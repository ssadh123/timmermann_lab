Item 5. OTHER EVENTS 

On July 12, 1994 Peoples First Corporation (Peoples First) filed a registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933 on Form S-4 to register securites to
be issued in connection with the acquisition of Libsab Bancorp, Inc. Previous-
ly, on March 10, 1994, subsequent to the most recent fiscal year, Peoples First
consummated a significant business combination accounted for by the pooling of
interest method. 

The acquisition of First Kentucky Bancorp, Inc. (First Kentucky), the parent
company of First Kentucky Federal Savings Bank (Bank), Central City, Kentucky,
into Peoples First Acquisition Corporation (Subsidiary), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Peoples First, became effective upon the filing of Articles of
Merger with the Kentucky Secretary of State on March 10, 1994. The surviving
Subsidiary acquired all the assets and assumed all the liabilities of First
Kentucky. At the time of the acquisition, the principal asset of First Kentucky
was the stock of the Bank. 

Peoples First exchanged 929,794 shares of its common stock for all the out-
standing shares of First Kentucky. Peoples First's common stock is traded on
the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System
(NASDAQ) National Market System (NMS) under the symbol PFKY. The last trading
price reported by NASDAQ on March 10, 1994, for PFKY was $27.00 per share.
Peoples First generally intends to continue to use the assets acquired for the
purpose of the general business conducted by a savings bank, their use
immediately before the acquisition. 

The following Supplemental Consolidated Financial Statements restate Peoples
First's most recent fiscal year comparative historical consolidated financial
statements to reflect the First Kentucky business combination.

Independent Auditors' Report 
_______________________________________________________________________________ 
The Board of Directors and Stockholders 
Peoples First Corporation 

We have audited the accompanying supplemental consolidated balance sheets of
Peoples First Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, 
and the related supplemental consolidated statements of income, changes in
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended December 31, 1993. These supplemental consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these supplemental consolidated
financial statements based upon our audits. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

The supplmental consolidated financial statements give retroactive effect to
the merger of Peoples First Corporation and subsidiaries and First Kentucky
Bancorp, Inc., on March 10, 1994, which has been accounted for as a pooling of
interest as describe in the notes to the supplemental consolidated financial
statements. Generally accepted accounting principles proscribe giving effect
to a consummated business combination accounted for by the pooling of interest
method in financial statements that do not included the date of consummation.
Theses financial statements do not extend through the date of consummation.
However, they will become the historical consolidated financial statements of
Peoples First Corporation and subsidiaries after financial statments covering
the date of consummation of the business combination are issued. 

In our opinion, the supplemental consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Peoples First Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, 
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
in the three-year period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles applicable after financial statements are issued
for a period which includes the date of consummation of the business
combination. 

As discussed in Note 1 to the supplemental consolidated financial statements,
the Company changed its method of accounting for investment securities to adopt
the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities, at December 31, 1993.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
Peoples First Corporation (Company) through its subsidiaries, Peoples First
National Bank and Trust Company, First Liberty Bank, First National Bank of
LaCenter, Salem Bank, Inc., Bank of Murray and First Kentucky Federal Savings
Bank, provides a full range of banking services to individual and corporate
customers in the western Kentucky and contiguous interstate area. The Company
and the subsidiary banks are subject to the regulations of various Federal and
state agencies and undergo periodic examination by regulators. 

The accounting policies and reporting practices of the Company are based upon
generally accepted accounting principles and conform to predominant practices
within the banking industry. In preparing financial statements, management is
required to make assumptions and estimates which affect the Company's reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and the results of operations. The more
significant policies are summarized below. 

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION 
The supplemental consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
parent company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. 

As further described below, the Company acquired First Kentucky Bancorp, Inc.
(First Kentucky) on March 10, 1994 under the pooling of interest method of
accounting. The Supplemental Consolidated Financial Statements present the
combined operations of the Company and First Kentucky. Since the preacquisition
year end for First Kentucky was September 30, for which audited financial
statements were prepared, the Supplemental Consolidated Financial Statements
for December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 consist of the Company for the twelve
months ended December 31, combined with First Kentucky for the twelve months
ended the previous September 30, for the respective years. 

RESTATEMENTS 
The Supplemental Consolidated Financial Statements give retroactive effect to
the First Kentucky transaction and, as a result, the Supplemental Consolidated
Statements of Income, Balance Sheets and Statements of Cash Flows are presented
as if the combining companies had been consolidated for all periods presented.
As required by generally accepted accounting principles, the Supplemental
Consolidated Statements will become the historical consolidated financial
statements upon issuance of the consolidated financial statements for the period
that includes the date of the transaction. The Supplemental Consolidated
Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity reflect the accounts of the
Company as if the appropriate amount of common stock issued in the First
Kentucky acquisition was outstanding effective June 18, 1991, the date First
Kentucky made its initial public offering of common stock. The Supplemental
Consolidated Statements, including the notes thereto, should be read in
conjunction with historical consolidated financial statements of the Company
included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

9

SECURITIES HELD FOR SALE AND INVESTMENT SECURITIES 
The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard No. 115 "Accounting for Cer-
tain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" (FAS 115) as of the end of 1993.
This new accounting policy expands the use of fair value accounting for secur-
ities for which there is not a positive intent and ability to hold to maturity.
At acquisition, FAS 115 requires that securities be classified into one of three
catergories: trading, held for sale or investment. Trading securities are
bought and held principally with the intention of selling them in the near term.
The Company has no trading securities. Investment securities are those securi-
ties for which the Company has the ability and intent to hold until maturity.
All other debt securities are classified as held for sale. There was no effect
of this change on 1993 net income. 

Securities held for sale are stated at fair value for December 31, 1993 and at
the lower of amortized cost or market for December 31, 1992. Fair value is
based on market prices quoted in financial publications or other independent
sources. Subsequent to adoption of FAS 115, net unrealized gains or losses are
excluded from earnings and reported, net of deferred income taxes, as a separate
component of stockholders' equity until realized. The adjusted cost of the
specific security held for sale that is sold is used to compute any gain or loss
upon sale. 

Investment securities are carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums
and accretion of discounts, which are recognized as adjustments to interest
income on the level-yield method. Gain or loss is recorded when realized on a
specific identity basis or when, in the opinion of management, an unrealized
loss is other than temporary in nature. Mortgage-backed securities represent a
significant portion of the investment security portfolio. Amortization of pre-
miums and accretion of discounts on mortgage-backed securities are analyzed in
relation to the corresponding prepayment rates, both historical and estimated,
using a method which approximates the level-yield method. 

Transfers of debt securities between categories are recorded at fair value at
the date of transfer. Unrealized gains or losses associated with transfers of
debt securities from the investment to the held for sale category are recorded
and maintained as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The unrealized
gains or losses included as a separate component of stockholders' equity for
debt securities transferred to the investment from the held for sale category
are maintained and amortized into earnings over the remaining life of the debt
securities as an adjustment to yield in a manner consistent with the amortiza-
tion or accretion of premiums or discounts on the associated securities. 

At the end of the third quarter of 1992, the Company evaluated the conditions
under which it might sell any of its debt securities. As a result, management
decided that certain types of debt securities might be sold in the future as
part of the Company's efforts to manage interest rate risk or in response to
changes in interest rates or other economic factors. Based upon this decision,
the Company classified these selected securities as held for sale. At December
31, 1992 (prior to adoption of FAS 115), debt securities classified as held for
sale were stated at the lower of amortized cost or market. 

10

LOANS RECEIVABLE 
Loans receivable held for investment are carried at cost, as the Company has the
ability and it is management's intention to hold them to maturity. Interest on
commercial and real estate mortgage loans is accrued if deemed collectible and
credited to income based upon the principal amount outstanding. Consumer
installment loans are generally made on a discount basis. The unearned discount
attributable to these loans is credited to income using a method which approxi-
mates the level yield method. Mortgage loans originated principally under
programs with the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) or the Federal
National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and held for sale, are carried at the lower
of cost or market value. 

The Company evaluates the collectibility of both contractual interest and
contractual principal of all receivables when assessing the need for a loss
accrual. When in the opinion of management the collection of interest on a loan
is unlikely or when either principal or interest is past due over 90 days, that
loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status and interest is not recognized
unless received in cash. When a loan is placed in nonaccrual status, accrued
interest for the current period is reversed and charged against earnings and
accrued interest from prior periods is charged against the allowance for loan
losses. A loan remains on nonaccrual status until the loan is current as to
payment of both principal and interest and/or the borrower demonstrates the
ability to pay and remain current. Interest payments received on nonaccrual
loans are applied to principal if there is any doubt as to the collectibility of
total principal, otherwise these payments are recorded as interest income. 

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 
The allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses charged to operations
and is maintained at an adequate level to absorb estimated credit losses
associated with the loan portfolio, including binding commitments to lend and
off-balance sheet credit instruments. At the end of each quarter, or more
frequently if warranted, management uses a systematic, documented approach in
determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses. 

Management's approach provides for general and specific allowances and is based
upon current economic conditions, past losses, collection experience, risk
characteristics of the loan portfolio, assessment of collateral values and such
other factors which in management's judgement deserve current recognition in
estimating potential loan losses. 

During May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
of a Loan" (FAS 114), which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 1994. FAS 114 requires that impaired loans be measured at the
present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective
interest rate, or at the loan's observable market price or the fair value of the
collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The Company is currently
evaluating when and how it will adopt FAS 114, as well as the possible financial
impact to the Company. 

11

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT 
Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. The provision for depreciation and amortization is computed using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Esti-
mated useful lives on buildings range from ten to thirty years and two to ten
years on equipment. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the term of the
related leases. Expenditures for major renewals and betterments of premises and
equipment are capitalized and those for maintenance and repairs are expensed as
incurred. 

OTHER REAL ESTATE 
Real estate acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure is in-
cluded in other assets, and is recorded at the lower of cost or the property's
fair value at the time of foreclosure less estimated disposal costs, if any.
The excess of cost over fair value of other real estate at the date of
acquisition is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent reductions
in carrying value to reflect current fair value and any other period costs are
charged to expense as incurred. In-substance foreclosed assets are accounted
for the same as foreclosed assets. 

INCOME TAXES 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" (FAS 109), was issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board in
February 1992, to be effective January 1, 1993 with earlier adoption encouraged.
The Company elected to adopt the new standard effective January 1, 1992 on a
prospective basis. FAS 109 provides for the recognition of a current tax
liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns
for the current year. A deferred tax liability or asset is recognized for the
estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carry-
forwards. The measurement of current and deferred tax liabilities and assets is
based on provisions of enacted tax laws. The measurement of deferred tax assets
is reduced, if necessary, by the amount of any tax benefits that, based upon
management's judgement of available evidence, are not expected to be realized. 

The deferred method of accounting for income taxes under APB Opinion 11, which
applied in 1991 and prior years, requires the recognition of deferred income
taxes for income and expense items that are reported in different years for
financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes using the tax rate
applicable for the year of the calculation. Under this method, deferred taxes
are not adjusted for subsequent changes in tax rates. 

The significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are
principally related to provisions for loan losses, amortization of premiums on
debt securities, depreciation and deferred compensation. 

NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE AND COMMON SHARE EQUIVALENT 
Net income per common share and common share equivalent is determined by divid-
ing net income by the weighted average number of common shares actually out-
standing and common stock equivalents pertaining to common stock options.
Earnings of First Kentucky are excluded from the net income per common share
calculation from October 1, 1990 through June 18, 1991, the date First

12

Kentucky made its Initial public offering of common stock. Also on June 18,
1991, First Kentucky Federal Savings bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of First
Kentucky, converted from a federally chartered mutual savings bank to a feder-
ally chartered stock savings bank. The average number of shares outstanding
including common stock equivalents for 1993, 1992 and 1991 were 7,337,528,
6,690,484 and 5,152,988, respectively. The computations of average shares
outstanding is based upon the new number of shares outstanding as a result of a
two-for-one stock split effected on January 4, 1994. Common stock equivalents
have no material dilutive effect. 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 
For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all cash and
due from banks to be cash equivalents. 

PURCHASE ACCOUNTING 
In accordance with the purchase method of accounting, the assets and liabilities
of purchased institutions are stated at estimated fair values at the date of
acquisition less accumulated amortization and depreciation. Intangible assets
related to purchased banks are amortized primarily on the straight-line method
over a fifteen year period. 

RECLASSIFICATIONS 
Certain amounts in the 1992 and 1991 consolidated financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the 1993 presentation. 

2. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS 
On May 4, 1992, the Company consummated the acquisition of an additional banking
organization, Bank of Murray. At acquisition, the bank had total assets of
approximately $235.3 million. The purchase price of approximately $42.4 million
consisted of 1,217,246 shares of the Company's common stock, $10.0 million of
subordinated two-year notes with an interest rate of 7.25% and $14.1 million in
cash. The transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. The results of operations of the acquired entity are included in
the supplemental consolidated financial statements subsequent to its acquisition
date and the excess of the cost over fair value of the net assets acquired,
$11.9 million, is being amortized over fifteen years on a straight-line basis.
The following table presents unaudited pro forma results of operations for the
years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991, assuming the purchase of Bank of Murray
had taken place on January 1, 1991:

This pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the actual results
of operations which would have occurred had the acquisition of Bank of Murray
been consummated as of January 1, 1991, nor is it necessarily indicative of
future operating results. 

On February 24, 1994, the Company entered into an affiliation agreement with
Libsab Bancorp, Inc. (Libsab), the bank holding company for Liberty Bank &
Trust Company of Mayfield, Kentucky. The agreement was subsequently amended on
April 15, 1994. The agreement, as amended, is subject to the approval of
Libsab shareholders and regulators. The Company will issue 1,078,000 shares
of the Company's stock for all the outstanding stock of Libsab. Liberty Bank
& Trust Company is a commercial bank with total assets of approximately $140.9
million at December 31, 1993 that is well established in western Kentucky with
its principal office in Mayfield, Kentucky. The business combination will be
accounted for as a pooling of interest. Consummation of the transaction is
expected to occur in the third quarter of 1994. 

3. CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS 
The Company's bank subsidiaries are required to maintain certain reserve
balances in accordance with Federal Reserve Board requirements. The reserve
balances maintained in accordance with such requirements as of December 31, 1993
and 1992 were $6,991,000 and $6,565,000, respectively.

Proceeds from sales of debt securities during 1993, 1992 and 1991 were
$2,536,445, $25,993,188 and $3,174,840, respectively. Gross gains of $40,577,
$593,181 and 28,356 were realized on those sales during 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively, and gross losses of $3,158 were realized on those sales during
1991. 

The amortized cost, estimated fair value and the weighted average yield of
securities held for sale and investment securities at December 31, 1993, by
contractual maturity, are shown below. Actual maturities will differ from the
depicted maturities because of the borrowers' right to call or prepay obliga-
tions with or without prepayment penalties. Contractual maturities are not
meaningful for mortgage-backed securities, which are particularly exposed to
prepayments in the current interest rate environment. Management evaluates, on
an on-going basis, the potential maturities for asset/liability purposes.
Yields on tax-exempt obligations have not been computed on a tax-equivalent
basis.

5. LOANS 
The Company's lending activities are concentrated primarily in the contiguous
interstate area of western Kentucky, southern Illinois, northwestern Tennessee
and southeastern Missouri. The loan portfolio is well diversified and consists
of business loans extending across many industry types, as well as loans to
individuals. As of December 31, 1993 and 1992, total loans to any group of
customers engaged in similar activities and having similar economic character-
istics, as defined by standard industrial classifications, did not exceed 10% 
of total loans.

The Company evaluates each customer's creditworthiness on a case by case basis.
The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company upon
extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the
counterparty. Collateral varies but may include accounts receivable, inventory,
property, plant and equipment, income producing commercial properties, real
estate mortgages and other property owned by the borrowers.

that was charged to operating expenses in 1993, 1992 and 1991 was $1,230,352,
$1,020,925 and $826,942 respectively. 

7. NOTES PAYABLE 
The Company issued unsecured, subordinated, short-term notes on May 4, 1992 in
connection with an acquisition of a subsidiary bank. The balance outstanding 
at December 31, 1993 and 1992 was $5,012,500 and $10,025,000, respectively.
Interest is payable quarterly at the annual rate of 7.25%. The remaining prin-
cipal amount is due and payable on May 4, 1994.

In May 1993, the Company obtained a $10,200,000 loan commitment from a regional
bank, which was used to retire short-term notes and other bank debt. The
balance outstanding at December 31, 1993 and 1992 was $4,576,792 and $2,076,792,
respectively, and is secured by the pledge of the outstanding stock of a
subsidiary bank (Bank of Murray). The note agreement contains various financial
covenants pertaining to levels of net worth and indebtedness. The Company was
in compliance with all such covenants at December 31, 1993. Interest is payable
quarterly at the lender's prime rate which can be adjusted daily (6.00% at
December 31, 1993 and December 31, 1992). The note provides for quarterly
principal payments of $261,604 and a final maturity in May 2004. 

One of the Company's subsidiaries is obligated to pay, through annual contri-
butions and dividends to their Employee Stock Ownership Plan, a note payable to
a regional financial institution. An original amount of $253,570 was borrowed
in May, 1991. The balance outstanding at December 31, 1993 and 1992 was
$158,481 and $202,856, respectively. The loan is secured by the pledge of
certain shares of the subsidiary stock. Interest is payable quarterly at the
lender's prime rate less 0.50% which can be adjusted daily (7.00% at December
31, 1993 and December 31, 1992). The note provides for annual principal
payments of $25,357 and a final maturity in May 2001. 

20

At December 31, 1993, the Company's lead bank had available up to $10.5 million
and the Company's savings bank subsidiary had available $4.6 million from the
Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Cincinnati which could be used for short-term
funding and other requirements. Certain single-family mortgage loans totaling
approximately $86.4 million and debt securities with a total carrying value of
approximately $14.4 were pledged to secure the line of credit. The arrangement
is subject to periodic review and cancellation by either party. There was no
outstanding indebtedness to the FHLB at December 31, 1993 and 1992. 

8. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK 
The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in
the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.
These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby
letters of credit. The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to
extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual
amount of those instruments. 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Standby
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee
the performance of a customer to a third party. These off-balance-sheet
financial instruments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination
clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some of the financial
instruments may expire without being drawn upon, the total amounts do not
necessarily represent future cash requirements. Commitments to extend credit
and standby letters of credit are subject to the same underwriting and collater-
alizing standards as on-balance-sheet items. 

Contractual commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit at
December 31, 1993 and 1992 are summarized as follows: 

Financial Instruments with 
Off-Balance-Sheet Risk 
December 31, 1993 1992
_______________________________________________________________________________
(in thousands) 

Contractual commitments to extend credit $79,229 $76,834
Standby letters of credit 3,231 2,847

9. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
The Company maintains two noncontributory Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOP)
and an employer matching 401(k) Plan which was made available to employees in
1991. The plans cover substantially all of the Company's employees. 

Employer contributions to the ESOPs are determined annually by the Company's
board of directors and were $195,357, $170,357 and $143,157 for the years ended
1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The ESOP's investments include 268,080 and
262,848 shares of the Company's common stock at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively. 

21

During November 1993, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
issued Statement of Position 93-6, "Employers' Accounting for Employee Stock
Ownership Plans" (SOP 93-6), which is effective for for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1993. SOP 93-6 replaces existing accounting guidance and
will significantly change the accounting for companies that maintain a leveraged
employee stock ownership plan (ESOP). Management has not yet evaluated the
potential impact of SOP 93-6 on the Company's financial condition or results of
operations. 

Under the 401(k) Plan, participants may voluntarily contribute a percentage of
their salary through payroll deductions. The Company is currently committed to
make contributions to the 401(k) Plan annually in an amount equal to 100% of the
first 3% contribution of each participant's base salary. For the years ended
December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, the Company's required matching contribution
amounted to $184,472, $148,665 and $113,249, respectively. Employees have four
investment options in which their contributions may be invested. 

In accordance with the terms of the acquisition, as described in Note 2., Bank
of Murray's defined benefit plan was terminated and their employees became eli-
gible to participate in the Company's ESOP and 401(k) plans during 1992. The
fair value of Bank of Murray's defined benefit plan assets, which were distri-
buted to plan participants in 1993, exceeded the actuarial present value of all
accrued benefits. The plan termination had no financial effect on the Company. 

Post retirement benefits other than pensions are not provided for the Company's
employees. Eligible retired employees may for a period of time maintain certain
health care benefits through policies of the Company at the employee's expense.
There was no cost for employee benefits for retired employees in 1993, 1992 and
1991. 

10. CAPITAL STOCK 
On December 15, 1993, the Company's Board of Directors announced a common stock
split to be effected on January 4, 1994 by the issuance of shares equal to 100%
of the previously outstanding shares. All shares outstanding and per share
amounts have been adjusted to reflect the two-for-one stock split. 

The Company has ten million authorized shares of no par, $0.7812 stated value
common stock. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, 820,322 shares and 854,234 shares,
respectively, of an original authorization of of 1,040,000 shares were reserved
for issuance under the Peoples First Corporation Share Owner Dividend Reinvest-
vestment and Stock Purchase Plan. In addition, at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
31,820 shares and 114,420 shares, respectively, of an original authorization of
600,000 shares were reserved for issuance under the Peoples First Corporation
1986 Stock Option Plan. 

DIVIDEND REINVESTMENT AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN 
The Plan provides for sale from shares reserved of unissued authorized shares of
the Company's common stock, at market value, to existing shareholders. All
shareholders may purchase stock with optional payments up to $500 but not less
than $100 per dividend payment cycle. Participating shareholders owning a
minimum of 500 common shares may reinvest all or part of cash dividends. At
December 31, 1993, a total of 219,678 shares have been issued pursuant to the
plan, of which 33,912 shares were issued during 1993. 
22

STOCK OPTION PLAN 
The Plan authorizes the granting to key employees of the Company incentive stock
options and nonqualified stock options to purchase common stock of the Company
at market value at the time the options are granted. Shares sold under the Plan
may be either unissued authorized shares or shares reacquired by the Company.
Options granted under the plan are exercisable, subject to vesting and other
requirements, at varying times from the first through the tenth year after the
grant date. Optionees may exercise their options with cash or with shares of
the Company's common stock. Of the 446,960 shares under option outstanding at
December 31, 1993, a total of 202,600 shares were currently exercisable,
compared to a total of 156,152 shares exercisable at December 31, 1992.

LIQUIDATION ACCOUNT 
In connection with the Company's savings bank subsidiary conversion from mutual
to stock form of ownership during 1991, the subsidiary established a liquidation
account in the amount of $6,750,000 for the purpose of granting to elibible
account holders a priority in the event of future liquidation. Only in such an
event, an elibible account holder who continues to maintain a savings account
will be entitled to receive a distribution from the liquidation account. The
total amount of the liquidation account decreases in an amount proportionately
corresponding to decreases in the savings account balances of the elibible
account holders. 

11. DIVIDEND LIMITATIONS 
Subsidiary bank dividends are the principal source of funds for payment of
dividends by the Company to its shareholders. National banks, federally
chartered savings banks and banks chartered by the State of Kentucky are
prohibited from paying dividends in excess of respective regulatory formulas,
which are generally based upon current year income as well as retained income
from the two preceding years in some circumstances unless prior Federal or
state regulatory approval is obtained. At December 31, 1993, approximately

23

$15.2 million in retained earnings of Peoples First Corporation's subsidiary
banks were available for the payment of dividends to the Company without
regulatory approval or without reducing the capital of the respective subsidiary
banks below present minimum regulatory standards. 

12. INCOME TAXES 
The current and deferred portions of income tax expense were as follows:

As discussed in Note 1, the Company adopted FAS 109 as of January 1, 1992,
changing the method of computing deferred taxes on a prospective basis. No
cumulative adjustment was required for the adoption of FAS 109. 

The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated Federal income tax return.
Deferred taxes result from temporary differences in the recognition of income
and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes. The sources of these
differences and the tax effect of each were as follows:

Enacted in September, 1993, the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 was a change
in the tax laws that raised the Company's top income tax rate. Adjustment to
the deferred tax asset required by this rate change was insignificant. Not all
temporary differences are accounted for through income tax expense on the state-
ments of income. The tax effects of temporary differences, that give rise to
significant elements of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are
as follows:

Deferred tax assets: 
Allowance for loan losses ($2,765) ($1,872)

Deferred tax assets have not been reduced by a valuation allowance since based
on the weight of available evidence, management believes it is more likely than
not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized.

Neither current or deferred taxes have been provided for approximately $2.6
million of income at December 31, 1993 and 1992 which represents allocations 
for bad debt deductions for tax purposes only. If the amounts that qualify 
for federal income tax purposes are later used for purposes other than bad debt
losses, including distributions in liquidation, such distributions will be
subject to federal income tax at the then current corporate rate.

15. DISCLOSURE ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
In December, 1991, Financial Accounting Standard (FAS) No. 107, "Disclosures
about Fair Value of Financial Instruments" was issued. This standard requires
that the Company disclose the fair value of financial instruments for both on
and off-balance sheet assets and liabilities for which it is practicable to
estimate that value. Where readily available, quoted market prices were util-
ized by the Company. If quoted market prices were not available, fair values
were based on estimates using present value and other valuation techniques.
These techniques were significantly affected by the assumptions used, including
the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. The calculated fair value
estimates, therefore, cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent
markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the
instrument. FAS 107 excludes certain financial instruments from its disclosure
requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented are not
intended to represent the underlying value of the Company. 

The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating the fair value for
financial instruments. 

CASH, DUE FROM BANKS, ACCRUED INTEREST RECEIVABLE, FEDERAL FUNDS SOLD, FEDERAL
FUNDS PURCHASED AND ACCRUED INTEREST PAYABLE 
The carrying amount reported for cash, due from banks, accrued interest receiv-
able, Federal funds sold, Federal funds purchased and accrued interest payable
approximates the fair value for those assets and liabilities. 

DEBT SECURITIES 
For both securities held for sale and investment, fair values are based on
quoted market prices or dealer quotes, if available. If a quoted market price
is not avialable, fair value is estimated using quoted prices for similar
securities. 

LOANS RECEIVABLE 
Loan balances were assigned fair values based on a discounted cash flow
analysis. The discount rate was based on the treasury yield curve, with rate
adjustments for credit risk, liquidity, sevicing costs and the prepayment
uncertainty. 

DEPOSIT LIABILITIES AND REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS 
The fair value for demand deposits, any interest bearing deposit with no fixed
maturity date or short-term repurchase agreement liabilities was considered to
be equal to the amount payable on demand or maturity date at the reporting date.
Time deposits and repurchase agreement liabilities other than short-term, were
assigned fair values based on a discounted cash flow analysis using discount
rates which approximate interest rates currently being offered on liabilities
with comparable maturities. 

NOTES PAYABLE 
Long-term debt was fair valued using discounted cash flow analysis with a
discount rate based on current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of
arrangements. 

30

UNRECOGNIZED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
No fair value of loan commitments is presented since the Company does not
generally collect fees for loan commitments. The fair value of guarantees and
letters of credit is based on equivalent fees that would be charged for similar
agreements and is less than $10,000 for 1993 and 1992. 

The book values and estimated fair values for financial instruments as of
December 31, 1993 and 1992 are reflected below.
