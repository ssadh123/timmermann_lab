Mr. Charles R. Ofner

August 9, 1994, Houston, Texas........Reading & Bates
Corporation (RB-NYSE) announced today that the Malaysian state
oil company, PETRONAS, has given approval for its Production
Sharing Contractor, Mobil Petroleum Malaysia Inc., to execute
a contract with Reading & Bates (M) Sdn. Berhad for the
drilling of one well plus an option well with the fourth-
generation semisubmersible JACK BATES. This drilling program,
in approximately 4000 feet of water, will directly follow the
unit's two-well commitment in Indonesia with INPEX Aceh, Ltd.
The additional commitment with Mobil results in an estimated
minimum utilization into the second quarter of 1995. Should
Mobil elect to drill its option well, the unit could be
deployed until late third quarter 1995. Reading & Bates
stated this latest commitment confirmed its belief that the
unit's initial contracts with BP Exploration Operating Company
Ltd. and INPEX Aceh, Ltd. would open a new and potentially
long-term market for fourth-generation semisubmersibles in the
Asia Pacific region. Several other operators in the region
continue to express interest in utilizing the unit for their
deep water programs upon completion of the Mobil well(s).

Reading & Bates is a New York Stock Exchange listed
company, providing offshore drilling services throughout the
world. Its wholly owned subsidiary, Reading & Bates
Development Co. provides technical, construction and project
management services to the upstream offshore oil and gas
industry worldwide.
