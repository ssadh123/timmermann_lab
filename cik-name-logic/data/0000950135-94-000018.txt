Item 5. Other Events

On January 25, 1994, Nashua Corporation issued the following press release:

NASHUA RECEIVES FINAL RULING ON GESTETNER CLAIMS

January 25, 1994 -- Nashua Corporation (NYSE:NSH) today announced that
it has received a final ruling from the arbitrator on claims
associated with the company's sale of its international office systems
business to Gestetner PLC. Nashua sold the business in 1990 for a
value of $202 million, which included $51 million in debt assumed by
Gestetner. Gestetner raised certain objections to the final
valuation, resulting in $18.2 million in claims submitted for
arbitration.

The arbitrator's findings will require Nashua to make a payment to
Gestetner of $1.3 million plus interest. Resolution of Gestetner's
claims will allow Nashua to recognize an after-tax gain from
discontinued operations from the sale of the office systems business
of $2.5 million, or $.40 per share, in the current quarter. Nashua
had been required to defer recognition of any gain or loss from the
sale, pending resolution of the final purchase price.

Nashua Corporation provides a diverse mix of products and services
which includes coated paper products, computer products, office
supplies and photofinishing services.
