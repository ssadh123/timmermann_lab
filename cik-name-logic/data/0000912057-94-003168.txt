ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

On August 27, 1994, MSG Holdings, L.P. ("Holdings"), a partnership between
a subsidiary of Rainbow Programming Holdings, Inc. ("Rainbow"), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Cablevision"), and a subsidiary
of ITT Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("ITT"), entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger with Viacom Inc., Paramount Communications Realty
Corporation, ITT and Rainbow Garden Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Rainbow, pursuant to which Holdings will acquire Madison Square Garden
Corporation ("MSG") in a transaction in which MSG will be merged with and into
Holdings. The purchase price payable by Holdings for MSG will be approximately
$1.075 billion, payable in cash.

MSG owns the world famous 20,000 seat Madison Square Garden Arena and the
adjoining 5,600 seat Paramount Theater; the National Hockey League ("NHL")
Stanley Cup Champion New York Rangers; the National Basketball Association
("NBA") Championship finalist New York Knicks; and the Madison Square Garden
Network, with five million subscribers for Knicks basketball, Rangers hockey,
Yankees baseball, boxing, college basketball and other programming.

The acquisition is subject to customary terms and conditions including the
expiration of Hart-Scott_Rodino waiting periods and approvals by the NHL and
the NBA of the indirect transfers of the sports franchises, and its expected to
close by December 31, 1994.

ITT, Rainbow and Cablevision are parties to an Agreement, made as of
August 15, 1994 (the "Bid Agreement"), pursuant to which it has been agreed
that Holdings will fund the purchase price of the acquisition through
(i) borrowings of approximately $355 million from a third party or, if such
funding is not obtainable by the closing of the acquisition, from ITT, (ii) an
equity contribution from Rainbow of $110 million, and (iii) an equity
contribution from ITT of the balance. Within 12 months following the MSG
closing, Rainbow may elect to acquire interests in Holdings from ITT sufficient
to equalize the equity ownership of ITT and Rainbow in Holdings. The
consideration for this equalization interest will be cash because, on
September 16, 1994, ITT elected not to exercise a provision which would have
permitted Rainbow to make payment in Rainbow common stock. In light of ITT's
September 16, 1994 election, Rainbow has the option during the 12 months
following the MSG closing to (i) acquire all or a portion of the equalization
interest for cash (including interest on such equalization interest at the
rate of 11 1/2% per year calculated from the MSG closing date), (ii) maintain
its investment at the initial level, or (iii) require ITT to purchase one-half
of Rainbow's initial interest in Holdings at the price paid by Rainbow plus an
adjustment for

2

<PAGE>

Rainbow's share of Holdings' operating income after interest expense following
the MSG closing. Rainbow has until one year from the time of the MSG closing to
make its election and has not finally decided which alternative it will pursue.

It is expected that initially Holdings will be managed on a 50/50 basis by
Rainbow and ITT. If, as discussed above, Rainbow does not equalize its
ownership interest in Holdings, its management role will be effectively
eliminated. Rainbow also has the right to voluntarily relinquish any power to
direct the management and policies of Holdings.

Rainbow has, pursuant to its New Ventures Agreement with National
Broadcasting Company, Inc. ("NBC"), offered NBC the opportunity to participate
in one-half of Rainbow's investment in Holdings. NBC has 45 days from the date
of the offer in which to decide whether it will participate.

AGREEMENT

This Agreement (the "Agreement") is made as of the 15th day of August,
1994 by and among ITT Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("I"), Cablevision
Systems Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("C"), and Rainbow Programming
Holdings, Inc., a New York corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of C ("R").
A new limited partnership ("LP") will be formed under the laws of Delaware by I
and R and I plans to submit a bid on behalf of LP to have LP acquire, through a
transaction described below, the business of Madison Square Garden Corporation,
a Delaware corporation ("M"), from Paramount Communications Realty Corporation,
a Delaware corporation ("P"). This Agreement definitively sets forth the mutual
understandings between I and C and R concerning the Bid (as defined below) that
LP will submit and their rights and obligations with respect thereto and with
respect to the continuing business if the Bid is accepted, including the rights
and obligations with respect to the ownership and governance of the general
partner ("GP") of LP and certain related obligations of C.

1. THE BID. The bid (the "Bid") to be submitted is attached hereto
as Annex 1. As indicated therein, the proposed acquisition will be structured
as a merger of LP and M, with LP as the surviving entity in the merger. LP will
be formed promptly after the date hereof pursuant to a customary form of
certificate of limited partnership.

<PAGE>

2

Neither I nor R has authority to alter the Bid, or to make any commitments or
agreements with respect thereto without the prior written consent of the other
party.

2. FUNDING LP. Of the total proposed purchase price in the Bid, (i) LP
will borrow $355 million from a third party or, if such financing is not
obtainable by the closing (the "Closing") of LP's acquisition of M, from I on
terms appropriate for such a borrowing, taking into account the expected
maturity of such borrowing, (ii) R will contribute $100 million, and (iii) I
will contribute the balance. LP will endeavor to obtain financing to repay any
borrowing from I made pursuant to the prior sentence. Any debt of LP, M or any
entity controlled by either LP or M or both of them will be nonrecourse to the
partners of LP (other than GP) and shall be expressly nonrecourse to the
shareholders of GP.

Each of R and I agrees to provide the funding of LP and GP described
herein on the date of the Closing (the "Closing Date"), subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein and as set forth in the letter with respect to the
Bid and the purchase agreement with P.

3. OWNERSHIP OF LP; SUBSEQUENT TRANSFERS. (a) The initial ownership
structure of LP shall be as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

<S> <C>
GP.................... 1% of capital, profit
and loss, as general partner

<PAGE>

3
Subsidiary of I
("I Sub")............. capital account equal to 99% of the
I Sub Investment (defined below),
49.5% of loss and pro rata share of
99% of profit based on the I
Sub Investment, as a limited
partner Subsidiary of R

("R Sub") ............ capital account equal to 99% of the
Initial R Sub Investment (defined
below), 49.5% of loss and pro
rata share of 99% of profit
based on the Initial R
Sub Investment, as
a limited partner

</TABLE>

Subject to Section 4 hereof, a limited partnership interest equal to one-half of
the difference between the capital account and profit share of I Sub and the
capital account and profit share of R Sub following the Closing is referred to
herein as the "Share Differential." For example, if (i) the I Sub Investment is
$600 million, I Sub's share of profit is 84.86%, and (ii) the Initial R Sub
Investment is $100 million, R Sub's share of profit is 14.14%, then (iii) the
Share Differential is $247.5 million of capital and 35.36% of profit.

(b) The capital contributions in respect of the initial ownership
structure of LP shall be as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

<S> <C>
GP.................. An amount equal to 1% of the
aggregate of the I Sub Investment
and the Initial R Sub Investment
(as those terms are defined below)

<PAGE>

4

I Sub............... 99% of a total amount (such total
amount, the "I Sub Investment")
equal to the purchase price of M
specified in the Bid plus all
transaction expenses (defined in
Section 9) (together, "M Cost"),
less debt incurred by LP to finance
a portion of the M Cost, less the
Initial R Sub Investment

R Sub............... 99% of a total amount that is $100
million (such total amount,
"Initial R Sub Investment")

</TABLE>

In addition, within twelve months following the Closing (the final date for
acquiring the Share Differential, the "Funding Date"), I shall cause I Sub to
sell to R Sub and R shall cause R Sub to purchase from I Sub (i) the Share
Differential with the result that the interests of R Sub and I Sub in capital,
profits and losses are equal and (ii) a number of shares of GP common stock so
that I and R own equal amounts thereof for a purchase price (the "Purchase
Price") equal to the sum of (x) one-half of the difference between the I Sub
Investment and the Initial R Sub Investment (the "Funding Balance") plus (y) a
return, at 11 1/2%, on the Funding Balance calculated for the actual number of
days in the period from the Closing through the date the related payment of the
Funding Balance is paid divided by 365. Interest shall accrue only on unpaid
portions of the Funding Balance.

<PAGE>

5

Subject to Section 15, if the entire Purchase Price has not been paid in
cash by the Funding Date, R shall pay the balance of the Purchase Price by
issuing to I on such date a number of newly issued shares of R common stock so
that I's aggregate economic percentage interest in R shall be as provided below:

Percent of R Funding Balance less any
to be owned = portion thereof paid in cash
----------------------------
by I $750 million plus [1/2 of
(I Sub Investment plus
Initial R Sub Investment)]

If (i) R is not obligated to purchase the Share Differential pursuant to
Section 15 otherwise than through a failure of a condition reasonably within the
control of R and (ii) for any reason R does not purchase the Share Differential
on or prior to the Funding Date, then the I Sub and R Sub respective shares of
losses shall be adjusted to be equal to the I Sub and R Sub respective shares of
profits. Unless R is obligated to purchase the Share Differential pursuant to
Section 15, if for any reason R does not purchase the Share Differential on or
prior to the Funding Date, R shall have the right to require I to purchase one-
half of R's initial interest in LP and GP for an amount equal to one-half of the
Initial R Sub Investment PLUS a portion of LP's operating income after interest
expense for the period from the Closing Date through the Funding Date equal to
one-half of R Sub's profit share percentage thereof. Thereafter R shall have no
further funding obligation hereunder.

<PAGE>

6

LP shall prohibit the admission of new partners without the consent of all
partners in LP (subject to Section 11 hereof). GP shall have complete control
over management of LP with the limited partners having narrow veto rights over
fundamental transactions.

4. CAPITALIZATION OF GP. GP shall have a single class of capital stock
(the "GP Common Stock") which will be owned by I and R at all times in the same
proportions that they participate in the profits of LP as limited partners. The
capital of GP shall comprise 1% of the capital of LP (plus amounts sufficient to
pay for the organization of GP), and GP shall contribute 1% of the capital of LP
as contemplated by Section 3 hereof. The purchase by R of the Share
Differential pursuant to Section 3 shall include the purchase by R of a number
of shares of GP Common Stock so that immediately thereafter I and R will each
own shares of GP Common Stock in the same proportions that they participate in
the profits of LP, and I shall transfer such number of shares of GP Common Stock
to R as is necessary to effect this ownership.

5. SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT OF GP. The shareholders of GP shall enter into
a shareholders agreement with respect to the ownership of GP Common Stock and
the governance of its affairs, including the voting of the shares of GP Common
Stock. Each share of GP Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote on all
matters submitted to the shareholders of GP. Subject to Section 14, until the
Funding Date and thereafter

<PAGE>

7

unless R shall not have purchased the Share Differential by the Funding Date as
provided in Section 3, I and R agree that they shall vote, or cause their
subsidiaries to vote, their shares of GP Common Stock at all times to cause (i)
the Board of Directors of GP (the "Board") to consist of six directors of whom
one-half shall be designated by I and one-half shall be designated by R and (ii)
Arthur Andersen & Co. to be designated as the independent accountants of GP and
LP. In the event R does not purchase the Share Differential by the Funding
Date, R shall have the rights set forth on Exhibit B.

6. CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. The Board, acting unanimously, shall elect
the Chief Executive Officer of GP who shall report to the Board. The Chief
Executive Officer shall have authority to manage the business and affairs of GP
and LP as delegated by the Board subject to receiving the prior approval of the
Board when such approval is required by law or this Agreement and in the case of
Extraordinary Decisions.

7. EXTRAORDINARY DECISIONS. Until the Funding Date and thereafter unless
R shall not have purchased the Share Differential by the Funding Date as
provided in Section 3, certain actions may only be taken with the prior approval
of 100% of GP's directors present at any meeting (which shall include at least
one director designated for election by I and one director designated for
election by R), including establishing policies and procedures as the Board
shall deem

<PAGE>

8

appropriate. These actions shall be the actions enumerated by the Board as
Extraordinary Decisions and shall initially include:

(i) GP incurring indebtedness or making any investment other than its
investment in LP.

(ii) LP incurring indebtedness other than indebtedness of $355 million
contemplated by Section 2 hereof and indebtedness to trade creditors
incurred in the ordinary course of its business.

(iii) GP issuing additional shares of capital stock.

(iv) LP issuing additional equity interests or admitting substitute or
additional partners (other than any admission as a result of an
Exempt Transfer pursuant to Section 11 hereof).

(v) GP requiring its shareholders or LP requiring its partners to provide
any additional capital by way of capital call, rights offering or
otherwise, except as required by GP's or LP's annual budget.

(vi) Changing GP's or LP's independent accountants.

(vii) Approving GP's or LP's annual budget or five year plan.

(viii) Selling, transferring, assigning or pledging all or substantially all
of the assets of GP or LP.

(ix) Entering into, amending or terminating any contract (including a
rights agreement) that is a material agreement of GP or LP.

(x) Committing to any material acquisition by GP or LP.

(xi) Entering into, amending or terminating an affiliate transaction
involving GP or LP.

(xii) Amending the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of GP or the
Agreement of Limited Partnership of LP.

(xiii) Payment by LP of any distribution to its partners.

In the event that any affiliate of any partner and one or more parties
unrelated to such partner are actual or potential competitors with respect to
the provision of any product or service to LP or any affiliate of any partner is
an actual or potential competitor with respect to the provision of any product
or service by LP, such partner will not exercise its voting rights with respect
to any Extraordinary Decision in a manner inconsistent with the best interests
of LP, or otherwise exercise any right it may have pursuant to this Agreement in
a manner inconsistent with the best interests of LP or withhold its consent to
any arrangement for the provision of such product or service so as to prevent LP
from entering into such arrangement with a party unrelated to such partner.

If LP is competing for any rights, property or services that would be of
material importance to LP with any entity that is an affiliate of I or R (I or R
in such case being an "Interested Partner"), the negotiation and approval of the
contract for such rights, property or services on behalf of LP shall be the
responsibility of the directors designated for election by the partner that is
not the Interested Partner and the Interested Partner shall not be entitled to
vote on the Extraordinary Decision with respect to such contract. The directors
taking such action with respect to such rights, property or services shall do so
only if they determine by resolution that they reasonably believe that

<PAGE>

10

the LP's revenues from such rights, property or services will at least equal the
costs thereof and related thereto.

8. BUDGET AND FIVE YEAR PLAN. The Chief Executive Officer shall submit to
the Board by September 30 of each year an annual budget for GP and LP for the
succeeding year and a revision to the GP and LP Five Year Plan to reflect the
proposed budget and to add an additional fifth year. If an item in the budget
is not approved, the budget for such item for such year shall be the budget for
such item for the prior year adjusted to reflect certain increases or decreases
(to include an adjustment for the terms of existing and approved agreements as
well as an inflation factor and other matters approved by the Board).

9. TRANSACTION EXPENSES. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"transaction expenses" shall include all governmental fees, sales, use and
transfer taxes and charges incurred by either party on behalf of GP or LP or by
GP or LP in connection with the preparation and submission of the Bid, the
organization of GP and LP, the Closing or the issuance of R shares to I and all
related fees and charges of counsel to LP and GP, but specifically does not
include the parties' internal expenses or fees and expenses of their respective
counsel. In the event the Closing does not occur, C and I shall each bear one-
half of the transaction expenses. Otherwise such expenses shall be paid by LP.

<PAGE>

11

10. GP CONSTITUENT DOCUMENTS. The Certificate of Incorporation and By-
laws of GP will contain the maximum indemnification and director exculpation
permitted by law.

11. RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER. Except with respect to Exempt Transfers or
as otherwise provided in this Section, there shall be no assignment, pledge or
other transfer of any interest in GP or LP without the consent of the Board as
an Extraordinary Decision (or in the case of an affiliate of I at a time when I
controls the Board, by a majority in number of limited partners that are not
affiliates of I). Exempt Transfers include transfers to an affiliate of the
shareholder/partner, transfers by R of up to a 50% interest in its ownership
interests to NBC pursuant to R's existing obligations with NBC and transfers by
R of limited partnership interests to one or more Regional Bell Operating
Companies and any of their affiliates, but any such affiliate, NBC or any
Regional Bell Operating Company may not be substituted as a partner without the
consent of the Board as an Extraordinary Decision (or in the case of an
affiliate of I at a time when I controls the Board, by a majority in number of
limited partners that are not affiliates of I). I shall cause its director
designees to consent to the admission of NBC and any Regional Bell Operating
Company as a partner and to the admission of R as a partner with respect to the
Share Differential. An Exempt Transfer by R to an affiliate of R shall be
limited to a transfer to an entity that at all times shall be a direct or

<PAGE>

12

indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of R. R shall be permitted to grant a security
interest in R Sub's interest in LP so long as the creditor is not entitled to
realize on the security without the consent of I. Any transferee must agree to
be bound by all agreements between parties with respect to GP and LP.

12. RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL. In addition to the consent required by
Section 11 hereof, there will be a right of first refusal with respect to any
transfer of an interest in GP or LP, other than an Exempt Transfer. The non-
transferring party must be given 45 days to purchase the interest proposed to be
transferred on specified terms. If the non-transferring party declines to
purchase the interest and has consented to the transfer thereof, the
transferring party will have 90 days in which to sell the interest on terms that
are not less favorable to the transferring party than such specified terms.

13. BUY-SELL ARRANGEMENTS. A buy-sell mechanism (the "Buy-Sell") may be
instituted by either party on six months notice at any time after the third
anniversary of the Closing Date. At the end of the notice period, the
initiating party must specify a value for its GP and LP interests. The
responding party will have six months after the end of the notice period in
which to elect to purchase the initiating party's interests or to sell its own
interests to the initiating party at that price. The closing of the Buy-Sell
will take place 90 days thereafter.

<PAGE>

13

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a state gaming authority formally
objects to I's continued participation in GP or LP because of a determination by
such authority that C, R or any of their subsidiaries, affiliates, directors or
officers is unsuitable and issues a final nonappealable order that I's continued
participation will cause I to lose a significant gaming license, then upon the
issuance of such order (or before any appeal if I's license would be otherwise
forfeited pending such appeal) I may initiate the Buy-Sell within 30 days
thereof by specifying a value for its GP and LP interests and R will have 30
days in which to elect to purchase I's interests or sell its own interest
payable at a price equal to that value. If R elects to purchase I's interests,
it may do so by paying the purchase price with a promissory note of R that is
secured by the purchased interest and provides for an 11 month maturity. If R
defaults under the note, I shall have the option for 30 days to purchase R's
interest at the Buy-Sell price.

14. SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS. If prior to the Closing (a) a state gaming
authority formally objects to I's participation in GP or LP with R because of a
determination by such authority that C, R or any of their subsidiaries,
affiliates, directors or officers is unsuitable to be affiliated with I, (b) R
is unable to amend its rights agreements with the New York Mets and the New York
Islanders to prevent the incurrence of any rights fee payment obligation by an
affiliate of R with respect to the revenues

<PAGE>

14

of LP or any of its subsidiaries, (c) there shall be outstanding any injunction,
order or judgment preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Bid, any pending lawsuit challenging such transactions, or any claim made
by any party challenging such transactions, if such lawsuit or claim is based
upon any alleged violation of any law, rule, regulation or order or upon the
failure to obtain any allegedly required consent or approval or to abide by any
contractual provision, and such lawsuit or claim would be material to either
party, or (d) the consummation of such transactions will create a material
adverse effect with respect to either party or M under any contract, franchise
or license, then in each case, the parties will take such reasonable actions as
are necessary to restructure the assets, properties and rights of M and the
respective rights of I and R therein to eliminate the effects of such situation,
while endeavoring to complete the transactions in a manner as close as possible
to that contemplated hereby.

In the event that, notwithstanding the efforts of the parties to
effect a restructuring to eliminate the effects of such situation as provided in
the prior paragraph, they are unable to do so by the date on which the Closing
must occur, LP shall proceed to consummate the Closing (and neither R nor I
shall withdraw from LP or GP or be relieved of any of their obligations
hereunder to provide funding and otherwise to participate in the transactions

<PAGE>

15

contemplated hereby); PROVIDED, THAT, nothing herein shall require LP to waive
any condition to LP's obligation to close pursuant to the definitive agreement
entered into pursuant to the Bid. If R in its sole discretion determines, as a
result of and in order to eliminate or mitigate the effects of any such
situation, to relinquish the power to direct or cause the direction of the
management and policies of LP or GP, R shall be permitted, in its sole
discretion, to reduce its rights hereunder, including, without limitation, its
rights under Sections 5, 6, 7 and 8 hereof; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that R shall, in
its sole discretion upon the elimination of the effects of such situation
(whether the effects of such situation have in fact been eliminated shall be in
the sole discretion and determination of R), be permitted to restore such rights
to the full extent provided in this Agreement; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, the
parties hereto will take such reasonable actions as are necessary to restructure
the assets, properties and rights of M and the respective rights of I and R
therein to eliminate the effects of any such situation while endeavoring to
achieve the intent of this Agreement in a manner as close as possible to that
contemplated hereby. In the event that R determines to relinquish the power to
direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of LP or GP, R and
I shall negotiate in good faith to afford R protections customarily afforded to
non-controlling

<PAGE>

16

limited partners, including the rights set forth on Exhibit B.

15. R DUE DILIGENCE; STOCK PURCHASE. I shall have the right for a
period (the "Review Period") ending on September 16, 1994 to conduct a due
diligence investigation of the business and affairs of R and R shall provide I
access at reasonable times to all information reasonably requested by I to
facilitate its investigation. All such information shall be subject to a
confidentiality agreement to be entered into between R and I.

During the Review Period the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
conclude a definitive purchase agreement for the purchase of R common stock,
which shall include the covenants to be applicable from signing such agreement
to the Funding Date and conditions to closing set forth on Exhibit A.

In the event I notifies C in writing by the end of the Review Period
that I is unwilling to accept R common stock as contemplated by Section 3
hereof, I shall not be required to accept R common stock in payment of the
Purchase Price. In the event the parties enter into such a purchase agreement,
R shall be obligated to purchase the Share Differential and to pay the Purchase
Price in cash or common stock of R as provided by Section 3. For purposes of
this Section 15, R shall not be obligated if any condition to closing under such
purchase agreement that was not reasonably within the control of R is not
satisfied.

<PAGE>

17

Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent C from spinning (or require C
to spin) off R to the shareholders of C or reclassifying the common stock of R
to include stock with disproportionate voting rights in the same manner as the
common stock of C (I.E., Class A Common Stock with one vote per share and Class
B Common Stock with ten votes per share). For purposes of this Agreement, a
spinoff shall include any distribution of all or part of the stock of R to the
shareholders of C, including reorganization transactions preparatory to such a
distribution. Any stock received by I from R pursuant to this Agreement prior
to a reclassification may at R's election be exchanged by I for Class A Common
Stock in any reclassification.

16. ASSIGNMENT. Except as contemplated by Section 11, neither this
Agreement nor any rights or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any party
without the prior written consent of the other parties.

17. CONSTRUCTION. This Agreement shall be governed, construed and
enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to
principles of conflicts of laws.

18. BENEFIT. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any person, firm or
corporation other than the parties hereto any remedy or claim under or by reason
of this Agreement or any term, covenant or condition

<PAGE>

18

hereof, all of which shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties
hereto.

19. PRESS RELEASES. All press releases or other public communication
of any sort relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and the method of
the release shall be subject, except as otherwise required by law, to the prior
approval of the other party hereto, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

20. HEADINGS. The headings of the sections of this Agreement are
inserted as a matter of convenience and for reference purposes only, are of no

6. No transfer of any of the common stock of R by C without the consent
of I, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
PROVIDED, THAT C shall be permitted to transfer common stock of R
without the consent of I if (i) such transfer is (a) pursuant to a

more Regional Bell Operating Companies or any affiliate thereof, or

I does not agree to purchase such common stock within 30 days of
notice of such sale, R may sell such common stock at such price or any
higher price to any unrelated third party for 120 days after the
expiration of the 30 day notice period (this item applies until the
earlier of three years from the Closing Date or two years from the

two) proportionate to its relative share of outstanding common stock
of R, except that after R common stock is traded in the public market,
R shall cause such designees of R (sufficient to permit the election

outstanding common stock of R of the class held by I) to be named in
management's slate of directors proposed for election by holders of

AMENDMENT AGREEMENT

This Amendment Agreement (this "Amendment Agreement") is made as of
September 12, 1994 by and among ITT Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("I"),
Cablevision Systems Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("C"), and
Rainbow Programming Holdings, Inc., a New York corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of C ("R") and amends the Agreement made as of August 15, 1994 by
and among I, C and R (the "Agreement"). Capitalized terms used herein which
are not defined herein shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the
Agreement.

1. Section 4 of the Agreement is amended in its entirety to read
as follows:

"4. Capitalization of GP. GP shall have two classes of capital
-------------------
stock: Class A Stock ("Class A Stock") and Class B Stock ("Class B
Stock" and, together with the Class A Stock, the "GP Common Stock"). The
Class A Stock and the Class B Stock shall each be entitled to one vote
per share on all matters on which the GP Common Stock is entitled to vote
and shall be identical in all respects, except that from and after the
Funding Date (i) unless the Purchase Price has been paid in full, the
Class B Stock shall cease to have any voting and dividend rights, except
as may be required by law, and payments in respect of the Class B Stock
on liquidation will be limited to the par value thereof, and (ii) shares
of Class B Stock shall become convertible into shares of Class A Stock
on the Funding Date to the extent provided in the next sentence. On the
Funding Date, the outstanding shares of Class B Stock shall become
convertible (at no cost) into shares of Class A Stock so that after such
conversion the percentage of the outstanding shares of Class A Stock
owned by R shall equal a fraction expressed as a percentage of which the
numerator is the sum of the Initial R Sub Investment and the portion of

<PAGE>

the Purchase Price paid by R on or prior to the Funding Date and the
denominator of which is the sum of the Initial R Sub Investment and the
I Sub Investment. At the Closing, I shall acquire 50 shares of Class A
Stock. At the Closing, R shall acquire a number of shares of Class A
Stock equal to 50 times a fraction, the numerator of which is the
Initial R Sub Investment and the denominator of which is the I Sub
Investment, and a number of shares of Class B Stock equal to 50 minus
the number of shares of Class A Stock issued to R at the Closing. The
capital of GP shall comprise 1% of the capital of LP (plus amounts
sufficient to pay for the organization of GP) (collectively, the
"GP Start-up Cost"), and GP shall contribute 1% of the capital of LP
as contemplated by Section 3 hereof. The purchase price per share for
the shares of Class A Stock issued at the Closing will be equal to the
GP Start-up Cost divided by the number of shares of Class A Stock
issued and the purchase price for the shares of Class B Stock issued
at the Closing shall be their par value, not to exceed $1 per share.
At any time following the Funding Date, if R has not paid the Purchase
Price in full, I shall have the right to require R to sell to I any
outstanding shares of Class B Stock that are not convertible into
shares of Class A Stock, at a purchase price equal to the par value
of those shares. To reflect the issuance to R of the Class B Stock for
nominal consideration, unless the parties agree in writing on an
alternative adjustment arrangement, the Purchase Price shall be paid
entirely in respect of the limited partnership interest included in
the Share Differential, with the effect that the amount of the
Purchase Price (exclusive of any interest included therein) will exceed
the capital contribution in respect of that limited partnership interest."

2. Section 5 of the Agreement is amended to delete the second sentence
thereof.

3. Except as provided in this Amendment Agreement, the Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect.

4. This Amendment Agreement and the Agreement as amended hereby shall
be governed, construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
state of New York without regard to principles of conflicts of laws.

5. This Amendment Agreement may be signed in several counterparts
with the same effect as if the signatures to each were to the same
document.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties hereto has caused this
Amendment Agreement to be duly executed in its name and on its behalf,
all as of the date first above written.

TIME" shall mean the date and time at which the Certificate of Merger is so

New York, New York, or at such other time or on such other date or at such other
place as the Seller and the Purchaser may mutually agree upon in writing (the
day on which the Closing takes place being the "CLOSING DATE").

(b) On the Closing Date the Certificate of Merger with respect to the
Merger shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware.

SECTION 2.04. CONVERSION OF SHARES; PAYMENT OF MERGER CONSIDERATION.
(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Viacom, the Seller, MSG, either Parent or the Purchaser, all of the
Shares shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive
an aggregate of $1,075,000,000 in immediately available funds (the "MERGER
CONSIDERATION"), subject to later adjustment as set forth in Section 2.05 of
this Agreement. At the Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller the
Merger Consideration by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated at least two Business Days prior to the Closing
Date by the Seller in a written notice to the Purchaser.

(b) Each general and limited partnership interest in the Purchaser
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
issued and outstanding and shall not be altered or changed by the Merger.

SECTION 2.05. POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENT. The Merger Consideration
shall be subject to adjustment after the Closing as specified in this Section
2.05:

(a) As promptly as practicable, but in any event within 60 calendar
days following the Closing Date, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a
balance sheet as of the Closing Date (the "POST-CLOSING BALANCE SHEET") prepared
in the same format as, and in accordance with the accounting principles and
procedures used in connection with the preparation of, the Reference Balance
Sheet, together with the calculation of the Final Net Worth.

(b) (i) Subject to clause (ii) of this Section 2.05(b), the Post-
Closing Balance Sheet delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser shall be deemed
to be and shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.

(ii) The Purchaser may dispute any amounts reflected on the Post-
Closing Balance Sheet to the extent that the amounts thereon were not arrived at
in accordance with the accounting principles and procedures used in connection
with the preparation of the Reference Balance Sheet; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
Purchaser shall have notified the Seller and the Seller's Accountants in writing
of each disputed item, specifying the amount thereof in dispute and setting
forth, in reasonable detail, the basis for such dispute, within 40 Business Days
after the Seller's delivery of the Post-Closing Balance Sheet to the Purchaser.
In the event of such a dispute, the Purchaser's Accountants and the Seller's
Accountants shall

<PAGE>

7

attempt to reconcile their differences, and any resolution by them as to any
disputed amounts shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto.
If any such resolution by the Seller's Accountants and the Purchaser's
Accountants leaves in dispute amounts which in the aggregate would not be
greater than $1,000,000, all such amounts remaining in dispute shall then be
deemed to have been resolved in favor of the Post-Closing Balance Sheet
delivered by the Seller to the Purchaser. If the Purchaser's Accountants and
the Seller's Accountants are unable to reach a resolution with such effect
within 20 Business Days after receipt by the Seller and the Seller's Accountants
of the Purchaser's written notice of dispute, the Purchaser's Accountants and
the Seller's Accountants shall submit the items remaining in dispute for
resolution to Deloitte & Touche (or, if such firm shall decline or is unable to
act or is not, at the time of such submission, independent of the Purchaser and
the Seller, to another independent accounting firm of international reputation
mutually acceptable to the Seller and the Purchaser) (either Deloitte & Touche
or such other accounting firm being referred to herein as the "INDEPENDENT
ACCOUNTING FIRM"), which shall, within 30 Business Days after such submission,
determine and report to the Seller and the Purchaser upon such remaining
disputed items, and such report shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
Purchaser and the Seller. The fees and disbursements of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be allocated between the Purchaser and the Seller in the
same proportion that the aggregate amount of such remaining disputed items so
submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by
each such party (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm) bears
to the total amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted.

(iii) In acting under this Agreement, the Seller's Accountants,
the Purchaser's Accountants and the Independent Accounting Firm shall be
entitled to the privileges and immunities of arbitrators.

(iv) No adjustment to the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
2.05(c) shall be made with respect to amounts disputed by the Purchaser pursuant
to this Section 2.05(b), unless the amount successfully disputed by the
Purchaser in the aggregate is greater than $1,000,000.

(c) The Post-Closing Balance Sheet shall be deemed final for the
purposes of this Section 2.05 upon the earliest of (A) the failure of the
Purchaser to notify the Seller of a dispute within 40 Business Days of the
Seller's delivery of the Post-Closing Balance Sheet to the Purchaser, (B) the
resolution of all disputes, pursuant to Section 2.05(b)(ii), by the Seller's and
the Purchaser's Accountants and (C) the resolution of all disputes, pursuant to
Section 2.05(b)(ii), by the Independent Accounting Firm. Subject to the
limitation set forth in Section 2.05(b)(iv), within three Business Days of the
Post-Closing Balance Sheet being deemed final, the Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted as follows:

(i) in the event that the Final Net Worth exceeds $414,411,000, then
the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted upward in an amount equal to
such excess and the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller by wire transfer in
immediately available funds,

<PAGE>

8

the amount of such excess, together with interest thereon from the Closing
Date to the date of payment at the rate of interest publicly announced from
time to time by Citibank as its "Base Rate"; or

(ii) in the event that the Final Net Worth is less than
$414,411,000, then the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted downward in
an amount equal to such shortfall and the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser
by wire transfer in immediately available funds, the amount of such
shortfall, together with interest thereon from the Closing Date to the date
of payment at the rate of interest publicly announced from time to time by
Citibank as its "Base Rate".

SECTION 2.06. ORGANIZATION. (a) PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT; CERTIFICATE
OF INCORPORATION. The partnership agreement and certificate of limited
partnership of the Purchaser as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the partnership agreement and certificate of limited partnership
of the Surviving Limited Partnership after the Effective Time unless and until
amended in accordance with its terms or, in the case of the certificate of
limited partnership, as provided by law. The certificate of incorporation of

jurisdictions in which such Subsidiaries are organized. Subject to Section 2.01

SECTION 5.09. INSURANCE. (a) Up to 12:01 a.m. on the day after the
Closing Date, Viacom and the Seller will maintain insurance generally comparable
to the insurance in place on the date of this Agreement. Effective 12:01 a.m.
on the day after the Closing Date, MSG and the Subsidiaries shall cease to be
insured by Viacom's or its affiliates' insurance policies, such that (i) with
respect to insurance coverage written on an "occurrence basis," Viacom and its
affiliates will have no liability for occurrences which take place on and after
12:01 a.m. on the day after the Closing Date and (ii) with respect to insurance
coverage written on a "claims made basis," Viacom and its affiliates will have
no liability for claims made after 12:01 a.m. on the day after the Closing Date.
The Purchaser agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Viacom and its affiliates in
respect to any liability, claim, damage or expense of any kind whatsoever, which
Viacom and its affiliates might incur arising out of or relating to any such
occurrences, losses or claims under this Section 5.09 other than any such
liability, claim, damage or expense due to Viacom's breach of this Section
5.09(a).

affiliates shall have any liability for self insured workers' compensation
claims with respect to MSG and the Subsidiaries in existence on the Closing Date
or arising from any event or circumstance taking place or existing prior to, on
or subsequent to the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall (and each Parent shall
cause the Purchaser to) take all steps necessary under any applicable law to
assume the liability for self insured workers' compensation pursuant to this
Section 5.09 and the Purchaser and each Parent, jointly and severally, shall
fully indemnify Viacom and its affiliates with respect to any liability, claim,
damage or expense of any kind whatsoever arising out of or relating to any

its affiliates in order to obtain the return or release of bonds or securities
or indemnifications given by Viacom or any of its affiliates to any state in
connection with workers' compensation self-insurance with respect to MSG and the
Subsidiaries; and, in order to effectuate such return or release, the Purchaser
shall (and each Parent shall cause the Purchaser to), to the extent required by
any state, post its own bonds, letters of credit, indemnifications or other
securities in substitution therefor.

SECTION 5.10. RIGHTS TO THE USE OF CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.
(a) Except as set forth in Section 5.10 of the Disclosure Schedule, the Seller,
Viacom and their respective affiliates agree that they will retain no rights of
ownership or use in or to the Intellectual Property Assets used primarily in the
Business, including, without limitation, any such rights in or to "Madison
Square Garden," "Madison Square" and "MSG" and any logos, symbols or other
devices associated primarily with Madison Square Garden; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the joint venture among American Telephone & Telegraph Company ("AT&T"),
Paramount Technology Group and PCI set forth in the Joint Development Agreement
dated as of February 1, 1994 shall be entitled to use the name "MSG"; PROVIDED,
FURTHER, that Viacom shall use all reasonable efforts to cause such joint
venture to cease using such name as promptly as reasonably practicable and that,
in any event, Viacom shall cause such name to cease to be used by the joint
venture not later than one year following the Closing Date.

(b) The Purchaser shall be entitled to continue to use the name
"Paramount Theatre" for a period of one year following the Closing, after which
time the Purchaser agrees that it shall no longer include the word "Paramount"
in the operation of the Business.

SECTION 5.11. POST-CLOSING SERVICES. (a) For a period of six months
after the Closing, at the Purchaser's option, Viacom and the Seller shall
provide, or cause PCI to provide, to the Purchaser such administrative
(including MIS), legal and management functions as were previously provided by
PCI and its affiliates to MSG and the Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, as
set forth in Section 5.11 (paragraphs 2, 3, 5 and 7 only) of the Disclosure
Schedule. The Purchaser hereby agrees to reimburse Viacom, the Seller and their
affiliates from time to time for the reasonable costs and expenses of providing
such administrative, legal and management functions.

agreements between (i) MSG and the Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and

venture agreement (the "CHRISTMAS SHOW AGREEMENT") between Antics, Inc.
("ANTICS") and the Purchaser relating to the production, promotion and
exploitation of a musical adaptation of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol"

that (i) Antics and the Purchaser shall form an equal joint venture for the
purpose of promoting and exploiting the Show on a worldwide basis, (ii) such
joint venture will own (or enjoy the benefits of) all right, title and interest

limitation, all lyrics, arrangements, musical scores, talent agreements,
artistic renderings, set and costume designs and choreography arrangements
relating to the Show, and (iii) Antics will have control over all creative
aspects of the production of the Show, provided that the Purchaser shall have
meaningful consultation rights in connection with such creative aspects of the
Show. Upon execution of the Christmas Show Agreement, the letter agreement
dated August 15, 1994 between Antics and MSG relating to the Show shall be
terminated and of no further force and effect.

SECTION 5.13. FURTHER ACTION. Each of the parties hereto shall
execute and deliver such documents and other papers and take such further

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

SECTION 6.01. EMPLOYEES. (a) For the one-year period commencing on
the Closing Date (the "CONTINUATION PERIOD"), the Purchaser agrees to provide
those persons employed by MSG or any Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Closing, including those employees on vacation, leave of absence, disability or
sick leave or layoff (whether or not such employees return to active employment
with the Purchaser) (the "TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEES"), other than those Transferred
Employees whose employment is governed by the terms of a collective bargaining
agreement, with employee benefits that in the aggregate are substantially
equivalent in value to, and no less favorable in value than, those provided to
such Transferred Employees immediately prior to the Closing and, with respect to
those Transferred Employees whose employment is governed by the terms of a
collective bargaining agreement, with such employee benefits as are required by
the terms of such collective bargaining agreement for the duration thereof.
During the Continuation Period,

<PAGE>

29

the Purchaser further agrees to continue to provide those former employees of
MSG or the Subsidiaries (the "TRANSFERRED FORMER EMPLOYEES"), other than those
Transferred Former Employees whose employment was governed by the terms of a
collective bargaining agreement, with employee benefits that in the aggregate
are substantially equivalent in value to, and not less favorable in value than,
the benefits to which such Transferred Former Employees were entitled under the
Plans immediately prior to the Closing and, with respect to those Transferred
Former Employees whose employment was governed by the terms of a collective
bargaining agreement, with such employee benefits as are required by the terms
of such applicable collective bargaining agreements for the duration thereof.
Nothing contained in this Agreement shall restrict or otherwise inhibit the
Purchaser's rights to terminate the employment of any Transferred Employees on
or after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the
Purchaser shall not have any obligation to provide any equity or equity-based
compensation or benefit to any Transferred Employee with respect to the equity
of the Purchaser, either Parent or MSG and no equity or equity-based
compensation or benefits provided to Transferred Employees immediately prior to
the Closing shall be taken into account for purposes of this Section 6.01(a) in
determining substantial equivalence.

(b) To the extent that service is relevant for purposes of
eligibility, vesting, benefit accrual, benefit contributions, benefit
calculations or allowances (including, without limitation, entitlements to
vacation and sick days) under any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement
established or maintained by the Purchaser, MSG or the Subsidiaries for the
benefit of Transferred Employees or Transferred Former Employees, such plan,
program or arrangement shall credit such employees or former employees for
service on or prior to the Closing with the Seller or any affiliate thereof;
PROVIDED that the Purchaser shall not be obligated to give credit for such
service to the extent it (i) would result in duplication of any benefits to
which a Transferred Employee or Transferred Former Employee is entitled to under
any comparable plans, programs or arrangements maintained by Viacom, the Seller
or PCI on or prior to the Closing Date or by the Purchaser after the Closing
Date, or (ii) was not service which was recognized for purposes of such
comparable plans, programs or arrangements. In addition, the Purchaser shall
waive any pre-existing conditions and recognize, for purposes of annual
deductible and out-of-pocket limits under its medical and dental plans, claims
of Transferred Employees and Transferred Former Employees incurred during the
year in which the Closing Date occurs and prior to the Closing Date.

SECTION 6.02. EMPLOYMENT RELATED MATTERS. The Purchaser agrees
(i) subject to the rights of the affected Transferred Employees regarding
representation to recognize the unions listed in Section 6.02 of the Disclosure
Schedule as the sole and exclusive collective bargaining agents for the affected
Transferred Employees and Transferred Former Employees and (ii) to be bound by,
and to comply in all respects with, the terms and conditions of the collective
bargaining agreements listed in Section 6.02 of the Disclosure Schedule
applicable to Transferred Employees and Transferred Former Employees.

SECTION 6.03. MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS. With respect to the Multiemployer
Plans listed in Section 3.14 of the Disclosure Schedule, the Purchaser agrees to
continue on and after the Closing Date to contribute to such plans for
substantially the same number of base units as MSG and the Subsidiaries were
obligated to contribute with respect to Transferred Employees and Transferred
Former Employees immediately prior to the Closing. The Purchaser further
covenants and agrees to take all actions that shall be necessary to avoid the
acquisition of MSG and the Subsidiaries, as contemplated by this Agreement, from
resulting in the assessment of withdrawal liability by such plans against Viacom
or the Seller.

SECTION 6.04. PARAMOUNT COMMUNICATIONS INC. RETIREMENT PLAN.
(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, Transferred Employees who were
immediately prior to the Closing Date participants (the "TRANSFERRED EMPLOYEE
PARTICIPANTS") in the Retirement Plan shall accrue no further benefits under the
Retirement Plan with respect to service after the Closing Date and Viacom and
the Seller shall have taken all such action prior to the Closing Date as may be
required to achieve this result. Effective as of the Closing Date, the
Purchaser shall establish a replacement defined benefit pension plan (the "NEW
DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN") intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code, and a related trust intended to be exempt form taxation
under Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, for the benefit of the
Transferred Employee Participants and the Transferred Former Employees who were
immediately prior to the Closing Date participants in the Retirement Plan (the
"TRANSFERRED FORMER EMPLOYEE PARTICIPANTS"), the terms of which plan and trust
shall be substantially identical to the terms of the Retirement Plan. The
Purchaser agrees to apply for, and to take all actions necessary to secure, as
soon as practicable after the Closing Date, a determination letter from the IRS
to the effect that the New Defined Benefit Plan is qualified under the
applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The Purchaser shall
recognize the service of the Transferred Employee Participants with the Seller
or any affiliate thereof prior to the Closing Date for all purposes under the
New Defined Benefit Plan.

(b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement,
Viacom shall cause its actuaries to determine effective as of the Closing Date
and in accordance with the requirements of ERISA and Section 414(l) of the
Internal Revenue Code, an amount of assets of the Retirement Plan (the "PLAN
ASSETS AMOUNT") equal to the present value of benefits accrued to the Closing
Date for all Transferred Employee Participants and Transferred Former Employee
Participants, determined as if the Transferred Employee Participants terminated
employment with MSG or any of the Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date and with
regard to only those benefits to which the Transferred Employee Participants and
Transferred Former Employee Participants would be eligible based on their age
and service as of the Closing Date. Such present value shall be determined
using (to the extent applicable) the assumptions underlying the determination of
disclosure values as of March 31, 1994 for purposes of compliance with Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 87 (FASB 87).

<PAGE>

31

(c) As soon as practicable after Viacom's actuaries determine the
Plan Assets Amount, Viacom and the Seller shall cause the transfer of an amount
equal to the Plan Assets Amount from the Retirement Plan to the New Defined
Benefit Plan, together with interest on such Plan Assets Amount at the rate
announced by Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York as its prime rate from
time to time from the Closing Date to the date of transfer.

(d) The Purchaser shall indemnify Viacom and the Seller and hold
Viacom and the Seller harmless from, any and all liability, claims, costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Viacom and the
Seller by reason of the Purchaser's failure to qualify the New Defined Benefit
Plan and related trust pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Internal
Revenue Code. Viacom and the Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser and the
Subsidiaries and hold the Purchaser and the Subsidiaries harmless from, any and
all liability, claims, costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Purchaser, MSG or the Subsidiaries
for all liabilities and obligations: (i) arising out of or relating to: (A)
Viacom's or the Seller's failure to cause assets to be transferred from the
Retirement Plan to the New Defined Benefit Plan in accordance with this Section
6.04, or (B) the Retirement Plan, other than liabilities for accrued benefits
properly transferred to the New Defined Benefit Plan, or (ii) with respect to
the New Defined Benefit Plan arising out of or relating to actions taken by
Viacom, the Seller or PCI prior to the Closing Date.

SECTION 6.05. PARAMOUNT COMMUNICATIONS INC. SAVINGS PLAN.
(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, the Transferred Employees and the
Transferred Former Employees who were immediately prior to the Closing Date
participants (the "SAVINGS PLAN PARTICIPANTS") in the Savings Plan, shall no
longer accrue benefits under the Savings Plan and Viacom and the Seller shall
have taken all such action prior to the Closing Date as may be required to
achieve this result. As of the Closing Date, Viacom and the Seller shall cause
each Transferred Employee to be 100% vested in his or her account balance. As
soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Viacom and the Seller shall cause
the transfer of an amount representing the entire account balances of the
Savings Plan Participants determined as of the plan valuation date coinciding
with or next following the Closing Date, adjusted for the actual return thereon
from such valuation date to the date of account balance transfer, to the
trustee, designated by the Purchaser, of the qualified trust established or
maintained by the Purchaser in accordance with the following sentence. After
the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall establish or provide the Savings Plan
Participants with a new savings plan (the "NEW SAVINGS PLAN") intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) and 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code, which
shall provide (i) for immediate eligibility for participation for each Savings
Plan Participant, (ii) each such Savings Plan Participant with an initial
account balance equal to the amount transferred to the New Savings Plan in
respect of such Savings Plan Participants interest in the Savings Plan and (iii)
vesting, eligibility, contribution levels, matching levels, investment
alternatives, participant loan and withdrawal provisions that are no less
favorable than those of the Savings Plan as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date, applied by aggregating service with the Seller, MSG, the
Subsidiaries and their

<PAGE>

32

affiliates prior to the Closing Date with service with the Purchaser and its
affiliates on and after the Closing Date. New Savings Plan shall accept the
transfer of outstanding loans from the Savings Plan and shall provide for the
continued administration of such transferred loans for the remainder of their
terms in accordance with the provisions thereof. Viacom, the Seller and the
Purchaser agree to cooperate fully with respect to the actions necessary to
effect the transactions contemplated in this Section 6.05(a), including, without
limitation, the provision of records and information as each may reasonably
request from the other.

(b) The Purchaser shall indemnify Viacom and the Seller and hold
Viacom and the Seller harmless from any and all liability, claims, costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Viacom and the
Seller by reason of the Purchaser's failure to qualify the New Savings Plan and
related trust pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.
Viacom and the Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser and the Subsidiaries and
hold the Purchaser and the Subsidiaries harmless from any and all liability,
claims, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
fees) incurred by the Purchaser or the Subsidiaries for all liabilities and
obligations: (i) arising out of or relating to: (A) Viacom's or the Seller's
failure to cause assets to be transferred from the Savings Plan to the New
Savings Plan in accordance with this Section 6.05, or (B) the Savings Plan,
other than liabilities for accrued benefits properly transferred to the New
Savings Plan, or (ii) with respect to the New Savings Plan arising out of or
relating to actions taken by Viacom, the Seller or PCI prior to the Closing
Date.

SECTION 6.06. MSG UNION SPONSORED PENSION PLANS. Effective as of the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall continue as the employer under the MSG Network
Retirement Plan for Bargaining Employees, the MSG Retirement Plan for Licensed
Ushers and Ticket Takers Local Union No. 176, the 401(k) Plan and the Trust for
Madison Square Garden Network Local 1212 and the Madison Square Garden 401(k)
Plan for Collective Bargaining Unit Employees.

SECTION 6.07. RETIREE MEDICAL AND RETIREE LIFE INSURANCE. The
Purchaser agrees to assume the liability of the Seller, if any, for the
provision of retiree medical and retiree life insurance liabilities for
Transferred Employees and Transferred Former Employees as of the Closing Date,
with respect to claims for covered services rendered after the Closing Date.

SECTION 6.08. INDEMNITY. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding (including, without limitation, Section 10.01) (except Section
6.04(d) and Section 6.05(b), the Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify Viacom and
the Seller against and hold Viacom and the Seller harmless from any and all
claims, losses, damages, expenses, obligations and liabilities (including costs
of collection, reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs of defense) arising
out of or otherwise in respect of (i) any failure of the Purchaser or the
Subsidiaries to comply with their obligations under any collective bargaining

ARTICLE VII

TAX MATTERS

SECTION 7.01. TAX INDEMNITIES. (a) From and after the Closing
Date, Viacom and the Seller agree to indemnify the Purchaser and the Parents
against liabilities for all Taxes (i) imposed on any person (other than MSG and
its Subsidiaries) for which MSG or any Subsidiary would be liable under Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1502-6 (or equivalent provision of state, local or foreign
law), as transferee, or as successor of any contract or otherwise, in each case
with respect to any taxable period that ends on or before the Closing Date or
includes the Closing Date and (ii) imposed on MSG or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to any taxable period or portion thereof that ends on or before the
Closing Date, in excess of the amount reflected as current Taxes payable in the
Post-Closing Balance Sheet.

(b) From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser and the Parents
shall indemnify Viacom, the Seller and their affiliates against liabilities for
all Taxes imposed on or with respect to the business of MSG or any of its
Subsidiaries that are not subject to indemnification pursuant to paragraph (a)
of this Section 7.01.

(c) Payment by the indemnitor of any amount due under this Section
7.01 shall be made within ten days following written notice by the indemnitee
that payment of such amounts to the appropriate tax authority is due, provided
that the indemnitor shall not be required to make any payment earlier than two
days before it is due to the appropriate tax authority. If Viacom or the Seller
receives an assessment or other notice of Tax due with respect to MSG or any of
its Subsidiaries for any period ending on or before the Closing Date for which
Viacom or the Seller is not responsible, in whole or in part, pursuant to
paragraph (a) of this Section 7.01 because all or a part of such Tax does not
exceed the amount reflected as current Taxes payable in the Post-Closing Balance
Sheet, and Viacom or the Seller pays such Tax, then the Purchaser or the Parents
shall pay to Viacom or the Seller, in accordance with the first sentence of this
Section 7.01(c), the amount of such Tax for which Viacom or the Seller is not
responsible. In the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance with the
provisions of Section 7.03, payment of the Tax to the appropriate tax

<PAGE>

34

authority will not be considered to be due earlier than the date a final
determination to such effect is made by the appropriate taxing authority or a
court.

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of any Tax that is
imposed on a periodic basis and is payable for a period that begins before the
Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date, the portion of such Taxes payable
for the period ending on the Closing Date shall be (i) in the case of any Tax
other than a Tax based upon or measured by income or sales, the amount of such
Tax for the entire period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of days in the entire period and (ii) in the case of any
Tax based upon or measured by income or sales, the amount which would be payable
if the taxable year ended on the Closing Date. Any credit shall be prorated
based upon the fraction employed in clause (i) of the next preceding sentence.
In the case of any Tax based upon or measured by capital (including net worth or
long-term debt) or intangibles, any amount thereof required to be allocated
under this Section 7.01(d) shall be computed by reference to the level of such
items on the Closing Date.

SECTION 7.02. REFUNDS AND TAX BENEFITS. (a) The Purchaser or the
Parents shall promptly pay to the Seller any refund or credit (including any
interest paid or credited with respect thereto) received by the Purchaser or a
partner of the Purchaser of Taxes (i) relating to taxable periods or portions
thereof ending on or before the Closing Date or (ii) attributable to an amount
paid by Viacom or the Seller under Section 7.01 of this Agreement. The
Purchaser or the Parents shall, if the Seller so requests and at the Seller's
expense, cause the relevant entity to file for and obtain any refund to which
the Seller is entitled under this Section 7.02. The Purchaser or the Parents
shall permit the Seller to control (at the Seller's expense) the prosecution of
any such refund claimed, and shall cause the relevant entity to authorize by
appropriate power of attorney such persons as the Seller shall designate to
represent such entity with respect to such refund claimed. In the event that
any refund or credit of Taxes for which a payment has been made pursuant to this
Section 7.02(a) is subsequently reduced or disallowed, Viacom and the Seller
shall indemnify and hold harmless the payor for any Tax liability, including
interest and penalties, assessed against such payor by reason of the reduction
or disallowance.

(b) Any amount otherwise payable by an indemnitor under Section 7.01
shall be reduced by any Tax benefit to the indemnitee or a partner of the
indemnitee for a period or portion thereof beginning after the Closing Date (a
"POST-CLOSING DATE TAX BENEFIT") that arose in connection with any underlying
adjustment resulting in the obligation of the indemnitee to pay Taxes for which
the indemnitor is responsible under Section 7.01 (such as a timing adjustment
resulting in a Tax deduction for the indemnitee for a period after the Closing
Date) or the payment of such Taxes. If a payment is made by the indemnitor in
accordance with Section 7.01, and if in a subsequent taxable year a Post-Closing
Date Tax Benefit is realized by the indemnitee or a partner of the indemnitee
(that was not previously taken into account pursuant to the preceding sentence
to reduce an amount otherwise payable by the indemnitor under Section 7.01), the
indemnitee shall pay to the

<PAGE>

35

indemnitor at the time of such realization the amount of such Post-Closing Date
Tax Benefit to the extent that the Post-Closing Date Tax Benefit would have
resulted in a reduction in the amount paid by the indemnitor under Section 7.01
if the Post-Closing Date Tax Benefit had been obtained in the year of such
payment. A Post-Closing Date Tax Benefit will be considered to be realized for
purposes of this Section 7.02 in the taxable period for which such reduction in
income, deduction or credit results in a reduction (and shall equal the amount
of such reduction) in the Taxes paid or results in an increase in any refund of
Taxes received (and shall equal the amount of such increase) for such period as
compared to the Taxes that would have been paid or the refund that would have
been received for such period in the absence of such reduction in income,
deduction or credit. Any reduction in income, deduction or credit not resulting
in a Tax benefit for the taxable period to which it relates shall be carried
forward to succeeding taxable years until used to the extent permitted by law.
In the event that a reduction in income, deduction or credit giving rise to a
payment to the indemnitor under this Section 7.02 is subsequently disallowed,
the tax liability resulting from such disallowance shall be treated for all
purposes as an indemnifiable liability under Section 7.01. The determination of
whether the Purchaser realizes a Post-Closing Date Tax Benefit will be made at
the partner level of the Purchaser.

SECTION 7.03. CONTESTS. (a) After the Closing, the Purchaser or
the Parents shall promptly notify Viacom and the Seller in writing of the
commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding or of any
demand or claim on the Purchaser or the Parents which, if determined adversely
to the taxpayer or after the lapse of time would be grounds for indemnification
under Section 7.01. Such notice shall contain factual information (to the
extent known to the Purchaser and the Parents) describing the asserted Tax
liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other
document received from any taxing authority in respect of any such asserted Tax
liability. If the Purchaser or the Parents fail to give Viacom and the Seller
prompt notice of an asserted Tax liability as required by this Section 7.03, and
the failure to give prompt notice results in a detriment to Viacom or the
Seller, then any amount which Viacom or the Seller is otherwise required to pay
the Purchaser and the Parents pursuant to Section 7.01 with respect to such
liability shall be reduced by the amount of such detriment.

(b) Viacom or the Seller may elect to direct, through counsel of its
own choosing and at its own expense, any audit, claim for refund and
administrative or judicial proceeding involving any asserted liability with
respect to which indemnity may be sought under Section 7.01 (any such audit,
claim for refund or proceeding relating to an asserted Tax liability is referred
to herein as a "CONTEST"). If Viacom or the Seller elects to direct a Contest,
it shall within 30 calendar days of receipt of the notice of asserted Tax
liability notify the Purchaser of its intent to do so, and the Purchaser and the
Parents shall cooperate, at the expense of Viacom or the Seller, in each phase
of such Contest. If Viacom or the Seller elects not to direct the Contest,
fails to notify the Purchaser of its election as herein provided or contests its
obligation to indemnify under Section 7.01, the Purchaser or the Parents may
pay, compromise or contest, at its own expense, such asserted liability.
However, in such case, the Purchaser or the Parents may not settle or compromise
any

<PAGE>

36

asserted liability over the objection of Viacom or the Seller; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that consent to settlement or compromise shall not be unreasonably
withheld. In any event, Viacom or the Seller may participate, at its own
expense, in the Contest. If Viacom or the Seller chooses to direct the Contest,
the Purchaser shall promptly empower (by power of attorney and such other
documentation as may be appropriate) such representatives of Viacom or the
Seller as it may designate to represent the Purchaser in the Contest insofar as
the Contest involves an asserted Tax liability for which Viacom or the Seller
would be liable under Section 7.01.

SECTION 7.04. PREPARATION OF TAX RETURNS. The Seller shall prepare
and file United States federal, state and local income and franchise tax returns
and schedules relating to MSG and its Subsidiaries for any Tax period ending on
or prior to the Closing Date and which are required to be filed after the
Closing Date. With respect to any returns for which the Seller has filing
responsibility pursuant to the preceding sentence, MSG and its Subsidiaries will
be included in the consolidated, combined or unitary tax returns of the Seller
or an affiliate of the Seller on a basis consistent with prior tax years unless
a different treatment is required by an intervening change in law. The parties
agree that if MSG or any of its Subsidiaries is permitted, but not required,
under applicable state or local income or franchise tax laws to treat the
Closing Date as the last day of a Tax period, they will treat the Tax period as
ending on the Closing Date. The Seller shall prepare and file all other returns
of Taxes for any period ending on or prior to the Closing Date to the extent the
Seller or an affiliate of the Seller (other than MSG or any of its Subsidiaries)
previously was responsible for the preparation and filing of such returns for
the immediately preceding Tax period. The Purchaser shall prepare and timely
file all returns of Taxes for which the Seller is not responsible pursuant to
this Section 7.04 and, where appropriate, prepare such returns in the name of
MSG or its Subsidiaries and submit such returns to the Seller for filing. The
Purchaser will deliver to the Seller a complete and accurate copy of each return
required to be filed by the Purchaser under this Section 7.04 for Tax periods
that include the Closing Date, and any amendment to such return, within 10 days
of the date such return is filed with the appropriate tax agency; PROVIDED,
