FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE December 21, 1994

CCB FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SECURITY CAPITAL
BANCORP REPORT PROGRESS IN TRANSACTION

Durham and Salisbury, North Carolina----CCB Financial
Corporation (CCBF:Nasdaq) and Security Capital Bancorp
(SCBC:Nasdaq), jointly announced that each have completed
its due diligence review of the other and have found no
reason not to continue progressing towards a combination of
their organizations. They also announced that all
regulatory applications had been filed and that a
registration statement pertaining to the combination and
special meetings of their shareholders was filed today with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Ernest C. Roessler, President and Chief Executive Officer of
CCB, and David B. Jordan, Vice Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of Security Capital, issued the following joint
statement:

"We are very pleased that we are on schedule with the
combination of our organizations. We are not surprised that
our reviews of one another have not produced any reason not
to move quickly and efficiently towards the ultimate goal of
providing an enhanced banking franchise in our existing
combined market areas. Our transition teams are working
closely together and are targeting the date by which we can
effectively combine both organizations. We are working
diligently so that there will be little disruption and a
smooth transition for all of the customers of Security
Capital."

"Although there has been a general decline in market prices
for financial institutions over the past several weeks, we
believe this to be a short-lived trend and have every
confidence that the inherent value of the combined
organization will be fully appreciated as we move forward.
Our goal remains to combine the organizations during the
second quarter of 1995."
