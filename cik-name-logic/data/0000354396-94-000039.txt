EXHIBIT I

October 28, 1994
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

USF&G CORPORATION CALLS 1,400,000 SHARES OF $5.00
SERIES C CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK

USF&G Corporation today announced its call for redemption

on November 28, 1994, of approximately 1.4 million shares or 50

percent of its outstanding $5.00 Series C Cumulative Convertible

Preferred Stock ("Series C", ticker:FGpC) at a redemption price of

$53.50 per share plus accrued dividends of $0.39. USF&G currently

has 2.8 million shares of the Series C outstanding. First Chicago

Trust Company of New York, transfer agent, has determined the

shares to be called by lot. All holders of record will be notified

of the number of Series C shares, if any, that have been called.

USF&G Corporation issued the Series C in June 1991 at the

outset of its significant financial and operational restructuring.

On September 28, 1994, the company completed the call of 950,000

shares of the original total of 3.8 million shares of the Series C,

resulting in a significant percentage of shares called converting to

common stock. Given the improvement in the company's overall

financial position and its return to profitability, USF&G has chosen

to continue to retire this high-coupon (10 percent) preferred stock.

This transaction, together with the previous call, is

expected to produce annual cash dividend savings of approximately

$10 million.

At the holder's option, the Series C shares called for

redemption are convertible into 4.158 shares of USF&G common stock

until the redemption date, November 28, 1994, at which time this

option will expire. As long as the common stock price is greater

than $12.96, holders of the Series C who convert will receive USF&G

common stock (plus cash for fractional shares) with market value

greater than the amount of cash that the holder would otherwise be

entitled to receive upon redemption. USF&G's common stock closed at

$14.00 per common share on the New York Stock Exchange on October

27, 1994.

Shares of the Series C not called for redemption are also

convertible into common stock at any time at the holder's option.

USF&G has, as with the previous transaction, entered into

an agreement with an unaffiliated financial institution to place

common stock to fund cash redemptions, if necessary. At September

30, 1994, there were approximately 89.3 million shares of common

stock outstanding. As a result of this transaction, USF&G will

issue approximately 5.8 million additional common shares either

through conversions into common stock or these arrangements.

Baltimore-based USF&G Corporation, with assets of $13.8

billion, is composed of property/casualty and life insurance

subsidiaries. The corporation's principal operating subsidiary is

the United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, one of the nation's

largest property/casualty insurers, founded in 1896.
