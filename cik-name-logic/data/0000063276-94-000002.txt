MATTEL PREPAYS $100 MILLION IN LONG-TERM DEBT
---------------------------------------------

LOS ANGELES, Feb. 1 -- Mattel, Inc. today said that the company will achieve
significant savings in interest expense, effective immediately, through the
prepayment of $100 million in high-cost debt assumed by Mattel in its merger
with Fisher-Price. The debt, which carried an interest rate of 10.69 percent,
was prepaid from a year-end cash position of approximately $500 million.
The prepayment will result in an extraordinary after-tax charge of
$14.7 million against 1993 fourth quarter earnings, representing a prepayment
penalty and unamortized costs associated with the debt.
