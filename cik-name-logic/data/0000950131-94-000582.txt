CUSIP NO. 423328 AZ 6 U.S. $100,000,000

UNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE
DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY, A NEW YORK CORPORATION ("DTC" OR THE "DEPOSITORY"), TO
THE ISSUER OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGE OR PAYMENT, AND
ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR IN SUCH OTHER
NAME AS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC (AND ANY PAYMENT IS
MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED
REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR
OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF,
CEDE & CO., HAS AN INTEREST HEREIN.

HELLER FINANCIAL, INC., a Delaware corporation (hereinafter called the
"Company", which term includes any successor corporation under the Indenture
referred to), for value received, hereby promises to pay to CEDE & CO., or
registered assigns, the sum of 100,000,000 Dollars on April 27, 1999, and to pay
interest (computed on the basis of the actual number of days in the applicable
Interest Period (as hereinafter defined) divided by 360) thereon from and
including April 27, 1994, or from and including the most recent Interest Payment
Date (as hereinafter defined) to which interest has been paid or duly provided
for, quarterly, to but excluding the immediately following January, April, July
or October 27, as the case may be (each an "Interest Period"), on the twenty-
seventh day of each January, April, July or October, commencing July 27, 1994
(each an "Interest Payment Date") to but excluding April 27, 1999 (the "Maturity
Date"), until the principal hereof is paid or has been duly provided for, or
upon earlier repayment, at the rate per annum, subject to adjustment on the
first day of any Interest Period (each an "Interest Reset Date"), determined by
using "LIBOR" (as hereinafter defined) plus the "Spread" (as hereinafter
defined) for the applicable Interest Period. The "Spread" for each Interest
Period shall be 25/100ths of 1%. LIBOR shall be determined on each "Interest
Determination Date" (as hereinafter defined) by the "Calculation Agent" (which
shall initially be the Company) who will (i) ascertain the offered rate for
three-month deposits in U.S. dollars in the London interbank market which
appears on the Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such
Interest Determination Date; (ii) if such rate does not appear on the Telerate
Page 3750, or the Telerate Page 3750 is unavailable, the Calculation Agent will
request the London offices of The Bank of Tokyo, Ltd., Bankers Trust Company,
Barclays Bank PLC and National Westminster Bank PLC or any duly appointed
substitute reference bank (the "Reference Banks") to
<PAGE>

provide the Calculation Agent with its offered quotation (expressed as a rate
per annum) for three-month deposits in U.S. dollars to leading banks in the
London interbank market at approximately 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the
Interest Determination Date; if at least two such quotations are provided, LIBOR
in respect of that Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of
such quotations; or (iii) if less than two of the Reference Banks provide the
Calculation Agent with such offered quotations, LIBOR in respect of that
Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by
three major banks in The City of New York (selected by the Calculation Agent) at
approximately 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on that Interest Determination
Date for three-month loans in U.S. dollars to leading European banks, in a
principal amount equal to an amount of not less than U.S. $1 million that is
representative for a single transaction in such market at such time; provided,
however, that if the banks selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are
not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, LIBOR will be LIBOR in effect on such
Interest Determination Date. All percentages resulting from any calculations
will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a
percentage point (with five one-millionths of a percentage point being rounded
upward). The term "London Business Day" means a day on which dealings in
deposits in United States dollars are transacted in the London interbank market.
The term "Interest Determination Date" means the second London Business Day
preceding the Interest Reset Date for each Interest Period. The interest so
payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date
will, as provided in said Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this
Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities, as defined in said Indenture) is
registered at the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day preceding an
Interest Payment Date. Such interest shall be payable by check mailed to the
person entitled thereto. Any such Interest not so punctually paid or duly
provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder on
each Interest Payment Date and may be paid to the Person in whose name this Note
(or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business
on a record date not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the
date fixed by the Trustee for payment of such defaulted interest and not less
than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee from the Company of notice of the
proposed payment, notice of which record date shall be given to Holders of Notes
not less than 10 days prior to such record date, or may be paid at any time in
any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities
exchange on which the Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be
required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture. The
interest payment at

-2-
<PAGE>

maturity will include interest accrued to but excluding the Maturity Date and
will be payable to the person to whom principal is payable. Payments of
principal and such interest will be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to a designated account maintained in the United States.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a holder of $10,000,000 or more in aggregate
principal amount of Notes in definitive form shall be entitled to receive
payments of interest by wire transfer of immediately available funds, provided
that payment instructions have been received by the Paying Agent in writing by
not less than 15 calendar days prior to the applicable Interest Payment Date.
If any Interest Payment Date would otherwise be a day that is not a Business
Day, payment of interest on such Interest Payment Date will be postponed to the
next day that is a Business Day.

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Note set forth
on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes have the
same effect as if set forth at this place.

Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been executed by or on
behalf of the Trustee referred to on the reverse hereof by manual signature,
this Note shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture, or be valid
or obligatory for any purpose.

HELLER FINANCIAL, INC.
FLOATING RATE NOTE
DUE APRIL 27, 1999

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes or other
evidences of indebtedness (hereinafter called the "Securities") of the Company,
all such Securities issued and to be issued under an Indenture for Senior
Securities (herein, together with all indentures supplemental thereto, called
the "Indenture") dated as of February 24, 1993, between the Company and The
First National Bank of Boston, as Trustee, to which Indenture and all indentures
supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a specification of the rights
and limitation of rights thereunder of the Holders of the Securities and of the
rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee and of the Company. As
provided in the Indenture, the Securities may be issued in one or more series,
which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may
mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be
subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different
sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different
covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the Indenture
provided or permitted. This Note is one of a series designated on the face
hereof (the "Notes").

The Notes are not redeemable by the Company prior to maturity and do not
provide for any sinking fund.

If any Event of Default with respect to the Notes, as defined in the
Indenture, shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be
declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the
Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities under the Indenture at
any time by the Company with the consent of the Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding, as defined
in the Indenture, of each series of Securities to be affected thereby. The
Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified
percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the
time Outstanding, as defined in the Indenture, on behalf of the Holders of all
the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain
provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and
their consequences
<PAGE>

with respect to such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain
provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and
their consequences with respect to such series. Any such consent or waiver by
the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and
upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer
herefor or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such
consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of
the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at
the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set
forth, this Note is transferable on the Securities Register of the Company, upon
surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of
the Company to be maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The
City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer in the form satisfactory to the Company and the Securities Registrar
duly executed by, the Holder herefor or his attorney duly authorized in writing,
and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the
same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or
transferees.

The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in
denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the
Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Notes are
exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of a like tenor and
of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering
the same.

This Security is exchangeable by the Company only if (x) the Depository
notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depository
for this global Note or if at any time the Depository ceases to be a clearing
agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (y) the
Company in its sole discretion determines that this Note shall be exchangeable
for certificated Notes in registered form or (z) an Event of Default, or an
event which with the passage of time or the giving of notice would become an
Event of Default, with respect to the Notes represented hereby has occurred and
is continuing, provided that the certificated Notes so issued by the Company in
exchange for this permanent global Note shall be in denominations of $1,000 and
any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof and be of like aggregate
principal amount and tenor as the portion of this permanent global Note to be

-2-
<PAGE>

exchanged, and provided further that, unless the Company agrees otherwise, Notes
of this series in certificated registered form will be issued in exchange for
this permanent global Note, or any portion hereof, only if such Notes in
certificated registered form were requested by written notice to the Trustee or
the Securities Registrar by or on behalf of a Person who is beneficial owner of
an interest hereof given through the Holder hereof. Except as provided above,
owners of beneficial interests in this permanent global Note will not be
entitled to receive physical delivery of Notes in certificated registered form
and will not be considered the Holders thereof for any purpose under the
Indenture.

No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the
Company in the Indenture of any indenture supplemental thereto or in this Note,
or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had
against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past,
present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either
directly or indirectly through the Company or any successor corporation, under
any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of
any assessment, penalty or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise,
all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof
and as a condition of and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof.

The Indenture with respect to any series will be discharged and
cancelled except for certain Sections thereof, subject to the terms of the
Indenture, upon the payment of all the Securities of such series or upon the
irrevocable deposit with the Trustee of cash or Government Obligations (or a
