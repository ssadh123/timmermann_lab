Dividends declared and paid with respect to shares of Common Stock and
any adjustments to surplus resulting from either (i) the repurchase or

appropriate by the Board of Directors shall be subtracted from or added
to the amounts available for the payment of dividends on Common Stock.
Subject to the foregoing, the declaration and payment of dividends on the

discretion of the Board of Directors of the Corporation.

(2) Dividends on Class E Common Stock.

Dividends on the Class E Common Stock may be declared and paid only to the

all times be solely in the discretion of the Board of Directors of the

(a)(2) and (a)(3), may, in its sole discretion, declare dividends payable
exclusively to the holders of Common Stock, exclusively to the holders of
Class E Common Stock, exclusively to the holders of Class H Common Stock
or to the holders of any two or more of such classes in equal or unequal
amounts, notwithstanding the respective amounts of surplus available for
dividends to each class, the respective voting and liquidation rights of
each class, the amount of prior dividends declared on each class or any
other factor.

(5) Available Separate Consolidated Net Income of EDS.

The "Available Separate Consolidated Net Income of EDS" shall mean the
separate net income of EDS on a consolidated basis, determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles without giving
effect to any adjustment which would result from accounting for the
acquisition of EDS by the Corporation using the purchase method,
calculated for each quarterly accounting period and multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the weighted average number of
shares of Class E Common Stock outstanding during such accounting period
and the denominator of which shall initially be 121,888,889; provided,
that such fraction shall in no event be greater than one. The denominator
of the foregoing fraction shall be adjusted from time to time as deemed
appropriate by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (i) to reflect
subdivisions (by stock split or otherwise) and combinations (by reverse
stock split or otherwise) of the Class E Common Stock and stock dividends
payable in shares of Class E Common Stock to holders of Class E Common
Stock, (ii) to reflect the fair market value of contributions of cash or
property by the Corporation to EDS or of cash or property of the
Corporation to, or for the benefit of, employees of EDS in connection
with employee benefit plans or arrangements of the Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries, (iii) to reflect the number of shares of capital stock
of the Corporation contributed to, or for the benefit of, employees of
EDS in connection with benefit plans or arrangements of the Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries, (iv) to reflect payments by EDS to the
Corporation of amounts applied to the repurchase by the Corporation of

approved such repurchase of shares by the Corporation or EDS and, in the
case of clause (iv) above, shall declare such payments by EDS to be
applied to such repurchase. Any changes in the numerator or denominator
of the foregoing fraction occurring after the end of a quarterly
accounting period shall not result in an adjustment to the Available

5

- 9 -
<PAGE>8

Separate Consolidated Net Income of EDS for such quarterly accounting
period or any prior period. For all purposes, determination of the
Available Separate Consolidated Net Income of EDS shall be in the sole

(6) Available Separate Consolidated Net Income of GMHE.

The "Available Separate Consolidated Net Income of GMHE" shall mean the
separate net income of GMHE on a consolidated basis, determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles without giving
effect to any adjustment which would result from accounting for the
acquisition of GMHE by the Corporation using the purchase method,
calculated for each quarterly accounting period and multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the weighted average number of
shares of Class H Common Stock outstanding during such accounting period
and the denominator of which shall initially be 200,000,000; provided,
that such fraction shall in no event be greater than one. The denominator
of the foregoing fraction shall be adjusted from time to time as deemed
appropriate by the Board of Directors of the Corporation (i) to reflect
subdivisions (by stock split or otherwise) and combinations (by reverse
stock split or otherwise) of the Class H Common Stock and stock dividends
payable in shares of Class H Common Stock to holders of Class H Common
Stock, (ii) to reflect the fair market value of contributions of cash or
property by the Corporation to GMHE or of cash or property of the
Corporation to, or for the benefit of, employees of GMHE in connection
with employee benefit plans or arrangements of the Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries, (iii) to reflect the number of shares of capital stock
of the Corporation contributed to, or for the benefit of, employees of
GMHE in connection with benefit plans or arrangements of the Corporation
or any of its subsidiaries, (iv) to reflect payments by GMHE to the
Corporation of amounts applied to the repurchase by the Corporation of
shares of Class H Common Stock, and (v) to reflect the number of shares
of Class H Common Stock repurchased by GMHE and no longer outstanding;
provided, that in the case of adjustments pursuant to clause (iv) or
clause (v) above, adjustments shall be made only to the extent that the
Board of Directors of the Corporation, in its sole discretion, shall have
approved such repurchase of shares by the Corporation or GMHE and, in the
case of clause (iv) above, shall declare such payments by GMHE to be
applied to such repurchase. Any changes in the numerator or denominator
of the foregoing fraction occurring after the end of a quarterly
accounting period shall not result in an adjustment to the Available
Separate Consolidated Net Income of GMHE for such quarterly accounting
period or any prior period. For all purposes, determination of the
Available Separate Consolidated Net Income of GMHE shall be in the sole
discretion of the Board of Directors of the Corporation and shall be
final and binding on all stockholders of the Corporation.

(2) After December 31, 1995, the Board of Directors of the Corporation,

FOURTH, the term "Class H Payout Ratio" shall mean, for any fiscal

stock, liquidation, dissolution, winding up or otherwise), effective
upon the consummation of such sale, transfer, assignment or other

the daily closing prices per share for such Common Stock or Class H
Common Stock for the fifteen (15) consecutive trading days ending one
(1) trading day prior to either (A) in the case of an exchange
pursuant to subparagraph (c)(2), the date the Exchange Notice (as
defined in subparagraph (c)12)) is mailed or (B) in the case of an
exchange pursuant to subparagraph (c)(6), the date of the public
announcement by the Corporation or one of its subsidiaries of the
first to occur of the following: that the Corporation or one of its
subsidiaries (1) has entered into an agreement in principle with
respect to such transaction or (2) has entered into a definitive
agreement with respect thereto. The closing price for each day shall
be the closing sales price as reported in The Wall Street Journal or,
if not reported therein, as reported in another newspaper of national
circulation chosen by the Board of Directors of the Corporation or, in
case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing
bid and asked prices regular way on the New York Stock Exchange, or if
the Common Stock or Class H Common Stock is not then listed or

10

<PAGE>13

admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, on the largest
principal national securities exchange on which such stock is then
listed or admitted to trading, or if not listed or admitted to trading
on any national securities exchange, then the last reported sale
prices for such shares in the over-the-counter market, as reported on
the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation
System, or, if such sale prices shall not be reported thereon, the
average of the closing bid and asked prices so reported, or, if such
bid and asked prices shall not be reported thereon, as the same shall
be reported by the National Quotation Bureau Incorporated, or, in all
other cases, an appraised market value furnished by any New York Stock
Exchange member firm selected from time to time by the Board of
Directors or the Finance Committee or Executive Committee of the
Corporation for that purpose.

(10) No fraction of a share of Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the exchange of shares of Class E Common Stock or
Class H Common Stock into Common Stock, but in lieu thereof, each
holder of Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock, as the case
may be, who would otherwise be entitled to a fractional interest of a
share of Common Stock shall, upon surrender of such holder's
certificate or certificates representing shares of Class E Common
Stock or Class H Common Stock, receive a cash payment (without
interest) (the "Fractional Payment") equal to the product resulting
from multiplying (A) the fraction of a share of Common Stock to which
such holder would otherwise have been entitled by (B) the Average
Market Price Per Share of the Common Stock on the Exchange Date (as
defined in subparagraph (c)(12)).

(11) No adjustments in respect of dividends shall be made upon the
exchange of any shares of Class E Common Stock or Class H Common
Stock; provided, however, that if the Exchange Date with respect to
Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock shall be subsequent to
the record date for the payment of a dividend or other distribution
thereon or with respect thereto but prior to the payment or
distribution thereof, the registered holders of such shares at the
close of business on such record date shall be entitled to receive the
dividend or other distribution payable on such shares on the date set
for payment of such dividend or other distribution notwithstanding the
exchange of such shares or the Corporation's default in payment of the
dividend or distribution due on such date.

(12) At such time or times as the Corporation exercises its right to
cause all of the shares of Class E Common Stock or Class H Common
Stock to be exchanged for Common Stock in accordance with subparagraph
(c)(1) or (c)(2) of this paragraph (c) of Division I of this Article
FOURTH and at such time as the Corporation causes the exchange of such
Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock for Common Stock as a
result of a sale, transfer, assignment or other disposition of the
type referred to in subparagraph (c)(5) or (c)(6) of this paragraph
(c), the Corporation shall give notice of such exchange to the holders
of Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock, as the case may be,

11

- 15 -
<PAGE>14

whose shares are to be exchanged, by mailing by first-class mail a
notice of such exchange (the "Exchange Notice"), in the case of an
exchange in accordance with subparagraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) not less
than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days prior to the date fixed
for such exchange (the "Exchange Date"), and in the case of an
exchange in accordance with subparagraph (c)(5) or (c)(6) as soon as
practicable before or after the Exchange Date, in either case to their
last addresses as they shall appear upon the Corporation's books.
Each such Exchange Notice shall specify the Exchange Date and the
Exchange Rate applicable to such exchange, and shall state that
issuance of certificates representing Common Stock to be received upon
exchange of shares of Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock, as
the case may be, shall be upon surrender of certificates representing
such shares of Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock.

(13) Before any holder of shares of Class E Common Stock or Class H
Common Stock shall be entitled to receive certificates representing
such shares of Common Stock, he shall surrender at such office as the
Corporation shall specify certificates for such shares of Class E
Common Stock or Class H Common Stock, as the case may be, duly
endorsed to the Corporation or in blank or accompanied by proper
instruments of transfer to the Corporation or in blank, unless the
Corporation shall waive such requirement. The Corporation will, as
soon as practicable after such surrender of certificates representing
such shares of Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock, issue and
deliver at the office of the transfer agent representing the Common
Stock to the person for whose account such shares of Class E Common
Stock or Class H Common Stock were so surrendered, or to his nominee
or nominees, certificates representing the number of whole shares of
Common Stock to which he shall be entitled as aforesaid, together with
the Fractional Payment, if any.

(14) From and after any applicable Exchange Date, all rights of a
holder of shares of Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock which
were exchanged for shares of Common Stock shall cease except for the
right, upon surrender of the certificates representing such shares of
Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock, as the case may be, to
receive certificates representing shares of Common Stock together with
a Fractional Payment, if any, as contemplated by subparagraphs
(c)(10) and (c)(13) of this paragraph (c) and rights to dividends as
provided in subparagraph (c)(11). No holder of a certificate which
immediately prior to the applicable Exchange Date represented shares
of Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock, as the case may be,
shall be entitled to receive any dividend or other distribution with
respect to shares of Common Stock until surrender of such holder's
certificate for a certificate or certificates representing shares of
Common Stock. Upon such surrender, there shall be paid to the holder
the amount of any dividends or other distributions (without interest)
which theretofore became payable with respect to a record date after
the Exchange Date, but which were not paid by reason of the foregoing,

12

- 16 -

<PAGE>15

with respect to the number of whole shares of Common Stock represented
by the certificate or certificates issued upon such surrender. From
and after an Exchange Date applicable to the Class E Common Stock or
the Class H Common Stock, the Corporation shall, however, be entitled
to treat the certificates for Class E Common Stock or Class H Common
Stock, as the case may be, which have not yet been surrendered for
exchange as evidencing the ownership of the number of whole shares of
Common Stock for which the shares of Class E Common Stock or Class H
Common Stock represented by such certificates shall have been
exchanged, notwithstanding the failure to surrender such certificates.

(15) If any certificate for shares of Common Stock is to be issued in a
name other than that in which the certificate representing shares of
Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such issuance that
the person requesting such issuance shall pay any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates for such
shares of Common Stock in a name other than that of the record holder
of the certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction
of the Corporation or its agent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
paragraph (c), the Corporation shall not be liable to a holder of
shares of Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock for any shares
of Common Stock or dividends or distributions thereon delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar law.

(16) At such time as any Exchange Notice is delivered with respect to
any shares of Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock, or at the
time of the Exchange Date, if earlier, the Corporation shall have
reserved and kept available, solely for the purpose of issuance upon
exchange of the outstanding shares of Class E Common Stock or Class H
Common Stock, as the case may be, such number of shares of Common
Stock as shall be issuable upon the exchange of the number of shares
of Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock specified or to be
specified in the applicable Exchange Notice, provided, that nothing
contained herein shall be construed to preclude the Corporation from
satisfying its obligations in respect of the exchange of the
outstanding shares of Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock, as
the case may be, by delivery of purchased shares of Common Stock which
are held in the treasury of the Corporation.

(d) Liquidation Rights.

In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, after there shall have
been paid or set apart for the holders of Preferred Stock and Preference
Stock the full preferential amounts to which they are entitled, the
holders of Common Stock, Class E Common Stock and Class H Common Stock
shall be entitled to receive the assets of the Corporation remaining for

13

- 17 -
<PAGE>16

distribution to its stockholders, on a per share basis in proportion to
the respective per share liquidation units of such classes. Subject to
adjustment pursuant to paragraph (e) hereof, each share of Common Stock,
Class E Common Stock and Class H Common Stock shall initially be entitled
to liquidation units of one (1.0), one-quarter (0.25), and one-half
(0.5), respectively.

(e) Subdivision or Combination.

(1) If after December 20, 1985, the Corporation shall in any manner
subdivide (by stock split or otherwise) or combine (by reverse stock
split or otherwise) the outstanding shares of the Common Stock, Class
E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock, or pay a stock dividend in
shares of any class to holders of that class, the per share voting
rights specified in paragraph (b) and the per share liquidation units
specified in paragraph (d) of Class E Common Stock and Class H Common
Stock relative to Common Stock shall be appropriately adjusted so as
to avoid any dilution in the aggregate voting or liquidation rights of
any class. Distribution by the Corporation of shares of any class of
its common stock as a dividend on any other class of its common stock
shall not require an adjustment pursuant to this paragraph (e)(1).

(2) If after December 20, 1985, the Corporation shall distribute shares
of Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock (such class being
hereinafter referred to as the "Distributed Class") as a dividend (the
"Dividend") on Common Stock (such class being hereinafter referred to
as the "Recipient Class"), then the per share liquidation rights of
the classes of common stock set forth in paragraph (d) above, as they
may have been previously adjusted, shall be adjusted so that:

(A) each holder of shares of any class other than the Recipient
Class shall be entitled to, with respect to such holder's interest
in each such class, the same percentage of the aggregate
liquidation units of all shares of the Corporation's common stock
immediately after the Dividend as such holder was entitled to, with
respect to such holder's interest in such class immediately prior
to the Dividend; and

(B) each holder of shares of the Recipient Class shall be entitled
to, with respect to such holder's interest in the Recipient Class
and all shares of the Distributed Class issued with respect to such
holder's shares of the Recipient Class, the same percentage of the
aggregate liquidation units of all shares of the Corporation's
common stock immediately after the Dividend as such holder was
entitled to with respect to such holder's interest in the Recipient
Class immediately prior to the Dividend; provided, that any
adjustment pursuant to this subparagraph (e)(2)(B) shall be made to
the liquidation units of the Recipient Class.

14

- 18 -
<PAGE>17

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph (e)(2)
or any other provision of this Article FOURTH, in the event of the
payment of the first Dividend of Class H Common Stock on the Common
Stock prior to September 16, 1986, no adjustment pursuant to this
subparagraph (e)(2) shall be made to the liquidation rights of the
Class H Common Stock, except to the extent that such Dividend shall
exceed 20,000,000 shares of Class H Common Stock, but an adjustment
shall be made to the liquidation rights of the Common Stock and the
Class E Common Stock so that: (i) the ratio of the aggregate
liquidation units of the Common Stock to the aggregate liquidation
units of the Class E Common Stock, determined immediately prior to
the Dividend, is the same as the ratio of the aggregate liquidation
units of the Common Stock plus the Class H Common Stock distributed
pursuant to the Dividend to the aggregate liquidation units of the
Class E Common Stock, determined immediately after the Dividend;
and (ii) the sum of the aggregate liquidation units of the Common
Stock plus the Class E Common Stock, computed immediately prior to
the Dividend, equals the sum of the aggregate liquidation units of
the Common Stock plus the Class E Common Stock, computed
immediately after the Dividend.

In no event will any adjustments be made pursuant to this
subparagraph (e)(2) if the adjustment called for herein would
reduce the liquidation units of any class of common stock to less
than zero.

(3) The determination of any adjustment required under this paragraph
(e) shall be made by the Corporation's Board of Directors; any such
determination shall be binding and conclusive upon all holders of
shares of all classes of the Corporation's common stock. Following any
such determination, the Secretary of the Corporation shall maintain a
record of any such adjustment.

DIVISION II:
PREFERRED STOCK.

A statement of the relative rights of the holders of Preferred Stock and a
statement of the limits of variation between each series of Preferred Stock as
to rate of dividends and price of redemption, a statement of the provisions
in these respects of the Preferred Stock-$5 Series and the Preferred Stock-
$3.75 Series, and a statement of the voting powers and the designations,
powers, privileges and rights, and the qualifications, limits or restrictions
thereof of the various series thereof, except so far as the Board of Directors
is expressly authorized to fix the same by resolution or resolutions for the
various series of the Preferred Stock, are as follows:

Preferred Stock of the Corporation may be issued in various series as may be
determined from time to time by the Board of Directors, each such series to

15

- 19 -
<PAGE>18

be distinctly designated, provided, however, that of the Preferred Stock
authorized or to be authorized, 1,875,366 shares shall be designated as
Preferred Stock-$5 Series and 1,000,000 shares shall be designated as
Preferred Stock-$3.75 Series. The Board of Directors may from time to time
authorize the issuance of Preferred Stock-$5 Series additional to the said
1,875,366 shares. All shares of any one series of Preferred Stock shall be
alike in every particular, and all series shall rank equally and be identical
in all respects except as to the dividend rate and the amount payable upon the
exercise of the right to redeem.

The dividend rate on the Preferred Stock-$5 Series shall be $5.00 per annum
and no more, the dividend rate on the Preferred Stock-$3.75 Series shall be
$3.75 per annum and no more, and the dividend on the Preferred Stock of each
series additional to the $5 Series and the $3.75 Series shall be such rate as
may be fixed by the Board of Directors in the resolution or resolutions
providing for the issuance of the Preferred Stock of such series, and as shall
be stated on the face or back of the certificates of stock therefor.

The amount payable upon the exercise of the right to redeem the Preferred
Stock-$5 Series shall be $120.00 a share and accrued dividends, the amount
payable upon the exercise of the right to redeem the Preferred Stock-$3.75
Series shall be $100.00 a share and accrued dividends, and the amount payable
on the exercise of the right to redeem Preferred Stock of each series
additional to the $5 Series and the $3.75 Series shall be an amount as may be
fixed by the Board of Directors in the resolution or resolutions providing for
the issuance of the Preferred Stock of such series, and as shall be stated on
the face or back of the certificates of stock therefor.

All other provisions herein set forth in respect of the Preferred Stock of the
Corporation shall apply to all the Preferred Stock of the Corporation,
irrespective of any variations between the Preferred Stock of the different
series.

The holders of the Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive cumulative
dividends, when and as declared by the Board of Directors, at the rates fixed
for the respective series in the Certificate of Incorporation or in the
resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors providing for the issuance
of the respective series, and no more, payable quarterly on the dates to be
fixed by the By-Laws. The periods between such dates commencing on such dates
are herein designated as "dividend periods." Dividends on all shares of any
one series shall commence to accrue and be cumulative from the first day of
the current dividend period within which shares of such series are first
issued, but in the event of the issue of additional shares of such series
subsequent to the date of the first issue of said shares of such series, all
dividends paid on the shares of such series prior to the issue of such
additional shares and all dividends declared payable to holders of record of
shares of such series of a date prior to such issue shall be deemed to have
been paid in respect of the additional shares so issued. Such dividends

16

- 20 -
<PAGE>19

on the Preferred Stock shall be in preference and priority to any payment on
any other class of stock of the Corporation.

The dividends on the Preferred Stock shall be cumulative and shall be payable
before any dividend on the Common Stock, Class E Common Stock or Class H
Common Stock or any series of the Preference Stock shall be paid or set apart
so that if in any year dividends at the rates determined for the respective
series of the Preferred Stock shall not be paid thereon, the deficiency shall
be payable before any dividend shall be paid upon or set apart for the Common
Stock, Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock or any series of the
Preference Stock. Dividends shall not be declared and paid on the shares of
Preferred Stock of any one series for any dividend period unless dividends
have been or are contemporaneously paid or declared and set apart for payment
thereof on the shares of Preferred Stock of all series, for all the dividend
periods terminating on the same or an earlier date.

Whenever all cumulative dividends on the Preferred Stock outstanding shall
have been paid and a sum sufficient for the payment of the next ensuing
quarterly dividend on the Preferred Stock outstanding shall have been set
aside from the surplus or net profits, the Board of Directors may declare
dividends on the Common Stock, Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock or
any series of the Preference Stock, payable then or thereafter, out of any
remaining surplus or net profits, and no holders of any shares of any series
of Preferred Stock, as such, shall be entitled to share therein; provided,
however, that subsequent to the issue of any Preferred Stock herein provided
to be issued, additional to 1,875,366 shares of Preferred Stock-$5 Series, no
dividends other than dividends payable in Common Stock, Class E Common Stock
or Class H Common Stock shall be paid on the Common Stock, Class E Common
Stock or Class H Common Stock or any series of the Preference Stock unless the
aggregate of the Common Stock, Class E Common Stock and Class H Common Stock
capital and surplus shall exceed $335,700,600 by an amount not less than
$100.00 in respect of each such additional share of Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding; and provided further, that no cash dividends shall be paid on the
Common Stock, Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock or any series of
the Preference Stock after the issue of Preferred Stock so long as the net
quick assets in excess of current liabilities of the Corporation are less than
$75.00 in respect of each share of outstanding Preferred Stock. Net quick
assets referred to above shall be made up of cash, drafts, notes and accounts
receivable, inventories, and marketable securities, and the aforesaid current
liabilities shall consist of obligations maturing within one year, as set
forth in the books of the Corporation.

At the option of the Board of Directors, the Preferred Stock shall be subject
to redemption at the amounts fixed for the respective series in the
Certificate of Incorporation or in the resolution or resolutions of the Board
of Directors providing for the issuance of the respective series, together, in
the case of each class or series, with accrued dividends on the shares to be
redeemed, on any dividend paying date in such manner as the Board of Directors
may determine.

17

- 21 -
<PAGE>20

The holders of the Preferred Stock shall not have any voting power whatsoever,
except upon the question of selling, conveying, transferring or otherwise
disposing of the property and assets of the Corporation as an entirety and
except as otherwise required by law; provided, however:

In the event that the Corporation shall fail to pay any dividend on the shares
of any series of the Preferred Stock when it regularly becomes due, and
failure to make such payment shall continue for a period of six months, the
holders of the shares of Preferred Stock as a class, during the continuance
of such non-payment and until the Corporation shall have paid all accrued
dividends on the shares of all series of Preferred Stock, shall have the
exclusive right to elect one quarter of the total number of directors of the
Corporation.

Unless the holders of at least three-fourths of the shares of Preferred Stock,
as a class, then outstanding shall consent thereto either in writing or at a
special meeting, the Corporation shall not mortgage or pledge or place any
specific lien upon the whole or any part of the property of the Corporation,
but this prohibition shall not be construed to apply to the execution of any
purchase money mortgage or any other purchase money lien, nor to the
assumption of any mortgage or other lien upon property purchased, nor to the
renewal or renewals thereof or to substitutions therefor, in whole or in part,
nor shall it prevent the Corporation at any time from pledging securities
belonging to it for the purpose of securing cash to be used in the ordinary
course of its business, provided such cash advances are procured upon its
obligations which shall mature not more than three years from the date
thereof; nor shall any amendment to any provision contained in this
Certificate of Incorporation in reference to the rights and security of the
holders of the Preferred Stock be authorized, unless such amendment is
consented to by the holders of three-fourths of the shares of Preferred Stock
then issued and outstanding.

The Board of Directors is authorized, subject to limitations prescribed by law
and the provisions of this Article FOURTH, to provide for the issuance of
Preference Stock from time to time in one or more series of any number of
shares, with a distinctive serial designation for each series, provided that
the aggregate number of shares issued and not cancelled of any and all such
series shall not exceed the total number of shares of Preference Stock
authorized by this Article FOURTH, all as shall hereafter be stated and
expressed in the resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such
Preference Stock from time to time adopted by the Board of Directors. Subject
to said limitations, and provided that each series of Preference Stock shall
rank junior to the Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends
and distributions in liquidation, each series of Preference Stock (a) may have
such voting powers, full or limited, or may be without voting powers; (b) may
be subject to redemption at such time or times and at such prices; (c) may be
entitled to receive dividends (which may be cumulative or noncumulative) at
such rate or rates, on such conditions, and at such times, and payable in
preference to, or in such relation to, the dividends payable on any other
class or classes or series of stock; (d) may have such rights upon the
dissolution of, or upon any distribution of the assets of, the Corporation;

prices or at such rates of exchange, and with such adjustments; (f) may be
entitled to the benefit of a sinking fund to be applied to the purchase or
redemption of shares of such series in such amount or amounts; (g) may be
entitled to the benefit of conditions and restrictions upon the creation of
indebtedness of the Corporation or any subsidiary, upon the issue of any
additional stock (including additional shares of such series or of any other
series) and upon the payment of dividends or the making of other distributions
on, and the purchase, redemption or other acquisition by the Corporation or
any subsidiary of any outstanding stock of the Corporation; and (h) may have
such other relative, participating, optional or other special rights,
qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof; all as shall be stated in
said resolution or resolutions providing for the issue of such series of
Preference Stock.

Shares of any series of Preference Stock which have been redeemed (whether
through the operation of a sinking fund or otherwise) or which, if convertible
or exchangeable, have been converted into or exchanged for shares of stock of
any other class or classes shall have the status of authorized and unissued
shares of Preference Stock of the same series and may be reissued as a part of
the series of which they were originally a part or may be reclassified and
reissued as part of a new series of Preference Stock to be created by
resolution or resolutions of the Board of Directors or as part of any other
series of Preference Stock, all subject to the conditions or restrictions on
issuance set forth in the resolution or resolutions adopted by the Board of
Directors providing for the issue of any series of Preference Stock.

DIVISION IV:
MISCELLANEOUS.

From time to time, the Preferred Stock, the Preference Stock, the Common
Stock, the Class E Common Stock and the Class H Common Stock may be increased
or decreased according to law, and may be issued in such amounts and
proportions as shall be determined by the Board of Directors, and as may be
permitted by law, except that no shares of Preferred Stock in addition to
1,875,366 shares of the Preferred Stock-$5 Series shall be issued unless the
sum total of the Common Stock, Class E Common Stock and Class H Common Stock
capital and surplus shall exceed $335,700,600 by an amount at least equal to
$100.00 in respect of each additional share of the Preferred Stock to be
issued.

In the event of any liquidation or dissolution or winding up, whether
voluntary or otherwise, of the Corporation, the holders of the Preferred Stock
shall be entitled to be paid each series in full, as aforesaid, out of the
assets whether capital or surplus, $100.00 a share, and, in every case, the
unpaid dividends accrued on such shares, whether or not earned or declared,
before any distribution of the assets to be distributed shall be made to the
holders of Common Stock, Class E Common Stock or Class H Common Stock or any

20

- 24 -
<PAGE>23

series of the Preference Stock; but the holders of such shares shall be
entitled to no further participation in such distribution. If the assets
distributable on such liquidation, dissolution or winding up shall be
insufficient to permit the payment to the holders of the Preferred Stock of
the full amount of $100.00 a share and accrued dividends as aforesaid, the
said assets shall be distributed pro rata among the holders of the respective
series of the Preferred Stock. After all payments are made as aforesaid, any
required payments shall be made with respect to the Preference Stock, if any,
outstanding, and the remaining assets and funds shall be divided among and
paid to the holders of Common Stock, Class E Common Stock and Class H Common
Stock pro rata in proportion to the respective per share liquidation units of
such classes. The merger or consolidation of the Corporation into or with any
other corporation shall not be or be deemed to be a distribution of assets or
a dissolution, liquidation or winding up for the purposes of this paragraph.

Any Preferred Stock, Preference Stock, Common Stock, Class E Common Stock or
Class H Common Stock, authorized hereunder or under any amendment hereof, in
the discretion of the Board of Directors, may be issued, except as herein
otherwise provided, in payment for property or services, or as bonuses to
employees of the Corporation or employees of subsidiary companies, or for
other assets or securities including cash, necessary or desirable, in the
judgment of the Board of Directors, to be purchased or acquired from time to
time for the Corporation, or for any other lawful purpose of the Corporation.

If it seems desirable so to do, the Board of Directors may from time to time
issue scrip for fractional shares of stock. Such scrip shall not confer upon
the holder any right to dividends or any voting or other rights of a
stockholder of the Corporation, but the Corporation shall from time to time,
within such time as the Board of Directors may determine or without limit of
time if the Board of Directors so determines, issue one or more whole shares
of stock upon the surrender of scrip for fractional shares aggregating the
number of whole shares issuable in respect of the scrip so surrendered,
provided that the scrip so surrendered shall be properly endorsed for transfer
if in registered form.

ARTICLE FIFTH

The Corporation is to have perpetual existence.

ARTICLE SIXTH

The private property of the stockholders shall not be subject to the payment
of corporate debts to any extent whatever.

21

<PAGE>24

ARTICLE SEVENTH

The number of Directors of the Corporation, not less than three, shall be
fixed from time to time by the By-Laws and the number may be altered as
therein provided. In case of any increase in the number of Directors, the
additional Directors shall be elected as provided by the By-Laws, by the
Directors, or by the stockholders at an annual or special meeting. In case of
any vacancy in the Board of Directors, the remaining Directors, by affirmative
vote of a majority thereof, may elect a successor to hold office for the
