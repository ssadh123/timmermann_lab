LEHMAN BROTHERS REPORTS SECOND QUARTER AND HALF-YEAR RESULTS

NEW YORK, July 19, 1994 -- Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. today reported second
quarter net income from operations of $32 million compared to net income of $95
million for the businesses that comprised Lehman in the second quarter of 1993.
After accounting for the after-tax charge of $12 million relating to the Firm's
May 31 spin-off from the American Express Company, the Firm posted net income
of $20 million.

Quarterly earnings per common share were $0.11 and, when adjusted for the
spin-off charge, were $0.23. Both figures are adjusted for the shares
outstanding on the date of the Firm's spin-off from American Express.

Richard S. Fuld, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, "We are
pleased to be an independent public company, with a strong capital base that
will allow us to grow our business over time. The difficult market environment
that existed during our first quarter as an independent company clearly
affected our operating results. Lower syndicate volumes in both equities and
fixed income had a significantly adverse effect on our business. Market
volatility also impaired the profitability of our customer flow activity in
certain areas, resulting in a less favorable business mix. Higher revenue
performance from our mortgage-backed, derivatives, financial advisory and non
U.S. businesses helped to offset some of the weaknesses in our other business
activities."

Mr. Fuld added, "Despite the current environment, we continue to build Lehman's
global presence and remain committed to our client/customer-driven strategy.
While we recognize that continued investment is required to position the firm
for future growth and greater operating efficiencies, we must also continue our
cost reduction efforts."

Revenues

Net revenues (gross revenues less interest expense) of $696 million for the
second quarter, declined by 22% from the prior year's period. The decrease in
net revenues reflected adverse market conditions in both the United States and
Europe that led to the sharp declines in underwriting and market making
activities.

Market making and principal transactions were $361 million, down 17% from the
prior year's quarter. Rising interest rates and increased market volatility
reduced the Firm's profitability in its customer flow activity and contributed
to lower revenues in fixed income, equities and foreign exchange. These
decreases were offset, in part, by stronger revenues in U.S. and foreign
governments, mortgage-backed securities and derivatives.

Investment banking revenues of $151 million represented a 27% decline from the
prior year's period. Revenues were impacted by a weak syndicate calendar in
fixed income and equities, offset, in part, by stronger results from financial
advisory activities. Despite the weaker underwriting environment, Lehman was
ranked the number two underwriter of U.S. debt and equity and the number four
underwriter of debt and equity worldwide, for the half year ended June 30,
1994.

Net interest and dividend revenues of $54 million decreased by 53% from the
prior year's period, reflecting the combination of reduced spreads on fixed
income products, higher funding costs and changes in hedging strategies.

Commission revenues of $117 million for the quarter were down slightly year to
year, with relatively sustained volumes of customer activity in listed
securities.

Expenses

Non-interest expenses of $646 million, excluding the spin-off charge, reflected
a 12% decline from last year's second quarter. Consistent with the lower
levels of business activity in the quarter, compensation and benefits decreased
to $364 million from $476 million in the prior year.

<PAGE> 4

- - -3-

Other non-interest expenses, excluding compensation and benefits and spin-off
expenses, increased 10% to $282 million in the second quarter of 1994.
Increases in these expense categories, which are less sensitive to business
volumes, reflected ongoing investments in the Firm's international franchise as
well as additional investments in systems and technology.

Capital

At June 30, 1994, Lehman's stockholders' equity was $3,310 million and total
capital (stockholders' equity and long-term debt) was $13,877 million. The
infusion of $1,050 million of common equity and $200 million of preferred
stock, in connection with the Firm's spin-off from American Express, occurred
in late May, 1994. Proceeds from the capital increase were used to repay
commercial paper and short-term debt.

Six Month Results

Net income from operations for the first half of 1994 was $87 million, before
the above-mentioned spin-off expenses as well as a charge of $13 million in
the first quarter related to the implementation of SFAS No. 112. Including
these charges, net income for the first half of 1994 was $62 million, down 52%
from the $129 million posted in 1993 for the Lehman businesses. For the first
six months of 1994, earnings per common share were $0.40; six month earnings
per share were $0.63, before charges for the spin-off and SFAS No. 112.

In March, 1994, the Lehman Board of Directors approved a change in the Firm's
fiscal year from December 31 to November 30. Consequently, the Firm will
report its next quarterly earnings period for the three months ended August 31,
1994.

Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. is one of the leading global investment banks
serving institutional, corporate, government and high net worth individual
clients and customers through offices in New York, London, Tokyo and other
major cities, worldwide.

LEHMAN BROTHERS INSTITUTES STOCK AWARD PROGRAM

NEW YORK, July 19, 1994 -- Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. (NYSE: LEH) today
announced that the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board of
Directors has approved the Lehman Brothers Stock Award Program.

Under the program, salaried, bonus-eligible employees as of June 30, 1994 whose
total compensation exceeds $75,000 will receive an award of restricted stock
units, effective July 1, 1994, as a pre-tax advance against their 1994 bonuses.
Salaried, bonus-eligible employees with 1993 total compensation of $75,000 or
less will receive a one-time grant of 50 restricted stock units. Certain
vesting and sales restrictions will apply to all units, and they will convert
into Lehman Brothers common stock on a one-for-one basis in five years.

For the Operating Committee, total compensation is based on the financial
performance of the Firm. Under the Stock Award Program, Operating Committee
members will receive restricted stock units representing up to 50 percent of
their total 1994 compensation. Messrs. Richard S. Fuld, Jr., Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, and T. Christopher Pettit, President and Chief Operating
Officer, will receive up to 62.5 percent of their total compensation in
restricted stock units. These awards carry the same vesting and sales
restrictions as those outlined above for other employees receiving awards.

The Stock Award Program has been launched now to encourage all employees to
increase shareholder value from Lehman Brothers' inception as a public company.

Award Program should drive shareholder value by providing Lehman Brothers

Approximately 5.2 million units will be awarded to employees this year,
excluding members of the Firm's Operating Committee as described earlier. In
order to meet the share requirements of the program, Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. has been authorized to repurchase shares in the open market, as
circumstances and events permit. The Firm also has the authority to issue
shares for these programs.
