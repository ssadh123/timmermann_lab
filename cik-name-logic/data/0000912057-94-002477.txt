This Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "AGREEMENT") is made as of August

RECITALS

A. The respective Boards of Directors of Target, Acquisition Subsidiary
and the Company have approved the merger (the "MERGER") of Acquisition
Subsidiary with and into Target in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware and the provisions of this Agreement.

B. Target, Acquisition Subsidiary and the Company desire to make
certain representations, warranties and agreements in connection with, and
establish various conditions precedent to, the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants
and agreements hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I
TERMS OF THE MERGER

1.1 THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, the Merger shall be consummated in accordance with the Delaware
General Corporation Law (the "DELAWARE CODE"). At the Effective Time (as
defined in SECTION 1.2, below), upon the terms and subject to the conditions
of this Agreement, Acquisition Subsidiary shall be merged with and into Target
in accordance with the Delaware Code and the separate existence of Acquisition
Subsidiary shall thereupon cease, and Target, as the surviving corporation in
the Merger (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION"), shall continue its corporate
existence under the laws of the State of Delaware as a subsidiary of the
Company. The parties shall prepare and execute a certificate of merger in
substantially the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT 1.1 (the "CERTIFICATE OF
MERGER") in order to comply in all respects with the requirements of the
Delaware Code and with the provisions of this Agreement.

1.2 EFFECTIVE TIME. The Merger shall become effective at the time
of the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of
Delaware in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Delaware Code or at
such later time as may be specified in the Certificate of Merger. The
Certificate of Merger shall be filed as soon as practicable after all of the
conditions set forth in this Agreement have been satisfied or waived by the
party or parties entitled to the benefit of the same. Target and the Company
shall agree upon the time of such filing and the place where the closing of the
Merger (the "CLOSING") shall occur. The time when the Merger shall become
effective is herein referred to as the "EFFECTIVE TIME" and the date on which
the Effective Time occurs is herein referred to as the "CLOSING DATE."

<PAGE>

1.3 MERGER CONSIDERATION. Subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share ("TARGET
SHARES") of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Target (the "TARGET
COMMON STOCK") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive, and there
shall be paid and issued as hereinafter provided in exchange for the Target
Shares, the following consideration (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"): (a) if the
Share Value (as hereinafter defined) is $16.00 or lower, .520231 of a share of
the common stock of the Company, par value $.01 per share (the "COMPANY
STOCK"); (b) if the Share Value is $22.00 or greater, .450867 of a share of
Company Stock; or (c) if the Share Value is greater than $16.00 but lower than
$22.00, that portion of a share of Company Stock set forth next to the
applicable Share Value listed below (provided that if the Share Value falls
between any two of the Share Values listed below, the portion of a share of
Company Stock shall be that applicable to the lower of the two Share Values).
The applicable exchange ratio determined pursuant to the foregoing is herein
referred to as the "EXCHANGE RATIO."

</TABLE>

For purposes hereof, the "SHARE VALUE" shall be an amount equal to
the average closing trade price of the Company Stock for the thirty (30)
consecutive trading days prior to the date three (3) business days prior to the
Closing Date as reported on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

No fractional shares of the Company Stock shall be issued pursuant
to the Merger nor will any fractional share interest involved entitle the holder
thereof to vote, to receive dividends or to exercise any other rights of a
shareholder of the Company. In lieu thereof, any person who would otherwise be
entitled to a fractional share of the Company Stock pursuant to the provisions
hereof shall receive an amount in cash equal to the value of such fractional
share. The value of such fractional share shall be the product of such fraction
(rounded down to the nearest hundredth of a share) multiplied by the Share
Value.

Each share of Target Common Stock held in the treasury of Target or
by a wholly owned subsidiary of Target shall be cancelled as of the Effective
Time and no Merger Consideration shall be payable with respect thereto. From
and after the Effective Time,

<PAGE>

there shall be no further transfers on the stock transfer books of Target of any
of the Target Shares.

Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time,
the shares of Acquisition Subsidiary common stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Merger shall be converted, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, into one share of the common stock of the
Surviving Corporation (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION COMMON STOCK"), which one
share of the Surviving Corporation Common Stock shall constitute all of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

1.4 STOCKHOLDERS' RIGHTS UPON MERGER. Upon consummation of
the Merger, the certificates which theretofore represented Target Shares (the
"CERTIFICATES") shall cease to represent any rights with respect thereto, and,
subject to applicable Law (as hereinafter defined) and this Agreement, shall
only represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration and the amount of
cash, if any, payable in lieu of fractional shares of the Company Stock into
which their Target Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement.
Target represents and warrants that the holders of the Target Shares are not
entitled to appraisal rights under applicable Law or the Certificate of
Incorporation of Target, provided the conditions of Section 262(b)(1) of the
Delaware Code are satisfied and the provisions of Section 262(b)(2) of the
Delaware Code are not applicable.

1.5 SURRENDER AND EXCHANGE OF SHARES. After the Effective
Time, each holder of a Target Share shall surrender and deliver the Certificates
to First Union National Bank of North Carolina or such other bank or trust
company as may be designated by the Company (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") together
with a duly completed and executed transmittal letter provided by the Exchange
Agent. Upon such surrender and delivery, the holder shall receive a certificate
representing the number of whole shares of the Company Stock to which such
holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement plus any cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares. Until so surrendered and exchanged, each outstanding
Certificate after the Effective Time shall be deemed for all purposes to
evidence the right to receive that number of whole shares of the Company Stock
into which the Target Shares have been converted pursuant to this Agreement,
plus any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
no dividends or other distributions, if any, in respect of the shares of the
Company Stock, declared after the Effective Time and payable to holders of
record after the Effective Time, shall be paid to the holders of any
unsurrendered Certificates until such Certificates and transmittal letters are
surrendered and delivered as provided herein. Subject to applicable Law, after
the surrender and exchange of Certificates, the record holders thereof will be
entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions without interest
thereon, which theretofore have become payable with respect to the number of
shares of the Company Stock for which such Certificates were exchangeable.
Holders of any unsurrendered Certificates shall not be entitled to vote the
Company Stock until such Certificates are exchanged pursuant to this Agreement.

1.6 OPTIONS. At the Effective Time, the Company shall cause
each holder of a then-outstanding and unexercised option or warrant exercisable
for shares of Target Common Stock ("TARGET OPTIONS") to receive, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, options or
warrants exercisable for shares of Company Stock having the same terms and
conditions as the Target Options except that the exercise price and the number
of shares issuable upon exercise shall be divided and

<PAGE>

multiplied, respectively, by the Exchange Ratio. The Company acknowledges that
at the Effective Time, all such options shall be vested and exercisable to the
extent provided in the Target Options or, subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, applicable employment agreements. The Company shall file or cause to
be filed all registration statements on Form S-8 or other appropriate form and
all other registrations and qualifications as may be necessary in connection

but not limited to, intangible properties), liabilities or the results of
operations of Target and the Target Subsidiaries taken as a whole ("TARGET

Target Subsidiary has been operated in compliance with all Laws and all tariffs,
rules and regulations of local exchange carriers and inter-exchange carriers
applicable thereto, except for any instances of non-compliance which do not or

understanding, instrument, bid or proposal described in the following sentence
("TARGET MATERIAL CONTRACT") that is not described in or filed as an exhibit
to any Target Securities Filing as required by the Securities Act or the

2.13, a Target Material Adverse Contract shall be a note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, contract, lease, license, agreement, understanding, instrument, bid

financial obligation of Target or a Target Subsidiary thereunder or applicable

continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms without penalty,
acceleration or rights of early termination by reason of the consummation of the
Merger, and (ii) except for such as do not or would not have a Target Material
Adverse Effect, neither Target nor any Target Subsidiary is in violation or
breach of or default under any such Target Material Contract, nor to Target's
knowledge is any other party to any such Target Material Contract in violation
or breach of or default under any such Target Material Contract.

2.14 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS. Except as set forth in EXHIBIT
2.14(a) or EXHIBIT 2.14(d) attached hereto, there are no Benefit Plans (as
defined below) maintained or contributed to by Target or any member of Target's
controlled group under which Target, a Target Subsidiary or the Surviving
Corporation could incur any material liability. A "BENEFIT PLAN" shall
constitute (i) an employee benefit plan as defined in Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, together with all
regulations thereunder ("ERISA"), even if, because of some other provision of
ERISA, such plan is not subject to any or all of ERISA's provisions, and (ii)
whether or not described in the preceding clause, (a) any pension, profit
sharing, stock bonus, deferred or supplemental compensation, retirement, thrift,
stock purchase or stock option plan, or any other compensation, welfare, fringe
benefit or retirement plan, program, policy, understanding or arrangement of any
kind whatsoever, whether formal or informal, oral or written, providing for
benefits for or the welfare of any or all of the current or former employees or
agents of Target or any Target Subsidiary or their beneficiaries or dependents,
(b) a multi-employer plan as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA, or (c) a
multiple employer plan as defined in Section 413 of the Code.

With respect to each Benefit Plan (where applicable): Target has
made available to the Company complete and accurate copies of (i) all plan and
trust texts and agreements, material insurance contracts and other material
funding arrangements; (ii) annual reports on the Form 5500 series for the last
year; (iii) financial statements and/or annual and periodic accountings of plan
assets for the last year; (iv) the most recent determination letter received
from the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"); (v) actuarial valuations for the
last year; and (vi) the most recent summary plan description as defined in
ERISA.

Except as set forth in EXHIBIT 2.14(b) attached hereto, with
respect to each Benefit Plan while maintained or contributed to by Target or a
Target Subsidiary: (i) if intended to qualify under Code Sections 401(a) or
403(a), such Benefit Plan has received a favorable determination letter from the
IRS that it so qualifies, and its trust is exempt from taxation under Code
Section 501(a) and nothing has since occurred to cause the loss of the Benefit
Plan's qualification; (ii) such Benefit Plan has been administrated in
substantial accordance with its terms and applicable Laws; (iii) to the
knowledge of the Target, no event has occurred and there exist no circumstances
under which Target, a Target Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation would incur
liability under ERISA, the Code or otherwise in addition to the payment of
nondelinquent benefits, contributions and expenses currently contemplated by
such Benefit Plans; (iv) no accumulated funding deficiency as defined in Code
Section 412 has occurred or exists; (v) no non-exempt prohibited transaction as
defined under ERISA and the Code has occurred; (vi) no reportable event as
defined in Section 4043 of ERISA has occurred (excluding events for which the
30-day notice requirement has been waived); (vii) all contributions and premiums
due have fully been made and paid on a timely basis; and (viii) all
contributions made or required to be made under any Benefit Plan intended to be
deductible meet the requirements for deductibility under the Code, and all
contributions

<PAGE>

accrued prior to the Effective Time which have not been made have been properly
recorded on the books of Target, except in the cases of clauses (iii)-(viii),
above, for any deviations from the foregoing which do not or would not have a
Target Material Adverse Effect.

Neither Target nor any Target Subsidiary has any material liability,
joint or otherwise, for any withdrawal liability (potential, contingent or
otherwise) under Title IV of ERISA for a complete or partial withdrawal from any
multi-employer plan by any member of a controlled group of employers (as used in
ERISA) of which Target is or was a member.

With respect to each Benefit Plan which is subject to Title IV of
ERISA: (i) except as disclosed in the Target Financial Statements (or footnotes
thereto), as of the Effective Time, the market value of its assets (exclusive of
any contribution due to such Benefit Plan) equals or exceeds the present value
of benefit liabilities as of the latest actuarial evaluation date for such plan

Furthermore, the Company covenants, represents and warrants that
from and after the date hereof, unless Target shall otherwise expressly consent
in writing, the Company shall, and the Company shall cause each Company

material respects with all Laws applicable to it or any of its properties,

necessary for, or otherwise material to, such business.

advisors and legal counsel) with such information and documentation relating to
the terms of such Significant Acquisition and the participants therein as they
may reasonably request, subject to the proposed recipient executing and
delivering such confidentiality undertaking as the participants therein may
reasonably require. Within 10 days after the date that the Company is notified
by Target that no further information is required pursuant to the foregoing with
respect to any such Significant Acquisition, and in any event within 30 days

Richards, Layton & Finger or other reputable counsel to Target, has determined
that the Merger is no longer in the best interests of the stockholders of Target

deemed contemplated by this Agreement and shall not constitute a breach of any
covenant, representation, warranty or condition herein or a Company Material
Adverse Effect, except that any Events discovered or occurring after such

properties (including, but not limited to, intangible properties), liabilities,
or the results of operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries after
giving affect to such Significant Acquisition and the Merger, shall (without
limiting other matters which may also constitute a Company Material Adverse
Effect) be deemed to constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
shall not make a Significant Acquisition except in compliance with this SECTION
5.1(b).

For purposes hereof, "SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITION" shall mean

equity securities or assets or otherwise, proposed to be made by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary with or involving Williams Telecommunications Group, Inc.
or any of its affiliates.

Agreement shall preclude the Company or any Company Subsidiary from taking any
or all of the following actions and actions incident thereto or require the

indirectly, of any securities or assets of third parties;

(ii) grants of options having an exercise price at least
equal to the market price of the underlying Company Stock on the grant date to

connection with any Litigation disclosed or required to be disclosed by the

Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company will give Target and its
authorized representatives (including, without limitation, its financial
advisors, accountants and legal counsel) at all reasonable times reasonable
access to all plants, offices, warehouses and other facilities and, subject to

LDDS COMMUNICATIONS, INC.
TO ACQUIRE IDB COMMUNICATIONS GROUP, INC.
IN A TAX-FREE EXCHANGE

JACKSON, Miss. and LOS ANGELES, Cal. (August 1, 1994) -- LDDS Communications,
Inc. (Nasdaq NM/LDDS) and IDB Communications Group, Inc. (Nasdaq NM/IDBX) today
jointly announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement calling for
the acquisition of IDB by LDDS, subject to various terms and conditions
including approval of regulatory authorities and shareholders of both companies.

Under terms of the agreement, the transaction will be a tax-free exchange
and accounted for on a pooling of interests basis. The agreement calls for
holders of IDB shares to receive a minimum of .450867 LDDS share for each IDB
share if LDDS shares are valued at $22 or more; or a maximum of .520231 LDDS
share for each IDB share if LDDS shares are valued at $16 or less. The exchange
ratio changes by .001445 LDDS share for every $.125 change in LDDS share value
between $22 and $16.

In addition, the $195 million in convertible subordinated notes issued by
IDB will remain outstanding and the note holders will receive the corresponding
exchange ratio adjustment to their common stock conversion price.

Bernard J. Ebbers, president and chief executive officer of LDDS,
commented, "LDDS is rapidly achieving one of its four stated goals that includes
being a significant and major player in the international arena. The acquisition
of IDB by LDDS is a tremendous opportunity to complement and expand the domestic
and international growth potential of each company. This is an important
acceleration of our strategy to penetrate the lucrative segments of the
international market, but it is only a first step."

Jeffrey P. Sudikoff, chairman and chief executive officer of IDB, added,
"I have long believed in the synergy of a transaction between IDB and a domestic
carrier. The marriage of IDB's international network and the LDDS domestic
network makes the company a significant competitor in the industry. We believe
this deal is forward thinking and is in the best interest of the shareholders of
our company."

Ebbers stated that LDDS has expended considerable resources to make a
thorough examination of the well publicized events surrounding IDB and has
evaluated each in the assessment of the company and the quality of its future
earnings. "The cost savings that can be achieved by integrating our domestic and
international network facilities and combining our operations should be
substantial. We expect that the transaction will be accretive to 1995 earnings
per share," concluded Ebbers.

IDB ANNOUNCES INTENTION TO RESTATE
FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS

LOS ANGELES, CA -- August 1, 1994 -- IDB Communications Group, Inc.
(Nasdaq NM/IDBX) today announced its intention to restate its financial results
for the first quarter ended March 31, 1994. In a discussion relating to the
recently announced proposed acquisition of IDB by LDDS Communications, Inc.,
Jeffrey P. Sudikoff, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IDB, stated that
IDB would restate its first quarter results to eliminate approximately $6
million of pre-tax income, approximately $5 million of which relates to a sale
of transponder capacity and approximately $1 million of which relates to
purchase accounting adjustments. The result of the restatement will be a
reduction of first quarter net income from $.12 per share to approximately $.08
per share.

Mr. Sudikoff also stated that, in part as a result of costs associated
with the abandoned acquisition of Peoples Telephone and the resignation of its
former auditors and in part as a result of increased operating costs, IDB
expects to report essentially break even results for its second quarter ended
June 30, 1994. IDB will not have definitive results for its second quarter
available prior to mid or late August.

Mr. Sudikoff further announced that IDB and its new auditors were
assessing implementation of an accounting change relating to the accrual of
revenue associated with inbound international traffic. IDB has not determined
the impact of any such change upon its second quarter or its 1994 results of
operations.

IDB Communications Group, Inc. is a global telecommunications company that
operates a domestic and international communications network providing its
customers with
international private line and long distance telephone services, radio and
television transmission services, facsimile and data connections, mobile
satellite communications capabilities and the design and integration of
