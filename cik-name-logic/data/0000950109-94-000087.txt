the relevant Terms Agreement are used herein as therein defined. The term
"Representative, " as used herein, means the Underwriter or Underwriters (as
defined below) named in the relevant Terms Agreement as Representative or
Representatives. If no Underwriter or Underwriters are named in the Terms
Agreement as Representative or Representatives, then the terms "Underwriters"
and "Representatives" as used herein shall mean the Underwriter (if only one) or
all Underwriters (if more than one) listed in such Terms Agreement.

Riggs National Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the Company), may
issue and sell from time to time series of its subordinated debt securities
registered under the registration statement referred to below (the Subordinated
Notes) to the Underwriters (the Underwriters) named in the Terms Agreement
relating to any such Subordinated Notes. The Subordinated Notes may have
varying designations, denominations, interest rates and payment dates,
maturities, redemption provisions and selling prices, with all such terms for
any particular series of Subordinated Notes (together with any other terms
relating to such series) to be determined and set forth in the Terms Agreement
relating to the series.

The Subordinated Notes are to be issued pursuant to an indenture, dated
as of January 1, 1994 (the Indenture), between the Company and The Bank of New
York, as trustee. Copies of the Indenture have been delivered to each of the
Representatives.

The Company has filed, in accordance with the provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations thereunder
(collectively called the Act), with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
Commission) a registration statement on Form S-3, including a prospectus
relating to the Subordinated Notes, which incorporates by reference documents
which the Company has filed or will file in accordance with the provisions of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the rules and regulations
thereunder (collectively called the Exchange Act) and such registration
statement has become effective under the Act. If any post-effective amendment
to such registration statement has been filed with the Commission prior to the
execution and delivery of the
<PAGE>

Terms Agreement, the most recent such post-effective amendment shall have been
declared effective by the Commission. Copies of such registration statement as
amended as of the date of the Terms Agreement have been delivered by the Company
to the Representatives. As used in this Agreement, (i) "Preliminary Prospectus"
means each prospectus (including all documents incorporated therein by
reference) included in such registration statement, or amendments or supplements
thereof, before it became effective under the Act, including any prospectus
filed with the Commission by the Company with the consent of the Underwriters
pursuant to Rule 424(a) of the rules and regulations of the Commission; (ii)
"Registration Statement" means such registration statement, as it became
effective under the Act, and as amended or supplemented as of the date of the
Terms Agreement (including all exhibits thereto and all documents incorporated
therein by reference); (iii) "Basic Prospectus" means the prospectus (including
all documents incorporated therein by reference) included in the Registration
Statement; (iv) "Prospectus" means the Basic Prospectus, together with any
prospectus amendment or supplement specifically relating to the Securities to be
purchased by the Underwriters pursuant to the Terms Agreement (Underwritten
Securities), in the form in which it is first filed with, or mailed for filing
to, the Commission pursuant to paragraph (b) of Rule 424 of the rules and
regulations of the Commission (including in each case all documents incorporated
therein by reference as of the date of such filing or mailing); and (v) any
reference to any amendment or supplement to any Preliminary Prospectus or the
Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the
date of the Preliminary Prospectus or the Basic Prospectus, as the case may be,
under the Exchange Act and incorporated by reference. The Company meets the
requirements for the use of Form S-3 under the Act, and as of the date of the
Terms Agreement the Commission has not issued any order preventing or suspending
the use of any Prospectus.

The Company and the Underwriters agree as follows:

1. Sale and Purchase: The obligation of the Underwriters to purchase,
----------------- 
and the Company to sell, the Underwritten Securities is evidenced by a Terms
Agreement delivered at the time the Company determines to sell the Underwritten
Securities. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Underwritten
Securities will be several and not joint. The Terms Agreement specifies the
firm or firms which will be Underwriters, the principal amount of the
Underwritten Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter, the purchase price
to be paid by the Underwriters for the Underwritten Securities, the public
offering price of the Underwritten Securities and any terms of the Underwritten
Securities not already specified in the Indenture (including, without
limitation, designations, denominations, interest rates and payment dates,
maturity, redemption provisions and sinking fund requirements). The terms
Agreement specifies any details of the
<PAGE>

3

terms of the offering which should be reflected in a post-effective amendment to
the Registration Statement or the supplement to the Prospectus relating to the
offering of the Underwritten Securities.

2. Payment and Delivery: Delivery of and payment of the purchase price
-------------------- 
for the Underwritten Securities shall be made at the office of Simpson Thacher &
Bartlett in New York City at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on the fifth
business day/1/ following the date of the Terms Agreement or at such other date,
time or location as shall be agreed to by the Underwriters and the Company). 
The time at which such payment and delivery are actually made is hereinafter
sometimes called the time of purchase. At the time of purchase, the Company
shall deliver the Underwritten Securities to the Underwriters against payment to
or upon the order of the Company of the purchase price by certified or official
bank check or checks payable in federal (same-day) funds or by such other means
agreed to by the parties. Time shall be of the essence, and delivery at the
time and place specified pursuant to this Agreement is a further condition of
the obligation of each Underwriter hereunder. The Underwritten Securities shall
be prepared in definitive fully registered form in such denominations, and
registered in such names as the Underwriters shall request in writing not less
than three full business days prior to the Delivery Date. The Company shall
make the Underwritten Securities available for inspection by the Underwriters in
New York, New York not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business
day prior to the Delivery Date.

disclosed in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, neither the
Company nor any of its Material Subsidiaries is party to or otherwise the
subject of any consent decree, memorandum of understanding, written
commitment or other written supervisory agreement with the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the OCC or any other federal or
state authority or agency charged with the supervision or insurance of
depositary institutions or their holding companies; since the date of the
Prospectus, neither the MOU nor the Written Agreement has been materially
modified, amended or supplemented nor has the applicable bank regulatory
authority advised the Company or Riggs-Washington that it intends or
contemplates making any such modification, amendment or supplement; and
recognizing that the MOU and the Written Agreement by their terms
contemplate that amendments, supplements or modifications may be made

no reason to believe that it is not in

<PAGE>

11

the Prospectus then being used, or in the information incorporated therein
by reference, so that the prospectus would not include an untrue statement
of any material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they are

of the Underwriters hereunder with respect to the Underwritten Securities are
subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the
Company on the date hereof and at the time of purchase, the performance by the
Company of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed and to the
following conditions:

(a) The Company shall furnish to the Underwriters at the time of

purchase and in form reasonably satisfactory to Simpson Thacher & Bartlett,
counsel for the Underwriters, to the effect that:

(i) the Terms Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Company;

(ii) the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Company and duly qualified under the Trust Indenture
Act; the Underwritten Securities have been duly authorized, executed,
authenticated, issued and delivered; and the Indenture and the
Underwritten Securities constitute
<PAGE>

13

valid and legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in
accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and
to general equity principles;

(iii) the Registration Statement has become effective under the
Act and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no stop order
proceedings with respect thereto are pending or threatened under the
Act; and the Prospectus, and any supplements thereto, have been filed
with the Commission within the time period specified by Rule 424(b)
under the Act;

(iv) all regulatory consents, authorizations, approvals and
filings required to be obtained or made by the Company under the
federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York
and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware for the
issuance, sale and delivery of the Underwritten Securities by the
Company to the Underwriters have been obtained or made;

(v) the issuance of the Underwritten Securities in accordance
with the terms of the Indenture and the sale of the Underwritten
Securities by the Company to the Underwriters pursuant to the Terms
Agreement do not, and the performance by the Company of its
obligations under the Indenture will not, (A) violate the charter or
by-laws of the Company or any Material Subsidiary or (B) violate any
federal law of the United States or law of the State of New York
applicable to the Company or its Material Subsidiaries or the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware; provided that, for the
-------- 
purposes of this clause (B), such counsel need express no opinion with
respect to federal or state securities laws, antifraud laws,
fraudulent transfer laws or antitrust laws; and provided further, that
-------- ------- 
insofar as the performance by the Company of its obligations under the
Indenture and the Underwritten Securities is concerned, such counsel
need express no opinion as to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors' rights; and

(vi) the redemption by the Company of its Floating Rate
Subordinated Notes Due 1996 and Floating Rate Subordinated Capital
Notes due 1996 (together, the "Capital Notes"), as such redemption is
described under the section "Use of Proceeds" in the Prospectus, will
not result in a default under, or a breach of, the terms of the
Indenture, dated as of September 15, 1984, between the Company and
Chemical Bank, as successor to
<PAGE>

14

Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company (Chemical), as trustee, the
Indenture, dated as of December 18, 1985, between the Company and
Chemical, as trustee, or the securities issued thereunder.

In connection with their opinions set forth in paragraphs (iv)
and (v) above, such counsel shall note that in a letter dated December
8, 1993 (the "Reserve Bank Letter"), the Reserve Bank stated that it
has no objection under the MOU to the issuance by the Company of up to
$125 million of subordinated debt and the redemption or repurchase of
up to $147 million of outstanding subordinated debt of the Company. 
In light of the Reserve Bank Letter, such counsel does not believe
that the issuance of the Underwritten Securities or the redemption of
the Capital Notes as such redemption is described under the section
"Use of Proceeds" in the Prospectus would violate the MOU or would be
an unsafe or unsound practice in violation of Section 8 of the Federal
Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. Section 1818. However, because
federal bank regulators have broad discretion, such counsel need not
express an opinion on what any bank regulatory authority may determine
constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice.

In addition, such counsel shall state that, as special counsel
for the Company, they reviewed the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus, participated in discussions with representatives of the
Underwriters and representatives of the Company and its accountants,
and advised the Company as to the requirements of the Act and the
applicable rules and regulations thereunder. Such counsel shall also
state that between the effectiveness of the Registration Statement and
the time of purchase, they participated in further discussions with
representatives of the Company and its accountants regarding the
contents of certain portions of the Prospectus and certain related
matters, and reviewed certificates of certain officers of the Company,
and an opinion of the Company's General Counsel and a letter from the
Company's independent accountants. Such counsel shall state that on
the basis of the information they gained in the course of the
performance of the services referred to above, considered in the light
of their understanding of the applicable law (including the
requirements of Form S-3 and the character of the prospectus
contemplated thereby) and the experience they have gained through
their practice under the Act, in their opinion, each part of the
Registration Statement, when such part became effective, and the
Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus, appeared on their face
to be appropriately responsive in all material respects to
<PAGE>

15

the requirements of the Act, the Trust Indenture Act and the
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder. 
Further such counsel shall state that nothing that came to their
attention in the course of such review has caused them to believe that
any part of the Registration Statement, when such part became
effective, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that the
Prospectus, as of the date of the Prospectus, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Also, such
counsel shall state that nothing that has come to their attention in
the course of the procedures described in the second sentence of this
paragraph has caused them to believe that the Prospectus, as of the
time of purchase, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

Such counsel may also state that the limitations inherent in the
independent verification of factual matters and the character of
determinations involved in the registration process are such, however,
that they do not assume any responsibility for the accuracy,
completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto, except for those made under the caption "Description of the
Debt Securities" in the Basic Prospectus, and any comparable
provisions in any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus insofar as
they relate to provisions of documents therein described. Also, such
counsel may state that they do no express any opinion or belief as to
the financial statement and schedules or other financial and
statistical data contained in the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus or as to the statement of eligibility and qualification of
the Trustee under the Indenture under which the Underwritten
Securities are being issued.

The foregoing opinion of such counsel may be limited to the
federal laws of the United States, the laws of the State of New York
and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, and may
state that such counsel express no opinion as to the effect of the
laws of any other jurisdiction.
<PAGE>

16

In connection with the foregoing opinion, such counsel may rely,
as to the due incorporation of the Company, upon the opinion, dated
the date of their opinion, of David Lesser, Esq., General Counsel of
the Company, delivered to the Company pursuant to the Terms Agreement.

Such counsel may rely as to certain matters on information
obtained from public officials, officers of the Company and other
sources believed by such counsel to be responsible, and shall assume
that the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
the Trustee, that the Trustee's certificates of authentication of the
Underwritten Securities have been duly manually signed by one of the
Trustee's authorized officers, and that the signatures on all
documents examined by such counsel are genuine, assumptions which they
will not have independently verified.

Such counsel may state that their opinion is delivered to the
Underwriters by them as special counsel for the Company and is solely
for the Underwriters' benefit.

(b) The Company shall furnish to the Underwriters at the time of
purchase an opinion of David Lesser, Esq., General Counsel of the Company,
addressed to each of the Underwriters and dated the time of purchase and in
form reasonably satisfactory to Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, counsel for the
Underwriters, to the effect that:

(ii) each of the Material Subsidiaries is a national banking

a valid certificate of authority from the OCC and is authorized to do
business as a national banking association under the laws of the

material adverse effect on the financial condition, properties,
assets, business, results of operations or prospects of the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole;
<PAGE>

17

(iii) the Company and its Material Subsidiaries are duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing as a foreign corporation in
each jurisdiction in which the ownership or leasing of its properties
or character of its operations makes such qualification necessary,
except where failure to obtain such qualification, license or good
standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition, properties, assets,
business, results of operations or prospects of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

(iv) all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company
have been duly and validly authorized and issued, are fully paid and
non-assessable and were not issued in violation of the preemptive
rights of any other stockholder of the Company; and all of the issued
and outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the Company's
Material Subsidiaries (except for directors' or other qualifying
shares) are owned of record by the Company or one or more of its

law);

in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus;

with the issue or sale of the Underwritten Securities by the Company
as contemplated by the Terms Agreement other than registration of the
Underwritten Securities under the Act, qualification of the Indenture
under the Trust Indenture Act and prior written notice to the Reserve
Bank, which notice has been duly given (except such counsel need
express no opinion as to any necessary qualification under the state
securities or blue sky laws of the various jurisdictions in which the
Underwritten Securities are being offered by the Underwriters); and
the Company has obtained all necessary approvals and consents of the
Reserve Bank and of any other applicable federal regulatory authority
for the redemption of the Capital Notes as set forth under the caption
"Use of Proceeds" in the Prospectus;

(vii) the execution, delivery and performance of the Terms
Agreement and the Indenture and the issuance of the Underwritten
Securities by the Company and the
<PAGE>

18

consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby do not and will not (A) conflict with, or result in any
breach of, or constitute a default under (nor constitute any event
which with notice, lapse of time, or both would constitute a breach of
or default under), (1) any provision of any license, indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, bank loan, credit agreement or other
agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or their
respective properties may be bound or affected, except any such

operations or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, or (2) any federal or District of Columbia law, regulation or

time, or both would constitute a breach of, or default under), (A) any
license, indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, bank loan or credit
agreement or any other agreement or instrument to which the Company or
any of its Material Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or
their respective properties may be bound or affected or (B) any law,
regulation or rule or any decree, judgment or order applicable to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except any such breaches or
defaults of a type referred to in (A) or (B) above which would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
material adverse effect on the financial condition, properties,
assets, business, results of operations or prospects, of the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or on the ability of the Company
to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Terms Agreement,
the Underwritten Securities and the Indenture;

(ix) to the best of such counsel's knowledge, there are no

(x) the Registration Statement has become effective under the
Act and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no stop order

Act; and the Prospectus, and any supplements thereto, have been filed
with the Commission within the time period specified by Rule 424(b)
under the Act;

(xi) to the best of such counsel's knowledge, there are no
actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties, at law or in equity or before or by any court,
governmental authority or administrative or regulatory authority which
are required to be described in the Prospectus but are not so

the Trustee under the Indenture under which the Underwritten

<PAGE>

22

of the foregoing, (i) such counsel are of the opinion that the Registration
Statement, as of its effective date, and the Prospectus, as of its date,
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act
and the Trust Indenture Act and (ii) such counsel have no reason to believe

therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

(g) Between the time of execution of the Terms Agreement and the time
of purchase (i) no material adverse change, financial or otherwise (other
than as referred to in the Registration Statement and Prospectus), in the
business, condition or prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken

<PAGE>

23

transaction which is material and adverse to the Company (other than as
referred to in the Registration Statement and Prospectus) shall have been

(h) The Company shall have performed such of its obligations under
this Agreement as are to be performed by the terms hereof at or before the

(i) The Company shall, at the time of purchase, deliver to you a
certificate of its chief executive officer and its chief financial officer

(j) The Company shall have furnished to the Representatives such
other documents and certificates as to the accuracy and completeness of any

of purchase as the Representatives may reasonably request, provided that no
opinions of counsel or comfort letters shall be requested other than those
referred to in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 7.

7. Termination: The obligations of the several Underwriters hereunder
----------- 
shall be subject to termination in the absolute discretion of the Underwriters
if, at any time prior to the time of purchase, trading in securities on the New
York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or minimum prices shall have been
established on the New York Stock Exchange, or if a banking moratorium shall
have been declared either by the United States or New York State authorities, or
if the United States shall have declared war in accordance with its
constitutional processes or there shall have occurred any material outbreak or
escalation of hostilities or other national or international calamity or crisis
of such magnitude in its effect on the financial markets of the United States
as, in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriters, to make it impracticable to
market the Underwritten Securities.

If the Underwriters elect to terminate this agreement as provided in
this Section 7, the Company shall be notified promptly in writing delivered by
facsimile or telegram.

If the sale to the Underwriters of the Underwritten Securities, as
contemplated by the Terms Agreement, is not carried out by the Underwriters for
any reason permitted under this Agreement or if such sale is not carried out
because the Company shall be unable to comply with any of the terms of the Terms
Agreement, the Company shall not be under any obligation or liability hereunder
or thereunder (except to the extent provided in Sections 4(m), 5 and 9 hereof),
and the Underwriters shall be under no obligation or liability to the Company
under this
<PAGE>

24

Agreement (except to the extent provided in Section 9 hereof) or to one another
hereunder.

8. Increase in Underwriters' Commitments: If any Underwriter shall
------------------------------------- 
default in its obligation to take up and pay for the Underwritten Securities to
be purchased by it under the Terms Agreement and if the aggregate principal
amount of Underwritten Securities which such Underwriter shall have agreed but
failed to take up and pay for does not exceed 10% of the total aggregate
principal amount of Underwritten Securities, the non-defaulting Underwriters
shall take up and pay for (in addition to the aggregate principal amount of
Underwritten Securities they are obligated to purchase pursuant to the Terms
Agreement) the aggregate principal amount of Underwritten Securities agreed to
be purchased by the defaulting Underwriter.

Without relieving any defaulting Underwriter from its obligations
hereunder, the Company agrees with the non-defaulting Underwriters that it will
not sell any Underwritten Securities hereunder unless all of the Underwritten
Securities are purchased by the Underwriters (or by substituted Underwriters
selected by the Representatives with the approval of the Company or selected by
the Company with the approval of the Representatives).

If a new Underwriter or Underwriters are substituted for a defaulting
Underwriter in accordance with the foregoing provision, the Company or the
Representatives shall have the right to postpone the time of purchase for a
period not exceeding five business days in order that any necessary changes in
the Registration Statement and Prospectus and other documents may be effected.

The term Underwriter as used in this agreement shall refer to and
include any Underwriter substituted under this Section 8 with the like effect as
if such substituted Underwriter had originally been named in the Terms
Agreement.

9. Indemnity by the Company and the Underwriters:
--------------------------------------------- 

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each
Underwriter, and any person who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, from and against any
loss, expense, liability or claim (including the reasonable cost of
investigation) which, jointly or severally, any such Underwriter or controlling
person may incur under the Act, the Exchange Act or otherwise, insofar as such
loss, expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the
Registration Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any
post-effective amendment thereof by the Company) or in a Prospectus (the term
Prospectus for the purpose of this Section 9 being deemed to include any
preliminary Prospectus, the Prospectus and the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented by the
<PAGE>

25

Company), or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact required to be stated in either such Registration
Statement or Prospectus or necessary to make the statements made therein not
misleading, except insofar as any such loss, expense, liability or claim arises
out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in and in conformity with information furnished in
writing by or on behalf of any Underwriter to the Company expressly for use with
reference to such Underwriter in such Registration Statement or such Prospectus
or arises out of or is based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact in connection with such information required to be stated in
either such Registration Statement or Prospectus or necessary to make such
information not misleading; and provided that the Company shall not be liable to
any Underwriter if such Underwriter failed to deliver the Prospectus (as amended
or supplemented by any amendment or supplement thereto filed prior to the time
of purchase) at or prior to the time of confirmation of the sale of the
Underwritten Securities which are the subject of any claim for indemnity under
this Section 9 and such Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto filed
prior to the time of purchase) corrected the untrue statement or omission or
alleged untrue statement or omission, unless such failure resulted from
non-compliance by the Company with Section 4(c). For purposes of the last
proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the term "Prospectus" shall not
be deemed to include the documents incorporated therein by reference, and no
Underwriter shall be obligated to send or give any supplement or amendment to
any document incorporated by reference in any Preliminary Prospectus or the
Prospectus to any person.

If any action is brought against an Underwriter or controlling person in
respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Company pursuant to the
foregoing paragraph, such Underwriter shall promptly notify the Company in
writing of the institution of such action and the Company shall assume the
defense of such action, including the employment of counsel and payment of
expenses. Such Underwriter or controlling person shall have the right to employ
its or their own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be at the expense of such Underwriter or such controlling person
unless the employment of such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by
the Company in connection with the defense of such action or the Company shall
not have employed counsel to have charge of the defense of such action or such
indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be
defenses available to it or them which are different from or additional to those
available to the Company (in which case the Company shall not have the right to
direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or
parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by the
Company and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that the Company
shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one

separate counsel in any one action or series of related actions in the same
jurisdiction representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such
action). Anything in this paragraph to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such claim or action
effected without its written consent.

(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Company, its directors and officers and any person who controls the
Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the
Exchange Act from and against any loss, expense, liability or claim (including
the reasonable cost of investigation) which, jointly or severally, the Company
or any such person may incur under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such loss,
expense, liability or claim arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in and in conformity
with information furnished in writing by or on behalf of such Underwriter to the
Company expressly for use with reference to such Underwriter in the Registration
Statement (or in the Registration Statement as amended by any post-effective
amendment thereof by the Company) or in a Prospectus, or arises out of or is
based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact in
connection with such information required to be stated either in such
Registration Statement or Prospectus or necessary to make such information not
misleading.

If any action is brought against the Company or any such person in
respect of which indemnity may be sought against any Underwriter pursuant to the
foregoing paragraph, the Company or such person shall promptly notify such
Underwriter in writing of the institution of such action and such Underwriter
shall assume the defense of such action, including the employment of counsel and
payment of expenses. The Company or such person shall have the right to employ
its own counsel in any such case, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall be at the expense of the Company or such person unless the employment of
such counsel shall have been authorized in writing by such Underwriter in
connection with the defense of such action or such Underwriter shall not have
employed counsel to have charge of the defense of such action or such
indemnified party or parties shall have reasonably concluded that there may be
defenses available to it or them which are different from or additional to those
available to such Underwriter (in which case such Underwriter shall not have the
right to direct the defense of such action on behalf of the indemnified party or
parties), in any of which events such fees and expenses shall be borne by such
Underwriter and paid as incurred (it being understood, however, that such
Underwriter shall not be liable for the expenses of more than one separate
counsel in any one action or series of related actions in the same jurisdiction
representing the indemnified parties who are parties to such action). Anything
in this paragraph to the contrary notwithstanding, no Underwriter shall be
liable for any
<PAGE>

27

settlement of any such claim or action affected without the written consent of
such Underwriter.

(c) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 9 is unavailable
to an indemnified party under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 9 in
respect of any losses, expenses, liabilities or claims referred to therein, then
each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified
party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party
as a result of such losses, expenses, liabilities or claims (i) in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the
Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering
of the Underwritten Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i)
above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but
also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Underwriters
on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in
such losses, expenses, liabilities or claims, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the
one hand and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same
proportion as the total proceeds from the offering of the Underwritten
Securities (net of underwriting discounts and commissions but before deducting
expenses) received by the Company bear to the underwriting discounts and
commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault of the Company on
the one hand and of the Underwriters on the other shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission relates to
information supplied by the Company or by the Underwriters and the parties'
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable by a party as a
result of the losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to above shall be
deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by
such party in connection with investigating or defending any claim or action.

(d) The Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just
and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro
rata allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such
purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the
equitable considerations referred to in subsection (c) above. Notwithstanding
the provisions of this Section 9, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute
any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the
Underwritten Securities underwritten by it and distributed to the public were
offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter
has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged
<PAGE>

28

omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Underwriters'
obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several in proportion
to their respective underwriting commitments and not joint.

(e) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this
Section 9, and the covenants, warranties and representations of the Company
contained in this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter, or any person who
controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section
20 of the Exchange Act, or by or on behalf of the Company, its directors and
officers or any person who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15
of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, and shall survive any termination
of the Terms Agreement or the issuance and delivery of the Underwritten
Securities. The Company and each Underwriter agree promptly to notify the
others of the commencement of any litigation or proceeding against it and, in
the case of the Company, against any of the Company's officers and directors, in
connection with the issuance and sale of the Underwritten Securities, or in
connection with the Registration Statement or Prospectus.

10. Notices: Except as otherwise herein provided, all statements,
------- 
requests, notices and agreements shall be in writing or by telegram and, if to
the Underwriters, shall be sufficient in all respects if delivered or sent to
the Representatives at the address set forth for that purpose in the Terms
Agreement, and, if to the Company, shall be sufficient in all respects if
delivered to the Company at the offices of the Company at 808 17th Street, N.W.,
Washington, D.C., Attention: David Lesser, General Counsel.

11. Construction: This agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
------------ 
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. The section headings in this
Agreement have been inserted as a matter of convenience of reference and are not
a part of this Agreement.

12. Parties at Interest: The Agreement herein set forth has been and is
------------------- 
made solely for the benefit of the Underwriters and the Company and the
controlling persons, directors and officers referred to in Section 9 hereof, and
their respective successors, assigns, executors and administrators. No other
person, partnership, association or corporation (including a purchaser, as such
purchaser, from any of the Underwriters) shall acquire or have any right under
or by virtue of this Agreement.

*-Earnings include the consolidated earnings of the national banking
subsidiaries which may not be available (due to legal limitations on the
sources and amounts of dividends national bank are permitted to pay their parent
companies) to cover fixed charges of the holding company. Fixed charges include
interest on long term debt which are obligations of the holding company. During
the nine month period ended September 30, 1993 and the years ended December 31,
1992, 1991 and 1990, earnings were insufficient to cover fixed charges
(including interest on deposits) by $91.7 million, $22.1 million, $72.1 million
