The following is the text of a press release issued by 
Dow Corning Corporation on March 23, 1994:

DOW CORNING PROVISIONALLY SIGNS SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT

Midland, Mich. - Dow Corning today announced that it has
provisionally signed, pending approval by its board of directors,
a written agreement specifying the terms for its participation in
a proposed global settlement for silicone breast implant
litigation.

"This agreement, which was negotiated by attorneys
representing plaintiffs and major manufacturers, sets forth the
terms and conditions for the settlement," explained Gary E.
Anderson, Dow Corning executive vice president. "It is another
positive step toward resolving this controversy."

If U.S. District Court Judge Sam C. Pointer grants
preliminary approval of the settlement, the agreement will
undergo a court-supervised notification and review process,
including fairness hearings to evaluate the proposed settlement's
terms and conditions.

While the written agreement allows each woman to decide
privately whether she wishes to participate in the settlement or
pursue her case independently in court, the success of the
settlement depends on virtually all women participating in it. 
Each funder has the option to withdraw from the settlement
depending on the number of women who reject the settlement.

"In contrast to the uncertainties of a court trial, this
settlement provides women with a predictable financial
compensation that is timely and private. That is why we hope it
will be the preferred option for all women with breast implants,"
Anderson said. "While we have a strong defense that is growing
stronger as the science evolves, we also believe that a
settlement is in the best interest of all parties involved. 
However, what we cannot manage is both paying the immense cost of
this settlement and defending ourselves in protracted
litigation."

Dow Corning previously announced that it would contribute
approximately $2 billion over more than 30 years as one of the
funders of the proposed global settlement, pending the completion
of terms and conditions. The company's participation in this
settlement is based on receiving substantial and timely support
from its insurance carriers.

As previously announced, Dow Corning is building on its 30
years of research by funding additional studies that respond to
the remaining questions women have about their implants. The
company permanently withdrew from the breast implant business in
March 1992.

Dow Corning Corporation, world leader in the production of
silicones, is a Michigan corporation with shares equally owned by
The Dow Chemical Company and Corning Inc.
