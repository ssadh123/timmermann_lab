Item 5. Other Events.

Armco Inc. ("Armco") announced on January 26, 1994, that Armco 
Steel Company, L.P. ("ASC"), the flat-rolled carbon steel joint venture 
equally owned by Armco and Kawasaki Steel Corporation, began 
implementing a proposed plan to restructure and recapitalize itself 
through the sale of equity in an initial public offering and debt in a 
senior note offering. 

The terms of the proposed plan have since been changed to provide 
that, if it is successfully implemented, as to which there can be no 
assurance, Armco would receive approximately 1 million shares, or 
approximately 4.2% (which is higher than the "less than 1%" to have been 
received by Armco as originally proposed) if the initial public offering 
price is within the range of $21 to $24 per share; that, if the initial 
public offering price is greater than $24 per share, the number of 
shares to be issued to Armco in exchange for its equity interests in the 
joint venture would be increased by an amount equal to one-third of (i) 
the excess of the initial public offering price per share over $24 (net 
of underwriting discounts), multiplied by (ii) the number of shares sold 
in the common stock offering (excluding any shares sold pursuant to any 
exercise of the U.S. Underwriters' and Managers' over-allotment option), 
and divided by (iii) the initial public offering price per share; and 
that, if the initial public offering price is less than $21 per share, 
the number of shares to be issued to Armco in exchange for its equity 
interests in ASC would be reduced to an amount to be agreed upon prior 
to the establishment of the initial public offering price. The March 
10, 1994 preliminary prospectus for the initial public offering states 
that "It is anticipated that the initial public offering price will be 
between $21 and $24 per share." As previously reported, the proceeds 
from the offering would be used by the joint venture primarily to reduce 
its debt and unfunded pension liability and Armco's obligation to make 
certain cash payments to the venture would be eliminated.
