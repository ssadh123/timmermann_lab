APC COMMITS TO BUILD THREE NEW SHIPS AT DAEWOO

OAKLAND, December 6, 1993 -- American President Companies (APC) has entered 
into an agreement with Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery, Ltd., of
Korea, under which Daewoo will construct three new diesel-powered
containerships for delivery in 1996. Each of the new ships will have a cargo-
carrying capacity of approximately 3600 TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units),
including slots for 250 refrigerated cargo containers, and a service speed
of about 23.5 knots. The new ships, in combination with capacity from six
C11-class ships currently under contract for construction, will replace
four chartered vessels now operated in American President Lines'
West Asia/Middle East service.

The new ship program will cost approximately $190 million, and will
be financed by funds from a recent debt offering and internally generated cash
flow. The agreement is contingent upon the finalization of certain export
licensing arrangements in Korea.

In announcing the transaction, APC Chairman John M. Lillie said: "These
new ships will further strengthen our services in some of the world's fastest-
growing trade lanes."

Oakland, California-based American President Companies provides
container transportation and related services through an intermodal system
combining ocean, rail and truck transportation.
