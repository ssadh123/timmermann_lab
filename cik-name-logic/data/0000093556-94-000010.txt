FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE June 21, 1994

STANLEY COMPLETES SALE OF COMPANY-OWNED TAYLOR RENTAL STORES

New Britain, Connecticut...The Stanley Works announced today that
it has completed the sale of its Taylor Rental Corporation
company-owned stores to General Rental L.P. headquartered in Chicago,
Illinois. Terms of the sale were not disclosed.

In June of 1993, Stanley announced the sale of its 228 Taylor
Rental Center franchise locations to SERVISTAR Corporation of Butler,
PA. At the same time, the company stated that it was also planning to
offer the 65 company-owned stores for sale. 

According to Robert Bobb, General Partner of General Rental L.P., 
the stores will continue to do business as Taylor Rental Centers,
under a license agreement from SERVISTAR.

R. Alan Hunter, President and Chief Operating Officer of The
Stanley Works commented, "We are very pleased to complete this
transaction. It concludes the second phase of our plan to sell both 
business units of Taylor Rental. I am confident that the hard work of the
dedicated group of store managers and employees will continue to serve
these Taylor Rental Centers well under the new ownership."

Mr. Hunter continued, "Stanley's corporate focus is to capitalize
on our strengths as a world-class manufacturer and marketer of
tools, hardware and specialty hardware for home improvement, consumer,
industrial and professional use. We are concentrating our
efforts on continued growth for these product categories and customers
through our initiatives in existing worldwide markets and by stretching
our geographic reach into the emerging, high-potential markets of
Asia and Eastern Europe."
