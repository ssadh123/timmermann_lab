NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1. Nature of Business and Significant Accounting Policies

Nature of business: T. K. Gray, Inc. (the Company) distributes supplies and 
equipment and provides service support to the printing and printed circuit 
board industries principally in Minnesota. In addition, the Company 
manufactures and sells printing blankets to the printing industry and is a 
distributor of electronic publishing industry supplies and equipment. The 
Company establishes credit with its customer on an individual basis.

Inventories: Nonequipment inventories (86 percent of total inventories) are 
stated at last-in, first-out method (LIFO) cost which does not exceed market. 
The remaining equipment inventories are valued at the lower of first-in, 
first-out (FIFO) cost or market. The lower of cost or market is determined on 
a pooled basis. If the FIFO method had been used for all inventories, the 
Company's inventories would have been $184,601 and $153,342 higher at December 
31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Depreciation and amortization: Equipment and furniture are depreciated over 
estimated useful lives of five to thirteen years using straight-line and 
accelerated methods. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of 
the useful lives of the assets or the term of the building lease.

Intangible assets: Noncompete agreements were amortized over three to four 
years. Debt issuance costs are being amortized over the life of the loan 
(five years). The customer list is being amortized over 13 years. All 
amortization is on the straight-line method.

Note 2. Debt Facilities

Debt outstanding includes the following at December 31:

1993 1992
- - - --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Revolving credit facility borrowings $6,030,043 $6,276,303
Senior term loan, paid in 1993 --- 1,100,000
---------- ----------
6,030,043 7,376,303
Less current maturities 660,000
---------- ----------
$6,030,043 $6,716,303
========== ==========

The Company has a revolving credit facility with a bank, which matures October 
19, 1995. Collateral pledged for amounts advanced under the line of credit 
consists of inventories, accounts receivable and equipment. Borrowings are 
limited to the lesser of $7,250,000 or a percentage of eligible accounts 
receivable and inventories, less $500,000. The Company is required to 
maintain a collateral account with the bank, wherein, all funds deposited are 
used to pay down the line with one-day availability. At December 31, 1993 and 
1992, the Company had checks outstanding in excess of cash balances of 
$249,687 and $224,500, respectively. These amounts are included as part of 
the revolving credit facility borrowings. At December 31, 1993, the Company 
had available for borrowing $920,929, before deducting the $500,000 minimum 
available balance and checks outstanding. Interest on the credit facility is 
paid monthly in arrears, at the then current base rate plus 1.75 percent (7.75 
percent at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively) and the Company is 
required to pay an annual fee of 0.375 percent of the unused funds.

<PAGE>

The credit agreement with the bank contains provisions which, among other 
things, limit the ability of the Company to acquire or merge with other 
companies, borrow additional funds, sell or purchase fixed assets, pay 
dividends, or repurchase its capital stock. The Company must also maintain 
certain net worth levels and meet periodic ratios of fixed charge coverage, 
interest coverage, current ratios and cash generation. As of December 31, 
1993, the Company was in compliance and had obtained a waiver of these 
covenants.

Note 3. Commitments and Contingencies

Leases: The Company currently leases approximately 38,000 square feet of 
office and warehouse facilities through June 1998. Terms of the lease require 
minimum annual rentals of $170,100 plus real estate taxes and other occupancy 
expenses. The Company has the option to renew the lease for an additional 
five years and also has an agreement to lease an additional 12,190 square feet 
of office and warehouse space through March 31, 1995.

In addition, the Company leases transportation equipment under noncancelable 
operating leases.

Approximate minimum annual rentals are as follows:

Years ending December 31:
1994 $227,600
1995 182,200
1996 170,100
1997 170,100
1998 85,000

Total rent expense was $234,048, $230,569 and $221,018 for the years ended 
December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Employment and stock repurchase agreements: The stockholders have entered 
into five-year employment agreements which include three-year noncompete 
agreements after termination. They have also entered into stock purchase 
agreements which first allow the other stockholders and then the Company the 
right of first refusal regarding stock transfers or sales after January 1, 
1996. After that time, or when the aggregate outstanding balance of the 
Company's term debt is less than the available borrowings under the revolving 
credit facility, the stockholders may require the Company to purchase their 
shares at fair market value but, in the event of death, at no less than the 
face amount of insurance carried on the stockholder's life. Fair market value 
is to be determined by mutual agreement between the seller and the buyer or by 
independent appraisal. Terms require that 20 percent of the price be paid 
upon transfer of shares with the remainder to be paid in up to five equal 
annual installments.

Note 4. Benefit Plan

The Company has a profit sharing/savings plan which meets the requirements of 
Internal Revenue Code Section 401(k). All employees with at least six months 
of service are eligible to participate in the plan and may contribute up to 10 
percent of their earnings. The Company matches 50 percent of the first six 
percent of the employee contributions and may make additional contributions as 
determined by the Board of Directors. The total nondiscretionary expense 
relating to this plan was $98,748, $98,396 and $94,972 for the years ended 
December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. In addition, the Company 
made discretionary contributions of none, $50,000 and $36,400 for the years 
ended December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

<PAGE>

Note 5. Income Taxes

The Company has elected to be taxed under sections of the federal and state 
income tax laws which provide that, in lieu of corporation income taxes, the 
stockholders separately account for the Company's items of income, deductions, 
losses and credits (S Corporation). Prior to January 1, 1992, income taxes 
were payable at the corporate level ('C' Corporation), and income taxes were 
computed for financial statement purposes in accordance with Accounting 
Principles Board Opinion No. 11. Therefore, the statements of income 
subsequent to 1991 do not include any provision or benefit for corporate 
income taxes. Periodic distributions are made to the Company's stockholders 
to enable them to pay the income taxes applicable to the Company's income 
reportable on their individual income tax returns. Cash distributions of 
$446,000 and $233,000 were made to the shareholders in 1993 and 1992, 
respectively, from additional paid-in capital.

As an S Corporation, the Company is liable for the tax associated with the 
recapture of prior years' LIFO benefits which is to be paid over a four-year 
period, which began with the year ended December 31, 1992. Income taxes 
payable related to this obligation was recorded in 1990 in connection with the 
acquisition of the Company by Gray Acquisition Co. and the original request to 
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to be treated as an S Corporation effective 
January 1, 1991. This election was not granted by the IRS. However, the 
Company filed a similar election effective January 1, 1992 for which no IRS 
permission was required. Because of the S election no other income taxes are 
reflected on the balance sheet at December 31, 1993.

The income tax benefit in 1991 consisted of the following:

Federal:
Current $ 27,000
Deferred 55,000
State:
Current 3,000
Deferred 29,000
-----------
$ 114,000
===========

The income tax benefit reconciles to the statutory combined federal and state 
income tax rates for the year ended December 31, 1991 as follows:

Benefit at statutory rate $ 189,000
Unprovided prepaid taxes related to 
inventory, depreciation and 
amortization adjustments due
to S election (173,500)
Unprovided deferred taxes related to 
inventory, accrued expenses, and 
LIFO reserve adjustments due to 
S election 85,500
Adjustment of prior period provision 24,000
Other (11,000)
-----------
$ 114,000
===========

Note 6. Subsequent Event

On January 27, 1994, the Company signed a letter of intent to sell 
substantially all assets of the Company to Momentum Corporation. Momentum 
will assume all liabilities including existing leases, but excluding the 
revolving credit facility which shall be retained and discharged by the 
Company from sale proceeds.
