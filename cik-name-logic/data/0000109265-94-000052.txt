ZENITH ELECTRONICS CORPORATION

FIRST-HALF 1994 REPORT

Message to Stockholders

While we still have a lot of work to do, we are pleased to report that we 
have made substantial progress in the first half of 1994 as we narrowed 
our losses by $26 million.
For the first six months, Zenith reported a net loss of $20.3 million, 
or 51 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $46.5 million, or $1.51 
per share, in the first half of 1993. For the second quarter, results 
improved by $16 million to a net loss of $8.4 million, or 20 cents per 
share, in 1994 from a net loss of $24.7 million, or 79 cents per share, 
in 1993. First-quarter results improved by $10 million to a net loss of 
$11.9 million, or 32 cents per share, in 1994 from a net loss of $21.8 
million, or 72 cents per share, last year.
Contributing to the improved first-half results were higher sales in 
Zenith's core business, lower costs resulting largely from new re-engineering 
programs and a substantial reduction in losses from non-core business areas 
that have been sold or downsized.
Cost reductions achieved in the first half were on plan as we continued 
to implement major re-engineering actions in the core Consumer Electronics 
and Network Systems business. These actions should benefit the second half 
of the year as well.
First-half sales were $596 million in 1994 and $565 million in 1993. 
Second-quarter sales were $299 million in 1994, up from $275 million 
in 1993, and first-quarter sales were $297 million in 1994 and $290 
million in 1993.
Sales for the core Consumer Electronics and Network Systems business 
increased by $71 million in the first half, even after absorbing $20 million 
of lower consumer electronics selling prices from the same period a year 
ago. Non-core business revenues declined by $40 million in the first six 
months of 1994.
Driving the increase in Consumer Electronics sales were higher Zenith 
color TV unit sales to dealers compared with the year-earlier period, 
reflecting the excellent acceptance of our new color TV line, the growing
strength of the Zenith brand name and increased industry sales.
As we continue to de-emphasize the poor-performing non-core business 
areas, we completed the sale of our switch mode power supply magnetics 
business. Non-core business areas represented less than 3 percent of 
first-half 1994 revenues, versus about 10 percent a year earlier.
We completed the sale of the 1.7-million-square-foot Springfield, Mo., 
plant in the second quarter. That brings the amount of plant and office 
space sold in the first half to 2.6 million square feet. Another 500,000-
square-foot building is under contract for sale. The completed transactions 
did not have a material effect on earnings.
Financing activities continued in the first half. Investors purchased 
senior convertible subordinated debentures in a private placement and, 
pursuant to shelf offerings, purchased common stock on the open market. 
And, we extended through June 1996 our $90 million revolving credit 
agreement, which was to expire at year-end 1994. Short-term debt of $49 
million at the end of the first half (compared with $46 million a year 
earlier) financed increased receivables and planned higher inventory levels 
to support seasonal demand in the second half.
As we said at the annual meeting, we are setting the stage for what we 
believe will be significant improvement for full-year 1994. First-half 
performance improvements are a good indication of the direction that we 
are headed as we enter the traditionally stronger second half of the 
year.

Annual Meeting Report

As difficult as 1993 was for Zenith, the company "made progress and set the 
stage for what we believe can be significant improvement in 1994," Chairman 
Jerry Pearlman told stockholders at the April 26 annual stockholders meeting. 
He discussed results for 1993 and the first quarter of 1994 and looked ahead, 
saying, "Momentum is building for Zenith as we refocus and re-engineer our 
core business, Consumer Electronics and Network Systems products."
After the formal business of the annual meeting, Mr. Pearlman answered 
questions from stockholders. A summary follows:

HDTV. Several stockholders asked about high-definition television (HDTV). 
Mr. Pearlman said HDTV will be the next significant evolution of the TV 
industry, "as dramatic as the change from black-and-white to color TV."
The chairman said that the Digital HDTV Grand Alliance system, to which 
Zenith is making major technical contributions, "is significantly ahead of 
the rest of the world with all-digital technology." The Grand Alliance hopes 
that a "fair amount of our technology will be used in HDTV systems in other 
parts of the world," he said.
He explained the timetable for HDTV tests and the launch: "Zenith's 
VSB transmission subsystem is being field tested beginning in April. The 
full Grand Alliance HDTV system will be laboratory-tested in the fourth 
quarter. More field tests and standard adoption by the FCC are expected in 
1995. The first HDTV broadcasts should be launched in the second half of 1996."
In response to another HDTV question, Mr. Pearlman said digital VCRs 
(with future use for HDTV) should be available in the industry as early as 
next year. Camcorders will take the longest; it's a question of reducing the 
cost of technology to capture images in HDTV resolution.

Mexico operations. Several people asked questions about Zenith operations 
in Mexico. On environmental and safety issues, the chairman said Zenith 
is proud of its plants in Mexico and that the company works to "meet and 
beat EPA and OSHA standards in Zenith plants wherever they are." In addition, 
while Zenith isn't a major chemical user, chemicals are labeled in Spanish 
and training has been increased regarding proper handling of chemicals. 
On re-engineering in Mexico, he cited "a very substantial amount of 
change" underway at plants in Mexico. "We're blending productivity and 
efficiency with improved safety and operating conditions." He discussed 
new equipment and processes in Juarez and Matamoros as examples.

Consumer Electronics. In response to a question about Zenith's main business, 
color television, Mr. Pearlman said, "While we operate in a very difficult 
environment, we are very optimistic about the business. Zenith has a superior
price position, earned with superior products and superior quality." 
Responding to a question about how that relates to employment levels at 
Zenith, the chairman said, "The nature of technology change and the competitive 
nature of the industry means that every manufacturer is always finding new 
ways to reduce costs. The TVs in the industry today use many fewer parts 
versus 10-15 years ago, and that means fewer people are required to assemble
them.
"It's an industry-wide reality, however, that while technology and 
efficiency reduce employment, volume growth increases employment," Mr. 
Pearlman said. "New technologies such as HDTV as well as expanded sales 
both in the U.S. and in Latin American should be positive for Zenith."

International sales. Asked if Zenith has plans to expand its sales beyond 
North America, Mr. Pearlman explained that Zenith's consumer electronics 
focus is on the Americas. Central and South America "represent new business 
opportunities to expand our sales volume." Excluding Mexico, the Latin 
American TV market is approaching 10 million TV units annually - almost 40 
percent of the size of the U.S. market. "We are aggressively pursuing the 
Mexican and Latin American markets. We are rolling out new products in 
Argentina and Brazil."

Network Systems. "We have refocused our product line and internal 
organization," the chairman said in response to a question about Zenith's 
plans in the Network Systems (cable and data communications products) area. 
"We believe that we are very well positioned in the business today with 
our analog boxes and digital features, and tomorrow, thanks to our HDTV 
work and technical skills, in digital boxes.
"This is a core business that can make a real long-term contribution to 
Zenith as the digital TVs and cable boxes of the future merge," Mr. Pearlman 
said. He told stockholders that the industry opportunities are very large - 
potentially tens of millions of boxes in the next 10 years. "We are actively 
seeking licensees for our digital transmission technology to help establish 
it as an industry standard. If successful, it will mean a nice stream of 
royalties paid to Zenith."
Another stockholder asked about Zenith's computer modem technology that 
should be attractive to cable operators who want to deliver data to home 
computers on cable. "We are enthusiastic about this product, which is 
rolling out this summer." 

Stockholder Actions

Stockholders elected 10 individuals to one-year terms on the board of 
directors at the annual meeting. 
A new director elected was Ilene S. Gordon, vice president of operations 
for Houston-based Tenneco Inc. Ms. Gordon, 40, brings to Zenith excellent 
qualifications in total quality management (TQM), line management and 
strategic planning. Most recently, she was senior vice president of 
TQM/Corporate Development at Packaging Corp. of America, a Tenneco subsidiary.
The nine directors re-elected were: Harry G. Beckner, management 
consultant and retired chief operating officer, H.E. Butt Grocery Company; 
T. Kimball Brooker, president, Barbara Oil Company; David H. Cohen, provost, 
Northwestern University; Charles Marshall, retired vice chairman of the board, 
AT&T; Gerald M. McCarthy, Zenith executive vice president, sales and marketing, 
and president, Zenith Sales Company division; Andrew McNally IV, chairman 
and chief executive officer, Rand McNally & Company; Albin F. Moschner, 
Zenith president and chief operating officer; Jerry K. Pearlman, Zenith 
chairman and chief executive officer; and Peter S. Willmott, chairman of 
the board, MacFrugal's Bargains Close-Outs Inc., and chairman and chief 
executive officer, Willmott Services Inc. 
Stockholders also ratified the selection of Arthur Andersen & Co. as the 
company's independent auditors for 1994, and defeated a stockholder proposal 
on cumulative voting.

Broad New Color TV Line Introduced

Continuing its sweeping product enhancements, Zenith has introduced its 
1994-95 color television line - including the industry's first TVs with 
built-in capability to receive the unique "StarSight" interactive electronic 
program guide. Announced in the second quarter, the new line offers a host of 
new, easy-to-use features at every price point.
Advanced Video Imaging (AVI), Zenith's brilliant new picture technology 
introduced last year and enhanced this year, brings to the line the richest, 
sharpest, most vivid picture ever to wear the Zenith logo. Features include a 
new set of on-screen menus using easily-identifiable icons and a new 
Advanced Multiple Picture-in-Picture system.
Zenith's goal has been to combine its best picture in TV with high styling, 
strong audio and more of the features that buyers want. The new 60-model 
line includes direct-view models from 9 to 35 inches, rear-projection home 
theater models with 46-, 52- and 60-inch screens. (Built-in Dolby Pro-Logic 
surround sound is included in selected home theater models for the first 
time.) One 13-inch and two 19-inch combination TV-VCRs round out the line.

Major New Set-Top Box Alliance Formed 

In a major new alliance designed to expand Zenith's business opportunities in 
set-top decoders, the company joined forces in mid-May with Philips Consumer 
Electronics Company and Compression Labs Inc. (CLI). The companies agreed to 
combine their complementary technologies, product development, and marketing 
capabilities to design and manufacture digital video-on-demand and hybrid 
digital/analog set-top terminals. 
The Zenith-Philips-CLI "Media Access" products will allow cable operators 
to operate with both digital and analog technology through open-architecture,
consumer-oriented decoders, and, for the first time, access a common integrated 
network management and security system. The new jointly developed Media 
Access family of products will allow cable operators to provide a wide range 
of programming, such as video-on-demand, video games, home shopping and 
other video services.
Zenith's collaboration with Philips and CLI comes as leading cable 
operators, telephone companies and other network providers are selecting 
the products they will deploy for revolutionary interactive entertainment 
and information services. The launch of Media Access products also comes at 
a time when Zenith and other consumer electronics manufacturers are preparing 
for the ultimate migration of the features of set-top decoders into future 
digital television sets and VCRs. This is of special interest to cable 
operators seeking to reduce their long-term investments in hardware. As 
digital building blocks of these set-top decoders are incorporated into 
future HDTV sets, the decoders are expected to become less expensive, 
smaller "set-back" boxes.
Network providers will benefit from the combination of the robust 16-level 
Vestigial Sideband (16-VSB) transmission system and real-time two-way 
technology from Zenith with MPEG-2 (Moving Picture Experts Group) world-
standard digital decoder technology from Philips and CLI. VSB and MPEG 
are key features of the Digital HDTV Grand Alliance high-definition 
television system expected to be adopted next year as the U.S. HDTV 
broadcast standard by the Federal Communications Commission.

Watch Us

Dovetailing with the nationwide launch of the unique interactive on-screen 
program guide provided by StarSight Telecast Inc., Zenith is offering 
the first color TV sets with built-in circuitry to receive the service.
Zenith plans to begin rolling out StarSight capability in eight all-new 
top-of-the-line models in Zenith's popular AVI line in July. These sets - two 
27-, two 32- and two 35-inch direct-view models, plus 52- and 60-inch home 
theater rear-projection models - are expected to further strengthen Zenith's 
position in the large-screen color TV market.
Consumer benefits of the new StarSight feature include instant TV listing 
information at the touch of a button; seven days of updated program schedule 
information; a simple guide for direct tuning by title, theme and channel 
number; and easy one-button VCR recording of selected programs.
