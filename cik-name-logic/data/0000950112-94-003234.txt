Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On December 7, 1994, Petroleum Heat and Power Co., Inc. (the "Company")
completed the acquisition of Star Gas Corporation ("Star"). The transaction was
effected pursuant to an option granted to the Company in December 1993 when
Petro invested $16 million in Star.

To complete the transaction the Company paid $3.8 million in cash and
issued approximately 2.5 million shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock.
Pursuant to rights granted in December 1993, the recipients of the Class A
Common Stock will have certain "piggyback" and demand rights with respect to the
registration of the Class A Common Stock under the Securities Act of 1933.

In addition to the consideration described above, pursuant to the option,
the Company granted to First Reserve Corp., one of Star's investors, options to
purchase approximately 0.7 million shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock
exercisable through December 31, 1999, at $10.14 per share, in exchange for
certain options First Reserve Corp. held to acquire equity of Star.

In connection with the acquisiton, the Company and The Prudential Insurance
Company of America, entered into an Agreement (a copy of which is annexed hereto
as Exhibit I)wherein Prudential granted to the Company an option, exercisable
through May 31, 1995, to repurchase 1,521,316 shares, together with certain
notes of the Company in the aggregate principal amount of $63.7 million (the
"Prudential Notes") and 82,641 shares of Star's 12.625% Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $87.3 million less all
principal payments made with respect to the Prudential Notes after December 1,
1994 and plus (i) any accrued and unpaid dividends after December 1, 1994 on the
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and (ii) an amount as will provide
Prudential a yield of 12.625% per annum compounded semiannually from December 7,
1994, on the $13.5 million it exchanged for the Petro Shares but less any
dividends paid on the Petro Shares from the date hereof. Further, Prudential
has agreed that if the Company fails to exercise its right to purchase the Petro
Shares, the Petro Notes and the Redeemable Preferred Stock, the Company shall
have a right of first offer with respect to the Petro Shares.

Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors and Shareholders of
Star Gas Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Star Gas
Corporation and subsidiaries as of September 30, 1993 and 1994 and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity (deficiency), and
cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits. The consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity and
cash flows for the year ended September 30, 1992 was audited by other auditors
whose report dated December 3, 1992, except for note 5(e) as to which the date
was April 1, 1993, expressed an unqualified opinion.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Star Gas Corporation
and subsidiaries at September 30, 1993 and 1994 and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Star Gas
Corporation adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, in 1994.

STAR GAS CORPORATION
AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1) Organization and Business

Star Gas Corporation (the "Company"), a Delaware Corporation, sells and
distributes propane gas and related appliances to retail and wholesale
customers located principally in the Midwest, Northeast and Southeast (see
note 10) sections of the United States. As of September 30, 1994, on an
as-if-converted basis (see note 2), the Company was owned by Petroleum
Heat and Power Co., Inc. ("Petro") (33.3%), Star Gas Holdings ("Holdings")
(18.6%), the Prudential Insurance Company of America ("Prudential")
(33.4%) and a group of limited partnerships managed by First Reserve
Corporation (the partnerships are hereinafter collectively referred to as
"FRC") (14.7%). In December 1993, the Company was recapitalized (see note
2). Prior to the recapitalization, the Company was owned by Star Energy
Inc. (45%) and by FRC (55%), collectively hereinafter referred to as the
"Prior Shareholders". In connection with the recapitalization, all shares
held by Star Energy Inc. were acquired by FRC.

In December 1993, the Company entered into, and is currently being managed
under, a Management Services Agreement with Petro which provides for an
annual cash fee to Petro of $500,000 and an annual bonus equal to 5% of
the increase in the Company's cash flow, as defined, over the fiscal year
ended September 30, 1993. The bonus is payable in Class A Common Stock of
the Company pursuant to a formula set forth in the Management Services
Agreement. For the year ended September 30, 1994, the value of this bonus
approximated $69,000. The Company also reimburses Petro for expenses and
costs associated with certain Petro personnel. In November 1994, Petro
announced its intention to exercise its options to purchase certain shares
of Common Stock and Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock owned by FRC
and Prudential. If these options are exercised, Petro's ownership of Star
will increase to approximately 80%.

In December 1993, the Company, in an effort to improve profitability and
to concentrate on its core business, sold one of its wholly owned
subsidiaries, Federal Petroleum Company ("Federal") and initiated
discussions to sell another wholly owned subsidiary, Highway Pipeline
Trucking Company ("Highway"). For the sale of Federal, the Company
received $1,650,000 in cash and an 8% interest bearing note in the amount
of $500,000. The note is due in 48 monthly installments commencing on
November 1, 1994 and ending on October 1, 1998. At September 30, 1993,
the Company adjusted the carrying value and the net assets of Federal to
equal the then expected sale price of $2,150,000. In July 1994, the
Company sold Highway for $4.1 million in cash. At September 30, 1993, the
Company had adjusted the carrying value of the net assets of Highway to be
sold to $5,228,128, its estimated value at that date. In September 1994,
the Company sold one of its retail propane operations for approximately
$650,000, net of expenses.

Prior to the recapitalization (see note 2), the Company purchased, in
September 1989, 15.12 shares of common stock owned by a former officer
for a 10% Junior Subordinated

Promissory Note in the amount of $2,187,916 (see note 5). These shares
were held in treasury at September 30, 1993, and were retired as part of
the recapitalization. In September 1991, the Company sold 30.60 shares of
Common Stock and 5,126.10 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to the prior
Shareholders for $4,873,900 and $5,126,100 respectively, the proceeds of
which were received in fiscal 1992. In August 1992, the Company sold
10.69 shares of common stock to the Prior Shareholders for $2,000,000. In
March 1993, the Prior Shareholders agreed to exchange $1,420,000 of long-
term liabilities acquired from a third party (see note 5) in consideration
of 1,420 shares of newly issued 8% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock.

(2) Recapitalization

During September 1994, the Company effected a reverse stock split of its
newly authorized and issued common stock wherein each share became .001
share. All newly authorized and issued shares of common stock presented
in the financial statements and notes, give effect to the reverse stock
split.

In December 1993, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation and
authorized three new classes of common Stock, par value $.10 - Class A
(30,000 shares), Class B (5,000 shares) and Class C (3,000 shares), each
with identical rights and preferences, except that Class A has one vote
per share, Class B is nonvoting and Class C has 10 votes per share. The
Company also authorized 3,000,000 shares of new $1.00 par value preferred
stock to be issued in one or more series as the Board of Directors may
determine. The Board is also authorized to fix and determine the
designation and relative rights and preferences of each such series. Two
new classes of preferred stock were then created by the Board - an 8%
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock [Series A (530,000 shares), Series
B (300,000 shares), Series C (160,000 shares), Series D (500,000 shares)
and Series E (10,000 shares)] and a 12.625% Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock [Series A (30,000 shares) and Series B (120,000 shares)].

All dividends on the Series A, B, D and E 8% Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock and on the Series A and B 12.625% Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock are payable in additional shares of the same preferred
stock series. The holders of the Series C 8% Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock have the option, upon delivering proper notice, to be paid
in cash or in additional shares of Series C 8% Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock.

December 21, 1993, the required number of shares of Series D 8% Cumulative
Convertible Preferred stock from Prudential. In addition, the Company has
an option, which expires on December 31, 1995, to repurchase the balance
of the Series D shares at the same formula price. In December 1993, the
Company sold Federal for a net price of $2.1 million, consisting of $1.6
million in cash and a $500,000 note. The cash from the Federal sale was
used to repurchase 16,285 shares of the Series D 8% Cumulative Preferred

price of $4.1 million in cash. The proceeds of that sale were used to
repurchase 40,026 shares of Series D 8% Cumulative Convertible Preferred
Stock from Prudential.

As the Company redeems shares of its Series D 8% Cumulative Convertible
Preferred Stock, FRC has agreed to return, as a contribution to the
capital of the Company, a number of shares of Class A Common Stock of the
Company owned by FRC, determined by multiplying 48.569 by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the face value of the Series D 8% Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock redeemed and the denominator of which is a
total of $10 million. In connection with the Federal and Highway sales,
FRC contributed 27.877 shares of Class A Common Stock back to the Company.

(3) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market following the moving
weighted average method, which approximates first-in, first-out cost. The
components of inventory were as follows at the dates indicated:

September 30,
----------------------
1993 1994
---- ----

Propane gas $ 4,982,284 $ 2,936,331
Appliances and equipment 1,463,009 1,841,676
----------- -----------

$ 6,445,293 $ 4,778,007
=========== ============

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed over
the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets (generally thirty
years for buildings and five to thirty years for equipment) using the
straight-line method.

Intangible Assets

Beginning in October 1992, the excess of cost over the fair value of net
assets acquired is being amortized using the straight-line method over 10
years. Prior to October 1992, such assets were being amortized over 40
years. The effect of the change in 1993 was to increase amortization
expense by $1,160,000. Other intangible assets, principally covenants not
to compete, capitalized consulting costs and customer lists are being
amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from one to ten
years. Deferred charges, representing costs associated with the issuance
of the Company's debt, are being amortized over the lives of the related
debt.

STAR GAS CORPORATION

The Company assesses the recoverability of intangible assets by comparing
the carrying values of such intangibles to market values, where a market
exists, supplemented by cash flow analyses to determine that the carrying
values are recoverable over the remaining estimated lives of the
intangibles through undiscounted future operating cash flows. Where an
intangible asset is deemed to be impaired, the amount of intangible
impairment is measured based on market values, as available, or by
projected cash flows.

Customer Credit Balances

Customer credit balances represent pre-payments received from customers
pursuant to a budget payment plan (whereby customers pay their estimated
annual propane gas charges on a fixed monthly basis) in excess of actual
deliveries billed.

Cash Equivalents

For the purpose of determining cash equivalents used in the preparation of
the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Company considers all
highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less, when
purchased, to be cash equivalents.

Income Taxes

The Company files a consolidated Federal income tax return with its
subsidiaries. Deferred income taxes are provided to reflect the tax
effects of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting.
Effective October 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS No.
109). (see note 6).

Basis of Presentation

Certain reclassifications have been made to the 1992 and 1993 financial
statements to conform to the 1994 presentation.

(4) Acquisitions

The Company expanded its operations in the retail propane gas business by
making several acquisitions during the fiscal years ended September 30,
1992, 1993 and 1994. The consideration for these acquisitions was
approximately $1,207,000, $61,000, and

(Continued)

(4) (Continued)

$760,000, respectively. The acquisitions were accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting and the purchase prices have been allocated
to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their respective fair
market values on the dates of acquisition. The purchase prices in excess
of the fair values of net assets acquired were classified as intangibles
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The results of operations of the
respective acquired companies have been included in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations from the dates of acquisition.

December 21, 1993, the Company may borrow up to $20 million to finance
working capital needs under a revolving credit facility which expires
on June 30, 1996. Amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility
are subject to a 30 day clean up requirement each year. Interest on
borrowings is payable monthly and is based upon either the Eurodollar
Rate (as defined below) plus 2 1/4% or the Alternate Base Rate (as
defined below) plus 1/4%, at the Company's option.

The Eurodollar Rate is the prevailing rate in the Interbank Eurodollar
Market adjusted for reserve requirements, if any. At September 30, 1994,
this rate was 4.9%. The Alternate Base Rate is the higher of (i) the
prime or base rate of The First National Bank of Boston or (ii) the
Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2%. At September 30, 1994, the prime rate was
7.8% and the Federal Funds Rate was 5.0%.

As of September 30, 1993, and 1994, outstanding revolving credit loans
aggregated $6,808,704 and $4,000,000. In addition, as of September 30,
1993 and 1994, the credit facility provided $2,648,816 and $2,438,816 in
letters of credit, respectively.

The Credit Agreement also provides for a revolving credit acquisition
facility under which the Company may borrow up to $20 million to fund
acquisitions of propane companies. This acquisition facility expires on
June 30, 1996 and the Company has the option to convert this facility into
a term loan, payable in 36 consecutive monthly installments commencing on
July 1, 1996, the acquisition loan conversion date. Interest on the
borrowings is payable monthly and is based upon either the Eurodollar Rate
plus 2 1/2% on loans made before the acquisition loan conversion date and
plus 3% on loans made after the acquisition loan conversion date or the
Alternate Base Rate plus 1/2% on loans made before the acquisition loan
conversion date and plus 1% on loans made after the acquisition loan
conversion date, at the Company's option. As of September 30, 1994,
$700,000 was borrowed to fund an acquisition completed during fiscal 1994.

Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, as amended, the Company is
restricted as to the declaration and distribution of dividends and is also
required to maintain certain financial and operational ratios. The
amounts borrowed under the Credit Agreement are secured by certain assets
of the Company. The Company pays a commitment fee equal to 1/2% of the
unused portion of the bank facilities.

(b) On January 10, 1989, the Company issued $85,000,000 of notes (the
"Note Agreements") to Prudential for cash. The Note Agreements
consisted of $45,000,000 of 11.56% Senior Notes due in six
consecutive annual installments of $7,500,000 commencing January 10,
1994; $30,000,000 of 12.625% Senior Subordinated Participating
Notes, Series A, due in six consecutive annual installments of
$4,250,000 commencing January 10, 1995, with a final installment of
$4,500,000 due on January 10, 2001; and $10,000,000 of 12.625%
Senior Subordinated Participating Notes, Series B, due in six
consecutive annual installments of $1,500,000 commencing January 10,

The Series A and Series B Senior Subordinated Participating Notes bore
additional interest aggregating to the greater of (a) $487,500 or 2.5% of
the first $33,500,000 of the Company's operating profit (as defined) for
each of the fiscal years ended September 30, 1991 through 1999 and (b)
$622,400 or 3.19% of the first $33,500,000 of the Company's operating
profit (as defined) for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2000. This
participating interest feature on the Notes was eliminated in connection
with the recapitalization.

As part of the recapitalization (see note 2), the Company exchanged in
direct order of maturity, $15,000,000 of Series A 12.625% Senior
Subordinated Participating Notes for 150,000 shares of Series B 8%
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, the entire $10,000,000 of Series B
12.625% Senior Subordinated Participating Notes for 100,000 shares of
Series D 8% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, and in inverse order
of maturity, $1,500,000 of Series A 12.625% Senior Subordinated
Participating Notes for 15,000 shares of Series A 12.625% Cumulative
Redeemable Preferred Stock and $6,000,000 of Series A 12.625% Senior
Subordinated Participating Notes for 60,000 shares of Series B 12.625%
Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock.

Additionally, the Company was also allowed to prepay $14,325,000 of the
11.56% Senior Notes in direct order of their maturity. The remaining
1995 payment of $675,000 and part of the 1996 payment of $1,325,000 were
deferred such that the 1997, 1998 and 1999 payments were increased from
$7,500,000 per year to $8,166,667 per year.

Under the terms of the Note Agreements, as amended at various dates, the
Company is restricted as to the declaration and distribution of dividends
and is also required to maintain certain financial and operational ratios.
The amounts borrowed under the 11.56% Senior Notes and the 12.625% Senior
Subordinated Participating Notes are secured by substantially all of the
Company's assets.

(c) On February 28, 1991, the Company issued $20,000,000 in Senior Reset
Term Notes (the "Notes") to Prudential for cash. The Notes were due
in semi-annual installments of $2,500,000 which were to commence

28, 2000 and February 28, 2001, respectively and $2,500,000 on August 28,
2001.

Interest on the notes was based on the Treasury rate in effect on the
issuance date, which under the terms of the note agreement, was scheduled
to be adjusted to the then current Treasury rate on the "Reset Date",
February 28, 1994. Prior to the recapitalization, the rate was based on
the 2.25 year Treasury rate plus 3.75%. In connection with the
recapitalization, the notes were amended such that the interest rate
became the 6.5 year Treasury rate plus 3.30%. On February 28, 1994, the
notes were reset and the rate was reduced from 10.72% to 9.11%.

Under the terms of the Notes, as amended, the Company is restricted as to
the declaration and distribution of dividends and is also required to
maintain certain financial and operational ratios. The amounts borrowed
under the Notes are secured by substantially all of the Company's assets.

(d) In March 1991, the Company entered into a Term Loan Agreement (the
"Term Loan") with PruSupply, Inc. which provided a $20,000,000
facility. The Company amended the Term Loan at various dates such
that the Term Loan was to be repaid in nineteen consecutive quarterly
installments of $875,000, which commenced in May 1991, with a final
payment of $3,375,000 due at maturity in February 1996. The Term
Loan bears interest at the one month London Interbank Offered Rate
("LIBOR") plus 2.7%.

As part of the recapitalization, the Term Loan was amended to allow for the
prepayment of $1,925,000 on December 23, 1993. In addition, the Company
paid $875,000 that had been deferred. This agreement was further amended
such that the remaining required payments on these notes will be $4,325,000
in 1996 and $5,000,000 in 1997.

Under the terms of the Term Loan, as amended, the Company is restricted as
to the declaration and distribution of dividends and is also required to
maintain certain financial and operational ratios. The amounts outstanding
under the Term Loan are secured by substantially all of the Company's
assets.

(e) In connection with certain acquisitions, the Company was required to
pay, over a several year period, an aggregate of $6,287,259 as of
September 30, 1993, and $1,440,610 as of September 30, 1994, pursuant
to certain covenant not-to-compete agreements and consulting
payments. In addition, the Company had obligations of $1,333,920 at
September 30, 1993 and $737,686 at September 30, 1994 of notes
payable to former owners.

In December 1992, the Prior Shareholders purchased from a third party the
Company's obligation to pay $5,500,000 of consulting and non-competition
payments due in equal installments of $2,750,000 in November 1992 and
November 1993. The November 1992 payment was initially deferred until June
1993, however, in March 1993, $1,420,000 of this payment was exchanged for
1,420 shares of newly issued 8% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares of
the Company. The balance of the June 1993 payment, $4,080,000, was
deferred. In December 1993, as part of the recapitalization (see note 2),
the Company exchanged the 1,420 shares of newly issued 8% Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Shares and the $4,080,000 deferred amount (the
balance of the purchased payments) plus accrued interest, for 5,000 shares
of Series E 8% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock and 230.895 shares of
Class A Common Stock.

As of September 30, 1994, the annual maturities of long-term debt, borrowings
under the revolving credit agreement and the acquisition loan are set forth in
the following table:

1995 $ 4,766,063

Statements of Operations consists of the components set forth below:

=========== ========== =========

A federal income tax benefit was recorded in 1992 as a result of reversing
previously recorded federal deferred income tax liabilities. No federal
income tax benefits were recorded as a result of the losses for 1993 or
1994. State tax expense was recorded each year in jurisdictions where the
Company had to pay taxes and where net operating loss carryforwards or
carrybacks are not recognized.

Effective October 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS No.
109"). This statement requires that deferred income taxes be recorded
following the liability method of accounting and adjusted periodically when
income tax rates change. Adoption of the new Statement did not have any
significant effect on the Company's financial condition or results of
operations, since the Company did not carry any material deferred income
tax accounts on its balance sheet at September 30, 1993 and any net
deferred tax assets set up as a result of applying SFAS No. 109 have been
fully reserved.

Under SFAS No. 109, as of October 1, 1993, the Company had total deferred
tax assets of approximately $35.8 million subject to a valuation allowance
of approximately $10.6 million. With the recapitalization in December 1993
(see note 2), the Company's NOL's were limited for purposes of general
carryforward availability and otherwise limited for specified carryforward
purposes since the recapitalization constituted a change in control for
income tax reporting purposes. The Company believes that it has sufficient
tax strategies available that will enable it to utilize most of its NOL
carryforwards.

Net deferred tax liability $ (221,400) $ (15,300) $ (236,700)
============ ============ ============
</TABLE>

A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that
some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company
has determined, based on the Company's recent history of annual net losses
and the tax strategies available, that at September 30, 1994, a valuation
allowance of $11.4 million is appropriate.

At September 30, 1994, the Company had approximately $92.5 million of
Federal net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards available to offset future
taxable income. Such NOL's expire in the years 2004 through 2009.

(7) Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has a 401(k) plan which provides benefits for all eligible
non-union employees. Subject to IRS limitations, the 401(k) plan provides
for each employee to contribute from 1% to 15% of compensation with the
Company contributing a matching amount of each employee's contribution up
to a maximum of 3% of compensation. Aggregate Company contributions made
to the 401(k) plan during fiscal 1992, 1993, and 1994 were $537,703,
$313,652, and $312,925 respectively.

The Company also makes monthly contributions on behalf of its union
employees to a union sponsored defined benefit pension plan. The amount
charged to expense was $202,545, $198,206, and $207,107 in fiscal 1992,
1993 and 1994, respectively.

(8) Lease Commitments

The Company has entered into noncancellable capital lease agreements with
former owners of acquired businesses for certain premises and related
equipment. These leases contain bargain purchase options, exercisable on
the lease termination dates. Amortization of premises and equipment under
capital leases is included in depreciation expense. The Company has also
entered into operating leases for office space, trucks and other
equipment.

The future minimum rental commitments at September 30, 1994 under leases
having an initial or remaining noncancellable term of one year or more are
as follows:

Capital Operating
Leases Leases
------- ---------

1995 $157,476 $1,200,000
1996 138,351 800,000

(9) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

During fiscal 1993, in connection with the recapitalization (see note 2),
and the impending sales of Federal and Highway (see note 1), the Company
reviewed the carrying values of its long-lived assets and identifiable
intangible assets for possible impairment. The Company determined, based
on expected future cash flows and the estimated fair values of certain
operations, that it would not be able to recover the carrying values of
some of these assets. Accordingly, as of September 30, 1993, the Company
recorded a write-off of approximately $33 million representing the
estimated impairment to its long-lived assets.

(10) Subsequent Events

On November 17, 1994, in an effort to focus on its core profitable
business, the Company sold all of its retail propane operations located in
the Southeast portion of the United States for $13,250,000 in cash. The
consideration received from the sale approximates the net book value of
the assets sold and therefore, no material gain or loss was recognized.

The Company applied a portion of the proceeds from the sale to reduce
outstanding principal and accrued interest on its 11.56% Senior Notes and
Term Loan in the amount of $3,382,539 and $602,310, respectively. In
addition, the Company redeemed the remaining outstanding shares of the
Series D 8% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock from Prudential
amounting to $5,091,011. As a result of the redemption, FRC has agreed to
return 20.693 shares of Common stock (see note 2) held by them, as a
contribution to the capital of the Company. The remainder of the proceeds
were used by the Company for general operating purposes.
