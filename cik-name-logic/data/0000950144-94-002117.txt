Introduction

The Seller is the Chairman of the Board and a Director of Patten

<PAGE> 5

(a) The Seller is the lawful, record and beneficial owner of
the Shares, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, charges, claims, or
restrictions on transfer, other than restrictions on transfer under applicable
federal and state securities laws. Seller has, and at the Closing will have,
good and marketable and unencumbered title to the Shares and full right, power
and authority to enter into this Agreement and to sell, transfer, assign and
deliver such Shares to the Purchaser as herein agreed. Each Purchaser will, on
transfer of the Shares to be acquired by such Purchaser at the Closing, acquire
good and marketable title to such Shares, free and clear of all liens,
encumbrances, charges, claims, or restrictions on transfer, other than
restrictions on transfer under applicable federal and state securities laws.

(b) The Shares constitute all of the shares of Common Stock
owned beneficially or of record by the Seller, except for shares which are held
in the Seller's 401k account and for shares issuable upon conversion of the
Company's 8 1/4% convertible subordinated debentures due 2012 held by the
Seller.

(c) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Seller and is the valid and binding obligation of the Seller, enforceable
against the Seller in accordance with its terms.

(d) The Seller, as Chairman of the Board and a Director of the
Company and a member of its investment committee, has full knowledge of all
material facts concerning the Company and its business, operations, conditions
and prospects.

5. Representations and Warranties by Each Purchaser. Each Purchaser
(on behalf of itself and not on behalf of any other Purchaser) hereby
represents and warrants to the Seller that each of the statements contained in
this section 5 is true and correct as of the date hereof, and will be true and
correct at and as of the date of Closing:

(a) Such Purchaser is acquiring the Shares to be acquired by
him for his own account for investment only and not with a view to, or for sale
in connection with, any distribution of such Shares within the meaning of or in
violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), any rule or
regulation under the Act, or any state securities laws.

(b) Such Purchaser is an "accredited investor" as defined in
Regulation D promulgated under the Act and has sufficient familiarity with the
business and affairs of the Company to be able to evaluate the merits and risks
of his investment in the Company through the purchase of the Shares to be
acquired by him. Such Purchaser has had the opportunity to ask questions of
and receive answers from management of the Company concerning his acquisition
of such Shares, and to obtain any additional information, documents, contracts,
records and books relative to the Company, its business, assets, financial
condition, results of operation, liabilities (contingent or otherwise), and his
investment in the Company through the purchase of such Shares. Such Purchaser
has sufficient experience in business, financial and investment matters to be
able to evaluate the merits and risks involved in the acquisition of the Shares
to be acquired by him and to make an informed investment decision with respect
to such acquisition.

2
<PAGE> 6

Such Purchaser can afford a complete loss of the value of such Shares and is
able to bear the economic risk of holding such Shares for an indefinite period.

(c) Such Purchaser understands that (i) the Shares to be
acquired by him have not been registered under the Act, the Seller is an
"affiliate" of the Company and the Share are therefore "restricted securities"
within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Act; (ii) such Shares cannot be sold,
transferred or otherwise disposed of unless they are subsequently registered
under the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or an exemption
from registration is then available; (iii) in any event, the exemption from
registration under Rule 144 will not be available for at least two years and
even then will not be available unless the terms and conditions of Rule 144 are
complied with; and (iv) there is now no registration statement on file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission or any state securities commission with
respect to the Shares and the Company has no obligation to register the Shares
under the Act or any state securities laws. The Purchaser agrees, for the
benefit of the Seller and the Company, not to sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of the Shares except in compliance with the Act and all applicable
securities laws. The Purchaser understands that the Shares have not been, and
will not be, registered under the Act by reason of a specific exemption from
the registration provisions of the Act, the availability of which depends upon,
among other things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent of the
Purchaser and the accuracy of the Purchaser's representations contained herein.

(d) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
such Purchaser and is the valid and binding obligation of such Purchaser,
enforceable against such Purchaser in accordance with its terms.

(e) Each Purchaser hereby represents and warrants that (i) he
has made an independent decision to purchase the Shares and such investment
decision is not a product of or contingent on the investment decision of any
other Purchaser, (ii) he will hold the Shares for his sole benefit and at his
sole risk; (iii) he has not sought or accepted and has no intention of seeking
or accepting investment advice or direction from any other Purchaser on the
decision to buy, hold or sell the Shares; and (iv) he has no intention of
seeking or accepting advice or direction from any other Purchaser as to any
matters submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company. No Purchaser
shall have any fiduciary or similar obligation to any other Purchaser solely by
reason of being a party to this Agreement.

6. Contemporaneous Transactions. Contemporaneous with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, the Company and the Seller are effecting the
following transactions:

(a) The Seller is resigning from all of the offices he holds
with the Company and its subsidiaries, including, without limitation, as
Chairman of the Board and a Director of the Company and as a member of its
investment committee, and is delivering to the Company written resignations to
that effect.
