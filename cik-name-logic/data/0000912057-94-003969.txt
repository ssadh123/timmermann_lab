[ROCKEFELLER CENTER PROPERTIES, INC. - LETTERHEAD]

New York, N.Y. -- November 17, 1994 -- Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc.
(NYSE - RCP) announced today that it has signed a letter of intent under which
Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Whitehall Street Real Estate Limited Partnership V
would purchase from RCPI $225 million of long-term debt which will permit RCPI
to retire its commercial paper and reduce its interest rate swap exposure. The
transaction is expected to close by December 31, 1994.

"We are very pleased to have entered into this letter of intent," said Richard
M. Scarlata, President and Chief Executive Officer of RCPI. "The Board and
Management believe strongly that this transaction will meet our short-term
liquidity needs and strengthen our long-term position."

RCPI would also issue to Whitehall or other affiliates of Goldman Sachs warrants
and stock appreciation rights covering 19.9 percent of the outstanding shares
(assuming exercise of such warrants and rights) with an exercise price of $5 per
share. Goldman would have the right to appoint one director to the RCPI Board.

The Board of Directors adopted this course of action after an extensive
review -- with the advice of its financial advisors Kidder, Peabody & Co.
Incorporated -- of a range of financing alternatives and proposals.

The transaction is subject to execution of mutually acceptable documentation and
customary approvals and conditions.
