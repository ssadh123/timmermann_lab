On January 26, 1994 ADVANTA Corp. announced record earnings
for both the fourth quarter and full year 1993. For the quarter,
ADVANTA reported earnings per share of 56 cents and net income of
$23.0 million, increases of 30 percent and 55 percent,
respectively, over fourth quarter 1992. For the full year,
earnings per share totalled $1.95 before extraordinary item and
net income before extraordinary item was $77.9 million,
increasing 41 percent and 62 percent, respectively, over 1992.
At December 31, 1993, the Company's portfolio of managed
receivables increased by $1.5 billion or 42 percent compared to
December 31, 1992. Total managed credit card receivables
expanded by $575 million in the fourth quarter, bringing the
outstandings to $3.9 billion at year-end 1993, up 47 percent for
the year. Fourth quarter earnings per share incorporate an 18
percent increase in the number of common shares outstanding
versus the fourth quarter last year. Earnings per share for all
periods reflect the October 15, 1993 three-for-two stock split.

Highlights for the fourth quarter include the following items:

Continued strong receivable growth with each business
segment growing its average total managed receivables in
excess of 30 percent year-over-year. Average managed credit
card receivables for the quarter were up 47 percent from the
comparable year-ago period and 16 percent from the September
quarter;

The managed credit card charge-off rate fell to 2.9 percent
in the quarter from 4.2 percent in the year-earlier period
and 3.2 percent in the September quarter. The consolidated
managed charge-off rate declined from 3.2 percent in the
year-earlier period to 2.7 percent in the quarter, the same
as the September quarter;

The 30 plus day delinquency rate on managed credit cards
declined to 2.4 percent at December 31, down from 3.7
percent in the year-ago quarter and 2.8 percent in the
September quarter;

The managed net interest margin rose to 7.64 percent from
7.32 percent in the year-earlier period and compares to 8.05
percent in the September quarter;

Off-balance sheet reserves for mortgage servicing were
increased to reflect recent loan loss and prepayment
experience;

Disciplined cost management resulted in an operating expense
ratio of 3.94 percent in the fourth quarter, compared to
4.68 percent in the comparable year-ago period and 4.11
percent in the third quarter;

Return on equity of 27.6 percent for the quarter and 27.5
percent for the full year.
