The combined summaries of revenues and certain rental expenses reflect
the combined operations of The Shire Apartments, Lakewood Place Apartments,
River Place Apartments, and Lakeside North Apartments (the "properties") for
the year ended December 31, 1993 based upon the audited combined statements
of rental operations of the properties appearing elsewhere herein and for the
three month period ended March 31, 1994 based upon the unaudited combined
statements of rental operations of the properties through the date on which
they were acquired. During 1993 and a portion of 1994, the properties were
owned and operated by entities other than United Dominion Realty Trust (the
"Trust").
The summary has been prepared on the accrual method of accounting. 
Rental expenses include repair and maintenance expenses, utilities, real
estate taxes, insurance and certain other expenses. In accordance with the
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, mortgage interest
expenses, depreciation, and general and administrative costs have been
excluded from operating expenses, as they are dependent upon a particular
owner, purchase price or financial arrangement.

In assessing the properties, management considered the existing and
potential tenant base, expected job growth in the area, occupancy rates, the
competitive nature of the market and comparative rental rates. Furthermore,
current and anticipated maintenance and repair costs, real estate taxes and
anticipated capital improvements were assessed.
