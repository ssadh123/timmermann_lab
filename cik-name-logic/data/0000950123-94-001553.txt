ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On September 12, 1994, the registrant acquired all of the outstanding
capital stock of Industrial Retaining Ring Company, a New Jersey corporation,
and of Retainers, Inc., a New Jersey corporation and substantially all of the
assets of Industrial Advertising, a New Jersey general partnership
(collectively the "Business"). The aggregate purchase price of the Business
was $14,750,000.00, payable in cash. The Business consists of manufacturing of
retaining rings used in heavy equipment and industrial machinery. Registrant
acquired the Business from Vincent A. Stabile, individually and as trustee
under trust dated July 1, 1985, Antoinette D. Stabile, individually and as
trustee under trust dated July 1, 1985 and Madeline C. Stabile, individually
and as trustee under trust dated July 1, 1985. The Business is located at
Irvington, New Jersey. The acquired assets of the business consist of real
estate, machinery and equipment, inventories, receivables, intellectual
property rights and other intangibles. The registrant intends to use the
acquired assets in substantially the same manner as previously used by the
prior owners.

(c) No "Obligations," as hereinafter defined, of
Advertising existing on or before the Closing Date or arising as a result of

2. Purchase Price and Payment.

2.1 Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price to be paid by
Purchaser to the Shareholders for the Stock and to Advertising for the Acquired
Assets shall be the sum of (a) Fourteen Million Seven Hundred and Fifty
Thousand ($14,750,000.00) Dollars, and (b) an amount equal to the cash
surrender value on the Closing Date, less an amount equal to any charges which
would be imposed by the insurer upon cashing in the policies, of any life
insurance policies maintained by Retainers (the "Life Insurance Policies") on
the lives of the Shareholders (the "Purchase Price"). Shareholders acknowledge
as to each of them receipt of value for any interest they have or may have in
the Life Insurance Policies or the

3
<PAGE> 12
benefits thereof and in consideration thereof hereby waive, release and
renounce any claim they or any executor or administrator may have in any of the
Life Insurance Policies or the benefits thereof.

2.2 Payment of Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall be paid on
the Closing Date to the Sellers by wire transfer to an account or accounts, and
in allocations amongst accounts, designated in writing by Sellers.

2.3 Allocation, Section 338(h)(10) Election. The Purchase Price
shall be allocated as set out in an allocation schedule to be provided to
Seller by Purchaser within sixty (60) days of the Closing. Sellers and
Purchaser agree to file all returns and reports in respect of the transactions
herein contemplated, including but not limited to, all Federal and state tax
returns, in a manner consistent with such allocation. With respect to the
preceding, Sellers agree that Purchaser may exercise the election available
under section 338(h)(10) of the Code (the "Section 338 Election"), in
accordance with the applicable Treasury regulations. In the event Purchaser
makes the Section 338 Election, Purchaser agrees (a) to assume full
responsibility for any additional Federal or state corporate taxes payable by
IRR or Retainers as a result of such election, regardless of the tax period in
which such corporate taxes are deemed payable, and (b) to pay Shareholders, as
additional consideration for the Stock, the Shareholders' "Increased Tax
Liability," which term shall mean the

4
<PAGE> 13
full amount by which the Shareholders' Federal and state tax liability relating
to the sale of the Stock pursuant to Purchaser's Section 338 Election exceeds
the Shareholders' Federal and state tax liability that would have resulted from
the sale of the Stock in the event no such election were made by Purchaser,
increased by Federal and state taxes arising from the reimbursement of the
Increased Tax Liability to the Shareholders on a grossed-up basis. The
additional consideration due from Purchaser by reason of the Section 338
Election shall be due ten (10) days after receipt by Purchaser from
Shareholders' tax preparer of a written statement of the additional sum due,
which statement shall be binding on Purchaser in the absence of manifest error.
It is understood and agreed that the Purchaser shall indemnify and reimburse
the Shareholders for the full amount of the Increased Tax Liability. The
Purchaser's obligation to indemnify the Shareholders pursuant to this paragraph
shall not expire until expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
under Federal and state tax laws for the tax year of the Shareholders in which
the Increased Tax Liability is incurred.

Companies taken as a whole.

date of such 1993 Year-end Financials and (ii) the security interests, liens,
claims, restrictions, equities and encumbrances, if any, disclosed in such 1993
Year-end Financials or referred to in Schedule 4.7 hereto, or which are not
material in any one case or in the aggregate. Each of the Companies owns all
of the assets of its respective business, except for those assets leased by
either of the Companies pursuant to leases specifically referred to in Schedule
4.8 hereto.

4.8 List of Assets. Annexed hereto as Schedule 4.8 is a true and

of the Companies. The material tangible business property owned or leased by
the Companies and used in their respective businesses at the date hereof is in
good operating condition and repair, excluding ordinary wear and tear, except
as set out in Schedule 4.8 hereto. No properties or assets owned or leased by
the Companies and set out in Schedule 4.8 are subject to any judicial order,
ordinance or zoning restriction which materially adversely affects the use of
such properties in the respective businesses of the Companies. The value of
any leasehold improvement, machinery or equipment owned or leased by either of
the Companies has not been written up above original cost less depreciated or
amortized cost.

14
<PAGE> 23

the Companies is in violation of any law, regulation or order of any court or
any federal, state, municipal or other governmental department, commission,
bureau, agency, or instrumentality as it respects the business, properties,
operations and affairs of the Companies where the failure to comply therewith
would have a material adverse effect on the business and properties of the
Companies taken as a whole. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.9 hereto, there
are no actions, suits, proceedings, investigations or claims pending or, to the
Shareholders' knowledge, threatened against either or both of the Companies
with respect to the business, properties, operations, employment policies and
practices or the application thereof, assets or affairs of the Companies, at
law or in equity, before or by any federal, state, municipal or any other
governmental court, department, commission, agency or instrumentality, domestic

claim, suit, proceeding or investigation.

all fire and casualty, liability, key-man insurance, workmen's compensation

4.11 Taxes. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.11 hereto, IRR,
Retainers and Advertising have each filed all federal, state, county, and local
tax returns which are required to be filed up to and including the date hereof
and have each paid all taxes which have become due pursuant to such returns or
otherwise, or pursuant to any assessment which has become payable, and no
extension of the time for filing a federal, state, county or local tax return
is presently in effect. All such returns and the returns to be filed by the
Companies and Advertising with respect to any period ending on or before the
Closing Date are or will be true and correct, and all returns required to be
filed prior to the Closing Date will be timely filed or appropriately extended.
The subchapter S election of IRR under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and
its predecessor statutes is, and has been, in effect since the organization of
IRR. To the extent that any tax liability or assessment with respect to either
of the Companies has accrued but has not yet become payable as of June 30,
1994, or has been proposed for assessment or determined but remains unpaid as
of June 30, 1994, the same has been reflected as a liability on the books and
records and, in the case of IRR, on the IRR Stub Period Financials. No waiver
or extension of the statute of limitations relating to the assessment of any
state or federal income tax against any of the Companies or Advertising is
presently in effect. No notice of an audit as to

16
<PAGE> 25
any income, sales or other taxes has been received by the Companies from the
Internal Revenue Service or any state taxing authority nor is any audit by the
Internal Revenue Service or any state taxing authority in progress. All
payments for withholding taxes, unemployment insurance and other amounts

accounts receivable generated since June 30, 1994, arose in the ordinary course
of the respective businesses of the Companies and Advertising. All accounts
receivable of the Companies and Advertising have arisen from bona fide
transactions by the Companies and Advertising. None of such accounts
receivable reflects a sale on consignment or other contingent basis, is subject
to any defense, counterclaim or set-off or is in dispute.

(b) Since June 30, 1994, there has been no change in the
quantity, quality or condition of the inventory of the Companies, except as

17
<PAGE> 26
with past practice. All such inventory is in good condition or otherwise

charges or encumbrances of any nature whatsoever except (a) those described in
Schedule 4.13, (b) the lien of current state and local property taxes not in
default, and (c) such liens, encumbrances, easements, rights of way, building
and use restrictions, exceptions, reservations, and limitations as do not in

in the usual and

18
<PAGE> 27
normal conduct of its business.

4.14 Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights, Etc. (a) Schedule 4.14A

the Companies

19
<PAGE> 28
or Advertising has knowledge of any proceedings, pending or threatened,
challenging ownership by, or the right to use of, any of the Companies or
Advertising of any Intellectual Property owned by them or in which they have
rights to use, and the Shareholders have no knowledge of infringing use of any
Intellectual Properties owned by or licensed to the Companies or Advertising by
others. Shareholders have no knowledge of any facts which would invalidate any
of the Intellectual Property owned by or licensed to the Companies or
Advertising or the respective rights of the Companies or Advertising therein.
The Companies and Sellers have had no notice of or knowledge of a claim against
the Companies or Advertising that any of the Companies' or Advertising's
operations, activities, products, equipment, machinery or processes infringes
the patents, trademarks, service-marks, trade names, copyrights or other
property rights of others or that it is unfairly competing with or illegally
using the trade secrets or property rights of others.

4.15 Employee Agreements. (a) Except as described in Schedule
4.15A, none of the Companies or Advertising is a party to or bound by any oral
or written: (i) employee collective bargaining agreement, employment agreement

of the Companies or Advertising in connection with any aspect of the employment
arrangement of such employees with the Companies or Advertising.

(b) Schedule 4.15B contains: (i) a list of all of the

21
<PAGE> 30
assignments of, or arrangements with, or promotions and appointments of, any

(c) No "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3 of
the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA"), maintained by
IRR, as from time to time in effect (collectively, the "Benefit Plans",
individually, a "Benefit Plan") nor any trusts created thereunder, nor any
trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction", as
defined in Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which
could subject any Benefit Plan or any such trust, or any trustee or
administrator thereof, or any party dealing with any Benefit Plan, or any such
trust to the tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by said Section
4975. Neither any of the Benefit Plans nor any such trusts have been
terminated, nor has there been any "reportable event", as defined in Section
4043 of ERISA, or "accumulated funding deficiency", as defined in Section 302
of ERISA, or application for an extension of any amortization period within the
meaning of Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or any
predecessor statute, since the effective date of ERISA. All Internal Revenue
Service Form 5500s were accurate at the time of filing, have been filed on a
timely basis and, to Shareholders' knowledge, are not subject to any Internal
Revenue Service or Department of Labor penalties. All Pension

22
<PAGE> 31
Benefit Guaranty Corporation premium filings were accurate at the time of
filing, have been filed on a timely basis and are not subject to any penalties
or late payment interest charges of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
IRR has not incurred any liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation,
nor do Shareholders know of any state of facts which would result in the
imposition of such liability on IRR.

(d) No Benefit Plan is a multiemployer plan within the meaning
of section 3(37) of ERISA and IRR has not withdrawn or partially withdrawn from
any multiemployer plan under circumstances giving rise to a withdrawal
liability under ERISA.

(e) Neither Retainers nor Advertising now maintains, or at any
time in the past has maintained, an employee benefit plan as defined in Section
3 of ERISA.

(f) Each Benefit Plan and any related trust substantially
conforms to, and each Benefit Plan and the administrators and fiduciaries of
each Benefit Plan are in substantial compliance with, all applicable laws and
regulations, including but not limited to ERISA, the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act, the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964
and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the latter to the extent
that the Benefit Plan is designed to obtain special Federal income tax
treatment for the sponsor of, the trust maintained for, or the participants in
such Benefit Plan), and each Benefit Plan has been administered substantially
in accordance with its terms to the extent consistent with such laws.
Shareholders are not aware of

23
<PAGE> 32
any fact or circumstance that would adversely affect the qualified status of
any Benefit Plan.

(g) With respect to each "employee welfare plan" (as defined
in Section 3(1) of ERISA), the Companies and Shareholders have met the
continuing coverage requirements of Section 162(k) or 4980(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, for all periods during which these Sections
applied to that plan.

(h) There are no scheduled or agreed upon future increases of
benefit levels (or creation of new benefits) and no increases in (or creation
of) benefits have been proposed, been made the subject of representations or
similar communications to employees, or been requested or demanded by employees
under circumstances which make it reasonable to expect that such increases will

sufficiently extensive to impair substantially the continued conduct of the
business of any of IRR, Retainers or Advertising, Purchaser in its sole
discretion may terminate this Agreement. In the event that Purchaser decides
not to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Paragraph, any insurance claim
for such risk of loss or damage shall accrue to the Sellers and the Purchase
Price shall be reduced by the amount of the loss or damage as determined by the
parties hereto.

9. Confidentiality. Sellers and Purchasers agree to comply with their
respective obligations under that certain confidentiality agreement among

10. Broker.

Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand,
represent to each other that no broker or finder has been connected with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the event of a claim by any
broker or finder based upon representing or being retained by Sellers, on the
one hand, or Purchaser, on the other hand, Sellers, or Purchaser, as the case

47
<PAGE> 56
may be, agree to indemnify and save harmless the other in respect of such
claim. This obligation to indemnify shall survive the Closing.

11. Indemnification.

11.1 General Indemnification. (a) Sellers jointly and severally
shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, the Companies, and each of
their respective officers, directors, employees and agents (collectively the
"Purchaser Indemnitees") from any and all liabilities, losses, costs or damages
suffered by any or all of the Purchaser Indemnitees ("Loss"), and any and all
reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees and expenses and other
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in defending or prosecuting any claim resulting
in or from a Loss, proximately caused by: (i) any breach of a covenant which
was required to be performed by any of Sellers at or prior to the Closing Date
(regardless of when such breach was discovered) or which by its terms imposes
continuing liability after the Closing Date, including without limitation, the
covenants set out in paragraph 7.11 above; or (ii) any misrepresentation or
breach of warranty made by any of Sellers in this Agreement or any certificate
delivered on behalf of Sellers pursuant hereto. Recovery under this indemnity
shall be limited to the Purchase Price and the indemnification provisions of
this Agreement shall, in the absence of fraud, constitute Purchaser's sole
remedy for any misrepresentation or breach of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements set out

48
<PAGE> 57
herein. The obligations contained herein shall survive the Closing.

(b) Purchaser shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Sellers, and each of them, (collectively the "Seller Indemnitees") from any and
all liabilities, losses, costs or damages suffered by any or all of the Seller
Indemnitees ("Loss"), and any and all reasonable attorneys' and accountants'
fees and expenses and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in defending or
prosecuting any claim resulting in or from a Loss, proximately caused by: (i)
any breach of a covenant which was required to be performed by Purchaser at or
prior to the Closing Date (regardless of when such breach was discovered) or
which by its terms imposes continuing liability after the Closing Date; or (ii)
any misrepresentation or breach of warranty made by Purchaser in this Agreement
or any certificate delivered on behalf of Purchaser pursuant hereto. Recovery
under this indemnity shall be limited to the Purchase Price and the
indemnification provisions of this Agreement shall, in the absence of fraud,
constitute Sellers' sole remedy for any misrepresentation or breach of any of
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set out herein. The
obligations contained herein shall survive the Closing.

11.2 Environmental Indemnification. (a) Purchaser shall
defend and indemnify each of the Shareholders from and hold them harmless
against Environmental Losses. The obligations contained herein shall survive
the Closing without limitation.

(b) Purchaser shall deliver at Closing a release by each

49
<PAGE> 58
of IRR and Retainers from claims for Environmental Losses in form reasonably
satisfactory to Shareholders (together with reasonably satisfactory evidence of
authority to execute the release on behalf of IRR and the release on behalf of
Retainers).

11.3 Procedures.

(a) Promptly after receipt by a Purchaser Indemnitee
or Seller Indemnitee (hereinafter referred to as "Indemnitee") of notice of the
assertion or the commencement of any litigation, suit, action or claim (each
and all of the foregoing items being herein referred to as "Litigation") with
respect to any matter for which indemnification is sought under this Article
11, the Indemnitee shall give written notice thereof (the "Notice") to the
person from whom indemnification is sought pursuant hereto (the "Indemnitor")
and shall thereafter keep the Indemnitor reasonably informed with respect
thereto. Failure of the Indemnitee to give the Indemnitor prompt notice as
provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnitor of any of its obligations
hereunder, except to the extent the failure to give such notice prejudices the
Indemnitor's ability to defend such Litigation. In case any such Litigation is
commenced or asserted against any Indemnitee, the Indemnitor shall be entitled
to assume the defense thereof, by giving written notice to the Indemnitee of
its intention to do so within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Notice,
with counsel as selected by Indemnitor, at the Indemnitor's own expense. If
the Indemnitor shall assume the defense of such Litigation, the Indemnitor
shall not make any admission of liability, agreement or compromise with

50
<PAGE> 59
any person, body or competent authority without the written consent of the
Indemnitee, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding the assumption by the Indemnitor of the defense of
any Litigation as provided in this subsection, the Indemnitee shall be
permitted to join in the defense of such Litigation and to employ counsel at
its own expense. Each party agrees to cooperate in good faith with each other
party in providing testimony, documents and other assistance necessary or
desirable to the defense of any such Litigation.

(b) If the Indemnitor shall fail to notify the
Indemnitee of its desire to assume the defense of any such Litigation within
the prescribed period of time, or shall notify the Indemnitee that it will not
assume the defense of any such Litigation, then the Indemnitee may assume the
defense of any such Litigation, in which event it may do so in such manner as
it may deem appropriate, and the Indemnitor shall be bound by any
determinations made in such Litigation or any settlement thereof effected by
the indemnitee; provided, however, that the Indemnitee shall not make any
admission of liability, agreement or compromise with any person, body or
competent authority without the written consent of the Indemnitor, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Indemnitor shall
be permitted to join in the defense of such Litigation and to employ counsel at
its own expense.

12. Survival of Representations and Warranties.

51
<PAGE> 60
The representations and warranties made by Sellers, and each
of them, or Purchaser shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Closing and any investigation made by any party hereto, but only
as set out below:

(a) the representations and warranties contained in paragraphs
4.2, 4.3, 4.7, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.2 shall survive without limitation;

(b) the representations and warranties contained in paragraph
4.11 shall survive for so long as any tax period covered by such
representations and warranties remain open, in whole or in part, and subject to

(c) the representations and warranties contained in paragraph
4.20 shall survive for a period of five (5) years following the Closing Date;

(d) all other representations and warranties set out in this

(a) For a period of five (5) years, directly or
indirectly, solicit business from or perform any services for any person,

set forth in the Loan Agreement, as amended by the First Amendment, the Second

-5-
<PAGE> 6

(B) Payment. The Acquisition Term Loan shall bear
interest as provided in paragraph (C) of this Section 2.3 and shall be
evidenced by, and repayable in accordance with, the Acquisition Term
Note but, in the absence of such Acquisition Term Note, shall be
evidenced by Bank's records of disbursements and repayments. Without
in any way limiting Bank's right at any time to demand payment of the
entire principal amount of the Acquisition Term Loan, and all interest
accrued thereon, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, which
right is absolute and unconditional, the entire principal amount of
the Acquisition Term Loan, together with all interest accrued thereon,
shall become due and payable in full on September 30, 1999, without
notice, presentment, demand, notice of dishonor, or any notice of any
kind.

(C) Interest on Acquisition Term Loan. Borrowers shall
pay interest (based on a year having 360 days and calculated for the
actual number of days elapsed) on the unpaid principal amount of the
Acquisition Term Loan outstanding from time to time from the date
thereof until paid, payable as of the last day of each month
commencing September 30, 1994, and continuing on the last day of each
month thereafter, and, at the maturity thereof, at a rate per annum
which shall be equal to the Base Rate from time to time in effect.
Any increase or decrease in the Base Rate shall become effective on
the date of such change.

2.4 Letter of Credit Facility. Subject to the provisions
of this Agreement, National Canada Finance Corp. or its parent
corporation, National Bank of Canada (New York, New York), shall issue
for and on behalf of Borrowers standby letters of credit the issued
and outstanding amounts of which, together with all unpaid draws
thereon, (1) shall not exceed the lesser of (a) the Borrowing Base or
(b) $5,000,000 (the "Letter of Credit Facility"), and (2) shall
reduce, on a dollar for dollar basis, the Borrowing Base and the
Revolving Loan Credit Limit. All draws made upon any issued and
outstanding standby letter of credit shall bear interest at the
Adjusted Base Rate from time to time in effect and all payments of
principal, and accrued interest thereon, shall be due and payable in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.1(B) and (D) above.

2.5 Fees and Additional Charges.

(A) Commitment Fee. On the date of execution of the
Fifth Amendment, Borrowers shall pay to Bank a commitment fee of
$37,500 (the "Commitment Fee").

-6-
<PAGE> 7

(B) Unused Line Fee. Commencing July 31, 1991, and
continuing on the last day of each month thereafter until such time as
the Revolving Loan is terminated as provided herein and Borrowers'
Obligations are paid in full, Borrowers shall pay to Bank an amount
equal to one-quarter of one percent (1/4%) per annum of the difference
between the Revolving Loan Credit Limit and the sum of (1) the issued
and outstanding standby letters of credit and (2) the outstanding
principal balance of the Revolving Loan during the preceding month
(the "Unused Line Fee").

(C) Termination Fee. Prior to the Termination Date,
Borrowers may terminate this Agreement as of the last day of any month
by giving Bank at least ninety (90) days prior written notice of the
date on which this Agreement is to terminate, which date must be the
last day of a month, and by paying to Bank on such termination date
all of the outstanding principal balance due and payable under the
Promissory Note, the Term Note, the Acquisition Term Note, all other
Obligations, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon; provided,
however, that if such specified date of termination is on or before
the Termination Date, Borrowers shall pay Bank an amount equal to one
percent (1%) of the sum of the Revolving Loan Credit Limit and the
original principal amount of the Term Loan (the "Termination Fee").
The Termination Fee shall be paid to Bank at the same time and in the
same manner in which Borrowers pay in full the then outstanding
principal amounts and interest thereon due and owing under the
Promissory Note, the Term Note, the Acquisition Term Note and all
other Obligations.

(D) Letter of Credit Fee. Borrowers shall be obligated
to pay Bank a per-annum amount equal to one and one-half percent
(1.5%) of the face amount of each standby letter of credit issued by
Bank for the benefit of Borrowers (the "Letter of Credit Fee"). Each
Letter of Credit Fee shall be due and payable in equal quarterly
installments. The first quarterly installment of each Letter of
Credit Fee shall be due and payable on the date of issuance of such
Letter of Credit and any additional quarterly installments shall be
due and payable in advance for each subsequent quarter in which a
standby letter of credit is issued and outstanding for the benefit of
Borrowers.

2.6 Accountings. Any accounting rendered by Bank to
Borrowers shall be deemed correct and conclusively binding upon
Borrowers unless (A) Borrowers notify Bank by certified mail, return
receipt requested, within thirty (30) calendar days after the date
when each such

-7-
<PAGE> 8

accounting is mailed or otherwise delivered to Borrowers, or (B) there
exists a bona fide mistake in such accounting regardless of which
party discovers such mistake.

2.7 All Advances to Constitute One Loan. The Revolving
Loan, the Term Loan, the Acquisition Term Loan and all other amounts
owed by Borrowers to Bank under this Agreement, whether or not
evidenced by a promissory note or term note, shall constitute one
obligation of Borrowers, secured by Bank's lien on and security
interest in all of the Collateral. Borrowers shall be liable to Bank
for all of the Obligations, regardless of whether such Obligations
arise as a result of advances made directly to Borrowers, it being
stipulated and agreed that all monies advanced by Bank hereunder inure
to the benefit of Borrowers, and that Bank is relying on the liability
of Borrowers in extending credit and otherwise making advances under
this Agreement.

2.8 Excess Interest. In no contingency or event
whatsoever shall the interest rate charged pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement exceed the highest rate permissible under any law which
a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination,
deem applicable hereto. In the event that such a court determines
that Bank has received interest under this Agreement in excess of the
highest applicable rate, such excess interest shall first be applied
to any unpaid principal balance owed by Borrowers and, if the then
remaining excess interest is greater than the unpaid principal
balance, Bank promptly shall refund such excess interest to Borrowers.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the Promissory Note, the Term Note or the Acquisition Term Note, if
the rate of interest payable on the Promissory Note, the Term Note or
the Acquisition Term Note is ever reduced as a result of this Section
2.8 and at any time thereafter the maximum rate permitted by
applicable law shall exceed the rate of interest provided for in the
Promissory Note, the Term Note or the Acquisition Term Note, then the
rate provided for in the Promissory Note, the Term Note or the
Acquisition Term Note, as the case may be, shall be increased to the
maximum rate permitted by applicable law for such period as is
required so that the total amount of interest received by Bank is that
which would have been received by Bank but for the operation of this
Section 2.8.

2.9 Revival. To the extent that Borrowers make a payment
or payments to Bank or to the extent Bank receives any payment or
proceeds of the Collateral for

-8-
<PAGE> 9

Borrowers' benefit, which payment or proceeds or any part thereof is
subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential,
set aside, and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver, or any
other party under any bankruptcy act, state or Federal law, common
law, or equitable cause, then, to the extent of such payment or
proceeds received by Borrowers, the Obligations or part thereof
intended to be satisfied shall be revived and shall continue in full
force and effect as if such payment or proceeds had not been received
by Bank.

2.10 Optional Charge Against Revolving Loan. To the
extent Borrowers do not remit, when due, any payments of interest or,
in the case of the Term Loan, the Acquisition Term Loan or any other
loans or Obligations other than the Revolving Loan, any payment of
principal or any other payment required to be made by Borrowers to
Bank pursuant to the terms of any of the Credit Documents within any
applicable grace periods, Bank, at its option, may make such payment
by increasing the outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Loan
in order to prevent such amount from becoming past due, but it is
expressly acknowledged and covenanted that Bank shall be under no
obligation to do so.

2.11 Specific Conditions Applicable to Requests for
Revolving Loan. In addition to all other conditions set forth in this
Agreement, each request by Borrowers for a Revolving Loan also is
subject to the following specific conditions:

(A) Notice of Request. Borrowers shall notify Bank in
writing or telephonically of Borrowers' request for a Revolving Loan,
which request shall be received by Bank not later than 2:00 p.m.,
Cleveland, Ohio time and shall state the total amount of the Revolving
Loan requested.

(B) Borrowing Base Certificate. Borrowers' written
request shall be accompanied by a duly completed and executed
"Borrowing Base Certificate" in the form attached to this Agreement as
Exhibit 2.9(B). If Borrowers' request is made telephonically, the
Borrowing Base Certificate shall be delivered to Bank no later than
the next business day after such telephonic request is made. Each
Borrowing Base Certificate shall demonstrate that the principal amount
of the Revolving Loan, when added to the aggregate principal amount of
all Revolving Loans then outstanding, shall not exceed the Borrowing
Base, as determined based on the last Borrowing Base Certificate
timely delivered to Bank pursuant to Section 5.4(B) of this Agreement.

-9-
<PAGE> 10

(C) Borrowers' Acceptance of Proceeds. The acceptance by
Borrowers of the proceeds of any Revolving Loan, as of the date of
such acceptance, shall be deemed (1) to constitute a representation
and warranty by Borrowers that all conditions to the making of such
Revolving Loan set forth in this Agreement have been satisfied, and
(2) a confirmation by Borrowers of the granting and continuance of the
Lien in favor of Bank created pursuant to this Agreement and the
Credit Documents.

(D) Conditions to Making Revolving Loan. Bank shall not
make any Revolving Loan unless (1) it shall have received Borrowers'
written or telephonic request and Borrowing Base Certificate in the
prescribed time as set forth in paragraph (A) of this Section 2.11,
(2) no Event of Default shall then exist or, immediately after the
making of any Revolving Loan, would exist, (3) all provisions or
covenants contained in Section 7 of this Agreement shall have been
complied with or performed, (4) all of the Credit Documents shall be

contained in Section 6 of this Agreement shall be true and correct in
all material respects as if made on and as of the date of such
borrowing except to the extent that any thereof expressly relate to an
earlier date, and (6) Bank shall not have made demand for the payment
of the Obligations or otherwise terminated the availability of any
Revolving Loan.

2.12 Manner of Payments. On or before the date they
become due, Borrowers shall make payments to Bank in immediately
available funds, even if it contests any statement rendered by Bank;
provided, however, that if any statement is subsequently proved to be
incorrect, Bank, at the option of Borrowers, shall (A) refund any
overpaid amount to Borrowers, or (B) grant a credit against amounts
due for the following month in the appropriate amount. As to
Obligations which become due and payable other than on a fixed date by
their terms or as a result of demand for payment and/or acceleration
on account of an Event of Default, Borrowers immediately shall pay to
Bank such Obligations in immediately available funds. Whenever any
payment to be made hereunder including, but not limited to, any
payment to be made on the Promissory Note, the Term Note or the
Acquisition Term Note, is stated to be due on a day which is not a
banking day, such payment may be made on the next succeeding banking
day and such extension of time in each such case shall be included in
the computation of the interest payable on the Promissory Note, the
Term Note or the Acquisition Term Note or such other

-10-
<PAGE> 11

or prepayments made or due hereunder (including, but not limited to,

Acquisition Term Note) shall be made in immediately available funds to
Bank prior to 2:00 p.m., Cleveland, Ohio time, on the date when due.

an Event of Default, and during the continuation thereof, the
Obligations shall bear interest at the Default Rate, calculated daily
on a 360-day year basis, based upon the actual number of days elapsed.
