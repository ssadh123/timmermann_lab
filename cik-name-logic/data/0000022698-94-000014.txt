COMSAT, RADIATION SYSTEMS, INC. ANNOUNCE
CONVERSION FRACTION FOR SHARES OF RSi

BETHESDA, Md. and STERLING, Va. -- COMSAT Corporation 

(NYSE:CQ) and Radiation Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:RADS) announced today

that if COMSAT's acquisition of RSi is approved by stockholders of RSi at 

a special meeting June 3, then each share of Radiation Systems common stock

outstanding on that day will be converted into 0.780 shares of COMSAT

common stock.

According to the COMSAT-RSi merger agreement, a share of RSi

common stock -- upon the consummation of the merger -- will be converted 

into a fraction of a share of COMSAT common stock determined by dividing 

$18.25 by the average closing price of COMSAT common stock on the New York 

Stock Exchange composite tape during the 20 trading days that ended today.

However, the merger agreement provides that in no event would a share of RSi

common stock be converted into less than 0.638 or more than 0.780 shares of

COMSAT common stock.

The average closing price of a share of COMSAT common stock during

the 20 trading days that ended today (May 26), five business days before the

RSi stockholders meeting, is $22.29. Because $18.25 divided by the average

price is greater than 0.780, the conversion fraction will be 0.780.

the Holiday Inn Washington-Dulles in Sterling, Va., at 10 a.m.
