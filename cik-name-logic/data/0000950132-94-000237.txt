[LETTERHEAD OF ERNST & YOUNG APPEARS HERE]

Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
United National Bancorporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United 
National Bancorporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and
the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity, and cash 
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements 
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of United National 
Bancorporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the 
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the 
three years in the period ended December 31, 1993 in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 1993 the Corporation 
changed its method of accounting for income taxes.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 1993

1. Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

United National Bancorporation (the Corporation) and its subsidiaries (Unitas
National Bank [the Bank], Unitas Real Estate Corp., Unitas Commercial Leasing
Corp., Unitas Financial Corp., Unitas Life Insurance Co., Unitas Mortgage
Corp., and Unitas Services Corp.) provide financial services. The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Corporation and
its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and
accounts have been eliminated. Investments in subsidiaries are carried at the
parent company's equity in the underlying net assets.

Mortgage Loans Held for Sale

The Bank identified a pool of conventional fixed-rate mortgages at December
31, 1992 which it was holding for sale. Mortgage loans held for sale are
carried at the aggregate of lower of cost or market value. No loans were held
for sale at December 31, 1993.

Investment and Mortgage-Backed Securities

Investment securities are stated at cost adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts. Security gains and losses are determined
using the specific identification method. In classifying debt securities
acquired and held in the investment portfolio, management continually
evaluates the Corporation's ability to hold the securities to maturity as
well as its intent to hold the securities for the foreseeable future.
Management's evaluation of the Corporation's ability to hold securities to
maturity is based on an evaluation of its ability to satisfy liabilities in
the normal course of business and meet regulatory and legal requirements such
as minimum capital requirements. Additionally, management continually
evaluates the probability of events that might occur which may cause the
Corporation to sell debt securities. Currently, management is not aware of
such probable events; thus all debt securities are classified as investment
securities at December 31, 1993.

Revenue Recognition

Interest on loans is recognized based upon the principal amount outstanding.
The accrual of interest income is discontinued when circumstances indicate
that collection is questionable. When interest accruals are discontinued,
interest credited to income in the current year is reversed. Management may
elect to continue the accrual of interest when the estimated net realizable
value of collateral is sufficient to cover the principal balance and accrued
interest.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by
management to absorb potential losses in the portfolio. Management's
determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the risk
characteristics of the portfolio, past loan loss experience, local economic
conditions, and such other relevant factors which, in management's judgment,
deserve recognition. The allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses
charged to operations.

Premises and Equipment

Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. Depreciation and amortization are charged to operations over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, computed by the straight-line
method.

Lease Financing

The Corporation provides equipment (principally automobiles) financing
through lease arrangements. Direct financing leases are stated at the
aggregate of lease payments receivable plus estimated residual values 
(1993 -- $10,340,000; 1992 -- $5,891,000). Unearned income on direct
financing leases is amortized over the lease term resulting in an approximate
level rate of return.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Per Share Data

Net income and dividends per share have been restated to reflect a 10 percent
stock dividend to shareholders of record December 9, 1993, payable January
18, 1994. The effect of common stock equivalents is not significant for any
period presented.

Cash Flow Information

For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Corporation considers cash
and due from banks and federal funds sold as cash and cash equivalents.
Generally, federal funds are purchased and sold for one-day periods. Cash
paid during the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991 for interest
was $4,883,000, $5,961,000, and $5,314,000, respectively. Cash paid for
income taxes was $585,000 in 1993, $544,000 in 1992, and $288,000 in 1991.

Accounting Change -- Income Taxes

The Corporation adopted FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes," in the first quarter of its fiscal year ended December 31, 1993.
The Corporation adopted the Statement on a prospective basis without
restating any prior years and has determined that the effect of its
implementation on the Corporation's financial position and results of
operations was not material for 1993 or 1992. In accordance with FASB
Statement No. 109, the liability method is used in accounting for income
taxes. Deferred income taxes are provided for differences between the tax
basis of an asset or liability and its reported amount in the financial
statements at the statutory tax rates that will be in effect when the
differences are expected to reverse.

Recently Issued FASB Statement

The Corporation is required to adopt FASB Statement No. 115, "Accounting
for Certain Investment in Debt and Equity Securities," in the first quarter
of its fiscal year ending December 31, 1994 and will be required to adopt
FASB Statement No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan,"
in the first quarter of its fiscal year ending December 31, 1995. The
Corporation has determined that the effect of its implementation of these
FASB Statements on the Corporation's financial position and results of
operations will not be material.

2. Restrictions on Cash and Due from Banks

The Bank is required to maintain average reserve balances with the Federal
Reserve Bank. The average amount of those reserve balances for the year ended
December 31, 1993 was approximately $1,130,000.

3. Investment Securities

The amortized cost and estimated market value of investment securities were

secure public deposits and for other purposes.

The amortized cost and estimated market value of debt securities at December

Proceeds from sales of investments in debt securities during 1993 were
$2,555,000. Gross gains of $62,000 and gross losses of $-0- were realized
on those sales. Proceeds from sales of investments in debt securities
during 1992 were $2,016,000. Gains of $35,000 and gross losses of $20,000
were realized on those sales. Proceeds from such sales were $2,183,000 in
1991. Gains of $41,000 were realized on those sales and a loss of $7,000
was realized on the sale of an interest-bearing time deposit.

4. Related Party Loans

Certain directors and executive officers of the Corporation and the Bank,
including their associates and companies, have loans with the Bank. Such
loans were made in the ordinary course of business at the Bank's normal
credit terms including interest rate and collateralization and do not
represent more than a normal risk of collection. Total loans to these
persons amounted to approximately $1,893,000 and $1,958,000 at December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively. During 1993, $257,000 of new loans were made
and repayments totalled $322,000.

6. Regulatory Matters

Dividends are paid by the Corporation from its assets which are mainly
provided by dividends from the Bank. However, certain regulatory
restrictions exist regarding the ability of the Bank to transfer funds to
the Corporation in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances. As of
December 31, 1993, the Bank had retained earnings of $7,982,000 of which
$3,070,000 was available for distribution to the Corporation as dividends
without prior regulatory approval.

Under Federal Reserve regulation, the Bank also is limited as to the amount
it may loan to its affiliates, including the Corporation, unless such loans
are collateralized by specified obligations. At December 31, 1993, the
maximum amount available for transfer from the Bank to the Corporation in
the form of loans approximated 20 percent of consolidated net assets.

The Bank is also required to maintain minimum amounts of capital to total
"risk-weighted" assets, as defined by the banking regulators. At December
31, 1993, the Bank was required to have minimum Tier I and total capital
ratios of 4.00 percent and 8.00 percent, respectively. The Bank's actual
ratios at that date were 10.72 percent and 11.76 percent, respectively. The
Bank's leverage ratio at December 31, 1993 was 8.26 percent.

7. Income Taxes

Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation changed its method of accounting
for income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method required
by FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (see Note 1,
"Accounting Changes"). As permitted under the new rules, prior years'
financial statements have not been restated. There was no cumulative effect
of adopting Statement No. 109 as of January 1, 1993. There was no effect on
the pre-tax income from continuing operations as a result of the adoption
of Statement No. 109.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
Significant components of the Company's deferred tax liabilities and assets
as of December 31, 1993 are as follows (In Thousands):

<TABLE>

Deferred tax liabilities:
Leasing activity $2,205

8. Pension Plan

The Corporation has a defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all
of its employees. The benefits are based on years of service and the
employee's compensation. The Corporation's funding policy is to contribute
annually the maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax
purposes. No contributions were made in 1993, 1992, or 1991. Contributions
are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date
but also for those expected to be earned in the future.

The following table sets forth the Plan's funded status and amounts
recognized in the Corporation's financial statements at December 31:

8. Pension Plan (continued)

Net pension expense (income) included the following components:

----- ----- ----
Net periodic pension expense (income) $ 40 $ 12 $ (1)
===== ===== ====
</TABLE>

The weighted average discount rate and rate of increase in future
compensation levels used in determining the actuarial present value of the
projected benefit obligation were 8 percent and 7 percent, respectively, at
December 31, 1993 and 1992. The expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets was 8 percent in 1993 and 7 percent in 1992 and 8.5 percent in 1991.

9. Loan Commitments and Standby Letters of Credit

Loan commitments are made to accommodate the financial needs of the Bank's
customers. Standby letters of credit commit the Bank to make payments on
behalf of customers when certain specified future events occur. They
primarily are issued to facilitate customers' trade transactions.
Historically, more than 90 percent of standby letters of credit expire
unfunded.

Both arrangements have credit risk essentially the same as that involved in
extending loans to customers and are subject to the Bank's normal credit
policies. Collateral (e.g., securities, receivables, inventory, equipment) is
obtained based on management's credit assessment of the customer.

The Bank's maximum exposure to credit loss for loan commitments (unfunded
loans and unused lines of credit, including home equity lines of credit) and
standby letters of credit outstanding at December 31, 1993 was as follows (In
Thousands):

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
<S> <C> 
Loan commitments: 
Home equity loans $ 828
Lines of credit 793
Real estate construction 907
Standby letters of credit 498
------
Total $3,026
====== 
</TABLE>

Loan commitments and standby letters of credit were $1,828,000 and $651,000,
respectively, at December 31, 1992.

10. Concentration of Credit Risk

Most of the Bank's business is with customers in the five county area of
Central Pennsylvania where it has full-service branch locations. The Bank's
consumer and real estate loan portfolios are principally to borrowers
throughout this market area. The Bank requires collateral on all real estate
exposures and generally requires loan-to-value ratios of no greater than 80
percent. The Bank's lease portfolio includes customers in this area as well
as other parts of South Central Pennsylvania. The commercial, financial, and
agricultural portfolio is diversified with no industry comprising greater
than 10 percent of total loans outstanding.

Collateral requirements on such loans are determined on a case-by-case basis
based on management's credit evaluations of the respective borrower.

11. Shareholders' Equity

In 1987, the Corporation established a dividend reinvestment and stock
purchase plan. Shareholders of common stock may participate in the plan which
provides that additional shares of common stock may be purchased with
reinvested dividends at prevailing market prices. To the extent that shares
are not available on the open market, the Corporation has reserved 266,200
shares of common stock to be issued under the dividend reinvestment plan.

The Corporation has reserved 133,100 shares covered by the 1986 Stock Option
Plan which expires January 1997.

The Plan permits the granting of stock options, including incentive stock
options (ISOs) and nonqualified stock options (NQSOs) to key employees.
Options may be accompanied by stock appreciation rights (SARs). The
exercise of a SAR requires the surrender of an unexercised related option.
The purchase price of the common stock covered by each ISO will not be less
than 100 percent (85 percent for NQSOs) of the fair market value of the
stock on the date of the grant of such option. The duration of each option
granted under the Plan will not exceed 10 years from the date of grant. No
option will be exercisable during the year ending on the first anniversary
date of the granting of such option. The Plan provides that SARs will be
automatically exercised on the last business day prior to the expiration of
the related option if, on that date, the fair market value of a share of
common stock exceeds the per share price of the related option. In the
event of termination of employment, options will generally remain
exercisable until the earlier of the expiration of the option term or three
months from the date of termination of employment.

At December 31, 1993, all option holders have expressed their intention to
exercise the fixed award portion of their plan. Accordingly, no compensation
expense has been recorded. Had the holders intended to exercise the SAR
portion of their plan, compensation expense of approximately $528,000, based
on the market value of the Corporation's shares at December 31, 1993, would
have been recorded.

The changes in option shares outstanding are as follows:

Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 ("Statement 109"), "Accounting for Income
Taxes" effective January 1, 1993. FAS No. 109 is an asset and liability
approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes. As permitted
by Statement 109, UNB has elected not to restate the financial statements of any
prior year and the cumulative effect of the change had no material impact on the
balance sheet or income statement in the first quarter of 1993.

The Corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 
"Accounting for certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" in the first 
quarter of 1994. Accordingly, Management reviewed the investment portfolio and 
classified certain securities as "Available-for-Sale". Such securities will be 
marketed-to-market on a quarterly basis, with net unrealized gains (losses), net
of taxes, posted to equity capital.

Note 5 Proposed Business Combination: On March 25, 1994, UNB signed a
- ------ ------------------------------ 
Definitive Agreement to merge the Corporation into First Commonwealth Financial
Corporation of Indiana, PA ("FCFC"). Total assets of the combined entity will
exceed $2.0 billion, affording our bank subsidiary, Unitas National Bank, and
active nonbank subsidiary, Unitas Mortgage Corporation, excellent long term
growth and profitability potential. We are confident that this partnership will
open significant opportunities for these subsidiaries as they become independent
affiliates of FCFC. Management of UNB anticipates acquisition costs to UNB in
excess of $200 thousand during 1994; however, Management is not aware of
forseeable future events which would otherwise materially alter the
profitability or safety and soundness of UNB. We expect certain cost savings in
noninterest expenditures subsequent to the merger.

Reliable Financial Corporation and Subsidiary
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Independent Auditors' Report

[LETTERHEAD OF EDWARDS LEAP & SAUER APPEARS HERE]

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders
Reliable Financial Corporation
Reliable Savings Bank, PaSA
Bridgeville, Pennsylvania

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Reliable
Financial Corporation (the "Corporation") and subsidiary as of September 30,
1993 and 1992 and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in
retained earnings and stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years ended
September 30, 1993 and 1992 and the statements of income, changes in retained
earnings and stockholders' equity and cash flows of Reliable Savings Bank, PaSA
(the "Savings Bank") for the year ended September 30, 1991. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's and the Bank's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Reliable
Financial Corporation and subsidiary as of September 30, 1993 and 1992 and the
results of their operations and cash flows for the years then ended and the
results of operations and cash flows of Reliable Savings Bank, PaSA for the year
ended September 30, 1991, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements

Years ended September 30, 1993, 1992 and 1991
================================================================================

Note A--Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation:

The consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended
September 30, 1993 and 1992 include Reliable Financial Corporation and its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Reliable Savings Bank, PaSA. The consolidated financial
statements for the year ended September 30, 1991 include Reliable Savings Bank,
PaSA and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Reliable Savings Service Corporation. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

Investment Securities:

Investment securities are carried at cost, adjusted for amortization of
premium and accretion of discount over the term of the security using the
interest method or methods which approximate the interest method. Gains or
losses on the sale of securities are recognized upon realization using both the
weighted average and the specific-identification methods. All securities
currently owned are classified as held for investment as management has the
ability to hold such investments until maturity and the intent to hold them for
the foreseeable future.

Mortgage-Backed Securities:

Mortgage-backed securities are stated at cost, adjusted for amortization of
premium and accretion of discount using the interest method or methods which
approximate the interest method. The Corporation has the ability and
management's intention is to hold such assets to maturity. Should any be sold,
gains and losses will be recognized based on the specific identification method.

Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses:

Loans are stated at the amount of unpaid principal less the undisbursed
portion of loans and unamortized loan fees. The allowance for loan losses is
established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense. Loans are
charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the
collectibility of the principal is unlikely. The allowance is an amount that
management believes will be adequate to absorb possible losses on existing loans
that may become uncollectible.

Real Estate Owned (REO):

Real estate acquired in satisfaction of a loan and in-substance
foreclosures are reported in other assets. In-substance foreclosures are
properties in which a borrower with little or no equity in the collateral,
effectively abandons control of the property or has no economic interest to
continue involvement in the property. The borrower's ability to rebuild equity
based on current financial conditions is also considered doubtful. Properties
acquired by foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure and properties classified
as in-substance foreclosures are transferred to REO and recorded at the lower of
cost or fair value at the date actually or constructively received. Fair value
is measured by market transactions. If there are no active markets for similar
items, fair value is determined by discounting a forecast of expected cash flows
at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.

27
<PAGE>

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interest Income:

Interest on loans is recorded when earned. Accrual of interest is
discontinued on a loan when management believes, after considering economic and
business conditions and collection efforts, that the borrower's financial
condition is such that collection is questionable. Loan origination fees are
deferred and recognized over the life of the loan as an adjustment of yield
(interest income).

Depreciation:

The Savings Bank generally computes depreciation on the straight-line
method for financial reporting purposes over the assets' estimated useful lives
which range from 7 to 50 years for buildings and leasehold improvements and from
5 to 10 years for furniture and fixtures. Depreciation for tax purposes is
computed under the straight-line method for assets placed in service prior to
January 1, 1981. Assets placed in service after December 31, 1980 are
depreciated under the provisions of Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS) or
the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS), which stipulates that the
cost of assets be recovered over recovery lives as determined by the Internal
Revenue Code. As a result, there may be timing differences between book
depreciation and tax depreciation.

Income Taxes:

Deferred income taxes are reported for timing differences between items of
income or expense reported in the financial statements and those reported for
income tax purposes. The differences relate principally to depreciation of
premises and equipment, recognition of interest income and the provision for
loan losses.

Earnings per Share:

Earnings per share are calculated on the basis of the weighted average
number of shares outstanding. As a result of the stock conversion, as described
in Note P, the newly issued stock was outstanding for 184 days during the fiscal
year ended September 30, 1992. Options to purchase an additional 34,000 shares
at $10/share, as described in Note L, were available for the year ended
September 30, 1993, with 11,332 shares actually purchased during the quarter
ended March 31, 1993. Therefore, the weighted average number for shares
outstanding was 1,425,596 and 1,457,944 at September 30, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

Cash Equivalents:

For the purposes of the Statements of Cash Flows, the Corporation and the
Savings Bank consider all highly liquid debt instruments with an original
maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents
totaled $20,586,837, $33,762,891 and $18,201,160 at September 30, 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively. Net loans transferred to real estate owned, a non-cash
operating activity, totaled $1,138,140, $0 and $32,943 in the years ended
September 30, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Reclassification of Prior Years' Statements:

Certain items previously reported in the prior years' financial statements
have been reclassified to conform with the current year's classifications. These
reclassifications have no effect on net income.

Note H--Stockholders' Equity

Retained earnings at September 30, 1992, the most recent date for which tax
returns were filed, included approximately $4,917,000 for which no provision for
federal income tax has been made. These amounts represent allocations of income
to bad debt deductions for tax purposes only. Reduction of amounts so allocated
for purposes other than tax bad debt losses will create income for tax purposes
only, which will be subject to the then current corporate income tax rate.

Treasury stock is shown at cost and consists of 61,380 shares of the
Corporation's stock at September 30, 1993. The Corporation purchased 72,712
shares of Treasury stock at an average price per share of approximately $19.50
and reissued 11,332 shares which cost approximately $18.00 per share, at $10.00
per share during the year ended September 30, 1993. The reissuance was in
conjunction with the Benefit Plans as described in Note L.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note I--Income Taxes

In addition to charging income for taxes actually paid or payable, the
provision for income taxes can reflect deferred income tax credits which result
from timing differences in computing income for financial and income tax
reporting. There were no deferred tax credits included in the income tax
provisions for the years ended September 30, 1993, 1992 and 1991. The principal
timing differences are a result of recognition of bad debt deductions, interest
income, loan fees and accelerated depreciation methods.

For Federal income tax purposes the Savings Bank is permitted a tax bad
debt deduction unrelated to any loan loss provision for book purposes. This
deduction is computed by one of two methods, the experience method taking into
account the six year moving average of net charge-offs to loans, and the
percentage of taxable income method, subject to certain limitations. The amount
of the tax bad debt deduction for the year ended September 30, 1992 was $-0-and
approximately $145,000 for the short tax year ended September 30, 1991. Due to
the limitations referenced above, no tax bad debt deduction is anticipated for
the tax year ended September 30, 1993.

The Corporation made income tax payments of $1,847,644 and $1,442,703
during the years ended September 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The Savings
Bank made income tax payments of $866,270 during the year ended September 30,
1991.

The income tax provision at September 30 consisted of the following:

The provision for federal income taxes differs from that computed at the
statutory corporate tax rate primarily due to the following:

<S> <C> <C> <C>

============== ============== ============

</TABLE> 

State income taxes are paid on income determined in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.

In February of 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (SFAS 109), "Accounting for
Income Taxes", that supersedes SFAS No. 96 and APB 11. The primary changes
incorporated in SFAS 109 include, among other things, relaxation of the criteria
for recognizing deferred tax assets and reduction in the complexity of
calculating deferred taxes by reducing the need to schedule the reversal of
temporary differences year-by-year. The statement is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1992. The Corporation plans to adopt SFAS 109 in
the first quarter of fiscal 1994. The adoption of SFAS 109 will require the
Corporation to change to the liability method for financial accounting and
reporting for income taxes. The Corporation currently estimates that its
deferred tax liability would be decreased by approximately $370,000. The
resulting benefit will be recorded through the income statement and reported as
a cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle.

Note J--Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act
("FIRREA") of 1989

FIRREA was signed into law on August 9, 1989 and regulations for savings
institutions' minimum capital requirements went into effect on December 7, 1989.
In addition to its capital requirements, FIRREA includes provisions for changes
in the federal regulatory structure for institutions including a new deposit
insurance system, increased deposit insurance premiums, and restricted
investment activities with respect to noninvestment-grade corporate debt and
certain other investments. FIRREA also increases the required ratio of
housing-related assets in order to qualify as a savings institution.

The regulations require institutions to have a minimum regulatory tangible
capital equal to 1.5 percent of total assets and, a minimum 3 percent core
capital ratio. The risk-based capital ratio requirement is 8.0 percent of total
risk adjusted assets as of December 31, 1992. Prior to December 31, 1992 it was
7.2% of total risk adjusted assets.

The Savings Bank, at September 30, 1993, meets all regulatory tangible
capital, core capital and risk-based capital requirements of 8.0 percent, as
defined by FIRREA. Failure to meet these capital requirements would expose the
Savings Bank to regulatory sanctions, including limitations on asset growth. The
following table shows that the Savings Bank is in compliance with regulatory
capital standards:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note K--Commitments

In the normal course of business, there are various outstanding commitments
and contingent liabilities, such as commitments to extend credit. These
commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of
amounts recognized in the balance sheets.

Loan commitments are made to accommodate the financial needs of the Savings
Bank's customers.

These arrangements have credit risk essentially the same as that involved
in extending loans to customers and are subject to the Savings Bank's normal
credit policies and loan underwriting standards. Collateral is obtained based on
management's credit assessment of the customer. Management currently expects no
loss from these activities.

<PAGE>

Reliable Financial Corporation and Subsidiary 
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Savings Bank's maximum exposure to credit loss for loan commitments
(unfunded loans) outstanding at September 30, 1993 and 1992, was $3,330,720 and
$1,272,000, respectively. Commitments for fixed rate loans totaled $2,741,720
and $773,000 at September 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively, with rates ranging
from 6.5% to 12%. The Savings Bank had outstanding commitments at September 30,
1993 and 1992 of $-0- and $324,000, respectively to purchase investment
securities.

Lease commitments: Annual rentals under long-term monthly operating leases
for property amounted to $22,800 in 1993, 1992 and 1991. At September 30, 1993,
the minimum rental commitment, including any current renewal options under
existing leases with initial or remaining terms of more than one year was as
follows:

Note L--Pension, Retirement and Benefit Plans

On August 9, 1991, the Savings Bank elected to terminate its previously
existing defined benefit pension plan. Under Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 88 (SFAS 88), "Employer's Accounting for Settlements and
Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits", a
termination of a defined benefit plan is considered both a settlement (an
irrevocable transaction relieving an employer of the responsibility for a
pension benefit obligation) and a curtailment (elimination for employees of the
accrual of defined benefits for future service). All balances in the plan as of
September 30, 1991, which were determined by actuaries to equal $845,627 vested
in the plan participants in relation to their respective present values
determined at a weighted average discount rate and long-term rate of return on
plan assets of 7.5% in the plan as of the termination date. Therefore, there was
no settlement or curtailment gain or loss associated with the termination. The
plan trust continued to hold the plan assets until distribution of $861,351 on
January 20, 1992. By definition, the accumulated benefit obligation is the value
of the assets. Pension expense for 1991 totaled $31,377.

On June 25, 1991, the Savings Bank adopted a 401(k) retirement plan,
whereby the employees may elect to make pre-tax contributions through a salary
reduction of up to 10% of their monthly salary. The Savings Bank may match
dollar for dollar up to 5% of employees' monthly salary reduction or make
elective contributions to the Plan. The Savings Bank's contributions to the Plan
were $29,047, $22,786 and $1,770 for the years ended September 30, 1993, 1992
and 1991, respectively.

On January 23, 1992, the Board of Directors of the Savings Bank adopted the
Reliable Savings Bank, PaSA Recognition and Retention Plan ("RRP") as a method
of providing officers and key employees with a proprietary interest in Reliable
Financial Corporation. All employees of the Savings Bank and its affiliates are
eligible to receive awards from the plan. The standard vesting rate of an award
is 20% per year commencing one year from the date of the award.

In August, 1992 an award under the RRP was granted to President Stephen
Grippi, representing 6,000 shares which were purchased at $17.50 per share.
Vesting under this award is 33 1/3% over three years. Amortization, on a
straight line basis over three (3) years, of this award for the years

35
<PAGE>

ended September 30, 1993 and 1992 totaled $49,500 and $3,500, respectively.
During the year ended September 30, 1993, 2,000 shares had vested.

On January 14, 1992, the Board of Directors of Reliable Financial adopted
Reliable Financial Corporation 1992 Incentive Stock Option Plan (the "Option
Plan") and the Reliable Financial Corporation 1992 Stock Option Plan for
Nonemployee Directors (the "Directors' Plan"). Under the Option Plan, options
may only be granted to officers and other key employees. The Option Plan is
designed to encourage the continued employment of these employees and to attract
new employees by facilitating their purchase of a stock interest in Reliable
Financial. Options granted under the Option Plan may include both incentive
stock options ("ISOs") within the meaning of Section 422A of the Internal
Revenue Code and nonstatutory stock options ("Nonstatutory Options").

The Pension Committee will, from time to time, select employees to whom
Options are to be granted and the number of Options to be granted based upon the
employee's performance, compensation and the nature of his responsibilities,
duties and functions.

Pursuant to the Option Plan, up to 109,518 shares of Reliable Financial
common stock may be issued or transferred for the exercise of options to
purchase shares of common stock.

The Committee will determine the dates on which each Option will become
exercisable. Each ISO will continue to be exercisable over a maximum period of
ten years from the date granted, and each Nonstatutory Option will be
exercisable over a period of ten years and one day from the date granted.

Under circumstances set forth in the Option Plan, all or a portion of the
Options may be exercised for specified periods following termination of
employment. An Option may not be transferred by an optionee during his or her
lifetime. The exercise price per share of Common Stock covered by an Option
shall be the fair market value of Common Stock on the date of grant. The
shares purchased upon exercise of an Option are to be paid for in cash or
through the delivery of previously-acquired shares of Common Stock or in a
combination of cash and such shares.

The Pension Committee, with shareholder ratification, has granted to
President Grippi options under the Option Plan to purchase 12,000 shares of
stock. One-third of these options were exercised on the first anniversary date
of the conversion.

The Directors' Plan is designed to promote the growth and profitability of
Reliable Financial and the Savings Bank and to provide non-employee directors
with an incentive to assume the significant duties and responsibilities entailed
therewith. Benefits under the Directors' Plan are granted to non-employee
directors, a group currently consisting of 4 people. Pursuant to the Directors'
Plan, up to 36,506 shares of the common stock of Reliable may be issued or
transferred pursuant to the exercise of options to purchase shares of common
stock ("Directors' Options"). Directors' Options may only be granted to members
of Reliable's Board of Directors who are not employees of Reliable, the Savings
Bank or any other subsidiary or affiliate thereof on the date the Directors'
Options are granted. Directors' Options granted under the Directors' Plan are
nonstatutory stock options.

The Directors' Plan provides that each of the 4 non-employee directors
serving at the consummation of the conversion of the Savings Bank from mutual to
stock form receive options to purchase 5,500 shares of Reliable common stock.
New directors, subsequently elected, also receive the option to purchase 5,500
shares, to the extent shares remain available under the Directors' Plan. The
exercise price of the outstanding Directors' Options is $10.00 per share, which
was the fair market value of Reliable's common stock on the date of grant. No
Directors' Option may be exercised after the expiration of ten years and one day
from the date of grant of such option. One-third of these Directors' Options
were exercised on the first anniversary of the date of grant.

Note M--Reliable Financial Corporation

Reliable Financial Corporation was formed on November 7, 1991 to acquire
100% of the common stock of Reliable Savings Bank, PaSA as a result of the
Savings Bank's conversion from mutual to stock form. Prior to March 30, 1992,
Reliable Financial Corporation had no significant assets. Reliable Financial
Corporation currently has no independent business operations. Certain items
previously reported in the prior years' financial statements have been
reclassified to conform with the current year's classifications. These
reclassifications have no effect on the consolidated net income.

Note O--Related-Party Transactions

Certain officers and directors and their affiliates of Reliable Savings
Bank, PaSA were indebted to the Savings Bank at September 30, 1993 and 1992.
Related party loans are made on substantially the same terms as those prevailing
at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated persons and generally do
not involve more than normal risk of collectibility. The aggregate dollar amount
of these loans (exclusive of loans to any such person which in the aggregate do
not exceed $60,000 at September 30, 1993) was $706,387 and $726,979 at September
30, 1993 and 1992, respectively. During the year ended September 30, 1993 and
1992, $67,000 and $87,900 of new loans were made to related parties and
repayments by any such person(s) totaled $87,592 and $90,336, respectively.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note P--Conversion

On March 16, 1992, the members of the Savings Bank formally approved the
Plan of Conversion under which the Savings Bank converted from a
Pennsylvania-chartered mutual savings and loan association to a
Pennsylvania-chartered permanent reserve fund capital stock savings and loan
association. Included in the Plan of Conversion was the formation of a holding
company, Reliable Financial Corporation, which owns all of the common stock of
Reliable Savings Bank, PaSA, as its wholly-owned subsidiary. The conversion was
consummated on March 30, 1992.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note Q--Accounting Standards

In addition to SFAS 109, as previously discussed in Note I, certain other
recent accounting standards relating to the Corporation have been promulgated by
the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 107 requires entities to disclose the fair value of "Financial
Instruments" for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, with certain
exceptions. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114 addresses the
accounting by creditors for impairment of certain loans. Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115 relates to accounting for certain investments in
debt and equity securities.

The Corporation is not currently required to and has elected not to adopt
early implementation of any of these standards. The impact of such adoption was
not determined at this time.

RELIABLE FINANCIAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NINE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 1994 AND 1993 
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles for interim financial information and with
the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles
for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals)
considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.
Operating results for the three- and nine-month periods ended
June 30, 1994, are not necessarily indicative of the results
that may be expected for the fiscal year ending September 30,
1994. The interim consolidated financial statements and the
following discussion should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included
in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended September 30, 1993. 

NOTE 2. EARNINGS PER SHARE

Earnings per common share are based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding and common share equivalents
in each period. Weighted average shares outstanding include
common share equivalents under the available stock option 
plans. 

NOTE 3. FHLMC STOCK AVAILABLE FOR SALE

Investment securities to be held for indefinite periods of time
including investment securities that management intends to use
as part of its asset/liability strategy, and that may be sold in
response to changes in interest rates, changes in prepayment
risk, or other similar factors are classified as available for
sale and are recorded at the lower of aggregate cost or market.
Specifically, management has classified only the FHLMC stock as
available for sale. 

NOTE 4. INVESTMENT SECURITIES

Investments in debt securities which management has the ability
and intent to hold to maturity or on a long-term basis are
carried at cost. Premiums and discounts are amortized to expense
and accreted to income over the life of the securities using a
method which approximates the level yield method. Gain or loss
on the sale of investment securities, if any, are based on the
specific identification method.

NOTE 5. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
Statement No. 114 "Accounting by Creditors for the Impairment of a
Loan" which effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1994. Statement No. 114 addresses the methods to be used by a creditor
to measure the impairment of a loan and the proper recognition of a
change in the value of an impaired loan. Management believes that the
effect of adopting this statement on Reliable's consolidated financial
statements would not be material.

Also in May 1993, the FASB issued Statement No. 115 "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" which is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993. Statement No 115
addresses the definition of, accounting for and disclosure of debt and
equity securities. In accordance with this statement, securities will
be classified into and accounted for based on three distinct
categories: securities held to maturity, securities available for sale
and trading securities. Management is currently evaluating the impact
of this statement on Reliable's consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 6. RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain items previously reported in the September 30, 1993
consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform
with the current quarter's classifications. These reclassifications
have no effect on net income.

NOTE 7. PENDING MERGER TRANSACTION

On April 21, 1994, the registrant entered into a definitive agreement
to be acquired by First Commonwealth Financial Corporation ("FCFC") of
Indiana, Pennsylvania. FCFC was incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1982
and is registered as a bank holding company which is currently
affiliated with 7 wholly owned bank subsidiaries. In addition, FCFC
owns a data processing subsidiary and a trust company subsidiary both
headquartered in Indiana, Pennsylvania an FCFC also has joint venture
interest in a credit life insurance company. Through its subsidiary
banking network, FCFC traces its banking origins to 1880 and conducts
its business through 69 community banking offices in 51 communities
throughout 14 countries of central and western Pennsylvania. FCFC has
total assets of approximately $2 billion and employs over 900 persons.
The share of FCFC are traded on New York Stock Exchange under the
symbol "FCF".

The agreement provides for the issuance of 1.6 shares of FCFC's common
stock for each share of the registrant's common stock. It is
anticipated that the acquisition will be accounted for as a pooling of
interests.
