ITEM 5: OTHER EVENTS

Beginning on June 2, 1994, Ames Department Stores, Inc. ("Ames" or the 
"Company") will distribute, to its banks and other lenders, principal 
trade vendors and factors, summaries of its unaudited financial 
results for the four and thirteen weeks ended April 30, 1994. These 
monthly and year-to-date results (collectively, the "monthly results") 
are attached hereto as Exhibit 20 and are incorporated by reference 
herein. 

Compared with the revised projections contained in the Form 8-K dated 
May 27, 1994 (referred to herein as the "Plan"), sales for the four 
weeks ended April 30, 1994 were $5.6 million above Plan and EBITDA (as 
defined in Exhibit 20) was $2.6 million better than Plan. In April, 
the major portion of the positive sales variance was in softlines. 
The favorable EBITDA variance for April was primarily due to 
higher-than-planned gross margin dollars that resulted from the 
higher-than-planned sales and a higher-than-planned gross margin rate.
Both softlines and hardlines gross margin dollars and rates exceeded 
Plan in April. Softlines gross margin in April benefitted from a 
reduced level of markdowns on apparel merchandise because of markdowns 
previously taken in March. The April and year-to-date fiscal 1995 net 
income(loss) include an income tax benefit recorded at the end of the 
first quarter, which is expected to be offset by income tax expense in 
later interim periods, and an extraordinary charge, net of income tax 
benefit, for the early extinguishment of certain debt to be prepaid in 
June, 1994.

Sales for the thirteen weeks ended April 30, 1994 were $.4 million 
below Plan; however, EBITDA was $1.4 million better than Plan. The 
unfavorable impact on the year-to-date EBITDA from a lower-than- 
planned gross margin rate was more than offset by lower-than-planned 
expenses. The lower gross margin rate was primarily due to higher- 
than-planned clearance markdowns on apparel merchandise in March. 
Store, field and home office expenses were all below the year-to-date 
Plan. 

As of April 30, 1994, inventories were $2.6 million above Plan, 
principally in hardline categories. Trade payables were $40.1 million 
above Plan due primarily to improved payment terms. Outstanding 
borrowings under the Company's revolving line of credit as of April 
30, 1994 were $46.5 million below Plan due primarily to the 
better-than-planned trade payable terms. 

The Company is in compliance with all debt covenants through 
April 30, 1994.

Ames is distributing the monthly results to its banks and other 
lenders, principal trade vendors and factors to facilitate their 
credit analyses. The summary results SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON FOR 
ANY OTHER PURPOSE and should be read in conjunction with the Company's 
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 1994, the Company's

Page 2 of 7

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Form 10-Q to be filed for the first fiscal quarter ended April 30, 
1994, and the Company's Form 8-K dated May 27, 1994. The monthly 
results are being reported publicly solely because they are being 
distributed to a large number of the Company's vendors for purposes of 
their credit analyses.

During the pendency of its reorganization case, Ames disclosed 
publicly its monthly results through filings with the Office of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee and continued to report publicly its monthly 
results during the fiscal year ended January 29, 1994. Although Ames 
expects to continue to make its monthly results public for the fiscal 
year ending January 28, 1995, Ames does not believe it is obligated to 
provide such information indefinitely, other than as required by 
applicable regulations, and Ames may cease making such disclosures and 
updates at any time. The monthly results were not examined, reviewed 
or compiled by Ames' independent certified accountants. Moreover, 
Ames does not believe that it is obligated to update the monthly 
results to reflect subsequent events or developments. The reported 
monthly results are subject to future adjustments, if any, that could 
materially affect such results. However, in the opinion of the 
Company, the monthly results contain all adjustments (consisting of 
normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the 
results for the periods presented.
