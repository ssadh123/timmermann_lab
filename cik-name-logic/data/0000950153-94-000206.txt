ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER RESULTS

PHOENIX, Arizona, October 20, 1994 -- Greyhound Financial Corporation (the
"Company") today reported strong results for the third quarter ended September
30, 1994 resulting from the addition of an acquisition for a full quarter,
quality portfolio growth and sustained net interest margins.

Net income was $22.1 million for the third quarter of 1994 compared to
$6.8 million for the third quarter of 1993, a 225% increase. The results for
the third quarter of 1994 include income for a full quarter from TriCon Capital
("TriCon") acquired on April 30, 1994. Net income for the third quarter of
1993 included a $4.9 million adjustment for tax rate increases applicable to
deferred income taxes generated by the Company's leveraged lease portfolio.
Excluding this adjustment, net income for the third quarter of 1993 was $11.6
million. The improvement in net income over the third quarter of 1993, before
including the adjustment for deferred income taxes, was 91%.

Sam Eichenfield, President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of
the Company, indicated that he was pleased with the strong performance for the
third quarter of 1994, which is the first full quarter with both Ambassador
Factors ("Ambassador), the factoring and asset based lending company acquired
in February 1994, and TriCon. Eichenfield stated that "along with the
Company's core operations, the addition of Ambassador and TriCon has formed a
solid foundation for the Company's continued growth." He added that new
business volume continues strong, exceeding $1.1 billion for the nine months of
1994 and portfolio quality continues to improve.

Nonearning assets as a percent of funds employed was 3.5% of funds
employed at September 30, 1994, an improvement from 3.7% at the end of the
second quarter of 1994, and measured as a percent of funds employed and
securitizations, declined further to 3.3% at September 30, 1994.

Interest margins earned continue to hold at 6.0% of average earning
assets. This measurement compares to 5.4% for the 1993 period and reflects the
contributions of the acquisitions made in 1994 as well as the continuing strong
returns of the core financial operations. The interest margins more than
offset the higher provisions for possible credit losses and the higher selling,
administrative and other operating expenses ("operating expenses").

The higher loss provisions are attributable to the operations of the
businesses acquired in 1994 and are consistent with the dynamics and expected
loss experience of the businesses.

The higher operating expenses are primarily attributable to the
acquisitions of TriCon and Ambassador in 1994. The running rate of these
expenses (measured as a percent of interest margins earned) was 46.2% (for the
combined entities) in 1994 a slight increase from 46.1% for GFC (which excluded
TriCon and Ambassador) in 1993.

Earnings also benefited from strong portfolio growth. New business
volume was up by 90% to $1.1 billion for the first nine months of 1994, from
$591 million for the 1993 period.

Income taxes were higher in the third quarter of 1994 due to an
increase in income before income taxes and to a higher tax rate in effect
during the third quarter of 1994 (primarily attributable to foreign income
taxes provided).
