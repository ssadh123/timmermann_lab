Item 2. On July 21, 1994, First Bank System, Inc. ("FBS") and Metropolitan
Financial Corporation ("MFC") entered into an Agreement of Merger and
Consolidation (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which MFC will be
merged into FBS. In connection with the merger, each outstanding share
of Common Stock of MFC will be converted into .6803 shares of Common
Stock of FBS. In addition, each outstanding share of Series B Preferred
Stock of MFC will be converted into the right to receive $27.00 (plus
accumulated and unpaid dividends) in cash and the outstanding warrants
to purchase 249,100 shares of MFC Common Stock will be converted to
warrants to purchase 169,462 shares of FBS Common Stock at $6.96 per
share. The conversion ratio for the MFC Common Stock will be
proportionately adjusted if the average closing price of FBS Common
Stock during the 20 trading days ending three business days before the
stockholders' meetings scheduled to consider the merger is less than
$33.00 or more than $40.50. Either party may terminate the merger if the
average closing price of FBS Common Stock during the 20 trading days
ending three business days before the stockholders' meetings scheduled
to consider the merger is less than $29.50. The merger is intended to be
tax free for federal income tax purposes to the holders of MFC Common
Stock receiving shares of FBS Common Stock and to be accounted for as a
"pooling of interests".

In connection with the Merger Agreement, FBS and MFC entered into a
Stock Option Agreement pursuant to which FBS has the right to purchase
up to 19.9% of MFC's outstanding Common Stock at a price of $24.66 per
share if, under certain circumstances, MFC enters into (or the MFC Board
of Directors recommends that the MFC stockholders approve or accept) an
agreement to be merged with or acquired by a third party (including the
acquisition of 20% or more of MFC's outstanding Common Stock) or a third
party acquires 20% or more of the outstanding MFC Common Stock.

The merger is subject to various conditions, including the approval of
the stockholders of MFC and FBS and required regulatory approvals.

The Merger Agreement and the Stock Option Agreement are attached hereto
as Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2 and are incorporated herein by reference.

Note A

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and results of
operations of Metropolitan Financial Corporation (the "Company") and its wholly
owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior 
years' financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.

Trading Account Assets

Trading account assets are mortgage-backed securities held for sale in
conjunction with mortgage banking activities. These mortgage-backed securities
are collateralized by 30-year fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans and
are stated at fair value. Gains and losses, both realized and unrealized, are
included in net gains related to mortgage banking activities. The Company 
carried no trading account assets at December 31, 1993.

Securities Held-To-Maturity and Available-For-Sale

Management determines the appropriate classification of debt securities at the
time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date.
Debt securities are classified as held-to-maturity when the Company has the
positive intent and ability to hold the securities to maturity. Held-to-maturity
securities are stated at amortized cost. 

Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity or trading are classified as
available-for-sale. Available-for-sale securities are stated at fair value, with
the unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, reported as a separate component of
shareholders' equity.

The amortized cost of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity or 
available-for-sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of 
discounts to maturity, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities, over the 
estimated life of the security. Such amortization is included in interest 
income with interest and dividends. Realized gains and losses, and declines in 
value judged to be other-than-temporary are included in net securities gains 
(losses). The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification 
method.

Loans Held-For-Sale

Loans held for sale are valued at the lower of cost or market. Market value is
calculated on the aggregate basis, based on commitments outstanding from
investors and current quoted market prices. Net unrealized losses due to 
declines in the market value are included in the determination of net income.

Loan Fees and Discounts

Loan origination fees and certain direct costs are deferred and amortized using
the interest method over the contractual lives of the related loans, adjusted 
for prepayments, as a yield adjustment. Discounts and premiums on loans 
purchased, net of deferred fees, which are considered yield adjustments, are 
amortized using methods which approximate a level yield over the estimated 
remaining lives.

Allowance for Loan Losses

Provisions for possible losses on mortgage and other loans are charged to
operations based upon management's review of the loan portfolio. The allowance
is based upon an assessment of the net realizable value of collateral 
securing loans, loss experience and management's judgment as the risk 
inherent in the loan portfolio.

Loans

Loans are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Interest
on loans is recorded as it is earned. Allowances are established for uncollected
interest on loans for which payments are more than 90 days past due.

Real Estate

Real estate represents properties acquired through foreclosure, in judgment
(foreclosed real estate for which a redemption period still remains), and in-
substance foreclosure (real estate loans in which the borrower has little or no
equity, repayment can be expected to come only from sale or operation of the 
real estate and the borrower has formally or effectively abandoned control) 
and is carried at the lower of cost or fair value. 

Intangible Assets

Goodwill, the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired, is 
amortized to expense using the straight line and interest methods over periods
approximating the asset life of related long term assets, to a maximum of 25
years. Premiums paid for loan servicing rights are amortized against servicing
fee income over the estimated average life, adjusted for prepayments, of the
servicing portfolio acquired using the interest method. Accumulated amortization
of goodwill was $42.5 million and $38.4 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively. Intangible assets are reviewed periodically for possible
impairment.

<PAGE>

Office Properties and Equipment

Office properties and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation
computed using the straight line method based on estimated useful lives.

Interest Rate Exchange Agreements

Interest rate exchange agreements ("swaps") are designated as hedges against
future fluctuation's in the interest rates of specifically identified assets and
liabilities. The net interest differential resulting from floating rate interest
payments exchanged for fixed rate interest payments is recorded as incurred.

Protected Rate Agreements

Protected rate agreements ("caps") are designated as hedges against future
fluctuation's in the interest rates of specially identified liabilities. The
interest received is recorded on a current basis. The cost of the caps is
amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the caps.

Mortgage Options

Mortgage options ("puts") are designated as hedges against future fluctuation's 
in the price of specific mortgage loans held for sale. The premium paid for the
put is accounted for as a component of the book value of the mortgage loans and
is realized upon settlement of the loan sales.

Income Taxes

A consolidated federal income tax return is filed for the Company and its
subsidiaries. Deferred taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on
future years' differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and 
the financial reporting amounts at each year end and the expected future 
benefit of net operating loss and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards.

Cash Flow Information

Cash equivalents include cash and due from banks, short term interest bearing
deposits and federal funds sold. Cash paid for interest expense in 1993, 1992 
and 1991 was $278.5 million, $265.7 million and $299.2 million, respectively. 
Cash paid during 1993, 1992 and 1991 for income taxes was $8.5 million, $3.5 
million and $684,000, respectively. Cash received during 1993, 1992 and 1991 
as a recovery of income tax was $343,000, $379,000 and $97,000, respectively.

Earnings Per Share

Earnings per share has been computed using the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding during the period. Per share data reflects the 10
percent stock dividend declared in July 1993, the 100 percent stock dividend 
declared in June 1992, and the 20 percent stock dividend declared in 
September 1991. Amounts equal to the fair market value of the additional 
shares issued in 1993 have been charged to retained earnings and credited to 
common stock and paid-in capital. The stock dividends in 1992 and 1991 
represent stock splits effected in the form of a dividend, an accounted for 
as such.

The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding
used to compute primary earnings per share were 31,662,000, 28,384,000 and
21,646,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

The weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding
used to compute fully diluted earnings per share were 31,692,000, 30,613,000 and
28,494,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Business Combinations

On June 11, 1993, the acquisition of Western Financial Corporation ("Western")
and its federally chartered savings and loan association subsidiary Columbia 
Savings Association F.A. ("Columbia") was completed. Pursuant to the 
agreement and plan of merger, Western was merged into the Company and 
Columbia was merged into Metropolitan Federal Bank, fsb, ("the Bank"). Total 
merger consideration of approximately $21.9 million was paid in the form of 
cash and the Company's stock. The transaction was accounted for as a 
purchase and, accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to assets and 
liabilities based on the estimated fair value as of the acquisition date. 
Based on their election, Western shareholders received .55 shares of the
Company's common stock or $10 in cash for each Western share owned. The 
results of operations of Western for the period since June 12, 1993 have 
been included in the Company's consolidated results.

On August 6, 1993, the Bank completed its acquisition of Eureka Savings Bank,
fsb, Eureka, Kansas ("Eureka"). The acquisition consideration of approximately
$20.8 million was paid in cash and the transaction was accounted for as a
purchase. The results of operations of Eureka have been included in the 
Company's consolidated results of operations for the period since August 7, 
1993.

During 1992, the Company completed several acquisitions designed to expand into
markets not previously served by the Bank. The acquisitions of Home Owners
Savings Bank of Fergus Falls, Minnesota ("Home Owners") and American Charter
Federal Savings and Loan Association of Lincoln, Nebraska ("American Charter"),
were completed December 1 and December 16, respectively. Home Owners was 
acquired from the RTC and American Charter was acquired through a voluntary 
supervisory conversion merger. These acquisitions were accounted for as purchase
transactions. The operating results of Home Owners and American Charter have 
been included in the Company's consolidated results of operations from the 
dates of acquisition.

On September 30, 1992 the Company completed the acquisition of Security 
Financial Group, Inc., St. Cloud, Minnesota ("Security Financial"). The 
Company issued 963,740 shares of common stock, valued at $12.8 million at the
time of the transaction. The acquisition of Security Financial was accounted for
as a pooling of interests. Security Financial is not material to the financial 
condition or operating results of the Company, and therefore, prior years 
balances were not restated. However, 1992 amounts were adjusted to reflect the 
transaction as if it had occurred January 1, 1992.

The unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations for the years ended
December 31, 1993 and 1992, assuming the acquisitions of Western, Eureka, Home
Owners and American Charter were consummated as of January 1, 1992 are as
follows:

In February 1993 the Office of Thrift Supervision notified the Bank that its
application to acquire Rocky Mountain Financial Corporation ("Rocky Mountain"),
Cheyenne, Wyoming, and its bank subsidiary, Rocky Mountain Bank, fsb, had been
approved. Rocky Mountain had assets of $537 million and deposits of $428 million
at December 31, 1993. The banking subsidiary operates 14 branches located
throughout Wyoming. The Bank will pay Rocky Mountain shareholders approximately
$64.2 million in cash as consideration after payment of approximately $3.0
million of transaction expenses. The transaction will be accounted for as a
purchase and is expected to close in March 1994.

<PAGE>

The following valuation methods and assumptions were used by the Company in
estimating the fair value of financial instruments:

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The book value of cash and due from banks and short-term interest bearing
deposits approximates fair value.

Assets Available-For-Sale

The book value represents market value of these instruments.

Loans Held-For-Sale

The book value represents the lower of cost or market value of these instruments
determined on an aggregate basis based on commitments outstanding and current
quoted market prices.

Mortgage-backed Securities

Fair values are based on quoted market prices.

Loans 

The fair values for fixed rate, one to four family residential mortgage loans,
commercial real estate, commercial business, and consumer loans are calculated
using interest rates currently offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers
of similar credit quality.

FHLB Stock

Fair value for FHLB stock is based on the price at which it may be resold to the
FHLB.

Other Assets

Other assets represent unamortized premiums on interest rate caps and purchased
mortgage servicing rights. The fair value of the interest rate caps is 
determined using quoted market prices for instruments with similar rate and
maturity characteristics. The fair value of the loan servicing rights is
based on average loan balances, interest rates, pass-through rates and
estimated servicing cost per loan adjusted for assumptions on prepayments,
delinquencies and foreclosures.

Deposits

The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (i.e., interest and noninterest
bearing checking, passbook savings and money market accounts) are equal to the
amount payable on demand at the reporting date. Fair values for fixed-
maturity certificates of deposit are calculated using a discounted cash flow
analysis that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates.

Borrowings

The carrying amounts of short-term borrowings approximate their fair value. The
fair value of the Bank's long-term borrowing is calculated using a discounted
cash flow analysis, based on the Bank's current incremental borrowing rate for
similar types of borrowing. The subordinated notes are valued according to the
quoted market price.

Rate Swaps

The fair value of interest rate swaps is derived from a pricing model that
discounts the cash flows of both the paying side and receiving side of the swap
using quoted market rates of similar term instruments.

Commitments

Off-balance sheet commitments include commitments to originate mortgage loans 
and sell mortgage-backed securities. Outstanding commitments approximate fair
value.

Assets Available-For-Sale

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." As permitted under the Statement, 
the Company has elected to adopt the provisions of the Statement as of the end 
of 1993. In accordance with the Statement, prior period financial statements
have not been restated to reflect the change in accounting principle and there 
were no cumulative adjustments to income as a result of adopting the standard. 
However, the ending balance of shareholders' equity was increased by $4.2 
million (net of $2.8 million in deferred income taxes) to reflect net 
unrealized gains on securities classified as available-for-sale previously 
carried at amortized cost or LOCOM. Assets available-for-sale consisted of the

<PAGE>

Accrued interest on loans was $24.5 million and $19.9 million at December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively.

Origination of residential mortgage loans and consumer loans is concentrated in
the states of North Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, South Dakota,
Wisconsin and Arizona. The ability of borrowers to honor these loan obligations
is influenced by the general economic health of the region. The Company's loans
are generally secured by readily marketable collateral. In addition, the Company
requires some form of mortgage insurance, either government sponsored or
private, on residential mortgage loans with a greater than 80 percent loan to
value ratio. The Company's exposure to loss is equal to the net carrying value
of these loans.

At December 31, 1993, approximately $176 million of commitments to make
residential real estate mortgage loans at specific rates were outstanding. These
commitments are subject to the same credit risk, total risk of loss and
collateral policies, as originated loans. 

Loans serviced for others totaled $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion at December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively. Residential mortgage loans sold with recourse
totaled $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively. Recourse provisions for loans sold relate primarily to 
defaults. Substantially all loans sold with recourse have either government 
sponsored or private mortgage insurance. 

Loans at December 31, 1993 include $43.2 million of restructured loans, of which
$16.4 million are performing in accordance with the restructured terms. The
remaining $26.8 million are included in the Company's nonperforming loans.

In May 1993 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 114,
"Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan," effective for years 
beginning after December 15, 1994. SFAS No. 114 requires that impaired loans 
be valued at the present value of expected cash flows. The Company will be 
adopting SFAS No. 114 during the first quarter of 1994 and does not expect the 
statement to be material to the Company's financial position or results of 
operations.

FHLB advances--FHLB stock, real estate loans and mortgage-backed securities 
with a carrying value of $1.6 billion. 

Collateralized mortgage obligations--mortgage-backed securities with a 
carrying value of $41.5 million.

Accrued interest on borrowings was $849,000 and $1.4 million at December 31, 
1993 and 1992, respectively.

Interest Rate Exchange and Protected 

Rate Agreements

The Company has entered into interest rate exchange agreements ("swaps") with
primary securities dealers to stabilize its cost of funds. The notional 
principal amount of interest rate exchange agreements totaled $200 million 
and $250 million for 1993 and 1992, respectively. The Company pays a fixed rate
and receives a variable rate of interest on the stated notional principal 
amount for a fixed period of time. The Company's exposure to market risk 
results from a declining interest rate environment in which the fixed rate 
paid exceeds the variable rate received. These agreements are subject to the 
counterparty's ability to perform in accordance with the terms of the 
agreements. The Company's risk of loss is equal to the interest payments due 
from the counterparty. Net accrued interest payable on swaps was $3.0 million
and $3.8 million on December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

In connection with its asset and liability management program, during 1993 the
Company entered into protected rate agreements ("caps") in the aggregate 
notional amount of $450 million with varying maturities. Under the terms of 
the caps, the Company will be reimbursed for increases in the three-month 
London Inter-Bank Offer Rate ("LIBOR") for any quarter during the agreement 
in which such rate exceeds the "strike price", which ranges from 6 percent to
8 percent depending on the maturity of the cap. These agreements are subject to 
the counterparty's ability to perform in accordance with the terms of the 
agreements. The Company's risk of loss is equal to the original premiums paid
to enter into these agreements.

A summary of the interest rate caps is as follows:

Shareholders' Equity

Preferred Stock

The Company has 10,000,000 shares of $.01 par value preferred stock authorized.
At December 31, 1993, the Company had 488,750 units of Series B, $2.875
Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, issued and outstanding. 

The Company, at its option, redeemed the outstanding 1,840,000 shares of Series
A, $2.00 cumulative convertible preferred stock on April 20, 1992, for 5,753,166
shares of common stock and $400,000 to holders exercising the options to receive
cash.

Each unit of Series B preferred stock consists of one share of Cumulative
Perpetual Preferred Stock and one warrant to purchase 1.32 shares of Common
Stock. The preferred stock is redeemable at the option of the Company at a rate
of $25 per share. Redemption can occur at any time on or after January 31, 1996.
Each warrant entitles the holder to purchase 1.32 shares of the Company's Common
Stock at a price of $6.25. The warrants became exercisable on February 19, 1991,
and expire November 20, 2000. Warrants outstanding at December 31, 1993 allow
for the purchase of 408,751 shares of Common Stock and would result in total 
proceeds to the Company, if exercised, of approximately $1.9 million.

The Company's Series B preferred stock ranks prior to Common Stock as to
dividends and liquidation. The liquidation preference of the preferred stock 
is $25 per share plus accumulated unpaid dividends. Dividends on the 
preferred stock are cumulative and are to be paid at an annual rate of $2.875.

Shares of the Company's preferred stock have no voting rights except in the
event of certain arrearages in which event holders of the preferred stock will
be entitled to elect two additional directors to the Company's Board of
Directors.

Regulatory Capital Requirements

The Bank and its subsidiaries are required to meet capital requirements as
defined by the Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS") for Tangible, Core and Risk-
based Capital. The requirements call for measures of capital as a percentage of
assets. Required capital levels increase through July 1, 1994, at which time
the fully phased in capital requirements will be effective. At December 31, 
1993, the Bank exceeds all fully phased in requirements.

</TABLE>

A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some
portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In 1992, Metropolitan
established a valuation allowance for a portion of the operating loss
carryforwards as a result of unresolved matters with taxing authorities. During
1993, certain tax issues were resolved which were previously considered in
management's assessment of the valuation allowance. As a result, the Company has
reduced the remaining valuation allowance. The change in the deferred tax asset
valuation allowance of $10.9 million was recorded as a reduction of income tax
expense. 

The adjustments to the net deferred tax asset in 1993 identified as the "Effect
of acquisitions and other transactions" result primarily from the acquisitions
of Western Financial Corporation and Eureka Savings Bank, fsb and the exercise
of compensatory stock options.

At December 31, 1993, Metropolitan had the following income tax net operating
loss carryforwards available for income tax purposes:

</TABLE>

During the first quarter of 1992, the Company prospectively adopted SFAS No. 
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." In accordance with this statement, the 
Company recognized deferred tax assets reflecting the benefit expected to be 
realized from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs") of 
$182.4 million and net deductible temporary differences of approximately $35.8 
million.

The Company had taxable income and pre-tax book income for the periods presented
as follows:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
(In thousands) 1993 1992 1991
<S> <C> <C> <C>
Taxable income $68,490 $ 74,707 $15,471
Pre-tax book income 86,459 110,062 61,866
</TABLE>
The primary difference between taxable income and pre-tax book income in 1992
and 1993 relates to the reversal of net deductible temporary differences. In
1991 the primary difference between taxable income and pre-tax book income 
related to the federally assisted acquisitions of seven insolvent thrift 
institutions in 1988 and the related tax exempt assistance received in the 
form of interest on FSLIC notes and covered assets and other assistance 
payments. The tax exempt assistance is also the primary cause of NOLs.
The Company generated net taxable income in 1993, 1992 and 1991 resulting in 
the utilization of a portion of the NOLs. Except for the effects of the 
reversal of net deductible temporary differences, the Company is not 
currently aware of any factors which would cause any significant differences 
between taxable income and pre-tax book income in future years. However, 
there can be no assurances that there will be no significant differences in the
future between taxable income and pre-tax book income if circumstances change
(such as changes in tax laws or the Company's financial condition or 
performance).

In adopting SFAS No. 109 the Company recorded income and a deferred tax asset
equal to the cumulative effect of the accounting change of $75.9 million, $53.1
million of which remains at December 31, 1993. To fully realize the deferred tax
asset the Company will need to generate future taxable income of approximately
$133 million prior to expiration of the NOLs which will begin to expire in 2002.
Based on the Company's historical and current pre-tax earnings, management
believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefit of
the NOLs existing at December 31, 1993 before they begin to expire in 2002.
Further, management believes the existing net deductible temporary differences
will reverse during periods in which the Company generates net taxable income.
However, there can be no assurance that the Company will generate any 
earnings or specific level of continuing earnings.

The bank qualifies as a savings and loan institution as defined by the Internal
Revenue Code. As a qualifying savings and loan, the Bank is able to utilize an
available special tax provision for the bad debt reserve deduction which allows
the use of either the "experience" method or the "percentage of taxable income"
method in determining the annual allowable deduction.

Employee Benefits

Pension Plan

The Company has a defined benefit plan covering substantially all employees. The
benefits are based on years of service, minimum age requirements, and the
employee's compensation while employed with the Company. The Company's funding
policy is to contribute annually the maximum amount that can be deducted for
federal income tax purposes. The actuarial cost method used to compute pension
cost is the Projected Unit Credit method.

Net pension cost (income) included the following components:

The weighted average discount rate and rate of increase in future compensation
levels used in determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit
obligation were 7 percent at both December 31, 1993 and 1992. The expected long
term rate of return on plan assets in 1993, 1992 and 1991 was 7 percent.

<PAGE>

Postretirement Benefit Plan

In addition to the Company's defined pension benefit plan, the Company sponsors 
a defined benefit health care plan that provides postretirement benefits to 
eligible employees. The benefits, based on years of service, is contributory 
and contains cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance. The 
Company's policy is to fund the cost of medical benefits in amounts determined 
by management.

In 1993, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard No. 106 "Employers
Accounting For Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions." The Company's total
postretirement benefit cost for 1993 was $545,000. Postretirement benefit costs
for 1992 and 1991, which were recorded on a cash basis, have not been restated.
The postretirement benefit liability at December 31, 1993 was $499,000. Upon
adoption, the accumulated postretirement obligation was $2.4 million and
increased to $2.9 million at December 31, 1993. 

The weighted average annual assumed rate of increase in the per capita cost of
covered benefits is 13 percent for 1993 and is assumed to decrease gradually 
to 6 percent for 2001 and remain at that level thereafter. The health care 
cost trend rate assumption has minimal effect on the amounts reported. 
Increasing the assumed health care trend rates by one percentage point in 
each year would increase the aggregate of the service and interest cost 
components of the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for 1993 by 
$160,000. The weighted average discount rate used in determining 
postretirement benefit obligation was 7 percent at December 31, 1993.

The board of directors has approved a directors' retirement plan subject to
shareholder approval.

In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 112,
"Employers Accounting for Post Employment Benefits." The Company is required to
adopt this Statement in 1994. As of December 31, 1993, the Company had not
adopted Statement No. 112. No material effect on the financial condition of the
Company is anticipated when the statement is adopted.

Savings Plans

The Company has a defined contribution savings plan covering substantially all
employees. Eligibility is based on years of service and minimum age
requirements. Employees elect to contribute a percentage of their compensation.
Contributions are invested, at the direction of the employee, in one or more
funds or can be directed to purchase common stock of the Company at fair market
value. The Company makes matching contributions, invested solely in common stock
of the Company, up to a specified percentage of employee's compensation. Company
contributions vest over a period of five years. Total savings plan expense was
$2.5 million $2.0 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31,
1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Stock Purchase Plan

The Company established a shareholder approved Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"Plan") in 1992 for which 440,000 shares have been reserved. Under the Plan, the
Company conducts a series of offerings (each an "Offering") of its Common Stock,
each continuing for three months, beginning on January 1, April 1, July 1 and
October 1 of each year (the "Offering Date") and ending on March 31, June 30,
September 30 and December 31 of each year (the "Offering Period"). The per share
purchase price of the shares offered in a given Offering is the lower of 85
percent of the fair market value of one share of the Common Stock of the Company
on the first day of the Offering Period or the last day of the Offering Period.
Employees, subject to restrictions regarding length of service and age, may
designate a payroll deduction limited to a minimum deduction of $25 per pay
period and not exceeding an amount which would result in the purchase of Common
Stock with a fair value of more than $25,000 in any calendar year. During 1993,
a total of 353,450 shares were issued under the plan for an aggregate purchase
price of $4.4 million. 

Stock Option and Incentive Plans

The Company has three board of director approved stock option and incentive
plans, initiated in 1984, 1990 and 1993. The 1993 plan is pending shareholder
approval. Two types of options are granted under the plans, incentive and
nonqualified. Incentive options are exercisable on a phased in basis beginning
one year after issuance. Nonqualified options before October 1993 are fully
exercisable on the grant date. Nonqualified options after October 1993 are
exercisable on a phased in basis beginning one year after issuance. All options
expire ten years from the grant date. Under the 1993 plan,restricted stock
awards, performance units, stock bonuses and stock appreciation rights may also
be granted.

The company initiated a non-employee director stock option plan, approved by the
shareholders, in 1993. The options are exercisable one year after issuance. The
grant of incentive and nonqualified stock options is to be made at the
discretion of the committee responsible for administering the plans and is to
be set forth in the option agreement.

Note P
Parent Company Financial Information

The Company's ability to pay cash dividends depends upon the cash dividends it
receives from the Bank, Edina Realty and Equity Title.

The Bank is required to give the OTS thirty day notice prior to declaration of a
cash dividend to the parent company. The Bank's dividends to the parent 
company are generally limited to the calendar year's earnings plus 50 percent
of the surplus capital (the percentage by which the ratio of its regulatory 
capital to assets ratio exceeds the fully phased in ratio) at the beginning 
of the year.

Report of Independent Auditors
Board of Directors and Shareholders
Metropolitan Financial Corporation
Minneapolis, Minnesota

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of condition of
Metropolitan Financial Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and
1992 and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders'
equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1993. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Metropolitan
Financial Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the 
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the 
three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note D to the financial statements, in 1993 the Company changed
its method of accounting for certain debt and equity securities. Also, as
discussed in Note O to the financial statements, in 1993 the Company changed its
method of accounting for certain postretirement benefits provided to its
employees.

not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally 
accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In 
the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal 
recurring accruals and periodic changes in estimates) considered

Operating results for the three months ended March 31, 1994, are not 
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year 
ending December 31, 1994. Amounts have been reclassified to conform to 
the current period presentation. For further information, refer to the 
consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the 
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993.

=========================================================
</TABLE>

The adjustments to the net deferred tax asset in 1994 identified as the 
"Effect of acquisitions and other transactions" result primarily from 
the acquisition of Rocky Mountain Financial Corporation and the exercise 
of compensatory stock options.

A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not, that 
some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. The 
Company established a valuation allowance for a portion of the operating 
loss carryforwards as a result of unresolved matters with taxing 
authorities. During 1993, certain tax issues were resolved which were 
previously considered in management's assessment of the valuation 
allowance. As a result, the Company reduced the valuation allowance by 
$10 million during the first quarter of 1993. The remaining $6.5 
million valuation allowance was eliminated in the last half of 1993. 
Approximately $10.6 million of the change in the deferred tax asset 
valuation allowance ($10 million in first quarter 1993) was allocated as 
a reduction of income tax expense. At March 31, 1994, the Company had the 
following net operating loss carryforwards available for income tax
purposes:

NOTE C--Acquisitions

On March 25, 1994, the Bank completed the acquisition of Rocky Mountain
Financial Corporation ("RMFC"), and its federally chartered thrift 
subsidiary Rocky Mountain Bank, FSB ("Rocky Mountain"), Cheyenne, 
Wyoming. Pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, the Bank purchased 
all of the outstanding stock of RMFC, which was liquidated and dissolved 
and Rocky Mountain was merged into the Bank. Total consideration of 
$64.2 million was paid in cash to the stockholders of RMFC, after 
consideration of approximately $3.0 million of transaction expenses. 
The transaction was accounted for as a purchase. Rocky Mountain had 
assets of $537 million and deposits of $428 million as of March 25, 
1994. The results of operations of RMFC and Rocky Mountain for the 
period March 26, 1994 through March 31, 1994 have been included in the 
Company's consolidated first quarter results.

In addition, on March 11, 1994, the Bank completed the acquisition of 
$12.5 million in deposits of two branches of Pioneer Federal Savings and
Loan Association, a failed thrift in Kansas.

ARTICLE 1

MERGER

Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article 6, on a date mutually satisfactory to the parties as soon as practicable
following receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("FRB") and the Office of Thrift
Supervision (the "OTS"), MFC will merge with and into FBS. FBS, in its capacity
as the corporation surviving the Merger, is sometimes referred to herein as the
"Surviving Corporation." The Merger will be effected pursuant to the provisions
of, and with the effect provided in, Section 251 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL").

1.1. Effect of Merger.
---------------- 

(a) On the Effective Date (as defined in Section 1.1(d)), MFC shall be
merged with and into FBS, and the separate existence of MFC shall cease. The
Charter (as defined Section 2.2) and Bylaws of FBS, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Date, shall be the Charter and the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation until further amended as provided therein and in
accordance with law. The directors of FBS immediately prior to the Effective
Date will be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors
are elected and qualify.

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall thereupon and thereafter be responsible
and liable for all the liabilities, debts, obligations and penalties of each of
FBS and MFC.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall thereupon and thereafter possess all
the rights, privileges, immunities and franchises, of a public as well as of a
private nature, of each of FBS and MFC; all property, real, personal and mixed,
and all debts due on whatever account, and all and every other interest, of or
belonging to or due to each of FBS and MFC, shall be taken and deemed to be
transferred to and vested in the Surviving Corporation without further act or
deed; and the title to any real estate or any interest therein, vested in FBS
and MFC, shall not revert or be in any way impaired by reason of the Merger.

(d) To effect the Merger, the parties hereto will cause a certificate of
merger relating to the Merger to be filed with the Secretary of State of
Delaware. The Merger shall be effective upon the filing of such certificate of
merger. As used herein, the term "Effective Date" shall mean the date on which
the certificate of merger is filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware.

1.2. Effect on Outstanding Shares of MFC Capital Stock.
------------------------------------------------- 

To effectuate the Merger and subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement:

-2-

<PAGE>

(a) each issued and outstanding share of MFC Common Stock (other than
shares held as treasury stock of MFC or shares held directly or indirectly by
FBS, other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in satisfaction of a debt
previously contracted) shall be converted into .6803 shares of FBS Common Stock,
and FBS shall issue to holders of MFC Common Stock .6803 shares of FBS Common
Stock (the "Exchange Ratio"), subject to adjustment as provided in Section 1.3,
in exchange for each such share of MFC Common Stock;

(b) all outstanding options and warrants to purchase shares of MFC Common
Stock shall be exchanged for options and warrants to purchase FBS Common Stock,
or shares of FBS Common Stock, as provided in Section 5.14;

(c) each issued and outstanding share of MFC Preferred Stock (other than
shares as to which the holders thereof have asserted and not effectively
withdrawn or otherwise lost their appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of
the DGCL ("Dissenters' Shares")) shall be converted into the right to receive
$27.00 in cash, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends on such shares of MFC
Preferred Stock to, but excluding, the Effective Date calculated as set forth in
the terms of such MFC Preferred Stock, without interest, from FBS (the
"Preferred Consideration"), and FBS shall pay to holders of such MFC Preferred
Stock the Preferred Consideration in exchange for each such share of MFC
Preferred Stock;

(d) Dissenters' Shares shall be purchased and paid for in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL; and

(e) each share of MFC Common Stock held as treasury stock of MFC or held
directly or indirectly by FBS, other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or
in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted, shall be canceled, retired and
cease to exist, and no exchange or payment shall be made with respect thereof.

1.3. FBS Common Stock Adjustments.
---------------------------- 

(a) If the average of the closing prices of FBS Common Stock as quoted on
the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") for the 20 trading days ending three
business days prior to the last date of the meetings of shareholders scheduled
to obtain the shareholder approvals referred to in Section 5.20 (the "Average
Price") is less than $33.00, then, subject to Section 7.1(e), the Exchange Ratio
will be adjusted by multiplying the Exchange Ratio by the quotient of (i) $33.00
divided by (ii) the Average Price.

(b) If the Average Price is greater than $40.50, then the Exchange Ratio
will be adjusted by multiplying the Exchange Ratio by the quotient of (i) $40.50
divided by (ii) the Average Price.

(c) If, between the date hereof and the Effective Date, shares of FBS
Common Stock shall be changed into a different number of shares or a different
class of shares by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, split-up,

-3-

<PAGE>

combination, exchange of shares or readjustment, or if a stock dividend thereon
shall be declared with a record date within such period, then the number of
shares of FBS Common Stock issued to holders of MFC Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement will be appropriately and proportionately adjusted so that the
number of such shares of FBS Common Stock (or such class of shares into which
shares of FBS Common Stock have been changed) that will be issued to holders of
MFC Common Stock will equal the number of such shares that holders of MFC Common
Stock would have received pursuant to such classification, recapitalization,
split-up, combination, exchange of shares or readjustment had the record date
therefor been immediately following the Effective Date.

1.4. Rights of Holders of MFC Capital Stock; Capital Stock of FBS.
------------------------------------------------------------ 

(a) On and after the Effective Date and until surrendered for exchange,
each outstanding stock certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Date
represented shares of MFC Common Stock shall be deemed for all purposes, except
as provided in Section 1.6(c), to evidence ownership of and to represent the
number of whole shares of FBS Common Stock into which such shares of MFC Common
Stock shall have been converted, and the record holder of such outstanding
certificate shall, after the Effective Date, be entitled to vote the shares of
FBS Common Stock into which such shares of MFC Common Stock shall have been
converted on any matters on which the holders of record of FBS Common Stock, as
of any date subsequent to the Effective Date, shall be entitled to vote. In any
matters relating to such certificates, FBS may rely conclusively upon the record
of shareholders maintained by MFC containing the names and addresses of the
holders of record of MFC Common Stock on the Effective Date.

(b) On and after the Effective Date and until surrendered for exchange,
each outstanding stock certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Date
represented shares of MFC Preferred Stock (other than Dissenters' Shares) shall
be deemed for all purposes to represent the right to receive the Preferred
Consideration from FBS. In any matters relating to such certificates, FBS may
rely conclusively upon the record of shareholders maintained by MFC containing
the names and address of the holders of record of MFC Preferred Stock on the
Effective Date.

(c) On and after the Effective Date, each share of FBS Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date shall remain an issued
and existing share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall not be
affected by the Merger.

(d) On and after the Effective Date, FBS shall reserve a sufficient number
of authorized but unissued shares of FBS Common Stock for issuance in connection
with the conversion of MFC Common Stock into FBS Common Stock as provided
herein.

1.5. No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of FBS Common Stock, and no
certificates representing such fractional shares, shall be issued upon the

-4-

<PAGE>

surrender for exchange of certificates representing MFC Common Stock. In lieu of
any fractional share, FBS shall pay to each holder of MFC Common Stock who
otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of FBS Common Stock an
amount of cash (without interest) determined by multiplying (a) the closing
price per share of FBS Common Stock on the Effective Date times (b) the
fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled.

1.6. Procedure for Exchange of Stock.
------------------------------- 

(a) After the Effective Date, holders of certificates theretofore
evidencing outstanding shares of MFC Common Stock or MFC Preferred Stock, upon
surrender of such certificates to an exchange agent appointed by FBS (the
"Exchange Agent"), shall be entitled to receive, (i) in the case of MFC Common
Stock, (A) certificates representing the number of whole shares of FBS Common
Stock into which shares of MFC Common Stock theretofore represented by the
certificates so surrendered shall have been converted as provided in
Section 1.2(a) and (B) cash payments in lieu of fractional shares, if any, as
provided in Section 1.5, and (ii) in the case of MFC Preferred Stock, the
Preferred Consideration. As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, FBS
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail appropriate and customary transmittal
materials (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title to the certificates theretofore representing shares of MFC Common
Stock or MFC Preferred Stock shall pass, only upon proper delivery of such
certificates to the Exchange Agent) to each holder of MFC Common Stock and MFC
Preferred Stock of record as of the Effective Date advising such holder of the
effectiveness of the Merger and the procedure for surrendering to the Exchange
Agent outstanding certificates formerly evidencing MFC Common Stock in exchange
for new certificates for FBS Common Stock and outstanding certificates formerly
evidencing MFC Preferred Stock in exchange for the Preferred Consideration. FBS
shall not be obligated to deliver the consideration to which any former holder
of shares of MFC Common Stock or MFC Preferred Stock is entitled as a result of
the Merger until such holder surrenders the certificate or certificates
representing such shares for exchange as provided in such transmittal materials
and this Section 1.6(a). In addition, certificates surrendered for exchange by
any person deemed an "affiliate" of MFC (as defined in Section 5.10), shall not
be exchanged for such consideration until FBS has received a written agreement
from such person as provided in Section 5.10. Upon surrender, each certificate
evidencing MFC Common Stock or MFC Preferred Stock shall be canceled.

(b) On the Effective Date, FBS shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for exchange in accordance with this
Section 1.6, certificates representing the shares of FBS Common Stock and the
cash in lieu of fractional shares and cash for payment of the Preferred
Consideration (such certificates and cash, hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund") to be issued or paid by FBS pursuant to this Article 1 in
connection with the Merger.

(c) Until outstanding certificates formerly representing MFC Common Stock
are surrendered as provided in Section 1.6(a), no dividend or distribution

-5-

<PAGE>

payable to holders of record of FBS Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of
such outstanding certificates, but upon surrender of such outstanding
certificates by such holder there shall be paid to such holder the amount of any
dividends or distributions (without interest) theretofore paid with respect to
such whole shares of FBS Common Stock, but not paid to such holder, and which
dividends or distributions had a record date occurring on or subsequent to the
Effective Date.

(d) After the Effective Date, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of MFC of outstanding certificates formerly
representing shares of MFC Common Stock or MFC Preferred Stock and, if a
certificate formerly representing such shares is presented to MFC or FBS, it
shall be forwarded to the Exchange Agent for cancellation and exchange for
certificates representing shares of FBS Common Stock or the Preferred
Consideration, as applicable, as herein provided.

(e) All shares of FBS Common Stock and cash for any fractional shares
issued and paid upon the surrender for exchange of MFC Common Stock and all
Preferred Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of MFC Preferred
Stock in accordance with the above terms and conditions shall be deemed to have
been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of MFC Common Stock and MFC Preferred Stock, respectively.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof and any FBS Common Stock or any dividends or distributions
thereon) that remains unclaimed by the holders of MFC Common Stock or MFC
Preferred Stock for six months after the Effective Date shall be repaid to FBS.
Any holders of MFC Common Stock or MFC Preferred Stock who have not theretofore
complied with this Section 1.6 shall thereafter look only to FBS for payment of
their shares of FBS Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares and any
unpaid dividends and distributions on the FBS Common Stock deliverable in
respect of each share of MFC Common Stock or cash in an amount equal to the
Preferred Consideration payable in respect of each share of MFC Preferred Stock,
as the case may be, that such holder holds as determined pursuant to this
Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. If outstanding
certificates for shares of MFC Common Stock or MFC Preferred Stock are not
surrendered or the payment for them not claimed prior to the date on which such
payments would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any governmental
unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned
property and any other applicable law, become the property of FBS (and to the
extent not in its possession shall be paid over to it), free and clear of all
claims or interest of any person previously entitled to such claims.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of FBS, the Exchange Agent or any other
person shall be liable to any former holder of MFC Common Stock or MFC Preferred
Stock for any amount delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(g) In the event any certificate for MFC Common Stock or MFC Preferred
Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue
and

-6-
<PAGE>

pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, (i) in the case of
MFC Common Stock, such shares of FBS Common Stock and cash for fractional
shares, if any, and (ii) in the case of MFC Preferred Stock, such Preferred
Consideration, each as may be required pursuant to this Agreement; provided,
however, that FBS may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the
issuance and payment thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as it may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against FBS, MFC, the Exchange
Agent or any other party with respect to the certificate alleged to have been
lost, stolen or destroyed.

(h) Any Dissenters' Shares shall not be converted into the Preferred
Consideration or the right to receive the Preferred Consideration unless and
until the holder of such Dissenters' Shares shall have effectively withdrawn or
otherwise lost the right to appraisal of and payment for such shares under the
DGCL, at which time such shares shall be converted into the Preferred
Consideration, and the right to receive the Preferred Consideration, as provided
in Section 1.2(c). MFC shall give prompt notice to FBS of any demands received
from holders of MFC Preferred Stock for appraisal of and payment for their
shares. MFC shall not, except with the prior written consent of FBS,
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
such demands for appraisal.

pledge, security interest, encumbrance or charge of any kind, other than
encumbrances arising as a result of requisite regulatory approvals for transfer.
Except for the stock of the Subsidiaries owned by MFC and as otherwise disclosed

has had or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
business, operations or financial condition of MFC and the Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or the ability of MFC to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

3.11. Absence of Certain Developments. Except as set forth in the Latest

<PAGE>

(b) Schedule 3.12(b) correctly sets forth a brief description, including
the term, of each lease for real or personal property to which MFC or any of the
Subsidiaries is a party as lessee with respect to (i) each individual lease
which involves a remaining aggregate balance of lease payments payable of more
than $100,000 or any group of related leases which involves a remaining
aggregate balance of lease payments payable of more than $100,000, (ii) each
lease which is a "material contract" within the meaning of Item 601(b)(10) of
Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC or (iii) each lease which was not entered

FBS complete and accurate copies of each of the leases described on
Schedules 3.12(a) and 3.12(b), and none of such leases has been modified in any
material respect, except to the extent that such modifications are disclosed by
the copies delivered to FBS. The leases described on Schedules 3.12(a) and
3.12(b) are in full force and effect. MFC or one of the Subsidiaries (if lessee
under such lease) has a valid and existing leasehold interest under each lease
described on Schedule 3.12(b) for the term set forth therein. With respect to
the leases described on Schedule 3.12(b), neither MFC nor any of the
Subsidiaries is in default, nor, to the best knowledge of MFC and the
Subsidiaries, are any of the other parties to any of such leases in default,
and, to the best knowledge of MFC and the Subsidiaries, no circumstances (not in
the control of MFC and the Subsidiaries) exist which could result in such a
default under any of such leases. To the best knowledge of MFC and the
Subsidiaries, there has been no cancellation, breach or anticipated breach by
any other party to any lease described on Schedule 3.12(a) or 3.12(b). The rent
rolls set forth on Schedules 3.12(a) and 3.12(b) are true and complete in all

occupancy.

(c) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.12(c), all of the buildings,
fixtures, furniture and equipment necessary for the conduct of the business of
MFC and each of the Subsidiaries are in good condition and repair, ordinary wear
and tear excepted, and are usable in the ordinary course of business. Each of
MFC and the Subsidiaries owns, or leases under valid leases, all buildings,
fixtures, furniture, personal property, land improvements and equipment
necessary for the conduct of its business as it is presently being conducted.

(d) Except as set forth in Schedules 3.12(d) and 3.12(e), neither MFC nor
any of the Subsidiaries nor any of the buildings owned or leased by MFC or any
of the Subsidiaries is in violation of any applicable zoning ordinance or other
law, regulation or requirement relating to the operation of any properties used
in the operation of its business, including, without limitation, applicable
environmental protection laws and regulations, which violations would,
individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
business, operations or financial condition of MFC and the Subsidiaries taken as
a whole; and neither MFC nor any of the Subsidiaries has received any notice of
any such violation, or of the existence of any condemnation proceeding with
respect to any properties owned or leased by MFC or any of the Subsidiaries.
Except as set forth in Schedule 3.12(d), no hazardous substances, hazardous
wastes, pollutants or contaminants have been deposited or

-18-

<PAGE>

disposed of in, on or under MFC's or any of the Subsidiaries' owned or leased
properties (including properties owned, managed or controlled by the Bank in
connection with its lending or fiduciary operations) during the period in which
MFC or any of the Subsidiaries has owned, occupied, managed, controlled or
operated such properties, except to the extent not material to the business,
operations or financial conditions of MFC and the Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. To the best knowledge of MFC and the Subsidiaries, no prior owners,
occupants or operators of all or any part of MFC's or any of the Subsidiaries'
owned or leased properties (including properties owned, managed or controlled by
the Bank in connection with its lending or fiduciary operations) ever used such
properties as a dump or gasoline service station, or deposited, disposed of or
allowed to be deposited or disposed of in, on or under such properties any
hazardous substances, hazardous wastes, pollutants or contaminants, except to
the extent not material to the business, operations or financial conditions of
MFC and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No asbestos or any material amount
of ureaformaldehyde materials exists in or on any of MFC's or the Subsidiaries'
owned or leased properties (including properties owned, managed or controlled by
the Bank in connection with its lending or fiduciary operations), and no
electrical transformers or capacitors, other than those owned by public utility
companies, on such properties contain any PCBs. The representations contained in
this Section 3.12(d) are not applicable to properties securing loans made by the
Bank where the loans were made in the ordinary course of business and are fully
performing in accordance with their terms.

(e) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.12(e), there are no aboveground or
underground tanks (excluding hot water storage or propane tanks) located under,
in or about, nor, to the best knowledge of MFC and the Subsidiaries, have there
ever been any such tanks located under, in or about, any of MFC's or any of the
Subsidiaries' owned or leased properties (including properties owned, managed or
controlled by the Bank in connection with its lending or fiduciary operations).

3.13. Tax Matters. Each of MFC, the Subsidiaries and all members of any
consolidated, affiliated, combined or unitary group of which MFC or any of the
Subsidiaries is a member have filed or will file all Tax (as hereinafter
defined) and Tax information returns or reports required to be filed (taking
into account permissible extensions) by them on or prior to the Effective Date,
and have paid (or have accrued or will accrue, prior to the Effective Date,
amounts for the payment of) all Taxes relating to the time periods covered by
such returns and reports. The accrued taxes payable accounts for Taxes and
provision for deferred income taxes, specifically identified as such, on the
Latest Balance Sheets are sufficient for the payment of all unpaid Taxes of MFC
and the Subsidiaries accrued for or applicable to all periods ended on or prior
to the date of the Latest Balance Sheet or which may subsequently be determined
to be owing with respect to any such period. Except as disclosed on Schedule
3.13, neither MFC nor any of the Subsidiaries has waived any statute of
limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to an assessment or deficiency for Taxes. Each of MFC and the
Subsidiaries has paid or will pay in a timely manner and as required by law all
Taxes due and payable by it or which it is obligated to withhold from amounts
owing to any

-19-
<PAGE>

employee or third party. All Taxes which will be due and payable, whether now or
hereafter, for any period ending on, prior to or including the Effective Date
shall have been paid by or on behalf of MFC and the Subsidiaries or shall be
reflected on the books of MFC and the Subsidiaries as an accrued Tax liability
determined in a manner which is consistent with past practices and the Latest
Balance Sheets. No Tax returns of MFC or the Subsidiaries have been audited by
any governmental authority other than as disclosed on Schedule 3.13; and, except
as set forth on Schedule 3.13, there are no unresolved questions, claims or
disputes asserted by any relevant taxing authority concerning the liability for
Taxes of MFC or any of the Subsidiaries. Neither MFC nor any of the Subsidiaries
has made an election under Section 341(f) of the Code for any taxable years not
yet closed for statute of limitations purposes. No demand or claim has been made
against MFC or any of the Subsidiaries with respect to any Taxes arising out of
membership or participation in any consolidated, affiliated, combined or unitary
group of which MFC or any of its Subsidiaries was at any time a member. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Tax" shall mean any federal, state, local
or foreign income, gross receipts, license, payroll, employment, excise,
severance, stamp, occupation, premium, property or windfall profits tax,
environmental tax, customs duty, capital stock, franchise, employees' income
withholding, foreign or domestic withholding, social security, unemployment,

respect of the foregoing, for each of MFC, the Subsidiaries and all members of
any consolidated, affiliated, combined or unitary group of which MFC or any of
the Subsidiaries is a member.

actions, suits, proceedings, orders or investigations pending or, to the best
knowledge of MFC and the Subsidiaries, threatened against MFC or any of the
Subsidiaries, at law or in equity, or before or by any federal, state or other

no actions, suits or claims pending against MFC or any Subsidiary relating
to benefits other than routine, uncontested claims for benefits.

(vii) Prohibited Transaction. Neither MFC nor any of the Subsidiaries
nor any officer, director, employee, agent or fiduciary of any Plan has

administered in accordance with their terms in all material respects. To

treatment and tax benefits, all Plans comply in all material respects with
the requirements of ERISA and the Code. All Tax information returns or

benefits under any long-term disability plan sponsored by MFC or any of the
Subsidiaries or (B) military service leave of absence. All employees of MFC
or any of the Subsidiaries are "at will" employees.

(xiii) Parachute Payments. No Plan requires or would result,
separately or in the aggregate, in the payment of any "excess parachute
payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not

-24-
<PAGE>

be a factor in causing payments to be made by FBS, MFC or any of the
Subsidiaries that are not deductible (in whole or in part) under
Section 280G of the Code.

3.19. Insurance. Schedule 3.19 hereto lists each insurance policy
maintained by MFC or any of the Subsidiaries with respect to its properties and

child or adult child living at the home of any such officer or director), nor
any entity which any of such persons "controls" (within the meaning of
Regulation O of the FRB), has any loan agreement, note or borrowing arrangement
or any other agreement with MFC or any of the Subsidiaries (other than normal
employment arrangements) or any interest in any property, real, personal or

any of the Subsidiaries.

3.21. Compliance with Laws; Permits. Each of MFC and the Subsidiaries has
complied in all respects with all applicable laws and regulations of foreign,
federal, state and local governments and all agencies thereof which affect the
business or any owned or leased properties of MFC or any of the Subsidiaries and
to which MFC or any of the Subsidiaries may be subject (including, without
limitation, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the HOLA, the FDIA,
the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of
1975, the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Federal
Reserve Act, each as amended, and any other state or federal acts (including
rules and regulations thereunder) regulating or otherwise affecting employee
health and safety or the environment), except where failure to so comply would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the
business, operations or financial condition of MFC and the Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or MFC's ability to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby;
and no claims have been filed by any such governments or agencies against MFC or
any of the Subsidiaries alleging such a violation of any such law or regulation
which have not been resolved to the satisfaction of such governments or
agencies. Each of MFC and the Subsidiaries holds all of the permits, licenses,
certificates and other authorizations of foreign, federal, state and local
governmental agencies required for the conduct of its business, except where
failure to obtain such authorizations would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the business, operations or
financial condition of MFC and the Subsidiaries, taken as whole, or the ability
of MFC to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. Except as disclosed
in Schedule 3.21, neither MFC nor any of the Subsidiaries is subject to any
cease and desist order, written agreement or memorandum of understanding with,
or is a

-25-

<PAGE>

party to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or is subject
to any order or directive by, or is a recipient of any extraordinary supervisory
agreement letter from, or has adopted any board resolutions at the request of,
federal or state governmental authorities charged with the supervision or
regulation of savings banks, banks, savings and loan holding companies or bank
holding companies or engaged in the insurance of bank deposits (collectively,
the "Bank Regulators"), nor have any of MFC or any of the Subsidiaries been
advised by any Bank Regulator that it is contemplating issuing or requesting (or
is considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such order,
directive, written agreement, memorandum of understanding, extraordinary
supervisory letter, commitment letter, board resolutions or similar undertaking.
Neither MFC nor any Subsidiary is subject to Section 32 of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act.

3.22. Administration of Fiduciary Accounts. Each Subsidiary has
properly administered, in all respects material and which could reasonably be
expected to be material to the business, operations or financial condition of
MFC and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, all accounts for which it acts as a
fiduciary, including but not limited to accounts for which it serves as a
trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or
investment advisor, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents and
applicable state and federal law and regulation and common law. Neither MFC, any
Subsidiary, nor any director, officer or employee of MFC or any Subsidiary has
committed any breach of trust with respect to any such fiduciary account which
is material to or could reasonably be expected to be material to the business,
operations or financial condition of MFC and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and correct in all
material respects and accurately reflect the assets of such fiduciary account in
all material respects.

3.23. Disclosure. The representations and warranties of MFC contained
in this Agreement are true and correct in all material respects, and such
representations and warranties do not omit any material fact necessary to make
the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. There is no fact known to MFC and the Subsidiaries
which has not been disclosed to FBS pursuant to this Agreement, the Schedules
hereto and the MFC 10-K Reports and the MFC 10-Q Report, all taken together as a
whole, which would have or would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the business, operations or financial condition of MFC and the
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the ability of MFC to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

3.24. Prospectus/Proxy Statement. At the time the Prospectus/Proxy
Statement is mailed to the shareholders of FBS and MFC in order to obtain
approvals referred to in Section 5.9(a) and at all times subsequent to such
mailing up to and including the times of such approvals, such Prospectus/Proxy
Statement (including any supplements thereto), with respect to all information
set forth therein relating to MFC (including the Subsidiaries) and its
shareholders, MFC Common Stock, this Agreement, the Merger and all other
transactions

-26-
<PAGE>

contemplated hereby, will (a) comply in all material respects with
applicable provisions of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act, and (b) not contain any
untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements contained therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

3.25. Pooling of Interests. Neither MFC nor any of the Subsidiaries
has taken or agreed to take any action which would disqualify the Merger as a
"pooling of interests" for accounting purposes.

3.26. Regulatory Approvals. As of the date hereof, MFC is not aware of
any reason that the regulatory approvals specified in Section 5.1 would not be
obtained.

3.27. Interest Rate Risk Management Instruments.
----------------------------------------- 

(a) Schedule 3.27 sets forth a true, correct and complete list of all
interest rate swaps, caps, floors and option agreements and other interest rate
risk management arrangements to which MFC or any of the Subsidiaries is a party
or by which any of their properties or assets may be bound. MFC has delivered
or made available to FBS true, correct and complete copies of all such interest
rate risk management agreements and arrangements.

(b) All interest rate swaps, caps, floors and option agreements and
other interest rate risk management arrangements to which MFC or any of the
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their properties or assets may be
bound were entered into in the ordinary course of business and, to MFC's
knowledge, in accordance with prudent banking practice and applicable rules,
regulations and policies of the Bank Regulators and with counterparties believed
to be financially responsible at the time and are legal, valid and binding
obligations enforceable in accordance with their terms (except as may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws affecting
the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable remedies),
and are in full force and effect. MFC and each of the Subsidiaries has duly
performed in all material respects all of its obligations thereunder to the
extent that such obligations to perform have accrued; and to MFC's knowledge,
there are no breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions of
such by any party thereunder.

or before the Effective Date where the due date for such returns or reports
(taking into account valid extensions of the respective due dates) falls on or
before the Effective Date; provided, however, that neither MFC nor any of the
Subsidiaries shall file any such Tax returns, or other returns, elections or
information statements with respect to any liabilities for Taxes (other than
federal, state or local sales, use, withholding or employment tax returns or
statements), or consent to any adjustment or otherwise compromise or settle any
matters with respect to Taxes, without prior consultation with FBS; provided,
further, that neither MFC nor any of the Subsidiaries shall make any election or
take any other discretionary position with respect to Taxes, in a manner
inconsistent with past practices, without the prior written approval of FBS,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. In the event the granting or
withholding of such approval by FBS results in additional Taxes owing for any
Tax period ending on or before the Effective Date, liability for such additional
Taxes shall

-33-
<PAGE>

not cause any representation of MFC relating to Taxes to be untrue. MFC shall
provide FBS with a copy of appropriate workpapers, schedules, drafts and final
copies of each federal and state income Tax return or election of MFC and each
of the Subsidiaries (including returns of all Plans) at least seven days before
filing such return or election and shall reasonably cooperate with any request
by FBS in connection therewith.

(b) FBS, in its sole and absolute discretion, will file (or cause to be
filed) all Tax returns of MFC and each of the Subsidiaries due after the
Effective Date. After the Effective Date, FBS, in its sole and absolute
discretion and to the extent permitted by law, shall have the right to amend,
modify or otherwise change all Tax returns of MFC and each of the Subsidiaries
for all Tax periods.

5.9. Registration Statement.
---------------------- 

(a) For the purposes (i) of holding meetings of the shareholders of FBS and
MFC to approve this Agreement and the Merger and (ii) of registering the FBS
Common Stock to be issued to holders of MFC Common Stock and of options under
the MFC Stock Option Plans (as defined in Section 5.14(a)) in connection with
the Merger with the SEC and with applicable state securities authorities, the
parties hereto shall cooperate in the preparation of an appropriate registration
statement (such registration statement, together with all and any amendments and
supplements thereto, being herein referred to as the "Registration Statement"),
which shall include a prospectus/joint proxy statement satisfying all applicable
requirements of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, applicable state securities laws and
the rules and regulations thereunder (such prospectus/joint proxy statement,
together with any and all amendments or supplements thereto, being herein
referred to as the "Prospectus/Proxy Statement").

(b) FBS shall furnish such information concerning FBS as is necessary in
order to cause the Prospectus/Proxy Statement, insofar as it relates to FBS, to
be prepared in accordance with Section 5.9(a). FBS agrees promptly to advise
MFC if at any time prior to the FBS or MFC shareholders' meetings any
information provided by FBS in the Prospectus/Proxy Statement becomes incorrect
or incomplete in any material respect, and to provide the information needed to
correct such inaccuracy or omission.

(c) MFC shall furnish FBS with such information concerning MFC and the
Subsidiaries as is necessary in order to cause the Prospectus/Proxy Statement,
insofar as it relates to MFC and the Subsidiaries, to be prepared in accordance
with Section 5.9(a). MFC agrees promptly to advise FBS if at any time prior to
the FBS or MFC shareholders' meetings any information provided by MFC in the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement becomes incorrect or incomplete in any material
respect, and to provide FBS with the information needed to correct such
inaccuracy or omission.

-34-
<PAGE>

(d) FBS shall promptly file the Registration Statement with the SEC and
applicable state securities agencies. FBS shall use reasonable efforts to cause
the Registration Statement to become effective under the 1933 Act and applicable
state securities laws at the earliest practicable date. MFC authorizes FBS to
utilize in the Registration Statement the information concerning MFC and the
Subsidiaries provided to FBS for the purpose of inclusion in the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement. MFC shall have the right to review and comment on
the form of proxy statement included in the Registration Statement. FBS shall
advise MFC promptly when the Registration Statement has become effective and of
any supplements or amendments thereto, and FBS shall furnish MFC with copies of
all such documents. Prior to the Effective Date or the termination of this
Agreement, each party shall consult with the other with respect to any material
(other than the Prospectus/Proxy Statement) that might constitute a "prospectus"
relating to the Merger within the meaning of the 1933 Act.

(e) FBS shall use reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to MFC a
letter relating to the Registration Statement from Ernst & Young, FBS's
independent auditors, dated a date within two business days before the date on
which the Registration Statement shall become effective and addressed to MFC, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to MFC and customary in scope and
substance for letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection
with registration statements similar to the Registration Statement.

(f) MFC shall use reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered to FBS a
letter relating to the Registration Statement from Ernst & Young, MFC's
independent auditors, dated a date within two business days before the date on
which the Registration Statement shall become effective and addressed to FBS, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to FBS and customary in scope and
substance for letters delivered by independent public accountants in connection
with registration statements similar to the Registration Statement.

(g) FBS shall bear (i) the costs of all SEC filing fees with respect to the
Registration Statement and the costs of qualifying the shares of FBS Common
Stock under state blue sky laws to the extent necessary and (ii) all printing
and mailing costs in connection with the preparation and mailing of the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement to FBS shareholders. MFC shall bear all printing and
mailing costs in connection with the preparation and mailing of the
Prospectus/Proxy Statement to MFC shareholders. FBS and MFC shall each bear
their own legal and accounting expenses in connection with the Registration
Statement.

5.10. Affiliate Letters. MFC shall use its best efforts to obtain and
deliver to FBS at least 31 days prior to the Effective Date a signed
representation letter substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto from each
shareholder of MFC who may reasonably be deemed an "affiliate" of MFC within the
meaning of such term as used in Rule 145 under the 1933 Act and for purposes of
qualifying for pooling of interests accounting treatment for the Merger. FBS
may place appropriate legends on the stock certificates of affiliates of MFC.

-35-
<PAGE>

5.11. Establishment of Accruals. If requested by FBS prior to March 1,
1995, prior to the public release of financial results for MFC's 1994 fiscal
year (or, if earlier, the business day immediately prior to the Effective Date),
MFC shall, consistent with generally accepted accounting principles, establish
for such fiscal year such additional accruals and reserves as may be necessary
to conform MFC's accounting and credit loss reserve practices and methods to
those of FBS (as such practices and methods are to be applied to MFC from and
after the Effective Date) and reflect FBS's plans with respect to the conduct of
MFC's business following the Merger and to provide for the costs and expenses
relating to the consummation by MFC of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that MFC shall not be required to take such action
unless (A) FBS certifies in writing that it has no reason to believe that all
conditions to FBS's obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement set forth in Article 6 hereof will not be satisfied or waived;
and (B) MFC shall have no reasonable basis for believing that all the conditions
to MFC's obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not be satisfied. In the event that MFC shall not be obligated to
establish the additional accruals and reserves referred to in the preceding
sentence prior to March 1, 1995, and thereafter FBS shall request that MFC
establish such accruals and reserves and the conditions set forth in clauses (A)
and (B) of the preceding sentence are satisfied, MFC shall establish such
accruals and reserves for a period subsequent to the 1994 fiscal year.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no accrual
or reserve made by MFC or the Bank pursuant to this Section 5.11, or any
litigation or regulatory proceeding arising out of any such accrual or reserve,
or any other effect on MFC or the Bank resulting from MFC's compliance with this
Section 5.11, shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation of or
failure to satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, condition or other
provisions of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining whether
any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have occurred.

5.12. Employee Matters.
---------------- 

(a) General. Subject to the following agreements, FBS shall have the right
to continue, amend or terminate any of the Plans (as defined in Section 3.18) in
accordance with the terms thereof and subject to any limitation arising under
applicable law. Until FBS shall take such action, however, such Plans shall
continue in force for the benefit of present and former employees of MFC or the
Subsidiaries who have any present or future entitlement to benefits under any of
the Plans ("MFC Employees").

(b) MFC Plans.
--------- 

(i) MFC 401(k) Plan. After the Effective Date, FBS will terminate the
accrual of benefits under the MFC 401(k) plans listed on
Schedule 3.18(b)(i)(B) and sponsored by MFC or any Subsidiary not more than
two years after the Effective Date and will take such actions as may be

-36-
<PAGE>

necessary to cause the assets and liabilities of the MFC 401(k) plans to be
merged with and into the FBS 401(k) plan. As of the Effective Date, FBS
shall take such action as may be necessary to amend the MFC 401(k) plans to
provide that with respect to MFC Employees who are participants in the MFC
401(k) plans and who are employees of MFC as of the Effective Date, their
accounts under such plans as of the Effective Date shall be fully vested as
of the Effective Date. Benefits accruing between the Effective Date and
the date on which the accrual of benefits is terminated shall be fully and
immediately vested as of that time. Distributions shall not be permitted
from the MFC 401(k) plans merely because of the discontinuance of accruals
or the transfer of assets and liabilities.

(ii) MFC Directors' Retirement Plan. MFC shall calculate and pay in
cash on the Effective Date all amounts reasonably estimated to be owing to
any MFC director pursuant to the MFC Directors' Retirement Plan, including
any estimated "gross up" payment payable as provided therein. To the
extent that any such gross up payment remains payable after the Effective
Date, FBS hereby acknowledges that it will promptly pay such amounts in
full in accordance with the terms of such plan.

(iii) Change in Control Plans. Prior to the Effective Date, MFC shall
amend the Change in Control Plans as set forth in Exhibit B hereto, and FBS
hereby agrees to such amendments. FBS acknowledges that any employment
agreement with an executive officer previously disclosed to it does not
constitute a "severance plan" for purposes of such plans.

(iv) MFC Bonus Plans. On or prior to December 31, 1994, MFC shall pay
all bonuses accrued in 1994 by MFC Employees under the MFC bonus plans
disclosed to FBS.

(v) MFC Defined Benefit Plan. Not more than two (2) years after the
Effective Date, FBS will terminate the accrual of benefits under the MFC
qualified defined benefit pension plan and will take such actions as may be
necessary to cause the assets and liabilities of the MFC qualified defined
benefit pension plan to be merged with and into the FBS Personal Retirement
Account. As of the Effective Date, FBS shall take such action as may be
necessary to amend the MFC qualified defined benefit pension plan to
provide that with respect to MFC Employees who are participants in the MFC
qualified defined benefit pension plan and who are employees of MFC as of
the Effective Date, their accrued benefits under such plan as of the
Effective Date shall be fully vested as of the Effective Date.

(c) FBS Plans.
--------- 

(i) FBS CAP (401(k)) Plan. After the Effective Date, FBS shall take
such actions as may be necessary to cause eligible MFC Employees to become
qualified to participate in the FBS Capital Accumulation Plan ("CAP")

-37-
<PAGE>

concurrent with the date that FBS causes accruals to cease under the MFC
401(k) plan. All service with MFC and any of the Subsidiaries (whether
before or after the Effective Date) shall be recognized under the CAP for
eligibility and vesting purposes but shall not be recognized for
contribution and allocation purposes. FBS shall take such actions as may be
necessary to cause the CAP to accept transfers of assets and liabilities
from the MFC 401(k) plan.

(ii) FBS Defined Benefit Plan. Upon the cessation of accruals under
any MFC Defined Benefit Plan, FBS shall take such actions as may be
necessary to cause eligible MFC Employees to be qualified to participate in
any qualified defined benefit plan generally available at the time to
similarly situated employees of FBS or an affiliate of FBS. All service
with MFC or any of the Subsidiaries and their predecessors, to such extent
taken into account for purposes of the MFC Defined Benefit Plan (whether
before or after the Effective Date) shall be recognized under the FBS plan
for eligibility and vesting purposes but shall not be required to be
recognized for any other purpose.

(iii) Welfare and Other Benefits. FBS shall use its best efforts to
cause any transition by MFC Employees from the welfare and other generally
applicable benefit plans and practices of MFC or its affiliates not
otherwise expressly dealt with in this Section 5.12 to FBS plans and
practices to be effected in a manner that does not result in a significant
financial detriment to the MFC Employees other than any such financial
detriment as a result of higher premium costs in the FBS plan which are
generally applicable to other similarly situated employees of FBS and its
affiliates or to the absence of any FBS counterpart for a particular MFC
plan or practice.

(d) Successor Status; Further Assurances. FBS hereby expressly assumes and
agrees to perform or cause to be performed all of the obligations of
"successors" under the terms of the MFC Broad-Based Change in Control Severance
Pay Plan, as amended, the MFC Senior Management Change in Control Severance Pay
Plan, as amended, and the MFC Executive Management Change in Control Severance
Pay Plan, as amended (the "Change in Control Plans"), and the MFC Directors'
Retirement Plan.

(e) Limitation on Enforcement. This Section 5.12 is an agreement solely
between MFC and the Subsidiaries and FBS. Nothing in this Section 5.12, whether
express or implied, confers upon any employee of MFC, any of the Subsidiaries or
FBS or any other person, any rights or remedies, including, but not limited to:
(i) any right to employment or recall, (ii) any right to continued employment
for any specified period, or (iii) any right to claim any particular
compensation, benefit or aggregate of benefits, of any kind or nature
whatsoever, as a result of this Section 5.12.

5.13. Pooling of Interests; Tax Treatment. Neither MFC nor any of the
Subsidiaries nor FBS shall take any action which would disqualify the Merger as
a 

-38-
<PAGE>

"pooling of interests" for accounting purposes or as a "reorganization" that
would be tax free to the shareholders of MFC pursuant to Section 368(a) of the
Code.

5.14. Stock Options and Warrants.
-------------------------- 

(a) Stock Option Plans. In the event that each option outstanding or to
be outstanding on the Effective Date under the MFC 1982 Stock Option and
Incentive Plan, the MFC 1990 Stock Option Plan, the MFC 1993 Non-Employee
Director Stock Option Plan and the MFC 1993 Stock Incentive Plan (collectively,
the "MFC Stock Option Plans") is converted into a right to receive in lieu of
all other rights under such option (and each such option thereafter is
terminated and canceled), shares of FBS Common Stock with a value as of the
Effective Date equal to the "fair value" of such option as determined by an
independent third party expert to be mutually selected by FBS and MFC, FBS will,
as of the Effective Date, issue in respect of such option shares of FBS Common
Stock having an Average Price equal to such "fair value." In the event that
each such option is not so converted, then, at the Effective Date, such option
shall be assumed by FBS and shall thereafter be deemed to constitute an option
to acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such
option, the same number of shares of FBS Common Stock as the holder of such
option would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such
holder exercised such option in full immediately prior to the Effective Date, at
a price per share equal to (x) the aggregate exercise price for the shares of
MFC Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such option divided by (y)
the number of full shares of FBS Common Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to
such option; provided, however, that in the case of any option to which Section
421 of the Code applies by reason of its qualification under Section 422 of the
Code ("incentive stock options"), the option price, the number of shares
purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of
such options shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424(a) of the
Code. In addition, MFC will use its best efforts to cause all of the options
outstanding and vested under the MFC Stock Option Plans as of December 31, 1994
to be exercised in full on or prior to such date.

(b) Employee Stock Purchase Plans. At the Effective Date, each outstanding
option issued pursuant to the MFC Employee Stock Purchase Plan or the Edina
Realty Sales Associate Stock Purchase Plan shall be deemed to constitute an
option to acquire FBS Common Stock on the same terms and conditions as
theretofore applicable, except that the exercise price per share and the number
of shares of stock for which such option is exercisable shall be adjusted as
appropriate in light of the Merger and the Exchange Ratio in order to prevent
any diminution of the value of such options or the rights of the participants.

(c) MFC Warrants. On the Effective Date, FBS shall execute a supplemental
warrant agreement to the Warrant Agreement dated as of November 20, 1990 (the
"MFC Warrant Agreement") between MFC and American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company, as Warrant Agent, as provided in Section 10(I) of the Warrant
Agreement, and all outstanding warrants of MFC (the "MFC Warrants") issued
pursuant to such Warrant Agreement shall be assumed by FBS. Each MFC

-39-
<PAGE>

Warrant shall be deemed to constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms
and conditions as were applicable under such MFC Warrant, the same number of
shares of FBS Common Stock as the holder of such MFC Warrant would have been
entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such holder exercised such option
in full immediately prior to the Effective Date, at a price per share equal to
(x) the aggregate exercise price for the shares of MFC Common Stock otherwise
purchasable pursuant to such MFC Warrant divided by (y) the number of full
shares of FBS Common Stock deemed purchasable pursuant to such MFC Warrant. FBS
shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient
number of shares of FBS Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of MFC Warrants
assumed by it in accordance with this Section 5.14. FBS shall use its best
efforts to register the MFC Warrants and the underlying FBS Common Stock under
the 1933 Act as of the Effective Date and to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such
MFC Warrants remain outstanding.

5.15. Indemnification and Insurance.
----------------------------- 

(a) From and after the Effective Date, FBS shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Date, an officer, director or
employee of MFC or any of the Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") against
all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including attorney's fees),
liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement (which
settlement shall require the prior written consent of FBS, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld) of or in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (a "Claim") in which an Indemnified Party is, or is
threatened to be made, a party or a witness based in whole or in part on or
arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer or employee of MFC or any of the Subsidiaries if such Claim
pertains to any matter or fact arising, existing or occurring prior to the
Effective Date (including, without limitation, the Merger and other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Date (the "Indemnified Liabilities")
to the full extent permitted under applicable Delaware or federal law as of the
date hereof or as amended prior to the Effective Date and under MFC's Charter
and Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof (and FBS shall pay expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding to each
Indemnified Party to the full extent permitted by law and under such Charter or
Bylaws, upon receipt of any undertaking required by such Charter, Bylaws or
applicable law). Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 5.15(a), upon learning of any Claim, shall notify FBS (but the
failure so to notify FBS shall not relieve it from any liability which FBS may
have under this Section 5.15(a) except to the extent such failure prejudices
FBS) and shall deliver to FBS any undertaking required by such Charter, Bylaws
or applicable law. FBS shall use its best efforts to assure, to the extent
permitted under applicable law, that all limitations of liability existing in
favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the MFC Charter and Bylaws, as
in

-40-
<PAGE>

effect as of the date hereof, with respect to claims or liabilities arising
from facts or events existing or occurring prior to the Effective Date
(including, without limitation, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement), shall survive the Merger. The obligations of FBS described in this
Section 5.15(a) shall continue in full force and effect, without any amendment
thereto, for a period of not less than five years from the Effective Date;
provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Claim
asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition
of such Claim; and provided further that nothing in this Section 5.15(a) shall
be deemed to modify applicable Delaware law regarding indemnification of former
officers and directors. Nothing in this Section 5.15(a) shall affect the
obligations to be assumed in the Merger by FBS to indemnify former directors and
officers of MFC or the Bank pursuant to the terms of the indemnification
agreements in effect as of the date hereof and as disclosed to FBS in Schedule
3.14.

(b) From and after the Effective Date, the directors, officers and
employees of MFC and the Subsidiaries who become directors, officers or
employees of FBS or any of its subsidiaries, except for the indemnification
rights set forth in Section 5.15(a), shall have indemnification rights with
prospective application only. The prospective indemnification rights shall
consist of such rights to which directors, officers and employees of FBS are
entitled under the provisions of the Charter or similar governing documents of
FBS and its subsidiaries, as in effect from time to time after the Effective
Date, as applicable, and provisions of applicable law as in effect from time to
time after the Effective Date.

(c) The obligations of FBS provided under Sections 5.15(a) and 5.15(b) are
intended to benefit, and be enforceable against FBS directly by, the Indemnified
Parties, and shall be binding on all respective successors of FBS.

(d) For a period of three years after the Effective Date, FBS shall use its
best efforts to provide that portion of directors' and officers' liability
insurance that serves to reimburse officers and directors of MFC or any of the
Subsidiaries (as opposed to FBS or MFC) with respect to claims against such
officers and directors arising from facts or events which occurred before the
Effective Date of at least the same coverage and amounts, and containing terms
and conditions no less advantageous, as that coverage currently provided by MFC;
provided, however, that the annual premiums for such coverage will not exceed
200% of the annual premiums currently paid by MFC for such coverage; provided,
further, that officers and directors of MFC or any Subsidiary may be required to
make application and provide customary representations and warranties to FBS's
insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such insurance; and provided,
further, that such coverage will have a single aggregate for such three-year
period in an amount not less than the annual aggregate of such coverage
currently provided by MFC.

5.16. Edina Realty Litigation Matters. MFC shall provide FBS regular
updates on the status of the Edina Realty Litigation Matters, shall notify FBS
of any developments with respect to such matters, and shall allow FBS to attend
all

-41-
<PAGE>

settlement negotiations or other meetings relating to the settlement or
other disposition of such matters.

5.17. FBS SEC Reports. FBS shall continue to file all reports with the
SEC necessary to permit the shareholders of MFC who are "affiliates" of MFC
(within the meaning of such term as used in Rule 145 under the 1933 Act) to sell
the FBS Common Stock received by them in connection with the Merger pursuant to
Rules 144 and 145(d) under the 1933 Act if they would otherwise be so permitted.
After the Effective Date, FBS will file with the SEC reports and other materials
required by the federal securities laws on a timely basis.

5.18. SEC Reports. Each of FBS and MFC agree to provide to the other
party copies of all reports and other documents filed with the SEC by it between
the date hereof and the Effective Date within five days after the date such
reports or other documents are filed with the SEC.

5.19. Stock Exchange Listing. FBS shall use its best efforts to list
on the New York Stock Exchange, subject to official notice of issuance, the
shares of FBS Common Stock to be issued to the holders of MFC Common Stock in
the Merger.

5.20. Shareholder Approvals. Each of FBS and MFC shall call a meeting
of its shareholders for the purpose of voting upon this Agreement and the
Merger, and shall schedule such meeting based on consultation with the other
party. The Board of Directors of each of FBS and MFC shall recommend approval of
this Agreement and the Merger, and use its best efforts (including, without
limitation, soliciting proxies for such approvals) to obtain such shareholder
approvals, unless the Board of Directors of either party determines, after
receipt of a written opinion of counsel to such party (a copy of which shall be
delivered to the other party), that recommending such approvals or using its
best efforts to obtain such shareholder approvals would be a breach of its
fiduciary duties.

5.21. FBS Board of Directors; Consulting Agreement.
-------------------------------------------- 

(a) Following the Effective Date, FBS shall use its best efforts to
(i) secure the election of Norman M. Jones to the FBS Board of Directors for a
term of at least three years and (ii) appoint Mr. Jones as Chairman of the Board
of Directors of the Bank, or its successor following the Merger, for at least
three years, subject to any applicable regulatory requirements.

(b) Prior to the Effective Date, FBS shall enter into a consulting
agreement with Mr. Jones, containing customary terms and conditions, engaging
Mr. Jones for a three-year period following the Effective Date as an independent
consultant to assist FBS in identifying and contacting, on behalf of FBS,
potential financial institution acquisition candidates as requested from time to
time by FBS.

(c) FBS shall pay Mr. Jones, for all of the services rendered by Mr. Jones
pursuant to this Section 5.21, total compensation equal to $200,000 annually.

-42-
<PAGE>

(d) FBS acknowledges that, on the Effective Date, there shall exist a
"termination" of Mr. Jones employment with MFC under the terms of the MFC
Executive Management Change in Control Severance Pay Plan and FBS shall pay all
benefits payable to Mr. Jones pursuant to the terms of such plan upon such
termination.

ARTICLE 6

CONDITIONS

6.1. Conditions to Obligations of Each Party. The respective obligations
of each party to effect the transactions contemplated hereby shall be subject to
the fulfillment at or prior to the Effective Date of the following conditions:

(a) Regulatory Approval. Regulatory approval for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been obtained from the FRB,
the OTS and any other governmental authority from whom approval is
required, the applicable waiting periods, if any, under the HSR Act shall
have expired or been terminated, and all other statutory or regulatory
waiting periods shall have lapsed. None of such approvals shall contain
any conditions or restrictions that FBS reasonably believes will materially
restrict or limit the business or activities of FBS, MFC or the
Subsidiaries or have a material adverse effect on, or would be reasonably
likely to have a material adverse effect on, the business, operations or
financial condition of FBS and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on the
one hand, or MFC and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, on the other hand.
FBS acknowledges that a requirement to divest control of Edina Realty, Inc.
following the Merger would not, in and of itself, constitute a failure of
the condition in this Section 6.1(a).

(b) No Injunction. No injunction or other order entered by a state or
federal court of competent jurisdiction shall have been issued and remain
in effect which would impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(c) No Prohibitive Change of Law. There shall have been no law,
statute, rule or regulation, domestic or foreign, enacted or promulgated
which would materially impair the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(d) No Termination. No party hereto shall have terminated this
Agreement as permitted herein.

(e) Registration Statement. The Registration Statement shall have
been declared effective and shall not be subject to a stop order of the
SEC, and,

-43-
<PAGE>

if the offer and sale of FBS Common Stock in the Merger pursuant
to this Agreement is required to be registered under the securities laws of
any state, the Registration Statement shall not be subject to a stop order
of securities commission in such state.

(f) Federal Tax Opinion. An opinion of Oppenheimer Wolff & Donnelly
shall have been obtained with respect to the Merger, based on customary
reliance and subject to customary qualifications, to the effect that for
federal income tax purposes:

(i) The Merger will qualify as a "reorganization" under
Section 368(a) of the Code;

(ii) No gain or loss will be recognized by any MFC shareholder
(except in connection with the receipt of cash) upon the exchange of
MFC Common Stock for FBS Common Stock in the Merger;

(iii) The basis of the FBS Common Stock received
by a MFC shareholder who exchanges MFC Common Stock for FBS Common
Stock will be the same as the basis of the MFC Common Stock
surrendered in exchange therefor (subject to any adjustments required
as the result of receipt of cash in lieu of a fractional share of FBS
Common Stock);

(iv) The holding period of the FBS Common Stock received by a MFC
shareholder receiving FBS Common Stock will include the period during
which the MFC Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor was held
(provided that the MFC Common Stock of such MFC shareholder was held
as a capital asset at the Effective Date); and

(v) Cash received by a MFC shareholder in lieu of a fractional
share interest of FBS Common Stock will be treated as having been
received as a distribution in full payment in exchange for the
fractional share interest of FBS Common Stock which he would otherwise
be entitled to receive, and will qualify as capital gain or loss
(assuming the MFC Common Stock was a capital asset in his hands at the
Effective Date).

Such opinion shall be delivered on and dated as of the Effective Date
and on and as of such earlier date as may be required by the SEC in
connection with the Registration Statement.

(g) The FBS Common Stock to be issued to holders of MFC Common Stock
in the Merger shall have been approved for listing on the NYSE on official
notice of issuance.

-44-
<PAGE>

6.2. Additional Conditions to Obligation of MFC. The obligation of MFC to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement is also subject to the following conditions:

(a) Representations and Compliance. The representations and
warranties of FBS set forth in Article 2 shall have been true and correct
as of the date hereof, and shall be true and correct as of the Effective
Date as if made at and as of the Effective Date, except where the failure
to be true and correct would not have, or would not reasonably be expected
to have, a material adverse effect on the business, operations or financial

ARTICLE 7

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

7.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated prior to the Effective
Date:

(a) by mutual consent of FBS and MFC;

(b) by either FBS or MFC, if any of the conditions to such party's
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement shall
have become impossible to satisfy;

-50-
<PAGE>

(c) by either FBS or MFC, if this Agreement and the Merger are not duly
approved by the shareholders of each of MFC and FBS, in each case at a meeting
of shareholders (or any adjournment thereof) duly called and held for such
purpose;

(d) by FBS or MFC if the Effective Date is not on or before September 30,
1995 (unless the failure to consummate the Merger by such date shall be due to
the action or failure to act of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement in
breach of such party's obligations under this Agreement);

(e) by FBS or MFC if the Average Price is less than $29.50;

(f) by MFC if (1) any corporation, partnership, person, other entity or
group, as defined in the 1934 Act (other than FBS or any affiliate of FBS) (a
"Person"), shall have commenced (as such term is used in Rule 14d-2(b) under the
1934 Act) a bona fide tender offer for all outstanding shares of MFC Common
Stock or any Person shall have made a bona fide written offer involving a merger
or consolidation of MFC or the acquisition of all or substantially all of its
assets, and (2) MFC's Board of Directors shall determine, based on advice of
MFC's independent financial advisors that such offer is a material economic
improvement to the Company's shareholders when compared to the Merger, and
(3) MFC's Board of Directors determines upon the advice of its legal counsel
that if they failed to recommend such offer or accept such proposal then such
failure would be likely to result in a breach of the directors' fiduciary
duties; provided, however, that MFC may not terminate the Agreement pursuant to
this Section 7.1(f) until the expiration of five business days after written
notice of any such offer or proposal referenced in this Section 7.1(f) has been
delivered to FBS, together with a summary of the terms of any such offer or
proposal;

(g) by FBS if, after the date hereof, any Person shall have commenced (as
such term is used in Rule 14d-2(b) under the 1934 Act) a bona fide tender offer
or exchange offer to acquire at least 20% of the then outstanding shares of MFC
Common Stock, or if the Board of Directors of MFC shall have withdrawn, modified
or changed its recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger; or

(h) by FBS if after the date hereof, there shall have occurred a
"Subsequent Triggering Event" as defined in the Stock Option Agreement.

Any party desiring to terminate this Agreement shall give written notice of
such termination and the reasons therefor to the other party.

7.2. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated as permitted
by Section 7.1, such termination shall be without liability or obligation of any
party (or any shareholder, officer, employee, agent, consultant or
representative of such party) to any other party to this Agreement, except (a)
that if such termination is (i) by MFC pursuant to (A) Section 7.1(b) as a
result of a failure of the condition contained in Section 6.2(g), or (B)
Section 7.1(f) or (ii) by FBS pursuant to (A) Section 7.1(g), (B) Section
7.1(h), or (C) Section 7.1(b) as a result of the failure of the condition

-51-
<PAGE>

contained in Section 6.3(a) because of the willful and material breach by MFC of
any obligation, agreement or covenant referred to therein (a "willful and
material" breach for the purposes of this Section 7.2 shall be deemed to have
occurred if MFC has intentionally and knowingly taken, or intentionally and
knowingly failed to take, any action which causes such breach), then MFC shall
pay to FBS within three business days of such termination, a termination fee of
$35,000,000 by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account
designated by FBS, (b) as may be otherwise provided in law or in equity, and (c)
except as provided in Section 8.6.

7.3. Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument
in writing approved by the parties to this Agreement and signed on behalf of
each of the parties hereto.

7.4. Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Date, any party hereto may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of any other party hereto or (b) waive compliance with any of the agreements of
any other party or with any conditions to its own obligations, in each case only

benefit.

STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT

STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT, dated July 21, 1994 between FIRST BANK SYSTEM,
INC., a Delaware corporation ("Grantee"), and METROPOLITAN FINANCIAL
CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation ("Issuer").

W I T N E S S E T H:
------------------- 

WHEREAS, Grantee and Issuer have entered into an Agreement of Merger
and Consolidation of even date herewith (the "Merger Agreement"), which
agreement has been executed by the parties hereto immediately prior to this
Agreement; and

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement to Grantee's entering into the
Merger Agreement and in consideration therefor, Issuer has agreed to grant
Grantee the Option (as hereinafter defined):

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants and agreements set forth herein and in the Merger Agreement, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

1. (a) Issuer hereby grants to Grantee an unconditional,
irrevocable option (the "Option") to purchase, subject to the terms hereof, up
to 6,209,304 fully paid and nonassessable shares of the common stock, $.01 par
value, of Issuer ("Common Stock") at a price of $24.66 per share; provided,
however, that in the event Issuer issues or agrees to issue any shares of Common
Stock at a price less than $24.66 per share (as adjusted pursuant to subsection
(b) of Section 5) other than in connection with the options, rights or plans
disclosed on Schedule 3.3 to the Merger Agreement, such price shall be equal to
such lesser price (such price, as adjusted if applicable, the "Option Price");
provided further that in no event shall the number of shares for which this
Option is exercisable exceed 19.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of
Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock that may be received upon the
exercise of the Option and the Option Price are subject to adjustment as herein
set forth.

(b) In the event that any additional shares of Common Stock are
issued or otherwise become outstanding after the date of this Agreement (other
than pursuant to this Agreement), the number of shares of Common Stock subject
to the Option shall be increased so that, after such issuance, it equals 19.9%
of the number of shares of Common Stock then issued and outstanding without
giving effect to any shares subject or issued pursuant to the Option. Nothing
contained in this Section 1(b) or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to
authorize Issuer or Grantee to breach any provision of the Merger Agreement.
<PAGE>

2. (a) The Holder (as hereinafter defined) may exercise the Option,
in whole or part, if, but only if, both an Initial Triggering Event (as
hereinafter defined) and a Subsequent Triggering Event (as hereinafter defined)
shall have occurred prior to the occurrence of an Exercise Termination Event (as
hereinafter defined), provided that the Holder shall have sent the written
notice of such exercise (as provided in subsection (e) of this Section 2) within
12 months following such Subsequent Triggering Event (or such later period as
provided in Section 10). Each of the following shall be an Exercise Termination
Event: (i) the Effective Date of the Merger; (ii) termination of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with the provisions thereof if such termination occurs
prior to the occurrence of an Initial Triggering Event; (iii) termination of
the Merger Agreement either (a) pursuant to Section 7.1(e) thereof, or (b) by
Grantee solely as a result of failure of one or more of the conditions set forth
in Sections 6.1(a), 6.1(b), 6.1(c), 6.1(g), 6.3(e), 6.3(h), 6.3(i) or 6.3(k) or
pursuant to Section 7.1(c) (as a result of failure of Grantee's shareholders to
approve the Merger) or Section 7.1(d) (as a result of failure to consummate the
Merger on or before the date specified therein) if neither Issuer nor any of its
affiliates, officers, directors, employees or agents shall have taken any
actions that have contributed in any way, either directly or indirectly, to any
such failure; or (iv) the passage of 12 months (or such longer period as
provided in Section 10) after termination of the Merger Agreement (other than
any termination of the Merger Agreement covered by the immediately preceding
clause (iii)) if such termination follows the occurrence of an Initial
Triggering Event (provided that if an Initial Triggering Event continues or
occurs beyond such termination, the Exercise Termination Event shall be 12
months (or such longer period as provided in Section 10) from the expiration of
the Last Triggering Event but in no event more than 18 months (or such longer
period as provided in Section 10) after such termination). The "Last Triggering
Event" shall mean the last Initial Triggering Event to occur. The term "Holder"
shall mean the holder or holders of the Option.

(b) The term "Initial Triggering Event" shall mean any of the
following events or transactions occurring after the date hereof:

(i) Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries (as hereinafter
defined) (each an "Issuer Subsidiary"), without having received
Grantee's prior written consent, shall have entered into an agreement
to engage in an Acquisition Transaction (as hereinafter defined) with
any person (the term "person" for purposes of this Agreement having
the meaning assigned thereto in Sections 3(a)(9) and 13(d)(3) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act"), and the rules and
regulations thereunder) other than Grantee or any of its Subsidiaries
(each a "Grantee Subsidiary") or the Board of Directors of Issuer
shall have recommended that the shareholders of Issuer approve or
accept any Acquisition Transaction other than as contemplated by the
Merger Agreement or this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
(a) "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean (x) a merger or
consolidation,

-2-

or any similar transaction, involving Issuer or any Significant
Subsidiary (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X promulgated by
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC")) of Issuer, (y) a
purchase, lease or other acquisition of all or substantially all of
the assets or deposits of Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary of
Issuer, or (z) a purchase or other acquisition (including by way of
merger, consolidation, share exchange or otherwise) of securities
representing 10% or more of the voting power of Issuer or any
Significant Subsidiary of Issuer, and (b) "Subsidiary" shall have the
meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 under the 1934 Act;

(ii) Any person other than Grantee or any Grantee Subsidiary
shall have acquired beneficial ownership or the right to acquire
beneficial ownership of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of
Common Stock (the term "beneficial ownership" for purposes of this
Agreement having the meaning assigned thereto in Section 13(d) of the
1934 Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder);

held for that purpose or any adjournment thereof, or such meeting
shall not have been held or shall have been cancelled prior to
termination of the Merger Agreement, or Issuer's Board of Directors
shall have withdrawn or modified (or publicly announced its intention
to withdraw or modify or interest in withdrawing or modifying) its
recommendation that the shareholders of Issuer approve the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, or Issuer or any
Issuer Subsidiary, without having received Grantee's prior written
consent, shall have authorized, recommended, proposed (or publicly
announced its intention to authorize, recommend or propose or interest
in authorizing, recommending or proposing) an agreement to engage in
an Acquisition Transaction with any person other than Grantee or a
Grantee Subsidiary ;

(iv) Any person other than Grantee or any Grantee
Subsidiary shall have made a bona fide proposal to Issuer or its
shareholders by public announcement or written communication that is
or becomes the subject of public disclosure to engage in an
Acquisition Transaction;

(v) Issuer shall have breached any covenant or obligation
contained in the Merger Agreement and such breach would entitle
Grantee to terminate the Merger Agreement;

<PAGE>

(vi) Any person other than Grantee or any Grantee
Subsidiary, other than in connection with a transaction to which
Grantee has given its prior written consent, shall have filed an
application or notice with the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of
Thrift Supervision ("OTS") or other federal or state bank regulatory
authority, which application or notice has been accepted for
processing, for approval to engage in an Acquisition Transaction; or

(vii) Issuer shall have terminated the Merger
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(b) by reason of the failure of
Issuer's condition set forth in Section 6.2(g) or pursuant to Section
7.1(f).

(c) The term "Subsequent Triggering Event" shall mean any of the
following events or transactions occurring after the date hereof:

(i) The acquisition by any person of beneficial ownership
of 20% or more of the then outstanding Common Stock; or

(ii) The occurrence of the Initial Triggering Event
described in clause (i) of subsection (b) of this Section 2, except
that the percentage referred to in clause (z) shall be 20%.

(d) Issuer shall notify Grantee promptly in writing of the
occurrence of any Initial Triggering Event or Subsequent Triggering Event
(together, a "Triggering Event"), it being understood that the giving of such
notice by Issuer shall not be a condition to the right of the Holder to exercise
the Option.

(e) In the event the Holder is entitled to and wishes to exercise
the Option, it shall send to Issuer a written notice (the date of which being
herein referred to as the "Notice Date") specifying (i) the total number of
shares it will purchase pursuant to such exercise and (ii) a place and date not
earlier than three business days nor later than 60 business days from the Notice
Date for the closing of such purchase (the "Closing Date"); provided that if
prior notification to or approval of the Federal Reserve Board, the OTS or any
other regulatory agency is required in connection with such purchase, the Holder
shall promptly file the required notice or application for approval, shall
promptly notify the Issuer of such filing, and shall expeditiously process the
same and the period of time that otherwise would run pursuant to this sentence
shall run instead from the date on which any required notification periods have
expired or been terminated or such approvals have been obtained and any
requisite waiting period or periods shall have passed. Any exercise of the
Option shall be deemed to occur on the Notice Date relating thereto.

<PAGE>

(f) At the closing referred to in subsection (e) of this Section
2, the Holder shall pay to Issuer the aggregate purchase price for the shares of
Common Stock purchased pursuant to the exercise of the Option in immediately
available funds by wire transfer to a bank account designated by Issuer,
provided that failure or refusal of Issuer to designate such a bank account
shall not preclude the Holder from exercising the Option.

(g) At such closing, simultaneously with the delivery of
immediately available funds as provided in subsection (f) of this Section 2,
Issuer shall deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates representing
the number of shares of Common Stock purchased by the Holder and, if the Option
should be exercised in part only, a new Option evidencing the rights of the
Holder thereof to purchase the balance of the shares purchasable hereunder.

(h) Certificates for Common Stock delivered at a closing
hereunder may be endorsed with a restrictive legend that shall read
substantially as follows:

"The transfer of the shares represented by this certificate is subject
to certain provisions of an agreement between the registered holder
hereof and Issuer and to resale restrictions arising under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended. A copy of such agreement is on
file at the principal office of Issuer and will be provided to the
holder hereof without charge upon receipt by Issuer of a written
request therefor."

It is understood and agreed that: (i) the reference to the resale restrictions
of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act") in the above legend shall be
removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the
Holder shall have delivered to Issuer a copy of a letter from the staff of the
SEC, or an opinion of counsel, in form and substance satisfactory to Issuer, to
the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the 1933 Act; (ii)
the reference to the provisions of this Agreement in the above legend shall be
removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such reference if the
shares have been sold or transferred in compliance with the provisions of this
Agreement and under circumstances that do not require the retention of such
reference; and (iii) the legend shall be removed in its entirety if the
conditions in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) are both satisfied. In
addition, such certificates shall bear any other legend as may be required by
law.

(i) Upon the giving by the Holder to Issuer of the written notice
of exercise of the Option provided for under subsection (e) of this Section 2
and the tender of the applicable purchase price in immediately available funds,
the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such exercise, notwithstanding that the stock transfer books
of Issuer shall then be closed or that certificates representing such shares of
Common Stock shall not then be actually delivered to the Holder. Issuer shall
pay all expenses, and any

-5-
<PAGE>

and all United States federal, state and local taxes and other charges that may
be payable in connection with the preparation, issue and delivery of stock
certificates under this Section 2 in the name of the Holder or its assignee,
transferee or designee.

3. Issuer agrees: (i) that it shall at all times maintain, free from
preemptive rights, sufficient authorized but unissued or treasury shares of
Common Stock so that the Option may be exercised without additional
authorization of Common Stock after giving effect to all other options,
warrants, convertible securities and other rights to purchase Common Stock;
(ii) that it will not, by charter amendment or through reorganization,
consolidation, merger, dissolution or sale of assets, or by any other voluntary
act, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the
covenants, stipulations or conditions to be observed or performed hereunder by
Issuer; (iii) promptly to take all action as may from time to time be required
(including (x) complying with all premerger notification, reporting and waiting
period requirements specified in 15 U.S.C. (S)18a and regulations promulgated
thereunder and (y) in the event, under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
amended, or the Home Owners Loan Act, as amended, or any state or other federal
banking law, prior approval of or notice to the Federal Reserve Board, the OTS
or to any state or other federal regulatory authority is necessary before the
Option may be exercised, cooperating fully with the Holder in preparing such
applications or notices and providing such information to the Federal Reserve
Board, the OTS or such state or other federal regulatory authority as they may
require) in order to permit the Holder to exercise the Option and Issuer duly
and effectively to issue shares of Common Stock pursuant hereto; and (iv)
promptly to take all action provided herein to protect the rights of the Holder
against dilution.

4. This Agreement (and the Option granted hereby) are exchangeable,
without expense, at the option of the Holder, upon presentation and surrender of
this Agreement at the principal office of the Issuer, for other Agreements
providing for Options of different denominations entitling the holder thereof to
purchase, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as are set forth
herein, in the aggregate the same number of shares of Common Stock purchasable
hereunder. The terms "Agreement" and "Option" as used herein include any
Agreements and related Options for which this Agreement (and the Option granted
hereby) may be exchanged. Upon receipt by Issuer of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this
Agreement, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) of reasonably
satisfactory indemnification, and upon surrender and cancellation of this
Agreement, if mutilated, Issuer will execute and deliver a new Agreement of like
tenor and date. Any such new Agreement executed and delivered shall constitute
an additional contractual obligation on the part of Issuer, whether or not the
Agreement so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated shall at any time be
enforceable by anyone.

<PAGE>

5. In addition to the adjustment in the number of shares of Common
Stock that are purchasable upon exercise of the Option pursuant to Section 1 of
this Agreement, the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the
exercise of the Option shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as
provided in this Section 5.

(a) In the event of any change in Common Stock by reason of
stock dividends, split-ups, mergers, recapitalizations, combinations,
subdivisions, conversions, exchanges of shares or the like, the type and
number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise hereof shall be
appropriately adjusted and proper provision shall be made so that, in the
event that any additional shares of Common Stock are to be issued or
otherwise become outstanding as a result of any such change (other than
pursuant to an exercise of the Option), the number of shares of Common
Stock that remain subject to the Option shall be increased so that, after
such issuance and together with shares of Common Stock previously issued
pursuant to the exercise of the Option (as adjusted on account of any of
the foregoing changes in the Common Stock), it equals 19.9% of the number
of shares of Common Stock then issued and outstanding.

(b) Whenever the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable
upon exercise hereof is adjusted as provided in this Section 5, the Option
Price shall be adjusted by multiplying the Option Price by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be equal to the number of shares of Common Stock
purchasable prior to the adjustment and the denominator of which shall be
equal to the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable after the
adjustment.

6. Upon the occurrence of a Subsequent Triggering Event that occurs
prior to an Exercise Termination Event, Issuer shall, at the request of Grantee
delivered within 12 months (or such later period as provided in Section 10) of
such Subsequent Triggering Event (whether on its own behalf or on behalf of any
subsequent holder of this Option (or part thereof) or any of the shares of
Common Stock issued pursuant hereto), promptly prepare, file and keep current a
registration statement under the 1933 Act covering any shares issued and
issuable pursuant to this Option and shall use its best efforts to cause such
registration statement to become effective and remain current in order to permit
the sale or other disposition of any shares of Common Stock issued upon total or
partial exercise of this Option ("Option Shares") in accordance with any plan of
disposition requested by Grantee. Issuer will use its best efforts to cause
such registration statement first to become effective and then to remain
effective for such period not in excess of 180 days from the day such
registration statement first becomes effective or such shorter time as may be
reasonably necessary to effect such sales or other dispositions. Grantee shall
have the right to demand two such registrations. The Issuer shall bear the
costs of such registrations (including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees,
printing costs and filing fees). The foregoing notwithstanding, if, at the time
of any request by Grantee

-7-

<PAGE>

for registration of Option Shares as provided above, Issuer is in registration
with respect to an underwritten public offering of shares of Common Stock, and
if in the good faith judgment of the managing underwriter or managing
underwriters, or, if none, the sole underwriter or underwriters, of such
offering the inclusion of the Option Shares would interfere with the successful
marketing of the shares of Common Stock offered by Issuer, the number of Option
Shares otherwise to be covered in the registration statement contemplated hereby
may be reduced; provided, however, that after any such required reduction the
number of Option Shares to be included in such offering for the account of the
Holder shall constitute at least 25% of the total number of shares to be sold by
the Holder and Issuer in the aggregate; and provided further, however, that if
such reduction occurs, then the Issuer shall file a registration statement for
the balance as promptly as practicable thereafter as to which no reduction
pursuant to this Section 6 shall be permitted or occur and the Holder shall
thereafter be entitled to one additional registration. Each such Holder shall
provide all information reasonably requested by Issuer for inclusion in any
registration statement to be filed hereunder. If requested by any such Holder in
connection with such registration, Issuer shall become a party to any
underwriting agreement relating to the sale of such shares, but only to the
extent of obligating itself in respect of representations, warranties,
indemnities and other agreements customarily included in such underwriting
agreements for Issuer. Upon receiving any request under this Section 6 from any
Holder, Issuer agrees to send a copy thereof to any other person known to Issuer
to be entitled to registration rights under this Section 6, in each case by
promptly mailing the same, postage prepaid, to the address of record of the
persons entitled to receive such copies.

7. (a) Upon the occurrence of a Subsequent Triggering Event that
occurs prior to an Exercise Termination Event, (i) at the request of the Holder,
delivered within 12 months of such occurrence (or such later period as provided
in Section 10), Issuer shall repurchase the Option from the Holder at a price
(the "Option Repurchase Price") equal to (x) the amount by which (A) the
market/offer price (as defined below) exceeds (B) the Option Price, multiplied
by the number of shares for which this Option may then be exercised plus (y)
Grantee's Out-of-Pocket Expenses (as defined below) (to the extent not
previously reimbursed), and (ii) at the request of the owner of Option Shares
from time to time (the "Owner"), delivered within 12 months of such occurrence
(or such later period as provided in Section 10), Issuer shall repurchase such
number of the Option Shares from the Owner as the Owner shall designate at a
price (the "Option Share Repurchase Price") equal to (x) the market/offer price
multiplied by the number of Option Shares so designated plus (y) Grantee's Out-
of-Pocket Expenses (to the extent not previously reimbursed). The term "Out-of-
Pocket Expenses" shall mean Grantee's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement,
including without limitation legal, accounting and consulting fees. The term
"market/offer price" shall mean the highest of (i) the price per share of Common
Stock at which a tender or exchange offer therefor has been made, (ii) the price
per share of Common Stock to be paid by any third party pursuant to an agreement
with Issuer, (iii) the highest closing price for shares of

-8-
<PAGE>

Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the date the
Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of this Option or the Owner gives
notice of the required repurchase of Option Shares, as the case may be, or (iv)
in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of Issuer's assets or
deposits, the sum of the price paid in such sale for such assets or deposits and
the current market value of the remaining assets of Issuer as determined by a
nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or the
Owner, as the case may be, divided by the number of shares of Common Stock of
Issuer outstanding at the time of such sale. In determining the market/offer
price, the value of consideration other than cash shall be determined by a
nationally recognized investment banking firm selected by the Holder or Owner,
as the case may be.

(b) The Holder and the Owner, as the case may be, may
exercise its right to require Issuer to repurchase the Option and any Option
Shares pursuant to this Section 7 by surrendering for such purpose to Issuer, at
its principal office, a copy of this Agreement or certificates for Option
Shares, as applicable, accompanied by a written notice or notices stating that
the Holder or the Owner, as the case may be, elects to require Issuer to
repurchase this Option and/or the Option Shares in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 7. As promptly as practicable, and in any event
within five business days after the surrender of the Option and/or certificates
representing Option Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices relating
thereto, Issuer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Holder the Option
Repurchase Price and/or to the Owner the Option Share Repurchase Price therefor
or the portion thereof that Issuer is not then prohibited under applicable law
and regulation from so delivering.

(c) To the extent that Issuer is prohibited under applicable
law or regulation, or as a consequence of administrative policy, from
repurchasing the Option and/or the Option Shares in full, Issuer shall
immediately so notify the Holder and/or the Owner and thereafter deliver or
cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the Holder and/or the Owner, as
appropriate, the portion of the Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share
Repurchase Price, respectively, that it is no longer prohibited from delivering,
within five business days after the date on which Issuer is no longer so
prohibited; provided, however, that if Issuer at any time after delivery of a
notice of repurchase pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section 7 is prohibited
under applicable law or regulation, or as a consequence of administrative
policy, from delivering to the Holder and/or the Owner, as appropriate, the
Option Repurchase Price and the Option Share Repurchase Price, respectively, in
full (and Issuer hereby undertakes to use its best efforts to obtain all
required regulatory and legal approvals and to file any required notices as
promptly as practicable in order to accomplish such repurchase), the Holder or
Owner may revoke its notice of repurchase of the Option or the Option Shares
whether in whole or to the extent of the prohibition, whereupon, in the latter
case, Issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to the Holder and/or the Owner, as
appropriate, that portion of the Option Purchase Price or the Option Share
Repurchase Price that Issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and (ii)
deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to the Holder, a new

-9-
<PAGE>

Agreement evidencing the right of the Holder to purchase that number of shares
of Common Stock obtained by multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock for
which the surrendered Agreement was exercisable at the time of delivery of the
notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Option
Repurchase Price less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to the Holder
and the denominator of which is the Option Repurchase Price, or (B) to the
Owner, a certificate for the Option Shares it is then so prohibited from
repurchasing. If an Exercise Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the
date of the notice by Issuer described in the first sentence of this subsection
(c), or shall be scheduled to occur at any time before the expiration of a
period ending on the thirtieth day after such date, the Holder shall nonetheless
have the right to exercise the Option until the expiration of such 30-day
period.

8. (a) In the event that prior to an Exercise Termination Event,
Issuer shall enter into an agreement (i) to consolidate with or merge into any
person, other than Grantee or a Grantee Subsidiary, and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation of such consolidation or merger, (ii) to
permit any person, other than Grantee or a Grantee Subsidiary, to merge into
Issuer and Issuer shall be the continuing or surviving corporation, but, in
connection with such merger, the then outstanding shares of Common Stock shall
be changed into or exchanged for stock or other securities of any other person
or cash or any other property or the then outstanding shares of Common Stock
shall after such merger represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares and
share equivalents of the merged company, or (iii) to sell or otherwise transfer
all or substantially all of its or any Significant Subsidiary's assets or
deposits to any person, other than Grantee or a Grantee Subsidiary, then, and in
each such case, the agreement governing such transaction shall make proper
provision so that the Option shall, upon the consummation of any such
transaction and upon the terms and conditions set forth herein, be converted
into, or exchanged for, an option (the "Substitute Option"), at the election of
the Holder, of either (x) the Acquiring Corporation (as hereinafter defined) or
(y) any person that controls the Acquiring Corporation.

(b) The following terms have the meanings indicated:

(i) "Acquiring Corporation" shall mean (i) the continuing or
surviving corporation of a consolidation or merger with Issuer (if
other than Issuer), (ii) Issuer in a merger in which Issuer is the
continuing or surviving person, and (iii) the transferee of all or
substantially all of Issuer's assets or deposits (or the assets or
deposits of a Significant Subsidiary of Issuer).

(ii) "Substitute Common Stock" shall mean the common stock
issued by the issuer of the Substitute Option upon exercise of the
Substitute Option.

-10-
<PAGE>

(iii) "Assigned Value" shall mean the market/offer price, as
defined in Section 7.

(iv) "Average Price" shall mean the average closing price of
a share of the Substitute Common Stock for one year immediately
preceding the consolidation, merger or sale in question, but in no
event higher than the closing price of the shares of Substitute Common
Stock on the day preceding such consolidation, merger or sale;
provided that if Issuer is the issuer of the Substitute Option, the
Average Price shall be computed with respect to a share of common
stock issued by the person merging into Issuer or by any company which
controls or is controlled by such person, as the Holder may elect.

(c) The Substitute Option shall have the same terms as the
Option, provided, that if the terms of the Substitute Option cannot, for legal
reasons, be the same as the Option, such terms shall be as similar as possible
and in no event less advantageous to the Holder. The issuer of the Substitute
Option shall also enter into an agreement with the then Holder or Holders of the
Substitute Option in substantially the same form as this Agreement (after giving
effect for such purpose to the provisions of Section 9), which agreement shall
be applicable to the Substitute Option.

(d) The Substitute Option shall be exercisable for such number
of shares of Substitute Common Stock as is equal to the Assigned Value
multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then
exercisable, divided by the Average Price. The exercise price of the Substitute
Option per share of Substitute Common Stock shall then be equal to the Option
Price multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock for which the Option is then exercisable and the
denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock
for which the Substitute Option is exercisable.

(e) In no event, pursuant to any of the foregoing
paragraphs, shall the Substitute Option be exercisable for more than 19.9% of
the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior to exercise of the
Substitute Option. In the event that the Substitute Option would be exercisable
for more than 19.9% of the shares of Substitute Common Stock outstanding prior
to exercise but for this clause (e), the issuer of the Substitute Option (the
"Substitute Option Issuer") shall make a cash payment to Holder equal to the
excess of (i) the value of the Substitute Option without giving effect to the
limitation in this clause (e) over (ii) the value of the Substitute Option after
giving effect to the limitation in this clause (e). This difference in value
shall be determined by a nationally recognized investment banking firm selected
by the Holder.

(f) Issuer shall not enter into any transaction described in
subsection (a) of this Section 8 unless the Acquiring Corporation and any person

-11-
<PAGE>

that controls the Acquiring Corporation assume in writing all the obligations of
Issuer hereunder.

9. (a) At the request of the holder of the Substitute Option (the
"Substitute Option Holder"), the issuer of the Substitute Option (the
"Substitute Option Issuer") shall repurchase the Substitute Option from the
Substitute Option Holder at a price (the "Substitute Option Repurchase Price")
equal to (x) the amount by which (i) the Highest Closing Price (as hereinafter
defined) exceeds (ii) the exercise price of the Substitute Option, multiplied by
the number of shares of Substitute Common Stock for which the Substitute Option
may then be exercised plus (y) Grantee's Out-of-Pocket Expenses (to the extent
not previously reimbursed), and at the request of the owner (the "Substitute
Share Owner") of shares of Substitute Common Stock (the "Substitute Shares"),
the Substitute Option Issuer shall repurchase the Substitute Shares at a price
(the "Substitute Share Repurchase Price") equal to (x) the Highest Closing Price
multiplied by the number of Substitute Shares so designated plus (y) Grantee's
Out-of-Pocket Expenses (to the extent not previously reimbursed). The term
"Highest Closing Price" shall mean the highest closing price for shares of
Substitute Common Stock within the six-month period immediately preceding the
date the Substitute Option Holder gives notice of the required repurchase of the
Substitute Option or the Substitute Share Owner gives notice of the required
repurchase of the Substitute Shares, as applicable.

(b) The Substitute Option Holder and the Substitute Share Owner,
as the case may be, may exercise its respective right to require the Substitute
Option Issuer to repurchase the Substitute Option and the Substitute Shares
pursuant to this Section 9 by surrendering for such purpose to the Substitute
Option Issuer, at its principal office, the agreement for such Substitute Option
(or, in the absence of such an agreement, a copy of this Agreement) and
certificates for Substitute Shares accompanied by a written notice or notices
stating that the Substitute Option Holder or the Substitute Share Owner, as the
case may be, elects to require the Substitute Option Issuer to repurchase the
Substitute Option and/or the Substitute Shares in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 9. As promptly as practicable and in any event within five
business days after the surrender of the Substitute Option and/or certificates
representing Substitute Shares and the receipt of such notice or notices
relating thereto, the Substitute Option Issuer shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Substitute Option Holder the Substitute Option Repurchase Price
and/or to the Substitute Share Owner the Substitute Share Repurchase Price
therefor or the portion thereof which the Substitute Option Issuer is not then
prohibited under applicable law and regulation from so delivering.

(c) To the extent that the Substitute Option Issuer is prohibited
under applicable law or regulation, or as a consequence of administrative
policy, from repurchasing the Substitute Option and/or the Substitute Shares in
part or in full, the Substitute Option Issuer shall immediately so notify the
Substitute Option Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner and thereafter
deliver or cause to be delivered, from time to time, to the Substitute Option
Holder and/or the Substitute

-12-
<PAGE>

Share Owner, as appropriate, the portion of the Substitute Share Repurchase
Price, respectively, which it is no longer prohibited from delivering, within
five business days after the date on which the Substitute Option Issuer is no
longer so prohibited; provided, however, that if the Substitute Option Issuer is
at any time after delivery of a notice of repurchase pursuant to subsection (b)
of this Section 9 prohibited under applicable law or regulation, or as a
consequence of administrative policy, from delivering to the Substitute Option
Holder and/or the Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, the Substitute Option
Repurchase Price and the Substitute Share Repurchase Price, respectively, in
full (and the Substitute Option Issuer shall use its best efforts to receive all
required regulatory and legal approvals as promptly as practicable in order to
accomplish such repurchase), the Substitute Option Holder or Substitute Share
Owner may revoke its notice of repurchase of the Substitute Option or the
Substitute Shares either in whole or to the extent of prohibition, whereupon, in
the latter case, the Substitute Option Issuer shall promptly (i) deliver to the
Substitute Option Holder or Substitute Share Owner, as appropriate, that portion
of the Substitute Option Repurchase Price or the Substitute Share Repurchase
Price that the Substitute Option Issuer is not prohibited from delivering; and
(ii) deliver, as appropriate, either (A) to the Substitute Option Holder, a new
Substitute Option evidencing the right of the Substitute Option Holder to
purchase that number of shares of the Substitute Common Stock obtained by
multiplying the number of shares of the Substitute Common Stock for which the
surrendered Substitute Option was exercisable at the time of delivery of the
notice of repurchase by a fraction, the numerator of which is the Substitute
Option Repurchase Price less the portion thereof theretofore delivered to the
Substitute Option Holder and the denominator of which is the Substitute Option
Repurchase Price, or (B) to the Substitute Share Owner, a certificate for the
Substitute Option Shares it is then so prohibited from repurchasing. If an
Exercise Termination Event shall have occurred prior to the date of the notice
by the Substitute Option Issuer described in the first sentence of this
subsection (c), or shall be scheduled to occur at any time before the expiration
of a period ending on the thirtieth day after such date, the Substitute Option
Holder shall nevertheless have the right to exercise the Substitute Option until
the expiration of such 30-day period.
10. The 30-day, 12-month or 18-month periods for exercise of certain
rights under Sections 2, 6, 7, 9 and 12 shall be extended: (i) to the extent
necessary to obtain all regulatory approvals for the exercise of such rights
(for so long as the Holder is using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
such regulatory approvals), and for the expiration of all statutory waiting
periods; and (ii) to the extent necessary to avoid liability under Section 16(b)
of the 1934 Act by reason of such exercise.

11. Issuer hereby represents and warrants to Grantee as follows:

(a) Issuer has full corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the

-13-
<PAGE>

transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by the
Board of Directors of Issuer and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Issuer are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions so contemplated. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by Issuer. This Agreement is the valid and legally binding
obligation of Issuer.

(b) Issuer has taken all necessary corporate action to authorize and
reserve and to permit it to issue, and at all times from the date hereof through
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms will have
reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the Option, that number of shares of
Common Stock equal to the maximum number of shares of Common Stock at any time
and from time to time issuable hereunder, and all such shares, upon issuance
pursuant thereto, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable, and will be delivered free and clear of all claims, liens,
encumbrance and security interests and not subject to any preemptive rights.

12. Neither of the parties hereto may assign any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement or the Option created hereunder to any other
person, without the express written consent of the other party, except that in
the event a Subsequent Triggering Event shall have occurred prior to an Exercise
Termination Event, Grantee, subject to the express provisions hereof, may assign
in whole or in part its rights and obligations hereunder within 12 months
following such Subsequent Triggering Event (or such later period as provided in
Section 10); provided, however, that until the date 30 days following the date
on which the Federal Reserve Board and OTS have approved applications by Grantee
to acquire the shares of Common Stock subject to the Option, Grantee may not
assign its rights under the Option except in (i) a widely dispersed public
distribution, (ii) a private placement in which no one party acquires the right
to purchase in excess of 2% of the voting shares of Issuer, (iii) an assignment
to a single party (e.g., a broker or investment banker) for the purpose of
conducting a widely dispersed public distribution on Grantee's behalf, or (iv)
any other manner approved by the Federal Reserve Board and OTS.

13. If the Grantee has been paid the termination fee provided for in
the Merger Agreement (the "Termination Fee") and at any time receives any Net
Realized Cash (as defined below) under this Agreement, then Grantee shall be
obligated, as provided in this Section 13, to reimburse such Termination Fee,
but only up to the amount of Net Realized Cash received by the Grantee. The
term "Net Realized Cash" shall mean: (i) any cash proceeds received on sale or
other disposition of Option Shares (or on sale or other disposition of other
consideration received in exchange for such Option Shares), net of all related
commissions, fees, underwriting discounts, costs and expenses; (ii) any Option
Repurchase Price paid pursuant to Section 7 hereof; and (iii) any cash proceeds
received in exchange for sale or other disposition of the Option (or upon sale
or other disposition of other consideration received in exchange for such
Option), net of all related commissions, fees, underwriting discounts, costs and
expenses. If the Grantee becomes obligated to

reimburse all or any part of the Termination Fee under this Section 13, Grantee
shall do so as soon as practicable upon receipt of the Net Realized Cash, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account designated by
Issuer. In no event shall the aggregate amount payable by Grantee under this
Section 13 exceed the lesser of (x) the amount of Termination Fee previously
received by Grantee and (y) the amount of Net Realized Cash received by Grantee
under this Agreement.

14. Each of Grantee and Issuer will use its best efforts to make all
filings with, and to obtain consents of, all third parties and governmental
authorities necessary to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including without limitation applying to the Federal Reserve
Board under the Bank Holding Company Act and the OTS under the Home Owners Loan
Act for approval to acquire the shares issuable hereunder, but Grantee shall not
be obligated to apply to state banking authorities for approval to acquire the
shares of Common Stock issuable hereunder until such time, if ever, as it deems
appropriate to do so.

15. The parties hereto acknowledge that damages would be an
inadequate remedy for a breach of this Agreement by either party hereto and that
the obligations of the parties hereto shall be enforceable by either party
hereto through injunctive or other equitable relief.

16. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction contained in this
Agreement is held by a court or a federal or state regulatory agency of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions and covenants and restrictions contained in this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect, and shall in no way be affected, impaired
or invalidated. If for any reason such court or regulatory agency determines
that the Holder is not permitted to acquire, or Issuer is not permitted to
repurchase pursuant to Section 7, the full number of shares of Common Stock
provided in Section 1(a) hereof (as adjusted pursuant to Section 1(b) or 5
hereof), it is the express intention of Issuer to allow the Holder to acquire or
to require Issuer to repurchase such lesser number of shares as may be
permissible, without any amendment or modification hereof.

17. All notices, requests, claims, demands and other communications
hereunder shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered in person, by
fax, telecopy, or by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return
receipt requested) at the respective addresses of the parties set forth in the
Merger Agreement.

18. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Minnesota, regardless of the laws that might
otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

19. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each
of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute
one and the same agreement.

20. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, each of the
parties hereto shall bear and pay all costs and expenses incurred by it or on
its behalf in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder, including
fees and expenses of its own financial consultants, investment bankers,
accountants and counsel.

21. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or in the Merger
Agreement, this Agreement contain the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereunder and supersedes all prior
arrangements or understandings with respect thereof, written or oral. The terms
and conditions of this Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assignees.
Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any
party, other than the parties hereto, and their respective successors except as
assignees, any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason
of this Agreement, except as expressly provided herein.

22. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement and not defined herein
shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Merger Agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties has caused this Agreement to
be executed on its behalf by its officers thereunto duly authorized, all of the
