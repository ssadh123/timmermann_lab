Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.

David Zack, a retired partner in David Berdon & Co.
("David Berdon"), the independent auditors of Petrie
Stores Corporation (the "Company"), has been appointed as
an executor of the Estate of Milton Petrie. As a result,
David Berdon may no longer be deemed independent and, on
November 14, 1994, the Audit Committee and the Company's
Board of Directors approved the appointment of Ernst &
Young LLP as the Company's independent auditors for the
fiscal year ending January 28, 1995, to replace David
Berdon.

David Berdon's reports on the financial statements
for the two most recent fiscal years did not contain an
adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion, nor were they
qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principles.

During the Company's two most recent fiscal years
and the six month period ended July 30, 1994, the Company
did not have any disagreements with David Berdon on any
matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure,
which disagreement, if not resolved to the satisfaction
of David Berdon, would have caused David Berdon to make
reference thereto in connection with its reports, nor did
David Berdon advise the Company as to any "reportable
events" as such term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of
Regulation S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "Commission").

During the two most recent fiscal years and the six
month period ended July 30, 1994, the Company has not
consulted with Ernst & Young LLP regarding any of the
matters listed in Item 304(a)(2)(i)-(ii) of Regulation S-
K of the Commission.

The Company has requested David Berdon to furnish a
letter addressed to the Commission stating whether it
agrees with the above statements. A copy of the letter
from David Berdon to the Commission, dated November 17,
1994, is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Report.

Securities and Exchange 
Commission
Washington, D.C. 20549

Gentlemen:

We were previously the accountants for Petrie Stores
Corporation and Subsidiaries, and, on March 24, 1994
(except for Note N, as to which the date is April 20,
1994), we reported on the consolidated financial
statements of Petrie Stores Corporation and Subsidiaries
as of January 29, 1994 and January 30, 1993, and for the
two years ended January 29, 1994. On November 14, 1994,
we resigned as principal accountants of Petrie Stores
Corporation. We have read Petrie Stores Corporation's
statements included under Item 4 of its Current Report on
Form 8-K dated as of November 17, 1994, and we agree with
such statements.

Very truly yours,

/s/ David Berdon & Co.
