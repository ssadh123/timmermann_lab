ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

In connection with its program of acquiring financial institutions in
existing or adjacent markets, Regions Financial Corporation ("Regions") is
filing this Current Report on Form 8-K (the "Current Report") with respect to
certain aspects of its consummated and pending acquisitions for the 1994 fiscal
year.

During the first nine months of 1994, Regions has consummated the
acquisitions of (i) Guaranty Bank and Trust Company ("Guaranty"), located in
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, (ii) First Bank of Fayette ("First Fayette"), located
in Fayette, Alabama, (iii) Bank of New Roads, located in New Roads, Louisiana,
and (iv) First Rome Bank, located in Rome, Georgia, contributing an aggregate
of approximately $527 million in assets, $291 million in loans, and $470
million in deposits to Regions' consolidated balance sheet. Also during the
same period, Regions consummated certain transactions with the Resolution Trust
Corporation (the "RTC") as a result of which Regions Bank of Florida, Regions'
banking subsidiary in Florida, acquired four branch offices in Panama City,
Florida, First Alabama Bank, Regions' banking subsidiary in Alabama, acquired a
branch office in each of Atmore and Brewton, Alabama, Secor Bank, Federal
Savings Bank, a savings bank subsidiary of Regions in Louisiana, acquired a
branch office in Houma, Louisiana, and Guaranty acquired two branch offices in
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with combined deposits in the nine offices of
approximately $90 million.

Since September 30, 1994, Regions has completed the acquisition of First
American Bank and Trust of Louisiana ("First American"), located in Monroe,
Louisiana (the "First American Acquisition"), which added approximately $307
million in assets to Regions' consolidated balance sheet, and which resulted in
the issuance of approximately 1,784,000 shares of Regions Common Stock having
an approximate value of $55 million, computed as of the date of consummation of
the First American Acquisition. Regions has accounted for the First American
Acquisition as a purchase.

In addition, as of the date of this Current Report, Regions has pending
three additional acquisitions (the "Pending Acquisitions") in Georgia,
Louisiana, and Alabama, certain aspects of which transactions are set forth in
the following table.

(1) Calculated as of the date of announcement of such transactions.

(2) At the effective time of the merger of an interim subsidiary of Regions
into Fidelity Federal Savings Bank ("Fidelity") (the "Fidelity Effective
Time"), each share of Fidelity common stock issued and outstanding at the
Fidelity Effective Time, with certain exceptions, will be converted into 0.449
<PAGE> 3

of a share of Regions Common Stock, subject to possible adjustment in the event
the average of the closing prices of Regions common stock over a specified
period is less than $32.32 (the "Fidelity Exchange Ratio"), and each share of 
Fidelity preferred stock issued and outstanding at the Fidelity Effective Time, 
with certain exceptions, will be converted into that number of shares of 
Regions Common Stock obtained by multiplying the Fidelity Exchange Ratio by the 
number of shares of Fidelity common stock into which such share of preferred 
stock is convertible at the Fidelity Effective Time.

(3) At the effective time of the merger of First Commercial Bancshares, Inc.
("First Commercial") into Regions (the "First Commercial Effective Time"),
each share of First Commercial common stock issued and outstanding at the First
Commercial Effective Time, with certain exceptions, will be converted, at the
option of the holder, into either (a) 2.626 shares of Regions Common Stock,
subject to possible adjustment, or (b) a combination of 1.444 shares of Regions
Common Stock, subject to possible adjustment, and $40.77 in cash.

(4) At the effective time of the merger of Union Bank & Trust Company
("Union") with Regions (the "Union Effective Time"), each share of Union common
stock issued and outstanding at the Union Effective Time will be converted into
(a) that fraction of a share of Regions Common Stock equal to the quotient
obtained by dividing (x) $16.02 by (y) the Average Closing Price (defined
generally as the average of the daily closing sales prices of Regions Common
Stock on the Nasdaq National Market for the ten consecutive full trading days
ending at the close of trading on the fifth trading day preceding the Union
Effective Time) and (b) the right to receive on a deferred basis and in
accordance with the terms of an escrow trust agreement that additional fraction
of a share of Regions Common Stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
(x) $0.51 by (y) the Average Closing Price.

If the First American Acquisition and all of the Pending Acquisitions had
been consummated on September 30, 1994, based on September 30, 1994 pro forma
financial information, Regions' total consolidated assets would have increased
by approximately $1.1 billion to approximately $12.8 billion; its total
consolidated deposits would have increased by approximately $946 million to
approximately $10.2 billion; and its total consolidated stockholders' equity
would have increased by approximately $77 million to approximately $978
million.

Consummation of the Pending Acquisitions is subject to the approval of
certain regulatory agencies and of the stockholders of the institutions to be
acquired and to the effectiveness of the registration statements filed or to be
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Moreover, the closing of
each transaction is subject to various contractual conditions precedent. No
assurance can be given that the conditions precedent to consummating the
Pending Acquisitions will be satisfied in a manner that will result in the
consummation of all of the Pending Acquisitions.

In connection with the acquisitions of First American and Union, Regions
has announced that it may purchase, in the open market, an equivalent number of
some or all of the shares of Regions Common Stock to be issued in such
transactions. As a result of the First American and Union transactions,
Regions anticipates that it may purchase in the open market as much as
approximately $126 million of Regions Common Stock. The timing and amount of
such possible purchases will be determined based on Regions Common Stock
price, capital needs, and other factors. As of November 22, 1994, Regions had
purchased approximately $80.5 million of Regions Common Stock pursuant to this
repurchase program.

As part of its ongoing business strategy, Regions continually evaluates
business combination opportunities and frequently conducts due diligence
activities in connection with possible business combinations. As a result,
business combination discussions and, in some cases, negotiations frequently
take place, and future business combinations involving cash, debt, or equity
securities can be expected. Any future business combination or series of
business combinations that Regions might undertake may be material, in terms of
assets acquired or liabilities assumed, to Regions' financial condition. Recent
business combinations in the banking industry typically have involved the
payment of a premium over book and market values. This practice could result in
dilution of book value and net income per share for the acquirer.

Included as an exhibit to this Current Report, and incorporated herein by
reference, is certain unaudited pro forma financial information of Regions as
of September 30, 1994, prepared in accordance with Regulation S-X, giving
effect to the above-discussed acquisitions.

Regions Financial Corporation
Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Condensed Statement of Condition

a) To reflect the purchase, in the open market, of an additional 339,787
shares of Regions Common Stock at $30.00 per share to effect the First American
transaction. As of September 30, 1994, 1,444,600 shares of Regions Common Stock
were held in treasury stock for issuance in connection with the First American
transaction

b) To reflect the elimination of First American's capital accounts in
accordance with purchase accounting, and corresponding exchange of 1,784,387
shares of Regions Common Stock for all the outstanding shares of First American
common stock, assuming a market price of $30.00 per share for Regions Common
Stock. The Regions Common Stock exchanged is reflected as being issued from
treasury stock.

c) To reflect the purchase, in the open market, of 2,166,532 shares of Regions
Common Stock at $30.00 per share to effect the Union transaction.

d) To reflect the elimination of Union's capital accounts in accordance with
purchase accounting, and corresponding exchange of 2,166,532 shares of Regions
Common Stock for all the outstanding shares of Union common stock, assuming a
market price of $30.00 per share for Regions Common Stock. The Regions Common
Stock exchanged is reflected as being issued from treasury stock.

e) To reflect the elimination of First Commercial's capital accounts in
accordance with purchase accounting, and corresponding exchange of 489,808
shares of Regions Common Stock and $4.6 million in cash for all the outstanding
shares of First Commercial common stock, assuming a market price of $30 per
share for Regions Common Stock, and assuming that 50% of First Commercial's
outstanding shares will elect to receive Regions Common Stock and 50% will
elect to receive a combination of Regions Common Stock and cash.

f) Upon consummation of the merger with Fidelity, each share of Fidelity common
and preferred stock is assumed to be converted into .484 shares of Regions
Common Stock. resulting in the issuance of 1,004,203 shares of Regions Common
Stock. The Fidelity transaction will be accounted for as a
pooling-of-interests, therefore the effect upon stockholders' equity will be to
increase Regions stockholders' equity by the total equity of Fidelity. The
unaudited pro forma financial statements have been prepared assuming that
Regions will issue approximately 1,004,203 shares of Regions Common Stock to
the stockholders' of Fidelity, based on a market price of $30.00 per share for
Regions Common Stock. A reclassification from preferred and common stock to
surplus results from the issuance of the shares.
