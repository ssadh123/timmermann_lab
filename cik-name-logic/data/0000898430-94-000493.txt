APPLIED MAGNETICS CORPORATION
ANNOUNCES SEVERAL MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS

GOLETA, CALIFORNIA, June 17, 1994 - APPLIED MAGNETICS CORPORATION
(APM:NYSE) today announced that in response to the Company's recent losses and
deteriorating financial condition, its Board of Directors and executive
management have taken a number of steps which are intended to strengthen the
Company's financial condition and improve its performance.

The Company has retained Lehman Brothers Inc. as financial advisors to
assist the Company in exploring a number of strategic options for maximizing
shareholder value. In addition, the Company is proceeding with the
establishment of additional credit facilities.

Further, management has taken and will take a number of actions to reduce
costs and conserve cash. The Company believes that its existing production
capacity is adequate to support near term commitments; accordingly, near term
capital expenditures will be severely restricted. The Company also expects work
force reductions at a number of its facilities, including Goleta, California.

Bill Anderson, Chief Executive Officer, stated that "These actions are
being taken in order to improve the Company's ability to meet its commitments
to customers and make the necessary investments in critical technologies. These
steps are consistent with Applied Magnetics' goals to achieve a leadership
position in cost, quality and technology to support key customer programs and
ensure the Company's long-term success."

The Company also announced today that Dr. Richard D. Balanson had resigned
as President and Chief Operating Officer. Bill Anderson will assume the
additional role of President.

leading independent supplier of magnetic recording heads for both disk and tape
drive applications for the worldwide data storage segment of the computer
