sales for the periods ending in calendar 1994 exclude sales from these 24
stores and include results only from the remaining chain of 67 stores (versus
87 stores for the comparable periods last year). Comparable store sales
results exclude the results of the entire group of 24 HomeBase stores for both
periods.
