KROGER 3RD QTR OPER NET PER SHARE:
43 CENTS VS. 23 CENTS

CINCINNATI, Ohio, October 19, 1994 --- The Kroger Co. said
today that 1994 third quarter fully diluted earnings per share
before an extraordinary charge for the early retirement of
debt increased to 43 cents per share from 23 cents in the
prior year third quarter.

Earnings before the extraordinary charge totaled $51.2
million, compared to $25.2 million in last year's third
quarter. After the extraordinary charge of $15.2 million,
Kroger reported net earnings of $36.0 million, or 31 cents per
share on a fully-diluted basis, versus earnings of $16.4
million, or 16 cents per share, fully diluted, in the 1993
third quarter. 

Operating cash flow in the third quarter rose 10.1 percent to
$274.8 million, compared to $249.7 million in the third
quarter a year ago. 

Identical food store sales increased 2.3 percent, the largest
increase of any 1994 quarter. Food store sales, adjusted for
the disposition of San Antonio in 1993, increased 5.6 percent,
and total sales increased 2.6 percent to a record $6.65
billion from $6.48 billion in 1993. 

<PAGE>
Year-to-date, Kroger reported operating cash flow of $773.5
million. Earnings before the extraordinary charge for debt
retirement totaled $176.9 million, or $1.45 per fully-diluted
share. Total sales rose 2.3 percent to $17.4 billion.

Kroger Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Joseph A. Pichler
said the third quarter results reflect the positive effects of
the Company's accelerated store construction, improvements in
productivity, cost reductions in procurement and distribution,
and the payback from investments in new technologies. "We had
an impressive quarter across-the-board, with excellent same
store sales growth, a strong performance from Kroger-label
brands, and firm cost discpline throughout the organization,"
Pichler said.

During the third quarter, Kroger opened or expanded 19 food
stores. This expansion is on target with the Company's
previously disclosed plans to expand retail square footage by
a minimum of approximately 5-6 percent annually in 1994-96.

The Company said net interest expense declined 16.0 percent in
the third quarter to $100.7 million from $119.9 million. 
Long-term debt at the end of the third quarter was $3.9
billion, compared to $4.2 billion for the comparable 1993
quarter. 

Kroger also noted that within the past few weeks, new labor
contracts have been ratified covering approximately 22,000
store employees in Cincinnati, Louisville, and Charleston,
West Virginia. The contracts fix wages and benefits for 4.5
to five years and provide increased flexibility in operating
procedures and employee health care plans.
