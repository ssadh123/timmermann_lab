Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On October 3, 1994, A. L. Laboratories, Inc. (the "Company")
issued a press release announcing that it had completed the
acquisition of the pharmaceutical, animal health, bulk antibiotic
and aquatic animal health businesses of Apothekernes Laboratorium
A.S (the "Related Norwegian Businesses"). Concurrent with the
closing of the acquisition (the "Closing"), the Company has changed
its name to "A.L. Pharma Inc." and effective October 4, 1994, its
new trading symbol on the New York Stock Exchange became "ALO".

The combination of the Related Norwegian Businesses of
Apothekernes Laboratorium A.S ("A. L. Oslo") with A. L.
Laboratories was completed pursuant to a Restructuring Agreement
dated as of May 16, 1994 (the "Restructuring Agreement"), which was
approved separately by the shareholders of the Company and A. L.
Oslo. A. L. Oslo is the beneficial owner of 100% of the
outstanding shares of the Company's Class B stock and is able to
control the Company through its ability to elect more than a
majority of the Board of Directors and to cast in excess of a
majority of the votes in any vote of the Company's stockholders. 
In addition, Einar W. Sissener, a director and the Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of A.L. Oslo owns or has authority to vote
approximately 50.8% of the outstanding A.L. Oslo shares. The
consideration paid by the Company to the shareholders of A. L. Oslo
was approximately $24 million in cash, and warrants to purchase 3.6
million shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock. The warrants
expire on January 3, 1999 and have an exercise price of $21.945.

The Company obtained the funds for the acquisition under a
credit agreement and related documents dated September 28, 1994
between the Company and certain of its subsidiaries and a
consortium of banks led by the Union Bank of Norway.

The Company is required to account for the acquisition of the
Related Norwegian Businesses of A. L. Oslo as a transfer and
exchange between companies under common control. Accordingly, the
assets and liabilities of Related Norwegian Businesses will be
combined with the Company at historical cost in a manner similar to
a pooling-of-interests; and the Company's historical financial
statements will be restated to reflect the combined results of
operations, assets, liabilities and new worth of the Company and of
the Related Norwegian Businesses. The payment of the cash purchase
price will be reflected as reduction of combined equity as of the
closing date.

As disclosed in the proxy statement dated August 22, 1994, the
Company estimates it will incur and charge to earnings, as of the
date of the closing, non-operating transaction related expenses of
approximately $3.6 million after tax. In addition, the Company may
take a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of 1994 in
connection with the combination.
<PAGE>
In accordance with the terms of the Restructuring Agreement,
the Company's Certificate of Incorporation has been amended,
concurrent with the closing, to increase the percentage of
Directors elected by the holders of the Class A stock from 25% to
33 1/3%. In connection with this change, the shareholders have
elected Mr. Peter G. Tombros as a Class A Director of the Company.

Mr. Tombros is President and Chief Executive Officer of Enzon
Inc., a developer and marketer of pharmaceutical products. 
Previously, he held a number of senior management positions with
Pfizer, Inc. during his 26 year tenure. Mr. Tombros' election to
the Board will increase the number of Class A Directors to three,
and the total number of Directors to nine.
