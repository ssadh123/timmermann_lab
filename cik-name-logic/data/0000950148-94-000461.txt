FOOTHILL GROUP SUBSIDIARY ANNOUNCES

RECEIPT OF STANDARD & POOR'S RATING

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, November 14, 1994 . . . The Foothill Group,
Inc. (NYSE-FGI) today announced that Foothill Capital Corporation, its
asset-based lending subsidiary, has received an additional investment grade
rating on its senior debt and commercial paper. Standard & Poor's Ratings
Group assigned a 'BBB' rating on Foothill Capital's senior debt and 'A-2' on
its commercial paper.
David C. Hilton, Executive Vice President, stated, "We are very
pleased to receive these investment grade ratings from Standard & Poor's. The
investor base for our commercial paper program, which totaled over $225 million
as of September 30, 1994, should expand as a result of the 'A-2' commercial
paper rating. In addition, Foothill Capital expects to establish a public
medium term note program of approximately $300 million in the first quarter of
1995. This program should significantly broaden the Company's access to the
capital markets. Historically, the term debt of Foothill Capital was issued
privately. We anticipate saving approximately 30 basis points on each public
medium term note issuance when compared to a private term debt issuance.
Foothill Capital anticipates issuing between $100 million and $150 million
annually in the public medium term note market in the next two years.
"Foothill Capital carries investment grade ratings of 'BBB+' on its
senior debt and 'Duff 2' on its commercial paper from Duff & Phelps Credit
Rating Co. Fitch Investors Service, Inc. maintains a 'BBB+' rating on
Foothill Capital's senior obligations and a "F-2' rating on the Company's
commercial paper."

THE FOOTHILL GROUP, INC. REPORTS

IMPROVED THIRD QUARTER RESULTS

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, October 17, 1994 . . . The Foothill Group,
Inc. (NYSE-FGI) today reported net income for the third quarter ended September
30, 1994 of $5,719,000, or 33 cents per fully diluted share, compared with net
income of $5,650,000, or 32 cents per fully diluted share, for the quarter
ended September 30, 1993. For the nine months ended September 30, 1994, net
income increased 57% to $23,764,000, or $1.35 per fully diluted share, compared
with net income of $15,151,000, or 88 cents per fully diluted share, for the
same period in 1993.
Henry K. Jordan, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,
said, "Third quarter results reflect strong profitability of our asset-based
lending operations and continued growth of the asset-based loan portfolio.
Finance receivables reached $675,759,000 as of September 30, 1994, up 42% on an
annualized basis from $514,518,000 as of December 31, 1993. Included in the
third quarter finance receivable growth were seasonal borrowings by several
clients who typically repay substantial portions of their borrowings as their
seasonal working capital positions strengthen.
"We are especially pleased that over 75% of our third quarter earnings
resulted from asset-based lending operations as compared to 49% in the 1993
third quarter. The credit quality of the Company's asset-based loan portfolio
continued to improve in the third quarter. Margins remained strong for both
the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 1994, due in part to
reductions in the Company's cost of funds. Volatility in the interest rate
environment has minimal impact on the Company's margins due to its
<PAGE> 4
policy of matching interest sensitive assets and liabilities. Net interest
revenue, as a percent of average assets, was 8.60% for the 1994 third quarter,
compared with 8.52% for the third quarter ended September 30, 1993.
"Equity and purchased bank debt positions owned by the Company have
unrealized gains totaling $38,760,000 as of September 30, 1994, up from
$33,719,000 as of June 30, 1994. In addition, investments of Foothill's
managed partnerships show substantial unrealized gains which, if realized, may
contribute to future earnings. The Company anticipates marketing a new fund,
Foothill Partners III, in the spring of 1995. This newest fund will have a
capital subscription goal of $500 million and is expected to commence
operations in 1996. Foothill Partners III will continue the managed
partnerships focus of investing in distressed debt and other securities of
companies in reorganization or in the process of restructuring.
"Book value per common share was $10.21 as of September 30, 1994, up
from $9.02 as of December 31, 1993. The Company repurchased and retired
292,700 common shares during the 1994 third quarter under its previously
announced common stock repurchase program. Total stockholders' equity
increased in the 1994 third quarter to a record $170 million."
The Foothill Group, Inc. is a specialized financial services company
which operates two tightly linked businesses: commercial lending and money
management. Foothill Capital Corporation, its wholly-owned subsidiary,
provides asset-based financing to businesses throughout the United States. The
parent company's money management operation conducts business through
