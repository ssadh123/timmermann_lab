ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.
This report is being filed with respect to the consummation of an
acquisition previously reported as pending and to present and update other
previously filed material.
On December 14, 1994, the Registrant purchased from Crowley Cellular
Telecommunications Limited Partnership ("Crowley LP") all of the outstanding
stock of Crowley Cellular Telecommunications Binghamton, Inc. ("Crowley Inc.")
for a purchase price of 1,766,674 shares of the Registrant's Class A Common
Stock and $5.2 million in cash, subject to certain closing adjustments. Crowley
LP was the sole shareholder of Crowley Inc. Crowley Inc. is the Federal
Communications Commission ("FCC") license holder for the nonwireline cellular
telephone system in the Elmira, New York metropolitan statistical area ("Elmira
MSA") and is the general partner and 97% owner of the partnership that is the
FCC license holder for the nonwireline cellular telephone system in the
Binghamton, New York metropolitan statistical area ("Binghamton MSA").
Concurrently with this acquisition, the Registrant acquired the remaining
minority interest of the partnership that holds the Binghamton FCC license for a
cash price of $900,000. The cash portion of the purchase price for each
acquisition was financed with borrowings under the Registrant's then existing
$390 million loan agreement with a group of lenders led by The Bank of New York
and The Toronto-Dominion Bank as managing agents (the "1993 Loan Agreement"). On
December 23, 1994, the Registrant closed a new $675 million credit facility with
a group of banks led by the same managing agents (the "1994 Credit Facility")
which refinanced the 1993 Loan Agreement. The stock issued by Registrant in
payment of part of the purchase price for Crowley, Inc. was registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 for resale to the public by Crowley LP. The Stock
Purchase Agreement is incorporated by reference as an exhibit hereto.
On September 26, 1994, the Registrant entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement with Sunshine Cellular, a general partnership ("Sunshine"), to acquire
all of the assets of Sunshine for a purchase price of $50.4 million, subject to
certain closing adjustments. Sunshine is the FCC license holder for the
nonwireline cellular telephone system in the Pennsylvania 8-Union rural service
area ("PA-8 RSA"). The purchase price consists of $15.0 million in cash with the
remainder payable, at Registrant's option, in cash or Class A Common Stock of
the Registrant, or any combination thereof. The Registrant expects to fund the
cash portion of the purchase price with its new 1994 Credit Facility. Any stock
issued by Registrant in payment of part or all of the purchase price must be
subject to a then effective registration statement under the Securities Act of
1933 for resale to the public. The Asset Purchase Agreement is incorporated by
reference as an exhibit hereto. The closing of the acquisition of the PA-8 RSA
is subject to customary conditions and regulatory approval and is expected to
occur in the first quarter of 1995.
Historical financial statements and pro forma financial information with
respect to these acquisitions is included herewith under Item 7.
In addition to the foregoing, on October 24, 1994 the Registrant completed
the closing of the acquisition of the holder of the FCC licenses for the West
Virginia 1 -- Mason rural service area ("WV-1 RSA") and the Maine
4 -- Washington rural service area ("ME-4 RSA") for an aggregate purchase price
of approximately $6.7 million in cash and $3.3 million in Class A Common Stock.
This transaction did not involve businesses that are significant under
Regulation S-X. Accordingly, financial statements and pro forma financial
information are not included herein with respect thereto nor is the acquisition
agreement filed as an exhibit.
The terms of each of the foregoing transactions were arrived at through
private negotiation and were based primarily on the population of the markets to
be acquired and the value of existing operations and the subscriber base. The
Registrant intends to continue to use the assets of the acquired markets in
those respective markets.

NOTE 1 -- DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND
REPORTING POLICIES
Crowley Cellular Telecommunications Binghamton, Inc. (Crowley Inc. -- a
wholly owned subsidiary of Crowley Cellular Telecommunications, L.P. (Crowley
LP)) was formed on August 10, 1988, to conduct cellular operations in Elmira,
New York, under a franchise issued by the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC). Crowley Inc. also maintains a majority investment (96.9651% at December
31, 1993, and September 30, 1993 and 1994) in Binghamton CellTelCo. (BCTC),
which conducts cellular operations in Binghamton, New York, under a franchise
issued by the FCC. The franchises are geographically limited to specific market
boundaries defined by the U.S. Census Bureau as Standard Metropolitan
Statistical Areas, or SMSA's.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
NOTE 1 -- DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND
REPORTING POLICIES -- Continued
INCOME TAXES
In February, 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes," which requires a change from the deferred method to the asset and
liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability
method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of
"temporary differences" by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to
future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and
the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. Crowley Inc. adopted SFAS No.
109 effective January 1, 1993.
Partnership losses of BCTC have been included in the taxable income of
Crowley Inc. to the extent of allocations in accordance with the terms of the
partnership agreement. Due to net losses incurred, no income taxes are due and,
accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been reflected in the
accompanying statements of operations. Crowley Inc. has aggregate tax net
operating losses (which approximate book net operating losses) of approximately
$11,300,000, $10,900,000 and $11,600,000 as of December 31, 1993, and September
30, 1993 and 1994, respectively, which may be utilized to offset future taxable
income of Crowley Inc. Crowley Inc. has not recognized any benefit to be derived
from future recognition of net operating losses.
REVENUES
Cellular service revenue is recognized when earned. Recurring monthly
subscriber revenues are billed in advance. The unearned portion of the
subscriber revenue is deferred and included in accrued expenses in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Sales of mobile phone equipment and
related services are recorded at the point the goods and services are delivered.
INTERIM FINANCIAL DATA
In management's opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements for the nine months ended September 30, 1993 and 1994, are presented
on a basis consistent with the audited consolidated financial statements, and
all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, which are
necessary to present fairly the operating results have been reflected. The
results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of
operations for the full fiscal year.
NOTE 2 -- BANK NOTES PAYABLE
Crowley Inc. has approximately $6,900,000 outstanding at December 31, 1993,
under a Third Amended and Restated Loan Agreement (Agreement) dated January 7,
1992. The Agreement is between Crowley LP and its wholly owned subsidiaries,
including Crowley Inc., and various banks. Interest is payable quarterly at
adjusted prime (6% at December 31, 1993, 6% at September 30, 1993, and 7.75% at
September 30, 1994) or LIBOR plus 1% (5% and 4.5625% at December 31, 1993, and
5.1875% at September 30, 1993).
Under the Agreement, up to $35,000,000 is available to Crowley Inc. and up
to $35,000,000 is available to Crowley LP's entire subsidiary group, subject to
the maintenance of certain covenants and overall borrowing limitations for
Crowley LP's entire subsidiary group. At December 31, 1993, available borrowings
totaled $35,000,000 for Crowley LP's entire subsidiary group. Crowley LP's
subsidiaries are required to pay commitment fees equal to 1/2% per annum on the
excess of available borrowings over amounts outstanding and 1/8% per annum on
the excess of the original commitment over available borrowings. There are no
compensating balances required.
The Agreement calls for Crowley LP's subsidiaries to maintain certain
quarterly financial ratios, which include debt to the population of the markets
served by the subsidiaries, along with other financial ratios. In addition, the
Agreement places certain restrictions on, among other things, the use of funds,
additional indebtedness, payment of dividends by Crowley LP's subsidiaries and
the sale of assets or the stock of Crowley LP's subsidiaries. As of December 31,
1993, and September 30, 1994, Crowley LP's subsidiaries were in compliance with
all requirements.
Amounts outstanding under the Agreement are secured by the joint and
several guarantee of each subsidiary of Crowley LP and by all of the
subsidiaries' assets. In addition, Crowley LP has pledged the stock of each
subsidiary as security and

each limited partner of Crowley LP and each shareholder of Crowley LP's general
partner has also pledged his partnership interest and stock, respectively, as
additional security.
The amounts outstanding under the Agreement were converted to term loans on
June 30, 1994, which mature over a period of six years. Under the provisions of
the term loans, bank notes payable as of December 31, 1993, will mature as
follows:

Certain provisions of the Agreement require Crowley LP's subsidiaries to
make prepayments should certain levels of cash flow, as defined, be achieved. No
prepayments were required under these provisions during 1993.
NOTE 3 -- SUBORDINATED NOTES PAYABLE
Subordinated notes payable consist of notes payable to limited partners of
Crowley LP, bearing interest at 8%. Notes payable to limited partners of Crowley
LP are subordinate to all other debt of Crowley Inc. The outstanding amounts are
secured by the stock of Crowley Inc. In addition, each limited partner of
Crowley LP and each shareholder of Crowley LP's general partner has pledged his
partnership interest and stock, respectively, as additional security. The
amounts outstanding under these notes mature on June 30, 1995; however, under
the terms of the Agreement described in Note 2, the creditors have agreed not to
demand payment until September 30, 1999, 90 days following an acceleration of
the bank notes payable, or 365 days following an event of default under the
agreements between these subordinated lenders and Crowley Inc., whichever occurs
first.
NOTE 4 -- RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Crowley Cellular Telecommunications, Inc. (CCTI), the general partner of
Crowley LP, performs certain administrative services on behalf of Crowley Inc.
and its subsidiary. MLC Industries, Inc. (MLC), whose shareholders are limited
partners of Crowley LP, manages the operations and performs certain

SUNSHINE CELLULAR
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION
Sunshine Cellular, a Maryland general partnership ("Sunshine"), is a
provider of cellular telephone service to the Union, Pennsylvania (PA-8) RSA.
Sunshine was formed on November 13, 1989 and the PA-8 RSA became operational in
January, 1992.
Sunshine operates under the trade name of CELLULARONE which is the trade
name many nonwireline carriers have adopted to provide conformity throughout the
industry.
NOTE 2 -- BASIS OF PRESENTATION
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern
basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of
liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Sunshine is in an
industry with vigorous competition and has incurred losses since inception. As
of September 30, 1994, Sunshine had a partners' deficit of $4,405,000, primarily
as a result of losses incurred since operations began in 1992. Sunshine has
incurred net losses of $1,388,000 for the year ended December 31, 1993 and
$106,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 1994.
As further discussed in Note 5, principal payments on Sunshine's long-term
debt are scheduled to commence on March 1, 1995. Sunshine's level of operations
is not expected to be sufficient to enable the Partnership to meet its principal
repayment requirements.
Sunshine is required to repay all outstanding debt with the proceeds from
the sale of its assets to Vanguard Cellular Systems, Inc. ("Vanguard"). This
sale is scheduled to be consummated in the first quarter of 1995. (See Note 10.)
Should this sale to Vanguard not occur, management intends to renegotiate its
existing long-term debt facility or to seek additional financing.
If management is unsuccessful in these plans, future operating income
levels generated by Sunshine may not be sufficient to allow Sunshine to meet its
contractual obligations under the terms of its long-term debt agreement. As a
result of the uncertainties described above, there is substantial doubt about
Sunshine's ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do
not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these
uncertainties.
NOTE 3 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING POLICIES
CELLULAR TELEPHONE INVENTORIES
Inventories, consisting primarily of cellular telephones held for resale,
are valued at the lower of first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost or market.
PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT
Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is calculated on
a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes over the following
estimated useful lives:
<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Buildings and leasehold improvements.................................................... 15-40 years
Cellular telephone system equipment..................................................... 10-15 years
Office furniture and equipment.......................................................... 5-7 years
</TABLE>

REVENUE RECOGNITION
Service fees are recognized at the time cellular services are provided and
service fees related to prebilled services are not recognized until earned.
Cellular telephone equipment revenues consist primarily of sales of cellular
telephones to subscribers and are recognized at the time equipment is delivered
to the subscriber.
INCOME TAXES
Income taxes are not payable by or provided for Sunshine. Partners are
taxed individually on their respective shares of Sunshine's earnings.
Partnership net income is allocated based on the partner's ownership interest.

SUNSHINE CELLULAR
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
NOTE 4 -- OTHER ASSETS
Other assets include deferred financing costs which are being amortized
over 8 years, the period of the related debt agreement. Amortization of $41,000,
$54,000 and $31,000 has been included in interest expense in the accompanying
December 31, 1993, September 30, 1993 and September 30, 1994 statements of
operations.
NOTE 5 -- LONG-TERM DEBT
On August 28, 1991, Sunshine secured financing for its system construction,
equipment and working capital needs from NTFC Capital Corporation in the
aggregate amount of $10,926,000. During 1993, this financing was amended to
increase the borrowing availability to $12,426,000. This debt is collateralized
by all of the assets of Sunshine and the personal guarantees of two of the
partners for $1,750,000 of the total borrowings.
This debt consists of three separate borrowing agreements as follows:
EQUIPMENT LOAN -- This loan is to be used exclusively for the purchase
of equipment and services. In 1993, the maximum borrowing capacity of the
equipment loan increased from $3,642,000 to $4,177,000. Monthly payments
consist of interest only until the commencement of principal payments
discussed below. Interest is payable at the 90 day commercial paper rate
(5.20% at September 30, 1994) plus 4.25%. As of December 31, 1993 and
September 30, 1994, the balance due on the equipment portion of the loan
was $3,633,000 and $3,779,000, respectively.
CONSTRUCTION LOAN -- This loan is to be used exclusively for
construction of Sunshine's cellular telephone systems. In 1993, the maximum
borrowing capacity of the construction loan increased from $3,642,000 to
$4,607,000. Monthly payments consist of interest only until the
commencement of principal payments discussed below. Interest is payable at
the 90 day commercial paper rate plus 4.25%. As of December 31, 1993 and
September 30, 1994, the balance due on the construction portion of the loan
was $3,642,000 and $4,248,000, respectively.
WORKING CAPITAL LOAN -- This loan is to be used for normal operating
expenses of Sunshine. The maximum borrowing capacity of the working capital
loan is $3,642,000. Monthly payments consist of interest only until the
commencement of principal payments discussed below. Interest is payable at
the 90 day commercial paper rate plus 4.25%. As of December 31, 1993 and
September 30, 1994, the balance due on the working capital loan was
$3,600,000 and $3,418,000, respectively.
Principal was originally scheduled to be repaid beginning September 1, 1994 on
the sum borrowed under the three loans as follows:
<TABLE>
<S> <C>
For the first through the twenty-fourth payment 1.250% of the principal balance
For the twenty-fifth through the thirty-sixth 1.667% of the principal balance
For the thirty-seventh through the fifty-ninth 2.083% of the principal balance
For the sixtieth payment the remaining balance due
</TABLE>

Sunshine and NTFC Capital Corporation entered into an agreement to defer
until March 1, 1995 all principal repayments originally scheduled to be paid
from September 1, 1994 through February 1, 1995.
As of September 30, 1994, scheduled maturities of long-term debt,
considering the deferral of principal repayments described above, are as
follows:

SUNSHINE CELLULAR
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- CONTINUED
NOTE 5 -- LONG-TERM DEBT -- Continued
Sunshine is required to repay all outstanding debt with the proceeds from
the proposed sale of its assets to Vanguard, which sale is scheduled to be
consummated in the first quarter of 1995 (See Note 10). In addition, Sunshine is
also required to pay a prepayment premium of 1% of the outstanding long-term
debt balance, or approximately $115,000 as of September 30, 1994, in the event
of early retirement of the debt. Should the sale to Vanguard not occur, Sunshine
intends to renegotiate its existing long-term debt facility or to seek
additional financing.
NOTE 6 -- SETTLEMENT OF LITIGATION
In June 1993, Sunshine and Vanguard settled certain outstanding litigation.
Under the terms of this settlement, Vanguard paid Sunshine $550,000 of which
$275,000 is to be applied toward the purchase price to be paid by Vanguard in
the proposed asset sale discussed in Note 10. An additional $275,000 was
recognized as a reduction of general and administrative expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 1993, and the year ended December 31, 1993.
Additionally, both parties dismissed all claims filed in the dispute.
NOTE 7 -- LEASES
Sunshine leases office facilities and cell sites under noncancellable
leases expiring through 2003. Rent expense for the year ended December 31, 1993
and the nine months ended September 30, 1993 and 1994 was $96,000, $74,000, and
$92,000, respectively. As of September 30, 1994, the estimated future minimum
lease payments required under these lease agreements are as follows:

NOTE 8 -- MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT
Sunshine currently has a management agreement with Minerich Cellular
Management Group, Inc. (MCMG) to assist in building, operating and managing the
cellular system. Monthly management fees of $16,000 are charged to operations.
In connection with the proposed sale of Sunshine's assets to Vanguard (See
Note 10), the management agreement with MCMG will be terminated. Under the terms
of the agreement, Sunshine will be required to pay a termination fee of
approximately $1,170,000 to MCMG upon cancellation of the agreement.
NOTE 9 -- Loans from Partners
In 1993, Sunshine received advances from its partners of $350,000. These
loans, which were made for working capital needs, are subordinated to the
borrowings from NTFC Capital Corporation and have no defined repayment terms or
interest provisions. The Partners do not intend to demand repayment within the
twelve months ended September 30, 1995.
NOTE 10 -- SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On September 26, 1994, Sunshine and its partners entered into an agreement
to sell substantially all of the assets of Sunshine to Vanguard. The purchase
price of the assets is $50.4 million consisting of $15 million in cash with the
remainder payable, at Vanguard's option, in cash, shares of Vanguard's Class A
Common Stock or any combination thereof. Under the terms of its long-term debt
facility, Sunshine is required to repay all outstanding debt from the proceeds
of this proposed sale. The proceeds from this disposition are expected to be
used by Sunshine to liquidate its liabilities with the remaining proceeds to be
distributed to the partners. The closing of the transaction is subject to
customary conditions and regulatory approvals.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
TO SUNSHINE CELLULAR:
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Sunshine Cellular (a
Maryland general partnership) as of December 31, 1993 and September 30, 1994,
and the related statements of operations and partners' capital and cash flows
for the year ended December 31, 1993 and the nine month periods ended September
30, 1993 and 1994. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
partnership's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Sunshine Cellular as of
December 31, 1993 and September 30, 1994, and the results of its operations and
its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 1993 and the nine month periods
ended September 30, 1993 and 1994 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the
Partnership will continue as a going concern. As further discussed in Note 2,
the partnership has suffered net losses since inception and may be unable to
generate sufficient income from operations to meet its debt repayment
requirements which are scheduled to commence on March 1, 1995. Management
expects these borrowings to be repaid with the proceeds from the planned sale of
the partnership assets (see Note 10). If this sale is not consummated there is
substantial doubt about the partnership's ability to continue as a going
concern. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

VANGUARD CELLULAR SYSTEMS, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
For purposes of determining the pro forma effects on the consolidated
statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 1993 and the nine months
ended September 30, 1994, the pro forma adjustments and eliminations have been
made as if the Crowley Transaction and the Sunshine Transaction had occurred on
January 1, 1993. For the purposes of determining the pro forma effects on the
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 1994, the pro forma
adjustments and eliminations have been made as if the Crowley Transaction and
the Sunshine Transaction had occurred on September 30, 1994. The following pro
forma adjustments have been made:
(1) These amounts reflect the combined historical data of Crowley, Inc.
and Sunshine as of or for the periods indicated, reclassified to
conform with the presentation of the Registrant's financial
statements.
(2) This adjustment reflects additional amortization of deferred cellular
license acquisition costs and the acquired customer base arising from
the acquisitions of Crowley, Inc. and Sunshine. The deferred cellular
license acquisition costs are being amortized over 40 years in
accordance with the Registrant's policy. The cost of the acquired
customer base is being amortized over the expected service period for
these customers which is estimated to be approximately four years.
(3) This adjustment reflects interest expense attributable to the $55.4
million of borrowings that would have been necessary to consummate the
acquisitions on January 1, 1993. The adjustment assumes the borrowings
would be funded from the Facility B Loan of the Registrant's 1993 Loan
Agreement and would bear interest at the Eurodollar Rate plus 2.5%.
For the year ended December 31, 1993 and for the nine months ended
September 30, 1994, the average Eurodollar rate was 3.32% and 4.34%,
respectively. This additional interest expense is offset by a
reduction in the commitment fee equal to .5% of the borrowings. If the
assumed rate varied by 1/8% in each period, consolidated interest
expense on all outstanding borrowings of the Registrant in each period
for the year ended December 31, 1993 and for the nine months ended
September 30, 1994, would have varied by approximately $340,000 and
$310,000, respectively.
(4) This adjustment eliminates interest expense incurred by Crowley, Inc.
and Sunshine during the year ended December 31, 1993 and the nine
months ended September 30, 1994 of $1.4 million and $1.2 million,
respectively. This interest expense relates to long-term debt of
Crowley, Inc. that will be retired prior to the Crowley Transaction
and long-term debt of Sunshine that will not be assumed by the
Registrant.
(5) The pro forma net loss per share is computed based on the weighted
average shares outstanding adjusted for the additional shares issued
to fund part of the Crowley Transaction.
(6) Reflects 3 for 2 stock split effected in the form of a 50% stock
dividend paid on August 24, 1994.
(7) This adjustment reflects the required settlement of "due from
affiliate" of Crowley Inc. prior to the consummation of the Crowley
Transaction.
(8) These adjustments reflect the consummation of the Crowley Transaction
and the Sunshine Transaction, the allocation of the purchase prices,
the elimination of certain liabilities not assumed from Sunshine and
the consolidation of Crowley Inc. and Sunshine as if the acquisitions
had occurred on September 30, 1994.
(9) This adjustment reflects additional borrowings of $56.4 million under
the Registrant's 1993 Loan Agreement incurred primarily to fund these
transactions. Additionally, this adjustment also reflects (i) the
retirement of $8.6 million of Crowley, Inc. long-term debt (including
current portion) which will occur prior to the consummation of the
Crowley Transaction and (ii) the elimination of $11.8 million of
Sunshine long-term debt (including current portion) that will not be
assumed in the Sunshine Transaction.
(10) This adjustment reflects the issuance of the Registrant's Class A
Common Stock to fund part of the Crowley Transaction.
(11) This adjustment reflects the adjustment for Minority interest in
Losses (Income) due to the acquisition of the remaining minority
interest of the partnership that holds the Binghamton MSA FCC license.
