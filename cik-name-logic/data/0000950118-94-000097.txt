ITEM 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On April 1, 1994, the registrant, United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.
(the "Trust") signed 25 separate contracts to acquire a portfolio of 25
apartment communities, located primarily in the Southeast, in separate but
related transactions from certain affiliates of Clover Financial Corporation, a
New Jersey corporation for $162,997,000, including estimated closing costs (the
"Portfolio Acquisition"). The proposed acquisition will be financed through
several sources of cash which include (i) the net proceeds from a public
offering of 7,000,000 shares of Common Stock, estimated to be $98,700,000, (ii)
the assumption of two mortgage loans encumbering two properties in the Portfolio
Acquisition totaling $11,700,000, and (iii) senior unsecured debt comprised of a
combination of bank line borrowings and term debt. The 25 apartment communities
consist of 5,170 total units located on a total of 365 acres, built at various
times between 1964 and 1987.

ITEM 5. Other Events

The Trust anticipates financing a portion of its 1994 property
acquisitions, including the Portfolio Acquisition, through the issuance of $75
million to $100 million of 7 to 10 year senior unsecured debt during the third
quarter of 1994. To mitigate the risks of rising interest rates, on May 18,
1994, the Trust entered into an interest rate hedge agreement with Goldman,
Sachs & Co., a New York limited partnership, which agreement has the effect of
limiting the Trust's exposure to an increase in the 10-year Treasury Rate to a
maximum of 7.197% for $75,000,000 of its debt to be issued on or before
September 15, 1994.

bility of the management of Holly Tree Park Apartments, Knolls at Newgate and

mately 93% during 1993.

Park I and II and Hunting Ridge Apartment Communities, is based solely on the
report of the other auditors.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing

NOTES TO SUMMARY OF REVENUES
AND CERTAIN RENTAL EXPENSES

The summaries of revenues and certain rental expenses reflect the
operations of the Portfolio Acquisition (the "property") for the year ended
December 31, 1993 based upon the audited statement of rental operations of
the properties appearing elsewhere herein and for the three month period
ended March 31, 1994 based upon the unaudited statement of rental operations
of the property.

The summaries have been prepared on the accrual method of accounting.
Rental expenses include repair and maintenance expenses, utilities, real
estate taxes, insurance and certain other expenses. In accordance with the
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, mortgage interest
expenses, depreciation, and general and administrative costs have been
excluded from operating expenses, as they are dependent upon a particular
owner, purchase price or financial arrangement.

In assessing the properties, management considered the existing and
potential tenant base, expected job growth in the area, occupancy rates, the
competitive nature of the market and comparative rental rates. Furthermore,
current and anticipated maintenance and repair costs, real estate taxes and
anticipated capital improvements were assessed.

Exhibit 99

RATE HEDGE AGREEMENT

This Agreement is made the 18th of May, 1994, between United Dominion
Realty Trust, a Virginia corporation (the "Customer"), and Goldman, Sachs &
Co., a New York limited partnership ("Goldman Sachs").

WHEREAS, the Customer intends to issue, within the term of this
Agreement, its debt Securities ("Debt"), with a maturity of approximately
1O years, and wishes to enter into a notional principal contract in the
amount of $75MM to hedge itself against the risk that the general level of
interest rates for securities with similar maturities might rise from their
current level during the term of this Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Customer intends this Agreement to qualify as a hedging
transaction within the meaning of Section 1256(e)(2) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 as amended:

NOW, THEREFORE, THIS AGREEMENT WITNESSETH:

1. Definitions. For the purposes of this Agreement, the following terms
shall have the meanings indicated:

(a) "Adjustment Price": the number determined in accordance with the
formula set forth in paragraph 3 of Schedule A hereto.

(b) "Agreement Date": the date set forth in the first paragraph
hereof.

(c) "Alternate Takedown Price": the price (stated in percent)
determined in accordance with Section 2(c) hereof.

(d) "Base Treasury Price": the price, expressed in percent, set
forth in paragraph 1 of Schedule A hereto.

(e) "Base Treasury Securities": the securities set forth in
paragraph 2 of Schedule A hereto.

(f) "Business Day": each Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and
Friday which is not a day on which Goldman Sachs, the Customer, or the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York are closed or banking institutions in the
State of New York are authorized or obligated by law or executive order to
close.

(g) "Determination Date": the date on which the Takedown Price shall
be accepted, or deemed to be accepted, by the Customer.

(h) "Price Differential": the amount obtained by multiplying (i) the
difference (stated in percent) between the Base Treasury Price and the
Takedown Price, times (ii) the Base Treasury Securities.

(i) "Readjustment Factor": the number determined in accordance with
the formula set forth in paragraph 3(b) of Schedule A hereto.

(j) "Takedown Price": the price (stated in percent) determined in
accordance with Sections 2 and 3 hereof and Schedule A hereto.

(k) "Termination Date": the date set forth in paragraph 4 of
Schedule A hereto.

2. Selection of a Takedown Price.

(a) On any Business Day, between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m.
(New York City time), the Customer may request Goldman Sachs to quote a
Takedown Price. Within one hour of receipt by Goldman Sachs of such a
request, Goldman Sachs shall quote an unadjusted Takedown Price to the
Customer; provided, however, that Goldman Sachs may, but shall not be
obligated to, quote a Takedown Price (i) at any time within one hour before
an expected announcement of money supply data or other economic statistics
by the government of the United States of America or any agency thereof,
(ii) if an event (including an announcement of money supply data or other
economic statistics) shall have occurred that would, in the judgment of
Goldman Sachs, materially affect the quotation of a Takedown Price, or
(iii) if in the opinion of Goldman Sachs there does not at such time exist
an active dealer market for the Base Treasury Securities. Upon receipt by
the Customer of such quotation subject to paragraph (c) of this Section,
the Customer shall immediately accept or reject such unadjusted Takedown
Price. If the Customer shall not have accepted such unadjusted Takedown
Price, the Customer shall be deemed to have rejected such unadjusted
Takedown Price.

(b) If the Customer shall not have accepted a quoted Takedown Price,
and Goldman Sachs and the Customer shall not be deemed to have accepted an
Alternate Takedown Price, prior to 11:30 a.m. (New York City time) on the
Termination Date, Goldman Sachs shall quote an unadjusted Takedown Price to
the Customer at or prior to 4:00 p.m. (New York City time), and except as
provided in paragraph (c) of this Section the Customer shall be deemed to
have accepted such Takedown Price.

(c) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section, if,
following the quotation by Goldman Sachs to the Customer of an unadjusted
Takedown Price pursuant to either such paragraph, the Customer immediately
rejects such unadjusted Takedown Price and notifies Goldman Sachs that the
Customer has received from another leading U.S. Government securities
dealer a firm bona fide offer to sell the Base Treasury Securities to the
Customer at a price (stated in percent) (an "Alternate Takedown Price"),
lower than the price quoted by Goldman Sachs, then Goldman Sachs shall
immediately quote a new unadjusted Takedown Price (which may be the same as
its previously quoted unadjusted Takedown Price) to the Customer, and the
Customer shall immediately accept or reject such new unadjusted Takedown
Price. If the Customer does not immediately accept such new unadjusted
Takedown Price, the Customer and Goldman Sachs shall be deemed to have
accepted the Alternate Takedown Price, provided, that in addition the
Customer shall be deemed to have agreed to sell to Goldman Sachs the Base
Treasury Securities at the Alternate Takedown Price. The settlement date
for such sale to Goldman Sachs shall be the next settlement date that, in
accordance with customary trade practices, would apply if the Base Treasury
Securities had been bought back on the Determination Date. The method of
settlement shall be the method that, in accordance with customary trade
practices, is employed with respect to the Base Treasury Securities.

3. Settlement Price. Upon acceptance pursuant to Section 2 hereof of the
unadjusted Takedown Price by the Customer, or of the Alternate Takedown
Price by Goldman Sachs, the following calculations and payments shall be
made:

(a) The Takedown Price or the Alternate Takedown Price (as the case may
be) established pursuant to Section 2 above shall be adjusted (up or down)
by adding thereto the Adjustment Price (positive or negative) determined in
accordance with paragraph 3(a) of Schedule A hereto, such Adjustment Price
to be modified by the Readjustment Factor determined pursuant to paragraph
3(b) of Schedule A if the Takedown Price (or Alternate Takedown Price) is
determined on a date prior to the Termination Date. The Takedown Price or
Alternate Takedown Price, as adjusted, shall be the "Takedown Price" for
purposes of determining the settlement price below.

(b) If the Takedown Price exceeds the Base Treasury Price, the Customer
shall owe Goldman Sachs the amount of the Price Differential. If the
Takedown Price is less than the Base Treasury Price, Goldman Sachs shall
owe the amount of the Price Differential to the Customer.

(c) The payment of the Price Differential shall be made in immediately
available federal funds by wire transfer on the Business Day immediately
following the Determination Date to the appropriate account of the
receiving party specified in paragraph 5 or 6 of Schedule A hereto.

(d) If the party required to pay the Price Differential hereunder fails to
do so in a timely manner, interest on such amount shall accrue from and
including the Determination Date through the date that such amount plus
interest is paid in full at an annual rate equal to 2% above the prime
brokers' loan rate. The prime brokers' loan rate will be determined by
Goldman Sachs for this purpose, in Goldman Sachs' sole discretion, in
accordance with prevailing money market conditions. It is understood that
in making such determination, Goldman Sachs will consider, among other
things, the rates quoted for brokers' loans by one or more New York banks
which are members of the New York Clearing House Association. Interest
shall be computed daily, using a 360 day base year.

4. Transfer. This Agreement may not be assigned or otherwise transferred
by either party hereto without the prior written consent of the other
party.

5. Representations and Warranties of the Customer. The Customer
represents and warrants to Goldman Sachs as follows:

good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it has been
incorporated.
