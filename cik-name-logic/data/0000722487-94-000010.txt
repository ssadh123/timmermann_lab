charismatic entrepreneur and visionary leader. He lived his life with great
courage and determination, and embodied the belief that "opportunities are
everywhere' for those with conviction and a strong work ethic. His legacy is
the entrepreneurial spirit that continues to guide the company he founded.
We will miss him and share this sadness with his family."
