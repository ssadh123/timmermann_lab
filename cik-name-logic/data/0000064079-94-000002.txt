MCI COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION

Senior Floating Rate Note due March 16, 1999

MCI COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation
the "Company"), for value received, hereby promises to pay to
CEDE & Co., c/o The Depository Trust Company, 55 Water Street,
New York, New York 10041, or registered assigns, the principal
sum of _________________________ Dollars ($___,___,___) on March
16, 1999 (the "Maturity Date"), and to pay interest thereon from
March 16, 1994 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date (as
defined below) to which interest has been paid or duly provided
for, quarterly in arrears on the third Wednesday of March, June,
September and December of each year (each, an "Interest Payment
Date"), commencing on the third Wednesday of June, 1994, and on
the Maturity Date, at the rate of interest described below, until
the principal hereof is paid or duly provided for.

The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly
provided for, on any Interest Payment Date and on the Maturity
Date will, as provided in the Senior Indenture referred to on the
reverse hereof, be paid to the Holder in whose name this Note (or
one or more predecessor Notes) is registered at the close of
business on the Regular Record Date (as defined below) for such

<PAGE> Exhibit 4(c)
------------
( 2 of 10)

interest, which shall be fifteen calendar days (whether or not a
Business Day, as defined below) next preceding such Interest
Payment Date or the Maturity Date, as the case may be (each, a
"Regular Record Date"). 

Interest payable on this Note on any Interest Payment
Date and on the Maturity Date, as the case may be, will include
the amount of interest accrued during the applicable Interest
Period (as defined below). Accrued interest in respect hereof
will be calculated by multiplying the principal amount hereof by
an accrued interest factor. Such accrued interest factor is
computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day in
the applicable Interest Period. The interest factor for each day
will be computed by dividing the interest rate applicable to such
day by 360.

An "Interest Period" is each period from and including
the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date in respect of
which interest has been paid or duly provided for (or from and
including March 16, 1994, if no interest has been paid on this
Note, to but excluding the applicable Interest Payment Date or
the Maturity Date, as the case may be. If any Interest Payment
Date other than the Maturity Date would otherwise be a day that
is not a Business Day, such Interest Payment Date will be
postponed to the succeeding Business Day, unless such succeeding
Business Day is in the succeeding calendar month, in which case
such Interest Payment Date will be the preceding Business Day. 
If the Maturity Date falls on a day that is not a Business Day,
principal and interest payable on the Maturity Date will be paid
on the succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as
if it were paid on the date such payment was due, and no interest
shall accrue on the amount so payable for the period from and
after the Maturity Date, as the case may be. A "Business Day"
means any day, (i) other than a Saturday or Sunday, on which
banks in The City of New York are not required or authorized by
law or executive order to close and (ii) which is also a London
Banking Day (as defined below). A "London Banking Day" is any
day on which dealings in United States dollars are transacted in
the London interbank market.

The interest rate hereon will be payable at a floating
rate that will be subject to quarterly adjustment effective on
the third Wednesday of March, June, September and December (each,
a "Reset Date"); provided, however, that if a Reset Date would
otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, such Reset Date
will be postponed to the succeeding Business Day, unless such

<PAGE> Exhibit 4(c)
------------
( 3 of 10)

succeeding Business Day is in the succeeding calendar month, in
which case such Reset Date will be the preceding Business Day. 
The "Determination Date" pertaining to a Reset Date will be the
second London Banking Day preceding such Reset Date.

The interest rate hereon in respect of an Interest
Period will be a per annum rate equal to LIBOR (determined by the
Calculation Agent (as defined below) as of the applicable
Determination Date as described below), plus .19%; provided,
however, that the interest rate hereon in respect of an Interest
Period may not be higher than the maximum rate permitted by New
York law, as the same may be modified by United States law of
general application.

"LIBOR" means, with respect to any Reset Date, the rate
(expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in U.S.
dollars for a three-month period that appears on Telerate Page
3750 (as defined below) as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on the
applicable Determination Date for such Reset Date. If such rate
does not appear on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m., London
time, on the applicable Determination Date, the Calculation Agent
will request the principal London office of each of four major
reference banks in the London interbank market selected by the
Calculation Agent to provide such bank's offered quotation
(expressed as a percentage per annum) to prime banks in the
London interbank market for deposits in U.S. dollars for a three
month period as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination
Date and in a Representative Amount (as defined below). If at
least two such offered quotations are so provided, LIBOR will be
the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such
quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request
each of three major banks in New York City selected by the
Calculation Agent to provide such bank's rate (expressed as a
percentage per annum) for loans in U.S. dollars to leading
European banks for a three-month period as of approximately 11:00
a.m., New York City time, on the applicable Determination Date
and in a Representative Amount. If at least two such rates are
so provided, LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If
fewer than two such rates are so provided, then LIBOR will be
LIBOR in effect on the preceding Reset Date.

"Representative Amount" means a principal amount of not
less than U.S. $1,000,000 that is representatives for a single
transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

<PAGE> Exhibit 4(c)
------------
( 4 of 10)

"Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated as
"Page 3750" on the Dow Jones Telerate Service (or such other page
as may replace Page 3750 on that service or such other service as
may be nominated by the British Bankers' Association as the
information vendor for the purpose of displaying British Bankers'
Association Interest Settlement Rates for U.S. dollar deposits).

All percentages resulting from any calculation in
respect of this Note will be rounded to the nearest one hundred -
thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a
percentage point rounded upwards (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545)
would be rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655)), and all dollar
amounts used in or resulting from such calculation in respect of
this Note will be rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent
rounded upwards).

The Company hereby appoints Citibank, N.A. as
"Calculation Agent", and unless the Company shall have otherwise
provided 30 days' prior written notice to the Holders of the
Notes, Citibank, N.A. will be the Calculation Agent. Upon the
request of any Holder of a Note, the Calculation Agent will
disclose the interest rate then in effect and, if determined, the
interest rate that will become effective as a result of a
determination made for the succeeding Reset Date.

The principal of this Note payable on the Maturity Date
will be paid against presentation of this Note at the office or
agency of the Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough
of Manhattan, The City of New York, in such coin or currency of
the United States of America as a the time of payment is legal
tender for the payment of public and private debts.

All payments of principal, premium, if any, and
interest in respect of this Note will be made by the Company in
immediately available funds unless and until one or more Notes
are issued in certificated form in exchange herefor, in which
event such payments will be made by the Company in next-day
funds.

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of
this Note set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provi-
sions shall for all purposes have the same effect as if set forth
at this place.
