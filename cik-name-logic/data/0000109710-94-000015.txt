ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On May 13, 1994, Registrant acquired all of the outstanding capital stock
("Stock") of Blaw-Knox Construction Equipment Corporation ("BK"), a
leading producer of asphalt paving equipment located in Mattoon, Illinois. 
These shares were purchased from White Consolidated Industries, Inc.
("WCI"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AB Electrolux. In addition, on May
13, 1994, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant acquired the assets
related to WCI's asphalt paving business in the United Kingdom ("Assets"). 
The Assets were acquired from White Consolidated International Holdings
Ltd. and Blaw-Knox Construction Equipment Co., Limited.

Included among the assets acquired by Registrant (either directly through
the purchase of the Assets or indirectly through the purchase of the
Stock) are (1) plants in Rochester, England and Mattoon, Illinois at which
asphalt paving equipment is manufactured, (2) machinery, equipment, tools,
dies and fixtures used in the manufacture of asphalt paving equipment, (3)
finished goods, raw materials, work-in-process and other inventory,(4)
certain trademarks, patents and other intellectual property, and (5)
receivables and contract rights. It is Registrant's current intention to
continue to use these assets in the manufacture of asphalt paving
equipment.

The aggregate purchase price for the Stock and Assets was approximately
$134 million. The purchase price is subject to adjustment pursuant to the
terms of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale dated April 20, 1994 between
WCI and Registrant. In addition, Registrant paid $10 million to WCI for a
covenant not to compete.

The funds used to consummate the acquisition of the Shares and Assets and
to pay for the covenant not to compete came from Registrant's available
cash, with the exception of $40 million which was borrowed by Registrant
pursuant to Registrant's $100 Million Master Credit Agreement dated April
6, 1994. Of the amount borrowed pursuant to the Master Credit Agreement,
$25 million was borrowed from PNC Bank and $15 million from Comerica Bank. 
These borrowings were repaid after two weeks upon the maturity of certain
of Registrant's short term investments which had not yet matured at the
time of the closing of the acquisition.

A copy of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale dated as of April 20, 1994
between WCI and Registrant is attached hereto as Exhibit (2).

ARTICLE II - CONSIDERATION

2.1 Sale Price. The aggregate consideration for the SHARES and
the BKL ACQUIRED ASSETS shall be the payment of the FINAL CASH PRICE (as
hereinafter defined) and the assumption of the ASSUMED LIABILITIES of BKL. 
The "FINAL CASH PRICE" shall be determined by adding the NET EQUITY
ADJUSTMENT, if the NET EQUITY ADJUSTMENT is a positive number, to ONE
HUNDRED THIRTY-FOUR MILLION U.S. Dollars (US$134,000,000), or subtracting
the NET EQUITY ADJUSTMENT, if the NET EQUITY ADJUSTMENT is a negative 

-9-<PAGE>
<PAGE>
number, from ONE HUNDRED THIRTY-FOUR MILLION U.S. Dollars (US$134,000,000). 
The NET EQUITY ADJUSTMENT as of the CLOSING shall be determined in accor-
dance with Section 2.4. The FINAL CASH PRICE shall be paid at the times
and in the manner provided in Sections 2.2 and 2.5.

2.2 Payments of the Preliminary Cash Price. A payment of ONE
HUNDRED THIRTY-FOUR MILLION U.S. Dollars (US$134,000,000) (the
"PRELIMINARY CASH PRICE") on account of the FINAL CASH PRICE shall be paid
at the CLOSING by BUYER to WCI by a certified or official bank check drawn
on a bank satisfactory to WCI, or at WCI's election, by the transfer of
federal funds. 

The PRELIMINARY CASH PRICE shall be allocated to the SHARES and
the BKL ACQUIRED ASSETS based on their respective fair market values to be
mutually agreed upon by the parties acting reasonably and in good faith. 
Appropriate adjustments to be mutually agreed upon by the parties acting
reasonably and in good faith will be made to the foregoing allocations to
take into account the NET EQUITY ADJUSTMENT.

2.3 Audit of Book Value of ACQUIRED ASSETS and ASSUMED
LIABILITIES and Determination of NET EQUITY.

2.3.1 Immediately after the CLOSING, WCI shall cause Ernst &
Young ("E&Y"), certified public accountants for WCI, to conduct an audit
of the BUSINESS in respect of the ACQUIRED ASSETS (including good will)
and the ASSUMED LIABILITIES to determine the book value as of the CLOSING
of the ACQUIRED ASSETS less the book value of the ASSUMED LIABILITIES (the
"NET EQUITY") of the BUSINESS (with a representative of BUYER'S certified
public accountant Price Waterhouse ("PW") to be present to observe such
audit), on the basis of which E&Y shall prepare and deliver, within sixty
(60) days following the CLOSING, to both WCI and BUYER, an audited
schedule setting forth the book value of such ACQUIRED ASSETS and ASSUMED
LIABILITIES and NET EQUITY as of the CLOSING. Except as otherwise
specifically provided for in this Agreement, the book value of the
ACQUIRED ASSETS and the ASSUMED LIABILITIES of the BUSINESS shall be
determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth in the specific
Accounting Methods and Procedures described in Part 2.3.1 of the SCHEDULE
(the "ACCOUNTING METHODS AND PROCEDURES"). Such audited schedule shall be
accompanied by a certificate of E&Y to the effect set forth in the
preceding sentence, and to the further effect that such audited schedule
has been prepared in accordance with the ACCOUNTING METHODS AND PROCEDURES
and that such ACCOUNTING METHODS AND PROCEDURES comply with the
immediately following sentence. The ACCOUNTING METHODS AND PROCEDURES are
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, with the
following possible exceptions:

(a) the allowance for doubtful accounts will be determined
based on the formula set forth in the ACCOUNTING METHODS AND
PROCEDURES;

(b) FIFO inventory valuations will include certain capitalized
product development costs as set forth in the ACCOUNTING METHODS AND
PROCEDURES;

(c) inventory reserves, including the LIFO reserve, will be
determined based upon procedures set forth in the ACCOUNTING METHODS
AND PROCEDURES;

-10-<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(d) goodwill will be US$104,290,000;

(e) the NET EQUITY will not include any balance sheet accruals
related to FAS No. 112 to the extent such accruals have not been
recognized previously pursuant to BK's consistently applied year-end
accounting methods; and 

(f) the NET EQUITY will not include any balance sheet deferred
taxes relating to the ACQUIRED ASSETS or the ASSUMED LIABILITIES.

2.3.2 In the event BUYER is in disagreement with the NET EQUITY
determined pursuant to Section 2.3.1, each specific item of disagreement
shall be set forth in writing and delivered to WCI within forty-five (45)
days from the receipt of the audited schedule of the book values of the
ACQUIRED ASSETS, the ASSUMED LIABILITIES and the NET EQUITY. If BUYER and
WCI shall not, within the next thirty (30) days, resolve each such item of
disagreement, both E&Y and BUYER's certified public accountant shall
immediately refer the unresolved items of disagreement to a firm of
independent public accountants of recognized standing which E&Y and
BUYER's certified public accountant mutually select for resolution. 
Except as otherwise specifically provided for in this Agreement,
resolution of the items in dispute shall be made in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles except to the extent otherwise
expressly set forth in the specific ACCOUNTING METHODS AND PROCEDURES, and
BUYER and WCI shall use their reasonable best efforts to assure that such
resolution is made within sixty (60) days subsequent to such referral. 
Such resolution shall be conclusive and binding on the parties hereto.

2.3.3 The fees and disbursements of BUYER's certified public
accountant shall be paid by BUYER, those of E&Y shall be paid by WCI and
those of any firm to whom disagreements may be referred (in respect of any
given disagreement) shall be paid by the party against whom such
disagreement is resolved. BUYER and WCI shall cooperate fully, each at
its own expense, in the conduct of the audit by E&Y and review by BUYER's
certified public accountant and the firm of independent public accountants
selected to resolve disputes, if any, and shall make available to such
accountants all working papers, data and such other information as may be
necessary or desirable in that connection.

2.4 NET EQUITY ADJUSTMENT. The NET EQUITY ADJUSTMENT shall be
the NET EQUITY as of CLOSING determined in accordance with Section 2.3
minus ONE HUNDRED FORTY-TWO MILLION TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S. Dollars
(US$142,200,000) (the "OPENING NET EQUITY"), which OPENING NET EQUITY does
not include any liabilities that constitute EXCLUDED LIABILITIES (as
defined in Section 3.2), it being understood that if the OPENING NET
EQUITY does include a liability that constitutes an EXCLUDED LIABILITY,
then the OPENING NET EQUITY shall be adjusted upward to delete therefrom
the EXCLUDED LIABILITIES.

2.5 Settlement and Payment of the FINAL CASH PRICE. Within ten
(10) days after the final determination of the NET EQUITY as of the
CLOSING (or such other date as shall be mutually agreed to in writing by
the parties) (the "SETTLEMENT DATE"), the NET EQUITY ADJUSTMENT as defined
in Section 2.4 shall be made to the PRELIMINARY CASH PRICE in satisfaction
or reconciliation of the FINAL CASH PRICE. In the event that the NET
EQUITY ADJUSTMENT is a positive number, BUYER shall pay to WCI an amount
equal to the NET EQUITY ADJUSTMENT on the SETTLEMENT DATE by means of a
bank or 

-11-<PAGE>
<PAGE>
cashier's check or wire transfer of federal funds. To the extent that the
NET EQUITY ADJUSTMENT is a negative number, WCI shall pay to BUYER an
amount equal to the NET EQUITY ADJUSTMENT on the SETTLEMENT DATE by means
of a bank or cashier's check or wire transfer of federal funds.

2.6 Effect of Certain Taxes. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, the ASSUMED LIABILITIES for purposes of this
Article II (including but not limited to the determination of the NET
EQUITY, the NET EQUITY ADJUSTMENT, and the FINAL CASH PRICE) shall not
include any liability for taxes, interest or penalties resulting from any
election filed by BK or BUYER under Section 338 of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), which liability, if any, shall
nevertheless be the sole obligation of BK.

ARTICLE III - ASSUMED LIABILITIES; INDEMNIFICATION

3.1 Assumed Liabilities.

Subject to Section 3.2 below, upon the CLOSING, and effective as
of the CLOSING, (a) BK shall be responsible for the ASSUMED LIABILITIES of

the extent set forth on Part 3.2(f) of the SCHEDULE, provided, however,
that the amount of each such TAX that exceeds the amount set forth on Part
3.2(f) of the SCHEDULE with respect to such TAX shall constitute EXCLUDED
LIABILITIES (as defined below) and shall not constitute ASSUMED
LIABILITIES.

3.1.2 Liabilities for post-retirement benefits under the BK
COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT.

3.2 Excluded Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, there shall not be included in the ASSUMED

or any of their affiliates, or otherwise.

Without duplication of any amount provided for under Section
3.3.5, if BK obtains a tax deduction for federal or state income taxes for
liabilities paid by WCI specified in Section 3.2, BUYER will reimburse WCI
for the amount of such tax benefit actually realized by BK in the year in
which the liability to which such tax benefit relates is paid by WCI. Any
such tax benefit, to the extent permitted by applicable law, shall be
treated as an adjustment of the purchase price.

shall indemnify and save BUYER, BK, and their affiliates harmless from and
against any and all expenses (including attorney's fees), damages (whether
compensatory or punitive), claims, liabilities or obligations whatsoever
resulting from (i) any EXCLUDED LIABILITY, (ii) any breach of any covenant
of WCI included herein, or (iii) any misrepresentations or breach of
warranty of WCI as of the date of this Agreement or as of the CLOSING with
respect to those representations and warranties of WCI contained in this

shall give prompt, but no more than thirty (30) days after institution,
notice to WCI of the institution of any action, suit, proceeding or demand
at any time instituted against or made upon BUYER in connection with which
BUYER could claim indemnification hereunder; provided further that the
failure of BUYER to provide such notice shall not affect the obligations
of WCI hereunder, unless such failure actually materially prejudices WCI's
right to contest such action, suit, proceeding or demand. BUYER shall, at
the same time of giving such notice, give WCI full authority to defend,
adjust, compromise or settle the action, suit, proceeding or demand of
which such notice shall have been given, in the name of BUYER or
otherwise, as WCI shall elect, provided that neither WCI nor any of its
affiliates shall, without the prior written consent of the BUYER, settle
or otherwise compromise any such action, suit, proceeding or demand in any
manner that, in the reasonable judgment of the BUYER, would adversely
affect BUYER; provided further, however, that WCI shall not be liable to
BUYER under clause (iii) of this Section 3.3.1 until the aforementioned

nature of any such action, suit, proceeding or demand. WCI shall, in good
faith, allow BUYER to make comments to WCI regarding the conduct of or
positions taken in any such action, suit, proceeding or demand. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the indemnification provision of
this Section 3.3.1 shall include, with respect to the EXCLUDED LIABILITIES
described in Section 3.2(b), any and all expenses (including attorneys
fees), damages, claims, liabilities and obligations whatsoever for or
resulting from any injury or disease to persons (including death) or
damage to property (including the loss of use thereof and consequential
damages therefrom) or for economic loss, irrespective of whether such
expenses, damages, claims, liabilities and obligations are caused, or
alleged to be caused, by a breach of warranty, whether express (other than
BK's obligation under the express written warranties described in Section
5.2.2 and the express extended or expanded warranties specifically
included in Part 5.2.2 of the SCHEDULE) or implied, or the negligence or
other tort or strict or other product liability or other tortious acts or
failures to act by BK, BKL, BUYER or any of their affiliates or otherwise
caused by or attributable to the PRODUCTS or any other products,
accessory, attachment, component, part or service.

3.3.2 Except as otherwise agreed in Section 3.3.3 below, BUYER
shall indemnify and save WCI and its affiliates harmless from and against
any and all expenses (including attorney's fees), damages (whether
compensatory or punitive), claims, liabilities or obligations whatsoever
(i) resulting from any misrepresentations or breach of warranty of BUYER
set forth herein, subject to Section 9.12.1, (ii) resulting from the
ASSUMED LIABILITIES, or (iii) arising out of breach of any covenant of
BUYER herein; provided, WCI shall give prompt, but no more than thirty
(30) days after institution, notice to BUYER of the institution of any
action, suit, proceeding or demand at any time instituted against or made
upon WCI in connection with which WCI could claim indemnification
hereunder, provided further that the failure of WCI to provide such notice
shall not affect the obligations of BUYER hereunder, unless such failure
actually materially prejudices BUYER's right to contest such action, suit,
proceeding or demand. WCI shall, at the same time of giving such notice,
give BUYER full authority to defend, adjust, compromise or settle the
action, suit, proceeding or demand of which such notice shall have been
given, in the name of WCI or otherwise, as BUYER shall elect, provided
that neither BUYER nor any of its affiliates shall, without the prior
written consent of WCI, settle or otherwise compromise any such action,
suit, proceeding or demand in any manner that, in the reasonable judgment
of WCI, would adversely affect WCI, provided further, however, that BUYER
shall not be liable to WCI under clause (i) of this Section 3.3.2 until
the aforementioned expenses, damages, claims, liabilities and obligations
under such clause (i) shall have exceeded in the aggregate Five Hundred
Thousand U.S. Dollars (US$500,000), and no claim for alleged
misrepresentation or breach of warranty under such clause (i) shall be
made after the third anniversary of the CLOSING DATE. BUYER shall keep
WCI fully and timely informed with respect to the commencement, status and
nature of any such action, suit, proceeding or demand. BUYER shall, in
good faith, allow WCI to make comments to BUYER regarding the conduct of

provision of this Section 

-16-<PAGE>
<PAGE>
3.3.2 shall include, with respect to Product Liability Matters to the
extent (and only to the extent) included within the ASSUMED LIABILITIES
pursuant to Section 3.1.1 above, any and all expenses (including
attorneys' fees), damages, claims, liabilities and obligations whatsoever
for or resulting from any injury or disease to persons (including death)
or damage to property (including the loss of use thereof and consequential
damages therefrom) or for economic loss, irrespective of whether such
expenses, damages, claims, liabilities and obligations are caused, or
alleged to be caused, by a breach of warranty, whether express or implied,
or the negligence or other tort or strict or other product liability or
other tortious acts or failures to act by WCI or any of its affiliates or
otherwise caused by or attributable to PRODUCTS or any other products,
accessory, attachment, component, part or service.

3.3.3 Each of WCI and BUYER shall share equally any liabilities or
obligations arising out of or related to (a) the failure to inform or
consult with employees, trade unions or similar organizations with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the U.K.
Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981
("TUPE") and (b) any "unfair dismissals" of employees as contemplated
under TUPE, in each case regardless of whether any claim relating to (a)
or (b) above ("Shared Claims") are asserted against WCI or BUYER or any of
their respective affiliates. WCI and BUYER shall cooperate with each
other in jointly defending any Shared Claims. If counsel is mutually
selected to represent both WCI and BUYER, then WCI and BUYER shall share
equally the fees and disbursements of such counsel; if counsel is selected
by WCI or BUYER to represent only WCI or BUYER, respectively, then the
fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be paid by the party
retaining such counsel.

3.3.4 In addition to WCI's other obligations set forth in this
Section 3.3, WCI shall indemnify and save BUYER, BK and their affiliates
harmless from and against any and all expenses (including attorney's
fees), damages (whether compensatory or otherwise), claims, liabilities or
obligations relating to or arising out of the Purchasers' (as defined in
the Blaw-Knox Trademark Agreement referred to below) use of the Term (as
defined in the Blaw-Knox Trademark Agreement) in the manner specified in

1994, by and among WCI, BK, Blaw-Knox Corporation, Scottdale Manufacturing
Corporation, Wheeling Machine & Foundry Company, Buffalo Technologies
Corporation, R.O.B. Realty Corporation, and Park Corporation. BUYER will
give WCI reasonably prompt notice of any claim asserted against such
Purchasers alleging facts or circumstances that would give rise to an
indemnity by WCI under this Section 3.3.4.

3.3.5 Any claims hereunder for indemnification by either party shall
be reduced to the extent of any tax benefits resulting from such
indemnified matter which are actually realized by the claiming party in
the year in which the indemnity payment is made.

compensation other than wages, salaries or sales commissions at rates then
in effect, nor have they made or been committed to make any payments
pursuant to any unusual compensatory arrangement.

(c) Employees. Part 4.1.8(c) of the SCHEDULE contains all:
(i) life insurance plans, group health and group welfare plans, retiree
life and retiree medical plans and other fringe benefit plans or
commitments (whether or not reduced to writing) which apply to personnel
of the BUSINESS (and which are not classified herein as PENSION PLANS or
OTHER EMPLOYEE PLANS) (collectively the "BENEFIT PLANS"), (ii) pension,
retirement, profit sharing, 401K and savings plans which apply in any way
to the personnel of the BUSINESS (collectively the "PENSION PLANS") and
(iii) employment, consulting, union, incentive compensation, deferred

(d) Employee Benefit Plans. Each BENEFIT PLAN and PENSION PLAN
that constitutes an employee benefit plan within the meaning of Section
3(3) of ERISA, maintained by BK or to which BK contributes or is a party
(each, a "PLAN" and collectively, the "PLANS") is in substantial
compliance with applicable law and has been administered and operated in
all material respects in accordance with its terms. Each PLAN which is
intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE"), has received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service and no
event has occurred and no condition exists which could reasonably be
expected to result in the revocation of any such determination. No event
which constitutes a "Reportable Event" (as defined in Section 4043(b) of
ERISA) for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived by the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") has occurred with respect to
any PLAN. No PLAN subject to Title IV of ERISA has been terminated or is
or has been the subject of termination proceedings pursuant to Title IV of
ERISA. Full payment has been made of all amounts which WCI or any of its
subsidiaries were required under the terms of any PLAN to have paid as
contributions to such PLAN on or prior to the date hereof (excluding any
amounts not yet due) and no PLAN which is subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B
of Title I of ERISA has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency"
(within the meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the CODE),
whether or not waived. Neither WCI nor any of its subsidiaries nor any
other "disqualified person" or "party in interest" (as defined in Section
4975(e)(2) of the CODE and Section 3(14) of ERISA, respectively) has
engaged in any transaction in connection with any PLAN that could
reasonably be expected to result in the imposition of a material penalty
pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA, damages pursuant to Section 409 of
ERISA or a tax pursuant to Section 4975(a) of the CODE. No material
liability, claim, action or litigation has been made, commenced or
threatened with respect to any PLAN (other than for benefits payable in
the ordinary course and for the payment of PBGC insurance premiums). No
PLAN is a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA). BK does not have any material unfunded liabilities for benefits
accrued pursuant to any PLAN, which PLAN is not intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the CODE. Neither BK nor any trade or business
(whether or not incorporated) which is required to be aggregated therewith
pursuant to Section 4001(b) of ERISA and/or Section 414(b), (c), (m) or
(o) of the CODE and the regulations promulgated thereunder has or could
incur or be subject to (i) any material liability under Title IV of ERISA
(other than for the payment of PBGC insurance premiums in the ordinary
course), (ii) a security interest pursuant to Section 412(f) of the CODE
or (iii) a lien pursuant to Section 412(n) of the CODE or Section 4068 or
302(f) of ERISA.

(e) U.K. Plan. The only active members of BKL's UNITED KINGDOM
PLAN (the "UK PLAN") are employees exclusively engaged in the BUSINESS and
BKL is the only participating employer. There is no obligation or ex
gratia or voluntary arrangement to provide any relevant benefits (as
defined in Section 612 Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 ("ICTA")) in
respect of any employee exclusively engaged in the United Kingdom in the
BUSINESS except under the UK PLAN, and no assurances or undertakings have
been given as to the continuance or introduction or improvement of the
provision of any such benefits. The UK PLAN has exempt approved status
under Chapter I of Part XIV of the ICTA and a contracting out certificate
is in force in respect of the UK PLAN relating to the employees of the
BUSINESS in the United Kingdom, and none of WCI, WCI-LTD or BK-LTD knows
of any circumstance which might cause such approval or such certificate to
be withdrawn or to cease to apply. The UK PLAN has at all times been
operated 
-23-<PAGE>
<PAGE>
in all material respects in accordance with its governing scheme documents
and the governing scheme documentation is in substantial compliance with
and has been administered in all material respects in accordance with all
applicable laws. All taxes and expenses relating to the UK PLAN have been
duly paid, and all contributions due to be made to the UK PLAN have been
duly paid. None of the UK PLAN's investments are employer-related
investments (as defined in Section 57A of the Social Security Pensions Act
1975). No material liability, claim, action or litigation has been made,
commenced or threatened with respect to the UK PLAN (other than for bene-
fits payable in the ordinary course). Death benefits payable under the UK
PLAN are insured with an insurance company authorized under the U.K.
Insurance Companies Act and all such contracts of insurance are
enforceable and all premiums thereunder have been paid. No augmentations
of benefits have been made under the UK PLAN. There have been disclosed
to BUYER material particulars of the UK PLAN, including copies of all
deeds and documents constituting the UK PLAN which are of current effect.

any conflict with its rights or the asserted rights of others regarding
the LICENSES or any other intellectual property constituting ACQUIRED
ASSETS or otherwise used in the BUSINESS. Except as set forth in

required to pay (nor has any third party asserted any claim for) any
royalty, license fee or similar type of compensation in connection with
the conduct of the BUSINESS as it is now or heretofore has been conducted. 
The conduct of the BUSINESS by BK and BKL in the ordinary course does not
infringe upon any intellectual property of any third parties.

requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976,

necessary in order for WCI and its affiliates to consummate the transac-
tions contemplated by this Agreement.

cause BK, WCI-LTD and BK-LTD to use their reasonable best efforts, in the
ordinary course of business, to preserve intact their respective business
organizations, keep available the services of their officers and employees
and maintain satisfactory relationships with licensors, suppliers,
distributors, clients and others having business relationships with them,
and BUYER shall cooperate with WCI in the performance of WCI's obligations
in this sentence (provided that BUYER shall not be obligated to incur any
obligation or make any commitment to any person or entity in connection
with such cooperation). Prior to the CLOSING, except as may be first
approved in writing by the BUYER, WCI shall cause BK, WCI-LTD and BK-LTD
to refrain from (a) increasing the level of compensation payable to any
officer, employee or agent, except for normal merit raises in accordance

the benefits thereunder.

5.1.2 During the period from the date of this Agreement to the

to the BUSINESS, and if it can be done without unduly disrupting WCI's or
its affiliates' businesses, WCI shall (i) make or cause to be made

BUYER does not take possession or otherwise remove such books and records
from WCI's premises within such sixty-day period, WCI may destroy such
books and records.

any of its affiliates (other than BK) that relate to intellectual property
included in the ACQUIRED ASSETS of BK.

5.1.7 Subject to Section 5.1.8 below, WCI shall take all steps
necessary to ensure that as of the CLOSING, BK shall be the exclusive
owner of, and shall have the exclusive right to use (other than the

5.1.8 WCI shall use its best efforts to negotiate a consensual
termination of the Trademark Agreement effective June 30, 1987 between
Italimpianti of America, Incorporated ("IAI") and WCI (the "IAI Trademark

specified in the preceding sentence, WCI is unable to negotiate a con-
sensual termination of the IAI Trademark Agreement prior to the CLOSING,
then (a) the FINAL CASH PRICE and the PRELIMINARY CASH PRICE shall
automatically be reduced by US$250,000 and (b) WCI shall cause the IAI
Trademark Agreement to be assigned to BK, at no cost to BK.

equipment lease dated May 6, 1988 between WCI and XL/Datacomp, Inc.
("Datacomp"), and any software or other licenses or agreements entered
into by WCI or any of its affiliates (other than BK) that constitute
ACQUIRED ASSETS of BK to be assigned to BK, at no cost to BK, and shall
deliver to BUYER an acknowledgment of Datacomp consenting to such
assignment.

documentation reasonably satisfactory to BUYER or, at BUYER's election, to
be assigned to BUYER or its designee(s), at no cost to BUYER or such
designee(s), pursuant to documentation reasonably satisfactory to BUYER.

5.1.11 WCI will and will cause its affiliates and advisors to
immediately cease any existing discussions or negotiations with any third
parties conducted prior to the date hereof with respect to any merger,
business combination, sale of assets (other than sales of inventory in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice), purchase of
assets (other than purchases permitted by this Agreement), sale or
purchase of shares of capital stock or other securities or similar
transaction involving any third party and the BUSINESS (an "ACQUISITION

or any directors, officers, employees or advisors shall, directly or in-
directly, encourage, solicit, participate in or initiate discussions or
negotiations with, or provide any information to, any corporation,
partnership, person or other entity or group (other than BUYER or its
respective affiliates, directors, officers and employees) concerning any
ACQUISITION TRANSACTION. WCI will immediately communicate to BUYER any
inquiries or proposals received by it or its affiliates or advisors that

of WCI or any affiliated company thereof, other than those included in the
ACQUIRED ASSETS, nor state or imply that BUYER is an agent of WCI, or that
WCI or any affiliated company thereof is in any way responsible for
products produced by BUYER; any reference to WCI shall be obliterated from
all printed materials and facilities relating to the BUSINESS; and BUYER
shall, to the extent practical and as soon as possible after the CLOSING,
take steps to add language to its products, letterheads, warranty and
advertising literature or other printed public materials constituting
ACQUIRED ASSETS and to take such other actions at the facilities included
in the ACQUIRED ASSETS to indicate clearly that the BUSINESS is being
operated, and that the ACQUIRED ASSETS are owned, by BUYER or an affiliate
thereof.

5.2.4 BUYER shall establish new bank accounts in the name of
the companies in which it intends to continue the BUSINESS in the United

promptly after execution of this Agreement to the extent necessary to
permit BUYER to establish such new bank accounts as of the date of the
CLOSING.

5.2.5 BUYER shall use its reasonable best efforts from time to
time, at the reasonable request of WCI, to cooperate with WCI in providing

respect to such information or (e) becomes available to BUYER on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than WCI or any of WCI's

such information.

BUYER submits to any governmental agency in respect of matters referred to
in Section 3.2(h) above and, to the extent reasonably practicable, shall
give WCI an opportunity to comment on the substance of such notice and/or
to file such supplemental notices with the relevant governmental agencies

ARTICLE VI - EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

6.1 Provisions relating to All Employees.

6.1.1 All employees exclusively engaged in the BUSINESS
immediately prior to the CLOSING (the "EMPLOYEES") shall either remain
employees of BK or become employees of BUYER or one of its subsidiaries on
and as of the CLOSING. If BUYER at any time within sixty (60) days after
the CLOSING engages in a "mass layoff" or "plant closing" as these terms
are defined in the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of
1988 ("WARN"), BUYER shall be fully responsible for and indemnify and hold
WCI harmless against any liability arising as a result of such "mass
layoff" or "plant closing" under WARN. If BK at any time within sixty
(60) days before the CLOSING engages in such a "mass layoff" or "plant
closing," WCI shall be fully responsible for and indemnify and hold BK and
BUYER harmless against any liability arising as a result of such "mass
layoff" or "plant closing." 

6.1.2 (a) Prior to the CLOSING, BK and BKL have each provided
benefits (other than pension benefits) to EMPLOYEES and to former
employees of the BUSINESS and retirees of certain predecessors
(collectively "FORMER EMPLOYEES") and their eligible dependents (where
applicable) under the BENEFIT PLANS identified in Part 4.1.8(c) of the
SCHEDULE. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all
benefits and coverages provided to such EMPLOYEES and their eligible
dependents under the BENEFIT PLANS shall terminate as of the CLOSING
except for those claims and expenses incurred prior to the CLOSING that
are eligible for payment under the terms of WCI's BENEFIT PLANS.

(b) BUYER shall provide or cause one of its affiliates to
provide, effective as of the CLOSING, for all EMPLOYEES and their
dependents, employee benefits which BUYER determines are appropriate under

-32-<PAGE>
<PAGE>
the circumstances. Without limiting the scope of the foregoing, BUYER
shall provide or cause one of its affiliates to provide, beginning as of
the CLOSING, to all EMPLOYEES and FORMER EMPLOYEES and their eligible
dependents, such group health benefit coverage as may be required to
eliminate any and all obligations of WCI or its subsidiaries or other
affiliates to provide "continuation coverage" for such persons under
Sections 601 through 607 of ERISA or under Section 4980B of the CODE (as a
condition to the avoidance of a tax thereunder).

6.1.3 BUYER shall furnish WCI any payroll data necessary to
enable WCI to properly report WCI's Federal, State and local, Social
Security and other payroll tax data with respect to BK for the period
January 1, 1994 through the CLOSING. Upon WCI's request, BUYER shall
deliver to the EMPLOYEES Federal and State W-2 forms required to be furn-
ished by WCI for the period January 1, 1994 through the CLOSING.

6.2 Benefits Relating to USA Salaried Employees (NON-UNION
PLANS).

6.2.1 BK's Non-Union Plans. EMPLOYEES located in the United
States who are not covered by a COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT ("USA Non-
Union Employees") are covered by the White Consolidated Industries, Inc.
Pension Plan For Non-Bargaining Salaried Employees, a tax-qualified
defined benefit pension plan ("WCI's Non-Union Pension Plan") and the
White Consolidated Industries, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan for Non-
Bargaining Employees, a tax-qualified 401(k) plan ("WCI's Non-Union
Savings Plan"), copies of which have been furnished to BUYER.

(a) BUYER shall neither adopt nor become a sponsoring employer
of WCI's Non-Union Pension and Savings Plans.

(b) WCI has informed BUYER that each USA Non-Union Employee
shall be considered by WCI to have terminated participation in WCI's Non-
Union Pension and Savings Plans as of the CLOSING. Accordingly, the
eligibility of each such USA Non-Union Employee for a benefit under WCI's
Non-Union Pension and Savings Plans and the amount of such benefits shall
be determined under the terms of WCI's Non-Union Pension and Savings Plans
as in effect as of the CLOSING (as such Plans may be amended by WCI) on
the same basis as such determination would be made for any other employee
covered by such Plans whose participation in such plans with WCI
completely and finally terminates as of the CLOSING without regard to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.3 Collective Bargaining Agreements and Hourly Employees
Covered Thereby.

6.3.1 Collective Bargaining Agreement. Hourly Employees of the
BUSINESS are covered by the COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS.

6.3.2 BK Retirement Benefit Plan.

For employees who are covered by the BK COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
AGREEMENT ("Union Employees"), WCI currently maintains the Blaw-Knox
Construction Equipment Retirement Plan ("BLAW-KNOX PLAN"), a copy of which
is set forth in Part 6.3.2 of the SCHEDULE.

(a) On the CLOSING DATE, BUYER shall adopt and assume or cause
BK to adopt and assume, and shall replace or cause BK to replace WCI as
the sole sponsoring employer of the BLAW-KNOX PLAN, subject to any
amendments which BUYER may adopt to the BLAW-KNOX PLAN after the CLOSING.
-33-<PAGE>
<PAGE>
(b) Effective as of the CLOSING DATE, WCI shall cause Mellon
Bank, N.A., as master trustee pursuant to a Master Trust Agreement with
WCI effective January 2, 1992 (the "Master Trust"), to segregate from all
other assets held in the Master Trust a cash amount equal to the equitable
share of the assets of the BLAW-KNOX PLAN in such Master Trust and,
pursuant to Section 22.1 of the Master Trust, to hold such assets as
trustee of a separate trust for the BLAW-KNOX PLAN (the "Pension Trust"). 
The equitable share of the BLAW-KNOX PLAN in the Master Trust shall be
determined by Mellon Bank, N.A. in accordance with the terms of the Master
Trust. On the CLOSING DATE, or within 90 days thereafter, BUYER shall
establish a separate trust, or a separate plan trust account within
BUYER'S master pension trust, for the BLAW-KNOX PLAN ("BUYER'S TRUST")
which satisfies the requirements for tax exemption pursuant to Section
501(a) of the CODE (as part of a plan which is qualified under Section
401(a) of the CODE). On or within 90 days of the establishment of BUYER'S
TRUST, WCI shall direct Mellon Bank, N.A. to transfer to BUYER'S TRUST in
cash all of the assets of the BLAW-KNOX PLAN then held by Mellon Bank,
N.A. in the Pension Trust. Prior to the transfer of assets, WCI will
provide to BUYER a written schedule of the amount of such assets (and the
methodology used in determining such amount), prepared by Mellon Bank,
N.A., which schedule shall be subject to review by BUYER's actuary for the
purpose of confirming that the calculation was made in accordance with the
terms of the Master Trust Agreement and the actuarial assumptions des-
cribed in the Schedule entitled "White Consolidated Industries Inc. Blaw-
Knox Construction Equipment Corporation Hourly Pension Plan (040)-
Statement of Actuarial Assumptions and Actuarial Cost Method" (attached
hereto as Part 6.3.2(b) of the SCHEDULE). In the event that BUYER does
not send WCI written notice of its objections within 45 days following
receipt of Mellon Bank, N.A.'s schedule, then such evidence shall be
deemed to be approved. In the event that BUYER does send WCI written
notice of its objections within 45 days as described above, then WCI's
actuary and BUYER's actuary will attempt to reach agreement as to any
disputed matter relating to the transfer. In the event they do not reach
agreement, then WCI's actuary and BUYER's actuary will select a third
actuary, the expense of which shall be borne equally by BUYER and WCI, to
make a final and conclusive determination of the amount of the transfer.

(c) WCI shall adopt appropriate amendments to the BLAW-KNOX
PLAN and the Pension Trust, and BUYER and WCI shall take all other
actions, as may be necessary or appropriate to establish BUYER as
successor to WCI as to all powers, duties and obligations under or with
respect to the BLAW-KNOX PLAN and, effective as of the CLOSING DATE, BUYER
shall assume such powers, duties and obligations, provided that all such
amendments and actions shall be subject to the prior review and approval
of BUYER. BUYER shall amend the BLAW-KNOX PLAN to comply with the
requirements of the CODE relating to the qualifications of such PLAN under
Section 401(a) of the CODE and exemption of its related trust from income
taxation pursuant to Section 501(a) of the CODE. Such amendment shall be
made effective retroactively to the dates that are required pursuant to
the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-514), the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1986 (P.L. 99-509), the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1987 (P.L. 100-203), the Technical and Miscellaneous
Revenue Act of 1988 (P.L. 100-647), the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
of 1989 (P.L. 101-239), the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990 (P.L.
101-508) and the regulations and rulings under such laws (collectively
referred to as "TRA '86 Requirements"); shall be adopted by the BUYER not
later than the time permitted pursuant to the provisions of Section 401(b)
of the CODE, Treasury Regulations Section 

-34-<PAGE>
<PAGE>
1.401(b)-1, IRS Notice 90-73, IRS Announcement 92-29, IRS Notice 92-36,
and other pronouncements made pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.401(b)-1(e); and shall include therein provisions which reflect all of
the administrative practices pertinent to the TRA '86 Requirements that
have been implemented prior to the CLOSING DATE with respect to the BLAW-
KNOX PLAN. WCI shall cooperate with BUYER in determining which
administrative procedures, if any, have been implemented prior to the
CLOSING DATE.

(d) After adopting and assuming the BLAW-KNOX PLAN as of the
CLOSING DATE, (i) BUYER shall have full responsibility for the
maintenance, operation or termination of the BLAW-KNOX PLAN and (ii)
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, BUYER shall be
responsible for and shall indemnify and hold WCI harmless against any
liability, obligation, claim, expense, loss, tax or penalty arising out of
the BLAW-KNOX PLAN, including (A) any and all pension and survivor
benefits provided for or which the sponsoring employer is obligated to
provide under the BK COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT, (B) all claims for
benefits under the BLAW-KNOX PLAN, (C) compliance with the reporting and
disclosure requirements of the CODE and ERISA for Plan Years ending after
December 31, 1993 with respect to the BLAW-KNOX PLAN (except that any such
report or disclosure required to be made prior to the CLOSING shall be the
responsibility of WCI), (D) satisfaction of the minimum funding standards
arising under the CODE and ERISA with respect to the BLAW-KNOX PLAN for
Plan Years ending after December 31, 1993, (E) any and all liability
relating to the termination of the BLAW-KNOX PLAN and (F) any amendment
adopted by BUYER to the BLAW-KNOX PLAN that adversely affects the
qualification of the BLAW-KNOX PLAN under Section 401(a) of the CODE for
any year, and (G) the failure to comply with the requirements of Section
6.3.2(c).

(e) If BUYER causes BK to assume the BLAW-KNOX PLAN, then all
references to BUYER in this Section 6.3 (other than the reference in the
first line of Section 6.3.2(a), the fourteenth line of Section 6.3.2(b),
and the first and second lines of this Section 6.3.2.(e)) shall be deemed

contrary, WCI agrees to cause the value of the assets of BKL's UNITED

less than the accrued liabilities (allowing for, inter alia, projected salary

resolution procedures set forth in Section 6.3.2(b) above.

and for all expenses, liabilities and obligations with respect thereto,
whether contingent, absolute, known or unknown, and WCI shall not have any

UNITED KINGDOM PLAN, then all references to BUYER in Section 6.4 (other

references to such entity.
