SOCIETY CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

Basis of Presentation
- ----------------------

The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Society
Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Corporation"). Significant intercompany
transactions have been eliminated. The financial statements contain all
adjustments and disclosures which, in the opinion of management, are necessary
for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented and
should be read in conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements included in Society's 1992 Annual Report to shareholders. Certain
amounts previously reported in the financial statements have been reclassified
to conform with the current presentation. The results of operations for the
first nine months of 1993 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for the full year.

Common Shares
- -------------

Net income per Common Share is computed by dividing net income, less any
dividend requirement on preferred stock, by the weighted average number of
Common Shares and Common Share equivalents outstanding during the period as
presented below. These amounts have been adjusted to reflect a two-for-one
stock split declared January 21, 1993, and effected by means of a 100% stock
dividend paid on March 22, 1993, to shareholders of record on March 2, 1993.

Mergers, Acquisitions and Divestitures
- --------------------------------------

On October 1, 1993, KeyCorp and Society entered into a definitive agreement
which provides for the merger of KeyCorp into and with Society, which will be
the surviving corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, each outstanding
share of KeyCorp Common Stock will be converted into 1.205 common shares of the
surviving corporation. The outstanding preferred stock of KeyCorp will be
exchanged for a comparable, newly-created issue of preferred stock of the
surviving corporation on a share-for-share basis. The merger, which is subject
to the approval of KeyCorp and Society shareholders, as well as appropriate
regulatory authorities, is presently expected to close in early 1994. It is
anticipated that the transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of
interests and will qualify as a tax-free exchange for KeyCorp and Society
shareholders. Total merger expenses and restructuring charges are estimated to
be in the range of $90 to $110 million. KeyCorp, a bank holding company based
in Albany, New York, had total assets of $32.4 billion at September 30, 1993,
and has banking offices in Alaska, Colorado, Idaho, Maine, New York, Oregon,
Utah, Washington, and Wyoming.

On October 6, 1993, the Corporation completed the previously-announced cash
purchase of Schaenen Wood & Associates, Inc. ("SWA"), a New York City-based
investment management firm which manages approximately $1.3 billion in assets.
The transaction was accounted for as a purchase with the excess of the cost
over the fair value of net assets acquired recorded as goodwill. Accordingly,
the results of operations of SWA will be included in the consolidated financial
statements subsequent to the date of acquisition.

On September 15, 1993, the Corporation completed the sale of Ameritrust Texas
Corporation ("ATC") to Texas Commerce Bank National Association, an affiliate
of Chemical Banking Corporation. ATC was based in Dallas, Texas, and provided a
range of investment management and fiduciary services to institutions,
businesses and individuals through 11 offices operating in Texas. For the
year-to-date period through the closing date, ATC had operating

revenues (primarily trust income) of $37.4 million and net income of $3.2
million. The $29.4 million gain on the sale ($12.2 million after-tax, $.10 per
Common Share) is included in noninterest income for the third quarter of 1993.

On January 22, 1993, the Corporation acquired all the outstanding shares of
First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Fort Myers ("Society First
Federal"), a federal stock savings bank, at a price of $45 per share for a
total cash consideration of $144.0 million. The transaction was accounted for
as a purchase with the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets
acquired recorded as goodwill. Accordingly, the results of operations of
Society First Federal have been included in the consolidated financial
statements subsequent to the date of acquisition. Society First Federal
operates 24 offices in southwestern and central Florida and had approximately
$1.1 billion in total assets at the acquisition date.

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." SFAS No. 115 requires that
investments in equity securities having readily determinable fair values and
all investments in debt securities be classified and accounted for in three
categories. Debt securities that management has the positive intent and ability
to hold to maturity are to be classified as "held-to-maturity securities" and
reported at amortized cost. Debt and equity securities that are bought and held
principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are to be
classified as "trading securities" and reported at fair value, with unrealized
gains and losses included in operating results. Debt and equity securities not
classified as either held-to-maturity securities or trading securities are to
be classified as "available for sale securities" and reported at fair value,
with unrealized gains and losses excluded from operating results and reported
in a separate component of shareholders' equity. Adoption of the standard is
required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993, with earlier
application permitted. The Corporation has not yet determined if it will
early-adopt the new standard. Based upon the Corporation's securities portfolio
as of September 30, 1993, the estimated impact of adopting the standard would
be an increase to shareholders' equity of approximately $37 million, with no
impact on the results of operations.

Pledged Assets
- --------------

Corporate assets, primarily securities, with a book value of approximately
$4,547.1 million at September 30, 1993, were pledged to secure public and trust
deposits and securities sold under repurchase agreements, and for other
purposes required or permitted by law.

In May 1993, the FASB issued SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan." SFAS No. 114 requires that impaired loans, as defined in
the statement, be measured based on the present value of expected future cash
flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, or based on the loan's
observable market price or fair value of the collateral, if the loan is
collateral-dependent. Adoption of the standard is required for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 1994, with earlier application permitted. The
Corporation has not yet made a final determination as to when to adopt the new
standard. An estimate of its impact upon the Corporation's financial condition
and results of operations has not yet been finalized.

Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
- -------------------------------------------

The Corporation provides postretirement health care and life insurance benefits
generally to employees who retire at age 55 or later and have at least 10 years
of service. The postretirement health care plan is nonfunded and contributory,
with retirees' contributions adjusted annually to reflect certain cost-sharing
provisions and benefit limitations. The postretirement life insurance plan is
noncontributory. Life insurance benefits for participants who retired before
1993 are generally provided for through outside insurance carriers. Life
insurance benefits for employees retiring in 1993 or later years will be paid
from the Corporation's pension plan and are, accordingly, included in the
determination of the pension benefit obligation.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
106, "Employers' Accounting For Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."
This standard requires that employers recognize the cost of providing
postretirement benefits over the employees' active service period to the date
they attain full eligibility for such benefits. Postretirement benefit costs
for 1992, which were recorded on a cash basis, will not be restated. The
Corporation elected to recognize the transition obligation, estimated to be
approximately $74 million, prospectively over a 20-year period. The transition
obligation represents the unfunded accumulated retirement obligation at the
date the standard was adopted. Adoption of the new standard is expected to add
an estimated $5 million to full-year 1993 postretirement benefits cost.

Postemployment Benefits
- -----------------------

Effective in the third quarter of 1993, the Corporation adopted the provisions
of SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." This
standard requires that employers who provide benefits to former or inactive
employees after employment but before retirement recognize a liability for such
benefits if specified conditions are met. Adoption of the standard increased
third quarter and year-to-date noninterest expense by $4.0 million,
representing both the cumulative "catch-up" adjustment as of January 1, 1993,
and the current year impact. Postemployment benefits for prior interim
periods, which were recorded on a cash basis, will not be restated due to
immateriality.

Restructuring Charges
- ---------------------

Noninterest expense for the first three months of 1992 included restructuring
charges of $50.0 million ($34.2 million after tax, $.29 per Common Share)
recorded in connection with the merger with Ameritrust. These charges included
accruals for severance payments, estimated costs for the integration or
elimination of operations and facilities, and other merger-related charges and
accruals.

Income Taxes

The current and deferred components of the provision for income taxes were as

</TABLE>

Income taxes on securities transactions are provided for at the statutory
income tax rate and included in the current portion of the Federal income tax
provision.

On August 10, President Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1993. The Act includes a number of key items which will impact the
Corporation's Federal income tax provision. Primary among these items was a
retroactive increase in the Federal statutory tax rate from 34% to 35% as of
January 1, 1993, and certain limitations on deductible expenses which take
effect after this year. A "catch-up" adjustment of $3.0 million, primarily for
current Federal income taxes, was recorded as part of the provision for income
taxes for the third quarter of 1993 to reflect the retroactive increase in the
statutory tax rate.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities
- --------------------------------------

In the normal course of business, various commitments and contingent
liabilities arise, including commitments to extend credit, standby letters of
credit, interest rate swaps, forward contracts, futures, options on financial
futures, and interest rate caps, collars and floors. The following table
summarizes the Corporation's exposure to these off-balance sheet commitments
and contingent liabilities as of September 30, 1993 (in thousands):
