LOCKHEED CORPORATION DENIES ALLEGATIONS

CALABASAS, Calif., June 22, 1994 -- Lockheed Corporation issued the
following statement in response to an indictment returned by a federal grand 
jury in Atlanta:

"Lockheed emphatically denies the allegations in the indictment and intends
to vigorously defend itself against the charges. Lockheed fully cooperated 
with the government during the course of its investigation and is disappointed 
by the decision to seek an indictment. Lockheed has a long-standing policy of 
not commenting on the specifics of ongoing litigation. However, we firmly 
believe that any prosecution of this case is without merit. After review, 
Lockheed believes its policies and practices have been and continue to be 
consistent with the spirit and intent of all applicable laws and regulations."

NEWS RELEASE

Gerrilyn G. Brill, First Assistant United States Attorney
for the Northern District of Georgia, and Richard A. Easley,
Special Agent in Charge, Defense Criminal Investigative Service,
announced today that a federal grand jury in Atlanta has indicted
LOCKHEED CORPORATION, and two of its executives, ALLEN R. LOVE,
and SULEIMAN A. NASSAR, on charges of violating the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, and conspiring to violate the act, as well
as conspiring to commit wire fraud and to impair and impede
agencies of the United States Department of Defense. The
indictment also charges defendant ALLEN R. LOVE with committing
perjury before the federal grand jury.

The indictment charges that LOCKHEED, acting through a
number of high level executives and other employees, retained a
consultant in Egypt, Dr. Leila I. Takla, to use her influence
with the Egyptian government officials in an effort to assist
LOCKHEED in procuring a contract for the sale of three C-130
Hercules Aircraft to Egypt in 1989 for a purchase price of
$79,983,575.00. The indictment alleges that Takla was a member
of the Egyptian Parliament at the time of the contract
negotiations and that she was paid over $1 million by LOCKHEED,
in the form of retainer payments and a termination fee. The
indictment also charges that LOCKHEED 
<PAGE>
executives created and maintained in LOCKHEED's records certain
false and fraudulent documents pertaining to the consulting
relationship in an effort to conceal the true identity of the
consultant. Finally, the indictment charges defendant ALLEN R.
LOVE with committing perjury when he advised the grand jury that
Dr. Takla had no significant involvement with the entity know as
Dr. Leila I. Takla, Inc.

The indictment alleges that defendant ALLEN R. LOVE was
based in Marietta, Georgia, at the offices of Lockheed
Aeronautical Systems Company, and unincorporated division of
defendant LOCKHEED CORPORATION. LOVE held the position of
Director of Middle East and North Africa Sales. The indictment
also alleges that defendant SULEIMAN A. NASSAR was based in
Geneva, Switzerland, and was the Regional Vice President of
Lockheed Corporation International, S.A., which was a wholly
owned subsidiary of defendant LOCKHEED CORPORATION.

Each of the charges carries a maximum penalty of five years
imprisonment. Under the alternative fine provisions of the
United States Code, any person or entity deriving pecuniary gain
from an offense may be fined no more than twice the gross gain
from such activity.

This indictment is the result of an investigation conducted
by Special Agents of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service,
with assistance from the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Swiss
Ministry of Justice, the Egyptian Ministry of Justice, and the
Office of the Egyptian Judge Advocate General for the Cairo
District. The lead agent on the investigation is DCIS Special
<PAGE>
Agent Chris Amato; the prosecution is being handled by Assistant
United States Attorney Martin J. Weinstein.

LOCKHEED CORPORATION cooperated with the United States
Attorney's Office in its efforts to gather documents during the
course of the investigation.

For further information, please contact Gerrilyn G. Brill,
First Assistant United States Attorney, at (404) 331-4960 or John
S. Davis, Chief, Criminal Division, at (404) 331-4230.

Members of the public are reminded that the indictment
contains only charges. The defendants are presumed innocent of
the charges, and it will be the government's burden to prove
their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.

A copy of the indictment is available upon request.
