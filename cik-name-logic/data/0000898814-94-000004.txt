Item 5. - Other Events

On December 17, 1993, the Registrant completed its public

The form of underwriting agreement executed by each of the parties

Upon the consummation of the public offering of the 10-3/4%
Senior Notes and the receipt of net proceeds therefrom, American Blind

subsidiary of the Registrant, acquired substantially all the assets of
ABF Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation, for a purchase price of
$80,000,000 and the assumption of certain liabilities. The terms and
conditions of this acquisition were previously reported in the
Registrant's Registration Statement or Form S-1 (Reg. No. 33-50599)

omitted from the form of prospectus included in the Registration
Statement at the time it is declared effective by the Commission,
(iv) the term "Prospectus" means the form of final prospectus relating

which they were made) not misleading. When the preliminary
prospectus dated November 16, 1993 was first filed with the
Commission (whether filed as part of the Registration Statement
or an amendment thereof or pursuant to Rule 424(a) of the
Regulations) and when any amendment thereof or supplement thereto
was first filed with the Commission, such preliminary prospectus
and any amendments thereof and supplements thereto complied in
all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Act
and the Regulations and did not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. No representation or warranty is made in this
subsection (a), however, with respect to information relating to
any of you or the public offering of the Securities by you
contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus or any related preliminary prospectus or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto in reliance upon and in conformity
with information furnished in writing to the Company by Bear,
Stearns & Co. Inc. on its or your behalf expressly for use
therein. If the Registration Statement has become effective, no
stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose has
been initiated or threatened by the Commission and the Company
shall file with the Commission in accordance with Rule 424(b) of
the Regulations a final Prospectus containing all Rule 430A
Information omitted at the time such Registration Statement was
declared effective by the Commission. The Company will not file
any such final Prospectus or further amendment to such
Registration Statement to which you shall reasonably object in
writing after being furnished a copy thereof prior to filing.

(b) Subsequent to the respective dates as of which
information is given in the Registration Statement, except as set
forth in the Registration Statement, there has not been any
material adverse change, or any development involving a

operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole,
whether or not arising from transactions in the ordinary course
of business, and since the date of the latest consolidated

distribution of the Securities by you, and will use its best
efforts to cause the same to become effective promptly.

(e) Promptly after the Registration Statement becomes
effective, and from time to time thereafter for such period as in
the opinion of your counsel a prospectus is required by law to be
delivered in connection with sales of Securities by you or any
dealer, the Company will furnish to you and each dealer as many
copies of the Prospectus (and of any amendment or supplement to
the Prospectus) as you or such dealer reasonably may request.

(f) If during the period specified in paragraph (e) above
any event shall occur as a result of which it becomes necessary
to amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances existing when
the Prospectus is delivered to a purchaser, not misleading, or if
it becomes necessary to amend or supplement the Prospectus to
comply with any law, the Company will forthwith prepare and file
with the Commission an appropriate amendment or supplement to the
Prospectus so that the statements in the Prospectus, as so
amended or supplemented, will not, in light of the circumstances
existing when it is so delivered, be misleading, or so that the
Prospectus will comply with law, and the Company will furnish to
you and to those dealers as you shall specify, such number of
copies thereof as you or those dealers reasonably may request.

(g) Prior to any public offering of the Securities, the
Company will cooperate with you and your counsel in connection
with the registration or qualification of the Securities under
the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions as you may
request, will continue such qualification in effect so long as
required for such purpose and will file such consents to service
of process or other documents as may be necessary in order to
effect such registration or qualification; provided, however, 
-------- -------
that in connection therewith the Company shall not be required to

13
<PAGE>

<PAGE>

qualify as a foreign corporation or to file any general consent
to service of process in any jurisdiction in which it is not
already so qualified or subject.

(h) The Company will mail and make generally available to
its securityholders as soon as reasonably practicable an earnings
statement covering a period of at least twelve consecutive months
commencing after the Effective Date (but in no event commencing
later than 90 days after such date) that shall satisfy the
provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule 158 thereunder.

(i) So long as any of the Securities remains outstanding,
the Company will (i) mail as soon as reasonably practicable after
the end of each fiscal year to the record holders of the
Securities, a financial report of the Company and its
subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, including in each such
financial report a consolidated balance sheet, a consolidated
statement of operations, a consolidated statement of cash flows
and a consolidated statement of stockholder's equity as of the
end of and for such fiscal year, together with comparable
information as of the end of and for the preceding year,
certified by independent public accountants, and (ii) mail and
make generally available to such holders as soon as practicable
after the end of each quarterly period (except for the last
quarterly period of each fiscal year), a consolidated balance
sheet, a consolidated statement of operations and a consolidated
statement of cash flows as of the end of and for such period, and
for the period from the beginning of such year to the close of
such quarterly period, together with comparable information for
the corresponding periods of the preceding year, none of which
statements need be audited.

(j) During the period referred to in paragraph (i) above,
the Company will furnish you as soon as available a copy of each
report mailed by the Company to holders of its securities or
filed by the Company with the Commission and such other publicly
available information concerning the Company and its subsidiaries
as you reasonably may request.

(k) Whether or not the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated, the
Company will pay all costs, expenses and fees incident to (i) the
preparation, printing, filing under the Act and distribution of
the Registration Statement (including financial statements and
exhibits), each preliminary prospectus and all amendments and
supplements to

14
<PAGE>

<PAGE>

any of them, (ii) the printing, filing under the Act (if
required), distribution and delivery of the Prospectus and all
amendments thereof or supplements thereto, (iii) the reproduction
and delivery of this Agreement, the Blue Sky Memorandum and any
supplement thereto and all other agreements, memoranda,
correspondence and other documents printed and delivered in
connection with the offering of the Securities (including in each
case any reasonable disbursements of your counsel relating to
such reproduction and delivery), (iv) the registration or
qualification of the Securities under the securities or Blue Sky
laws of the several states (including in each case the reasonable
fees and disbursements of your counsel relating to such
registration or qualification and the preparation of a Blue Sky
Memorandum relating thereto), (v) filings with the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. in connection with its
review of the fairness of the underwriting terms and arrangements
for the public offering of the Securities by you (including the
reasonable fees and disbursements of your counsel in connection
therewith), (vi) furnishing such copies of the Registration
Statement, the Prospectus and all amendments and supplements
thereto as may be requested for use in connection with the
offering or sale of the Securities by you or by dealers to whom
Securities may be sold, (vii) the fees and expenses of the
Trustee and any agent of such Trustee and the fees and
disbursements of counsel for such Trustee in connection with the
Indenture, (viii) the fees of the national rating agencies in
connection with the rating of the Securities, and (ix) the
performance by the Company of its other obligations under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Underwriters shall
reimburse the Company for $500,000 of its legal and other
expenses in the same proportion among the Underwriters as that of
the principal amount of Securities agreed to be purchased by each
Underwriter pursuant to Section 3 hereof.

(l) The Company will apply the proceeds from the sale of
the Securities as set forth under "Use of Proceeds" in the
Prospectus.

(m) The Company will use its best efforts to do and perform
all things required or necessary to be done and performed under
this Agreement by the Company prior to the Closing Date and to
satisfy all conditions precedent to the delivery of the
Securities.

15

<PAGE>

(n) During the period of one hundred eighty (180) days
following the date of the Prospectus, the Company will not,
without your prior written consent, directly or indirectly issue,
sell, offer or agree to sell, or otherwise dispose of any debt or
redeemable equity (other than for other non-redeemable equity
securities) Securities (or any securities convertible into,
exercisable for or exchangeable for any such securities) other
than the Securities to be issued and sold pursuant hereto.

6. Indemnification. (a) The Company agrees to indemnify
---------------
and hold harmless each of you and each person, if any, who controls
each of you within the meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20
of the Exchange Act, from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and judgments arising out of or relating to any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus (as amended
or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments or
supplements thereto) or any preliminary prospectus, or caused by any
omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or judgments arise out of or relate to any such untrue
statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission based
upon information relating to you furnished by Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc.
in writing to the Company expressly for use therein; provided,
--------
however, that the foregoing indemnity agreement with respect to any
-------
preliminary prospectus shall not inure to your benefit or that of any
such controlling person if the person asserting any such losses,
claims or damages purchased Securities from you and if a copy of the
Prospectus (as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have
furnished any amendments or supplements thereto) was not sent or given
by you or on your behalf to such person, if required by law to have
been so delivered, at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale
of Securities to such person, if the Prospectus (as so amended or
supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or judgments and if the Company shall
have fully complied in all material respects with Sections 5(c) (other
than Section 5(c)(i)) through 5(f) hereof.

(b) In case any action shall be brought against you or any
person controlling you, based upon the Registration Statement, any
preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto and with respect to which indemnity may be sought
against the Company, you shall promptly notify the Company in writing
(but failure to so notify an

16
<PAGE>

<PAGE>

indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it
may have under this Section 6 except to the extent that it has been
prejudiced in any material respect by such failure or from any
liability which it may otherwise have) and the Company shall assume
the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to you and payment of all fees and expenses. You or any
such controlling person shall have the right to employ separate
counsel in any such action and participate in the defense thereof, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at your expense or at
the expense of such controlling person unless (i) the employment of
such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the
Company, or (ii) the Company has failed to assume the defense and
employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to you or (iii) the named
parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include
both you or such controlling person and the Company, and you or such
controlling person shall have been advised by such counsel that there
may be one or more legal defenses available to you or such controlling
person that are different from or additional to those available to the
Company (in which case the Company shall not have the right to assume
the defense of such action on behalf of you or such controlling
person, it being understood, however, that the Company shall not, in
connection with any one such action or separate but substantially
similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of the
same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of
attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) for you and all such
controlling persons, which firm shall be designated in writing by you
and that all such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are
incurred). The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any
such action effected without its written consent but if settled with
its written consent, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
you and each such controlling person from and against any loss or
liability by reason of such settlement. Notwithstanding the foregoing
sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an
indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable
fees and expenses of counsel, the indemnifying party agrees that it
shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without
its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more than
60 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid
request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the
indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the date of
such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior
written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any
pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified
party is or has been threatened to be made

17
<PAGE>

<PAGE>

a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by that
indemnified party; provided, however, that an indemnifying party may
-------- -------
effect such a settlement without the consent of the indemnified party
if such settlement includes an unconditional release of the
indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject
matter of the proceeding or the indemnifying party indemnifies the
indemnified party in writing and posts a bond for an amount equal to
the maximum liability on all such claims.

(c) You agree severally to indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its directors, its officers who sign the Registration
Statement, and each person, if any, controlling the Company within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, to
the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to you but
only with reference to information relating to you furnished in
writing by Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. on its or your behalf expressly
for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, any preliminary
prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto. In case any action
shall be brought against the Company, any of its directors, any such
officer or any such controlling person based on the Registration
Statement, the Prospectus or any preliminary prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto and in respect of which indemnity may
be sought against you, you shall have the same rights and duties as
are given to the Company by Section 6(b) hereof (except that if the
Company shall have assumed the defense thereof, you shall not be
required to do so, but may employ separate counsel therein and
participate in the defense thereof but the fees and expenses of such
separate counsel shall be at your expense), and the Company, its
directors, each such officer and each such controlling person shall
have the same rights and duties as are given to you by Section 6(b)
hereof.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6
is unavailable to an indemnified party in respect of any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or judgments referred to therein, then
each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified
party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and judgments (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand
and you on the other hand from the offering of the Securities or
(ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted
by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not
only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also
the relative fault of the Company and you in connection with the
statements or

18
<PAGE>

<PAGE>

omissions that resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities
or judgments, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. 
The relative benefits received by the Company and you shall be deemed
to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the
offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the
total underwriting discounts and commissions received by you, bear to
the total price to the public of the Securities, in each case as set
forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative
fault of the Company and you shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of
a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or you
and each party's relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

The Company and you agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 6(d) were
determined by any other method of allocation that does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified
party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
judgments referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph shall be
deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party
in connection with investigating or defending any such action or
claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6, you shall
not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by
which the underwriting discount applicable to the Securities purchased
by you exceeds the amount of any damages which you were otherwise
required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement
or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty
of such fraudulent misrepresentation. No party shall be liable for
contribution with respect to any action or claim settled without its
written consent; provided, however, that such written consent was not
-------- -------
unreasonably withheld.

7. Conditions of Underwriters' Obligations. Your
---------------------------------------
obligations to purchase and pay for the Securities shall be subject to
(i) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company
herein contained, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date,

operations, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of
business, of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
or any material change, or any development involving a
prospective material adverse change, in the sales, the capital
stock or in the long-term debt of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries from that set forth in or contemplated by the

jurisdiction of incorporation.

(ii) Each of the Company and the Material Subsidiaries is
duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in
good standing in all jurisdictions where the ownership or leasing
of its properties or the conduct of its business requires such

adverse effect on the business, operations, financial condition
or results of operations of the Company and the Material
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

the corporate power and authority to own or lease its respective

stock of each of the Material Subsidiaries to secure the
Company's obligations under the Senior Credit Agreement (as

(v) The authorized capital stock of the Company is as set
forth in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus. All of

enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, (A)
subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws now or
hereafter in effect relating to or affecting creditors' rights
and remedies generally, (B) subject, as to enforceability, to
general principles of equity, including principles of commercial

deemed to be unenforceable.

(vii) The Securities have been duly and validly authorized
by the Company, and when executed, authenticated and delivered in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture and delivered to and

Company in accordance with their respective terms, (A) subject to

(ix) This Agreement has been duly and validly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Company.

(x) To such counsel's knowledge, there is no action,
proceeding, inquiry or investigation, before or brought by any
court or governmental agency or body, to which the Company or any

of the Company or any of the Material Subsidiaries is subject,
which is required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement
or the Prospectus and that has not been so disclosed.

(xi) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company
of this Agreement, the Indenture and the Securities and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
including without limitation the issuance, sale and delivery of
the Securities, do not (A) conflict with or result in a breach of
any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a default (or an
event which with notice or lapse of time, or both, would
constitute a default) or require consent under, or result in the
creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon
any property or assets of the Company or any of its Material
Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of any Material Agreement, (B)
conflict with or violate any statute, rule, regulation or, to
such counsel's knowledge, any judgment, decree or order of any

in this clause (B) with respect to the Federal securities laws,
rules or regulations to the extent such laws are expressly
considered in other sections of this opinion, or with respect to
state securities or blue sky laws); or (C) conflict with or
violate the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or equivalent
charter documents of the Company or any of the Material
Subsidiaries.

(xii) No consent, approval, authorization, permit or order

counsel's knowledge, any court that has jurisdiction over the
Company or any of the Material Subsidiaries or any of their

made by the

23
<PAGE>

<PAGE>

Company or any of the Material Subsidiaries for the sale of the
Securities to the Underwriters as contemplated by this Agreement
and the Indenture, except for such as have been obtained and made
and such as may be required under state securities or blue sky
laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the
Securities by the Underwriters, as to which we offer no opinion.

(xiii) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and
each amendment or supplement thereto, as of their respective
effective or issue dates, appear on their face to comply as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, except
that we express no opinion as to (i) the financial statements or
schedules or other financial or statistical data contained in the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus, (ii) the Statement of
Eligibility and Qualification of the Trustee under the Trust
Indenture Act or (iii) the exhibits to the Registration
Statement.

(xiv) The Securities and the Indenture conform in all
material respects to the respective descriptions thereof in the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus.

(xv) The Registration Statement has become effective under
the Securities Act and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge,
no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement or any part thereof has been issued and no proceedings
for that purpose have been instituted or are pending or, to such
counsel's knowledge, threatened under the Securities Act.

(xvi) The Company is not required to be registered as, and
is not controlled by, an investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended.

In addition, such counsel shall state the following: 

We have participated in conferences with officers and other
representatives of the Company, representatives of the
independent auditors of the Company and your representatives at
which the contents of the Registration Statement, the Prospectus
and related matters were discussed. Because the purpose of our
professional engagement was not to establish or confirm factual
matters and because the scope of our examination of the affairs
of the Company did not permit us to verify the accuracy,
completeness or fairness of the

24
<PAGE>

<PAGE>

statements set forth in the Registration Statement or Prospectus,
we are not passing upon and do not assume any responsibility for
the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements
contained in the Registration Statement or Prospectus. However,
on the basis of the foregoing and relying as to materiality to a
large extent upon the opinions of officers and other
representatives of the Company, it being understood that we make
no statement as to the financial statements or schedules or other
financial or statistical data contained in the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus, the Statement of Eligibility and
Qualification of the Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act or the
exhibits to the Registration Statement, (i) we do not know of any
pending or threatened legal or governmental proceedings required
to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus
that are not described as required or of any contracts or
documents of a character required to be described in the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus or to be filed as
exhibits to the Registration Statement that are not described or
filed as required and (ii) no facts have come to our attention
that lead us to believe that the Registration Statement, or any
supplement or amendment thereto, as of their respective effective
dates, contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or
that the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, as
of their respective issue dates and as of the date hereof,
included any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

In rendering the foregoing opinion, such counsel may rely
(A) as to matters involving the application of laws other than
the laws of the United States, the State of New York and Delaware
corporate law, to the extent such counsel deems proper and to the
extent specified in such opinion, if at all, upon an opinion or
opinions (in form and scope reasonably satisfactory to your
counsel) of other counsel, reasonably acceptable to your counsel,
familiar with the applicable laws, which opinion shall be
addressed and delivered to you; and (B) as to matters of fact, to
the extent such counsel deems proper, on certificates of
responsible officers and other representatives of the Company,
certificates of public officials, and certificates or other
written statements of officers of departments of

25
<PAGE>

<PAGE>

various jurisdictions having custody of documents respecting the
corporate existence or good standing of the Company and its
subsidiaries, provided that copies of any such statements or
certificates shall be delivered to your counsel. 

(d) On the Closing Date you shall have received from your
counsel, Weil, Gotshal & Manges, an opinion, dated the date of
its delivery, addressed to you, with respect to the Company, the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters
as you reasonably may require, and the Company shall have
furnished to your counsel such documents as they may reasonably
request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such
matters.

(e) Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement you shall have received from each of Grant Thornton and
Coopers & Lybrand, and on the Closing Date you shall have
received from Coopers & Lybrand a letter addressed to you, dated
the date of its delivery, substantially in the form and to the
effect and with respect to such matters as shall have been
previously agreed upon by you.

(f) At the Closing Date, you shall have received an opinion
from counsel to the Trustee, dated the date of its delivery,
addressed to you and in form and substance satisfactory to your
counsel, to the effect that:

(i) the Trustee is a national banking association or
state chartered bank or trust company and is validly
existing in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction
in which it is incorporated;

(ii) the Trustee has the power and authority to enter
into the Indenture and authenticate the Securities as
Trustee under the Indenture;

(iii) the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed
and delivered by the Trustee, as Trustee under the
Indenture, and the Indenture is valid and binding on the
Trustee in accordance with its terms, (i) subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws now or hereafter
in effect relating to creditors' rights and remedies
generally, (ii) subject, as to enforceability, to general
principles of equity, including principles of commercial
reasonableness, good

26
<PAGE>

<PAGE>

faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether enforcement is
sought in a proceeding at law or in equity) and (iii) except
insofar as the usury waiver therein may be deemed to be
unenforceable; and
