wholly-owned subsidiary of L.A. Gear, Inc. (the "Company"), entered into the
First Amendment to Loan and Security Agreement dated as of May 31, 1994 (the
"First Amendment") to the Loan and Security Agreement (the "Loan Agreement")
dated as of November 22, 1993, between Borrower and BankAmerica Business
Credit, Inc. ("Lender"), pursuant to which Lender provides to Borrower a
revolving line of credit facility for loans and letters of credit in an

various overdraft extensions of credit from an affiliate of Lender and (iii)
provide greater financial flexibility to Borrower. The First Amendment reduces
the Adjusted Tangible Net Worth (as defined in the First Amendment) for the
remainder of the Company's 1994 fiscal year to $169.5 million from $175 million
and, as long as the Adjusted Tangible Net Worth is below $175 million, imposes
a quarterly minimum earnings requirement commencing with the Company's 1994
third fiscal quarter. The foregoing description of the First Amendment is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the First Amendment,
filed as Exhibit 99.2 hereto and which is incorporated herein by reference.
