acquired 98.7% (5,620,383 shares) of the outstanding

("ELDEC") from individual shareholders and trusts for
$73,064,979 and thereafter consummated the merger of

is anticipated that ELDEC Corporation will continue to
operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of Crane Co. Any
shares not acquired in the tender offer will be granted
