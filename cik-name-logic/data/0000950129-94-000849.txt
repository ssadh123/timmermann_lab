APACHE TO ACQUIRE TEXACO PROPERTIES FOR $600 MILLION
PROPERTIES WILL INCREASE PROVED RESERVES BY 118 MMBOE

HOUSTON, TEXAS -- Apache Corporation and Texaco today announced that the
companies have entered into a memorandum of understanding outlining the terms
under which Apache will acquire Texaco's interest in over 300 oil and gas
fields for approximately $600 million. The effective date of the transaction
is January 1, 1995, with closing expected in the first quarter of 1995.

The acquisition includes estimated net proved reserves of 81 million barrels
(MMBbls) of oil and 220 billion cubic feet of gas. On an energy equivalent
basis, proved reserves total 118 MMBbls and are 69 percent crude oil. The
acquired reserves represent a 51-percent increment over Apache's year-end 1993
total reserves.

The properties are highly concentrated with approximately two-thirds of the
reserves located in 54 fields and are in producing regions where Apache has
existing operations -- the Permian Basin, the Gulf Coast of Texas and
Louisiana, western Oklahoma, East Texas, the Rocky Mountains and the Gulf of
Mexico. Current average daily production from the properties is approximately
21,000 barrels of oil and 90 million cubic feet of natural gas. Apache will
operate approximately 68 percent of the production and hold an average
70-percent working interest in the operated properties.
<PAGE> 2
According to Apache Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Raymond Plank, "This
acquisition is another important step in achieving our growth objectives and
furthers our pursuit in becoming a premier independent oil and gas producer.
The properties being acquired offer upside opportunities for increasing
reserves and profitability through drilling, workovers and recompletions,
application of 3-D seismic, as well as reductions in operating costs.
Additionally, they can be incorporated quickly into existing operations and
will provide economies of scale. We are very pleased to have negotiated a
transaction with Texaco which results in continued growth for Apache, is
additive to per share earnings and cash flow, and enables Texaco to achieve one
of its strategic objectives."

Commenting on the sale, Texaco Exploration and Production Inc. President
Clarence P. Cazalot, Jr., said, "Achieving greater shareholder value by
focusing human resources and capital assets on our most profitable properties
is a cornerstone of our plan for growth. The proceeds from this sale will be
redeployed into growth opportunities across the company, including major
expenditures on core producing properties in the U.S."

Consummation of the transaction is subject to negotiation and execution of a
definitive purchase and sale agreement, as well as approval by the respective
Board of Directors of both companies.

Apache Corporation is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration
for and development and production of natural gas and crude oil. The company's
securities are traded on the New York and Chicago Stock Exchanges under the
symbol APA.

(i) Buyer and Seller shall promptly make all
required filings under the HSR Act;

another in:

authorizations, approvals or waivers; and

If, prior to the Effective Date, all or any material portion of an
Asset is destroyed by fire or other casualty, is taken in condemnation
or under the right of eminent domain or proceedings for such purposes
are pending or threatened, Buyer shall purchase such portion of the
Assets, notwithstanding any such destruction, taking or pending or
threatened taking. Seller shall pay to Buyer (as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price) all sums paid to Seller by Third Persons by reason of
the destruction or taking of such portion of the Assets to be assigned
to Buyer, and shall assign, transfer and set over to Buyer all of the
right, title and interest of Seller in and to any unpaid awards or
other payments from Third Persons arising out of the destruction,
taking or pending or threatened taking as to such interest. If prior
to the Effective Date, the applicable Assets are destroyed by fire or
other casualty and the sums transferred to Buyer pursuant to the
foregoing sentence do not equal the amount necessary to replace or
restore the pertinent Assets to the condition they were in prior to
such fire or casualty, Seller shall pay to Buyer, or the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the additional amount necessary to repair or
replace all destroyed Assets or restore the Assets to their condition
prior to the fire or casualty loss. If the sums that Seller would be
responsible for pursuant to the foregoing sentence exceed fifty percent
(50%) of the Allocated Value of the pertinent Asset, Seller may elect

any Asset without first obtaining the written consent of Buyer, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(h) Post-Closing Access. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, from and after the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller
shall reasonably cooperate and afford each other or cause to be
afforded to their respective officers, employees, accountants and

24
<PAGE> 33
other representatives access, upon reasonable notice, during business
hours with respect to the facility to which access has been requested,
to review and copy the books, documents, databases or other records
relating to the Assets not including the excluded assets (which books,
documents, databases, records, or employees files or other information
the Parties shall cooperate and assist one another in identifying and
locating), interview, depose or seek testimony of employees, provide
assistance in proceedings with employees as witnesses or advisors,
investigate the physical premises, take photographs or videotapes,
identify employees and contractors with knowledge of any matter which
is the subject of a claim for which a Party has responsibility and make
such employees available to such Party and provide reasonable office
space to do any of the foregoing in connection with any matter
affecting or alleged to affect the Party requesting such access.
Access to Tax records shall be governed by Part 5.

(i) Financial Audit. Both prior to and after the
Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer financial data for the calendar
years 1992, 1993 and 1994, and any portion of 1995 prior to the

direct lease operating costs with respect to each of the Assets and the
gross revenues from such Assets and such other information as may be
required by Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission. The cost incurred by Seller in providing the financial
data to Buyer shall be shared equally by Buyer and Seller.

(j) Preferential Purchase Rights. With respect to
Preferential Rights:

(i) Within fifteen (15) days following the
execution of the Agreement, Seller shall propose to Buyer the
forms of notice it intends to send to all holders of
preferential purchase rights in the Assets. Seller shall
incorporate any revisions or additions to the forms of notice
requested by Buyer and reasonably satisfactory to Seller in
order to assure full compliance with the applicable notice
provisions and effective waiver of the exercise of such rights
if no affirmative exercise is received. Seller shall transmit
to the respective holders of preferential purchase rights all
such notices no later than thirty (30) days following the
execution of the Agreement. Seller shall keep Buyer informed
on a current basis as receipt of responses from the holders of
preferential purchase rights are received or applicable
exercise periods expire without exercise or response from the
holders. Seller shall provide Buyer with copies of all such
correspondence between Seller and such holders of preferential
purchase rights as such correspondence is received.

(ii) To the extent any preferential purchase
rights are exercised by any Third Person entitled to exercise
such rights, then the Assets subject to such preferential
purchase rights shall not be sold to Buyer and shall be
excluded from the Agreement. The Purchase Price shall be
adjusted by the portion of the Allocated Value representing
the portion of the Assets subject to such exercised
preferential purchase right. In the event any Third Person
initially elects to exercise a particular preferential right,
but subsequently refuses or elects not to consummate the
purchase under the preferential right and such refusal occurs
prior to one hundred eighty (180) days following the Closing
Date, Buyer shall

25
<PAGE> 34
purchase such interests covered by the preferential right for
its Allocated Value as of the Effective Date and the closing of
such transaction shall take place on a date mutually acceptable
to Seller and Buyer not more than thirty (30) days following
such failure or refusal.

(iii) If a preferential purchase right has not
been waived prior to Closing, the Assets subject to such right
shall be included in the Assets conveyed at Closing and there
shall be no adjustment to the Purchase Price or account of
such preferential purchase right. If the holder of the
preferential purchase right exercises the right subsequent to
Closing, Buyer shall convey the affected property to the
holder of the right, and shall retain the payment therefor.

(k) Required Consents. If Seller shall fail to obtain
any consent required for the transfer of any Asset, Seller's failure
shall be handled as follows:

(i) If the holder of the right to consent
affirmatively refuses to consent prior to Closing, such
refusal shall be considered a Title Defect under Section 7.1
and the Title Indemnity Payment therefor shall equal the
Allocated Value (or portion thereof) of the affected Property
(or portion thereof).

(ii) Except for approvals from Governmental
Bodies normally received subsequent to assignment, if Seller
believes a consent may be obtained subsequent to Closing, the
Property shall be held by Seller for the benefit of Buyer
after Closing and shall provide Buyer with the economic
benefits thereof until such consent is received or until
ninety (90) days following Closing, if later, and Buyer shall
pay for the property at Closing in accordance with the
Agreement as though the consent had been obtained. If Seller
obtains the consent on or before ninety (90) days following
Closing, then Seller shall deliver conveyances of the property
to Buyer. If the consent is not obtained or is affirmatively
refused on or before ninety (90) days following Closing,
Seller shall refund the Allocated Value of the affected
portion of the Property to Buyer less any net revenues
(revenues net of costs and Burdens) received by Buyer in
connection with such affected portion of the Property and
Seller's holding for the benefit of Buyer shall terminate.

(l) Employee Matters. Buyer shall have the right to
solicit the field employees of Seller (and any other employees of
Seller that Seller identifies in writing) who work directly on or in
connection with the Assets ("Employees"), and shall have the right to
offer employment to and hire any such Employees. If Buyer hires any
Employee, the terms of employment shall be at Buyer's discretion
provided, however, that (i) Buyer shall provide such Employee the
benefits that are provided to other employees of Buyer on the same
terms; and (ii) Buyer shall credit such Employee with the
time-in-service that such Employee accrued with Seller, except that no
more than three (3) weeks vacation shall be credited to an Employee.

(m) Final Recapitulation Settlement; Subsequent Audits
and Settlements. With respect to final recapitulation and audits;

26
<PAGE> 35
(i) Within one hundred eighty (180) days after
the Closing Date, Seller shall provide to Buyer, for Buyer's
review, a proposed final recapitulation settlement in the form
of the Preliminary Settlement Statement (the "Final Recap
Statement") to account for all adjustments to the Purchase
Price known as of such date pursuant to Sections 2.2 and 2.3
(the "Final Recap"). Buyer shall have the right, within one
hundred twenty (120) days after receipt of the Final Recap
Statement, to audit the Final Recap Statement. If Buyer
disagrees with the Final Recap Statement, Buyer and Seller
shall use best efforts to reach agreement within thirty (30)
days following Buyer's audit of the Final Recap Statement.

(ii) Should the Parties be unable to resolve any
disagreements, such disagreement shall, at the earliest
practicable date, be referred, by either or both of the
Parties, to Arthur Andersen & Co. (the "Accounting Firm"),
along with all audit reports, work papers, schedules and
calculations related to the matter in dispute. Within
twenty-five (25) days after such submission, the Accounting
Firm shall issue a letter report determining the Final Recap,
which shall be final and binding. Any fees and expenses
incurred in resolving disputes shall be borne equally by the
Parties.

(iii) Payment of any amounts owed under the Final
Recap is due thirty (30) days from the date Seller and Buyer
agree on the Final Recap Statement, or ten (10) days from the
determination of the Final Recap by the Accounting Firm,
whichever is later. Interest will be applied at the Agreed
Rate to any amounts if not paid when due.

(iv) On or before two (2) years after the Closing
Date, each of Seller and Buyer may give notice that it intends
to audit the other Party's books, accounts and records
relating to production proceeds, capital costs, Taxes,
expenses and Burdens relating to this transaction and may
thereafter promptly conduct such audit. Such audit shall be
conducted, at the auditing Party's own expense and by
appointment only, and shall be conducted promptly so as to
cause a minimum of inconvenience to the audited Party. Based
on such audit, a Party may claim further adjustments to the
Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.3, or payments of any
other monetary obligation provided in the Agreement. The
Parties shall use their best efforts to reach agreement on
such adjustments or payments within thirty (30) days following
the audit giving rise to the claims. If the Parties cannot
reach agreement within such time period, the matters shall be
handled in the same manner as disagreements regarding the
Final Recap as provided in Sections 4.3(m)(ii) and (iii).

(v) Following the Closing, Seller and Buyer
shall settle the adjustments to the Purchase Price on an
interim basis in accordance with the Transition Agreement.
Following termination of the Services under the Transition
Agreement, (A) revenue received by either Party that belongs
to the other Party shall be remitted to the other Party at
least monthly, and (B) invoices received by a Party that are
the obligation of the other Party shall be forwarded to the
other Party within ten (10) days of receipt of the invoice.

27
<PAGE> 36
(n) Further Assurances. Each Party shall, from time to
time at the request of the other, and without further consideration,
execute and deliver such other instruments of sale, transfer,
conveyance, assignment, clarification and termination and take such
other action as the Party making the request may require to effectuate
the intentions of the Parties, including those required to sell,
transfer, convey and assign to, and vest in Buyer, and to place Buyer
in possession of the Assets and to transfer, assign or convey the
excluded assets to Seller. Seller intends to convey the Assets at
Closing; however, in the event it is determined after Closing that: (i)
any part of the Assets was not in fact conveyed to Buyer, and that the
title to any part of the Assets is incorrectly in the name of Seller;
(ii) any excluded asset is conveyed to Buyer and that the title to such
excluded asset is incorrectly in the name of Buyer; then each Party
shall take all such action necessary to correctly convey any part of
Assets to Buyer, or any part of the excluded assets to Seller.

(o) Files Transfer. Seller shall deliver the originals
of all the files and records described in item (g) set forth in the
definition of Other Property except where such original files also
relate to a property retained by Seller, in which case Seller shall
deliver copies of such files and shall provide Buyer with access to the
original files as reasonably requested by Buyer (but Buyer shall always
receive the originals of well logs for the wells completed or attempted
to be completed within depths included within the Assets). In the
event Seller has delivered originals of files to Buyer, Seller shall
have the right to make copies of all originals. If Seller abandons or
transfers its retained property prior to seven (7) years following
Closing it shall provide Buyer a reasonable opportunity to receive any
retained original files. Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to
transfer relevant well files in Seller's inactive storage as soon as
practicable following Closing, but Seller shall not be liable if it
fails to identify such files after exercising its reasonable efforts,
or if such files are inadvertently destroyed prior to such transfer.
The handling of such files and records subsequent to Closing is
addressed in the Transition Agreement. Seller and Buyer shall be
equally responsible for the cost of copying these materials. Buyer
shall designate the method of shipment and the carrier far enough in
advance to allow for timely shipment and will be solely responsible for
the cost and expense of shipment and for any losses occurring as a
result of such shipment. BUYER SHALL ACCEPT ALL INTERPRETIVE DATA
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OR REPRESENTATION REGARDING ACCURACY OR
CORRECTNESS THEREOF. Notwithstanding the provisions of item (g) of the
definition of Other Property regarding legal files and files subject to
attorney-client privilege, if such documents are pertinent to Assumed
Liabilities or future obligations on the Assets, Seller will waive
privilege and provide such documents unless it reasonably believes such
waiver is likely to cause material adverse consequences to Seller.
Seller shall also use its reasonable efforts to obtain waivers of any
Third Person restrictions on the transfer of any files or information.

(p) Gas Balancing.

(i) Within ninety (90) days following the
Closing for Properties operated by Seller, and as soon as
possible after the receipt of statements from the operators of
Properties not operated by Seller, Seller shall provide to
Buyer detailed gas balancing statements on a
Property-by-Property basis (other than for Properties excluded
from the Assets or conveyed on account of the exercise of

28
<PAGE> 37
preferential purchase rights), in accordance with COPAS for all
owners as to Seller-operated Properties (other than properties
owned solely by Seller) and in accordance with generally
accepted accounting procedures for Seller's interest as
prepared by the operator as to all other Properties, showing in
each case the gas balances in such Properties as of the
Effective Date. Buyer shall have until two (2) years following
Closing to audit and reconcile gas balances with respect to
such Properties and object to gas balances whether or not shown
on the statements provided by Seller. Promptly following
agreement by Seller and Buyer of the net gas imbalance as of
the Effective Date, Seller shall pay to Buyer if there is a net
overproduction balance, or Buyer shall pay to Seller if there
is a net underproduction balance, $1.00 per Mcf of the
imbalance. The payment shall be made only with respect to the
net volume of the imbalance after deduction of volumes
attributable to unpaid Burdens. If there is a dispute as to
the volume of imbalance, the foregoing adjustment payment shall
be made as promptly as possible to the undisputed imbalance
volume, and the remainder of the adjustment payment shall be
made upon settlement of the dispute. Either Party may commence
dispute resolution in accordance with Section 10.14 when it
reasonably appears a dispute exists with regard to the matters
covered by this Section 4.3(p).

(ii) Notwithstanding the payment adjustment to be
made pursuant to Section 4.3(p)(i), Seller shall have the
obligation to pay any cash gas balancing settlements to Third
Persons, attributable to periods on or before the Effective
Date which (A) arise by virtue of the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement, (B) are related to Properties
included within the Assets that had permanently ceased
production prior to the Effective Date, or (C) are required
pursuant to any other cash gas balancing obligation due as of
the Effective Date. To the extent Seller pays any such cash
gas balancing amounts, Seller's gas balance as of the
Effective Date shall be adjusted for all volumes for which
cash payments are made.

(q) Plugging and Abandonment. Seller shall retain
liability for Plugging and Abandonment obligations for specified wells
included within the Assets with respect to which, as of the Effective
Date, an order has been issued by the Governmental Body having
jurisdiction requiring the well to be Plugged and Abandoned within a
time certain. Seller shall perform such Plugging and Abandonment
operations upon the request of Buyer or shall reimburse Buyer for all
reasonable costs of Plugging and Abandonment if Buyer or the operator
plugs and abandons such wells. Seller shall retain liability for
properly replugging any wells located on the Assets where the well was
improperly Plugged and Abandoned on or before the Effective Date under
Laws in effect at the time of such Plugging and Abandonment, and Seller
shall perform such replugging at the request of Buyer, or shall
reimburse Buyer for all costs of replugging and abandonment if Buyer or
the operator replugs such well. Upon Closing, Buyer shall assume all
of Seller's other Plugging and Abandonment obligations associated with
the Assets as of the Effective Date and shall conduct such Plugging and
Abandonment operations in compliance with applicable Laws and in a good
and workmanlike manner.

29
<PAGE> 38
(r) Joint Use Facilities. Facilities, whether Included
Facilities or Excluded Facilities, that have been used both in
connection with the Assets and properties retained by Seller (a "Joint
Use Facility") shall, subject to rights of Third Persons existing as of
the date of the Agreement, be made subject to joint use agreements
appropriate for the different Joint Use Facilities to be entered into
between Seller and Buyer providing for the sharing of such Joint Use
Facilities in accordance with the following general terms:

(i) direct expenses shall be allocated in
accordance with usage;

(ii) usage shall be apportioned in accordance
with historical use for servicing the respective Assets or
retained properties of Seller;

(iii) if the owner of a Joint Use Facility intends
to expand or replace such Facility, it shall offer the other
Party hereto the right to participate in such expansion or
replacement on a direct cost-sharing basis and on the basis of
the same percentages that the original Joint Use Facility was
shared;

(iv) if the owner of a Joint Use Facility intends
to abandon the Joint Use Facility, it shall first give the
other Party the opportunity to assume the ownership thereof
along with the obligations in connection therewith; and

(v) if the owner of a Joint Use Facility intends
to sell such Joint Use Facility, the transferor shall cause
the transferee to be made subject to the applicable joint use
agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Facilities shall not be shared if such
sharing cannot be accomplished on reasonable commercial terms.

(s) Easements. If any Easements are used as of the date
of the Agreement for operations of Seller or its Affiliates, Seller
shall convey co-tenancy in such Easements, if possible, or shall convey
such other license or co-use rights as will ensure Buyer's use of such
Easements in the same manner after the date of the Agreement as it was
used by Seller prior to the date of the Agreement.

furnish Seller with written notices of alleged Title Defects ("Title Defect
Notice(s)"), stating with reasonable specificity the Property

41
<PAGE> 50
affected, the particular Title Defect claimed, and Buyer's good faith estimate
of the amount the Title Defect reduces the Allocated Value of the affected
Property ("Defect Value"). After January 1, 1997, Buyer shall conclusively be
deemed to have waived any Title Defects not asserted by a Title Defect Notice.
For all Title Defects asserted in Title Defect Notices, Seller shall have the
option of (a) curing the Title Defect, (b) contesting the Title Defect or
Buyer's good faith estimate of the Defect Value, or (c) paying Buyer's good
faith estimate of the Defect Value, subject to the conditions of Section 7.5
("Title Indemnity Payment").

Section 7.3 Seller's Right to Cure. If Seller elects to cure a
Title Defect, then Seller shall so notify Buyer in writing within thirty (30)
days after receipt of the particular Title Defect Notice ("Cure Notice").
Within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Title Defect Notice, Seller shall
either cure the Title Defect to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer ("Cure")
or if Seller is unable to Cure such Title Defect, make a Title Indemnity
Payment for such Title Defect equal to Buyer's good faith estimate of the
Defect Value set forth in the Title Defect Notice. If any Title Defects are
Cured or if Buyer waives any Title Defect, Seller shall have no further
liability to Buyer for Purchase Price adjustments with respect thereto.

Section 7.4 Contested Title Defects. If Seller contests the
existence of a Title Defect or Buyer's good faith estimate of the Defect Value,
then Seller shall so notify Buyer in writing within thirty (30) days after
Seller's receipt of the Title Defect Notice ("Rejection Notice"). The
Rejection Notice shall state with reasonable specificity the basis of Seller's
rejection of the Title Defect or Buyer's good faith estimate of the Defect
Value. Within thirty (30) days of Buyer's receipt of the Rejection Notice,
representatives of Buyer and Seller, knowledgeable in title matters, shall meet
and, within sixty (60) days after Buyer's receipt of such Rejection Notice,
either (i) agree to mutually reject the particular Title Defect in which case
Buyer shall waive the Title Defect, or (ii) agree on the validity of such Title
Defect and the Defect Value, in which case Seller shall have sixty (60) days
after the date of such agreement within which to Cure such Title Defect and
failing such Cure, to make the Title Indemnity Payment therefor. If the
Parties cannot agree on either options (i) or (ii) in the preceding sentence,
the Title Defect or the Defect Value subject to the Rejection Notice shall be
submitted to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
10.14. If Seller fails to timely deliver a Rejection Notice or a Cure Notice,
Seller shall be deemed to have accepted the validity of the Title Defect and
Buyer's good faith estimate of the Defect Value, and shall pay Buyer a Title
Indemnity Payment for the Title Defect equal to the Defect Value within sixty
(60) days of Seller's receipt of the applicable Title Defect Notice.

Section 7.5 Title Indemnity Payments. Title Indemnity Payments
shall be made by Seller to Buyer as an adjustment to the Purchase Price at
Closing if then determined, or if not determined as of the Closing, thereafter,
consistent with the time frames set forth in Sections 7.3 and 7.4. The amount
of the Title Indemnity Payment for a particular Defect shall be paid regardless
of the amount of the Defect Value if the Defect Value is liquidated or certain
in amount (such as the amount necessary to release a lien, or a proportional
change to the Allocated Value of a Property resulting from a change in the Net
Revenue Interest of the Property), otherwise Seller is obligated to make a
Title Indemnity Payment only if the aggregate Defect Value of all Title Defects
with respect to a Property exceed a threshold (not a deductible) of Ten
Thousand Dollars ($10,000). If a Defect Value is not liquidated or certain in
amount, the Defect Value shall be the amount necessary to compensate Buyer for
the adverse economic effect on

42
<PAGE> 51
the Property, taking into account all relevant factors, including without
limitation, the Property's Allocated Value, the time value of money, the
practical and legal effect of the Title Defect, and the amount of reduction in
Net Revenue Interest and/or increase in the Working Interest of the affected
Property. The aggregated Defect Value on any Property shall never exceed the
Allocated Value of such Property.

Section 7.6 Interest Additions. If Seller discovers an Interest
Addition to which Seller has Defensible Title, then Seller shall, from time to
time and without limitation, have the right to give Buyer written notice of
such interest additions ("Interest Addition Notice"), as soon as practicable
but on or before January 1, 1997, stating with reasonable specificity the
Property affected, the particular Interest Addition claimed, and Seller's good
faith estimate of the amount the Interest Addition increases the Allocated
Value of the affected Property ("Interest Addition Value"). After January 1,
1997, Seller shall conclusively be deemed to have waived any Interest Additions
not asserted by an Interest Addition Notice. If Buyer agrees with the
existence of an Interest Addition and Seller's good faith estimate of the
Interest Addition Value, then the Interest Addition Value shall be applied as
an offset to any Title Indemnity Payment required of Seller ("Offset"). If
Buyer contests the existence of an Interest Addition or Seller's good faith
estimate of the Interest Addition Value, then Buyer shall so notify Seller in
writing within thirty (30) days after Buyer's receipt of the Interest Addition
Notice ("Interest Addition Rejection Notice"). The Interest Addition Rejection
Notice shall state with reasonable specificity the basis of Buyer's rejection
of the Interest Addition or Buyer's good faith estimate of the Interest
Addition Value. Within thirty (30) days of Seller's receipt of the Interest
Addition Rejection Notice, representatives of Buyer and Seller, knowledgeable
in title matters, shall meet and, within sixty (60) days after Seller's receipt
of such Interest Addition Rejection Notice, either (a) agree to mutually reject
the particular Interest Addition in which case Seller shall waive the Interest
Addition, or (b) agree on validity of such Interest Addition and the Interest
Addition Value, in which case Seller shall be entitled to an Offset. If the
Parties cannot agree on either options (a) or (b) in the preceding sentence,
the Interest Addition subject to the Interest Addition Rejection Notice shall
be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Section 10.14. If Buyer fails to timely deliver an Interest Addition Rejection
Notice, Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted the validity of the Interest
Addition and Seller's good faith estimate of the Interest Addition Value, and
Seller shall be entitled to an Offset. Buyer shall have no obligation
whatsoever to notify Seller of any Interest Additions.

Section 7.7 Reconveyance. If Seller makes a Title Indemnity
Payment for one hundred percent (100%) of the Allocated Value allocable to a
Property or portion thereof, Buyer shall, at Seller's sole option to be
exercised no later than sixty (60) days after such payment, reconvey to Seller
the Property or portion of the Property with respect to which the Title
Indemnity Payment is made (effective as of the Effective Date).

from and against all Losses based upon, arising out of, in connection
with, or relating to:

(i) any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of Seller contained in the Agreement;

(ii) any matter arising in connection with the
ownership or operation of or production of Hydrocarbons from

the Closing in connection with preferential purchase rights on
the Assets.

(b) Buyer. Except with respect to Taxes (which are
covered in Part 5), and Environmental Matters (to the extent covered by
Part 6 as set forth in Section 6.11), Buyer shall indemnify, defend and
hold harmless Seller from and against all Losses based upon, arising
out of, in connection with, or relating to:

(i) any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in the Agreement;

(ii) if the Closing occurs, any matter arising in
connection with the ownership or operation of or production of
Hydrocarbons from the Assets from and after the Effective
Date;

(iii) Buyer's inspection of the Assets as set

44
<PAGE> 53
(vi) the Assumed Liabilities.

Section 8.2 Method of Asserting Claims, Etc. Except for claims
under Part 6 for reimbursement for Remediation and under Part 5 or Part 7, all
claims for indemnification under the Agreement shall be asserted and resolved
as follows provided that the provisions of Sections 8.2 through 8.4 shall be
covenants and not conditions to the defense and indemnity obligations to which
they apply:

(a) Third Person Claims. In the event that any claim for
which a Party providing indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party")
would be liable to a Party or any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents or representatives entitled to indemnification
hereunder (the "Indemnified Party") is asserted against or sought to be
collected by a Third Person, the Indemnified Party shall promptly
notify the Indemnifying Party of such claim, specifying the nature of
such claim and the amount or the estimated amount thereof to the extent
then feasible (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final
amount of such claim) (the "Claim Notice"). The Indemnifying Party
shall have thirty (30) days from its receipt of the Claim Notice (the
"Notice Period") to notify the Indemnified Party (i) whether or not it
disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder with respect
to such claim, and (ii) if it does not dispute such liability, whether
or not it desires, at its sole cost and expense, to defend the
Indemnified Party against such claim; provided, however, that the
Indemnified Party is hereby authorized prior to and during the Notice
Period to file any motion, answer or other pleading, submission or
document which it shall deem necessary or appropriate to protect its
interests. In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it does not dispute
such liability and desires to defend against such claim or demand,
then, except as hereinafter provided, the Indemnifying Party shall have
the right to defend such claim or demand by appropriate proceedings,
which proceedings shall be promptly settled or prosecuted to a final
conclusion, in such a manner as to avoid any risk of the Indemnified
Party becoming subject to liability. If the Indemnified Party desires
to participate in, but not control, any such defense or settlement, it
may do so at its own cost and expense. If the Indemnifying Party
disputes its liability with respect to such claim, or elects not to
defend against such claim, whether by not giving timely notice as
provided above or otherwise, the Indemnified Party shall have the right
but not the obligation to defend against such claim, and the amount of
any such claim, or if the same be contested by the Indemnifying Party
or by the Indemnified Party, then that portion thereof as to which such
defense is unsuccessful, shall be conclusively deemed to be a liability
of the Indemnifying Party hereunder (subject, if it has timely disputed
liability, to a determination in accordance with Section 8.4 that the
disputed liability is covered by this Part 8.)

(b) Other Claims. In the event that the Indemnified
Party shall have a claim against the Indemnifying Party hereunder which
does not involve a claim or demand being asserted against or sought to
be collected from it by a Third Person, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly send a Claim Notice with respect to such claim to the
Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the
Indemnified Party within the Notice Period that it disputes such claim,
the amount of such claim shall be conclusively deemed a liability of
the Indemnifying Party hereunder.

45
<PAGE> 54
Section 8.3 Payment. Payments under Part 6 in regard to Third
Person claims, under this Part 8 and under any other indemnity provision of the
Agreement other than Parts 5 or 7 shall be made as follows:

(a) Payment of Undisputed Amount. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party is required to make any payment under Part 6 or this
Part 8, the Indemnifying Party shall promptly pay the Indemnified Party
the amount so determined. If there should be a dispute as to the
amount or manner of determination of any indemnity obligation owed
under Part 6 or this Part 8, the Indemnifying Party shall nevertheless
pay when due such portion, if any, of the obligation as shall not be
subject to dispute. The difference, if any, between the amount of the
obligation ultimately determined as properly payable under Part 6 or
this Part 8 and the portion, if any theretofore paid, shall bear
interest at the Agreed Rate as provided in Section 8.3(b). Upon the
payment in full of any claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated to the rights of the Indemnified Party against any Person or
other entity with respect to the subject matter of such claim.

(b) Interest. If all or part of any indemnification
obligation under the Agreement is not paid when due upon resolution of
the claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall pay on demand to the
Indemnified Party interest at the Agreed Rate on the unpaid amount of
the obligation for each day from the date the amount became due until
payment in full.

Section 8.4 Disputed Claims. If the Indemnifying Party shall
notify the Indemnified Party during the Notice Period that it disputes any
claim under Section 8.2 (the "Disputed Claim"), the Disputed Claim shall be
subject to the dispute resolution procedures pursuant to Section 10.14.

Section 8.5 Applicability of Part 8. This Part 8 does not apply
to Title matters (which are governed by Part 7) or Tax matters (which are
covered by Part 5). This Part 8 applies to certain Environmental Matters in
the manner expressly provided in Parts 6 and 8.

Agreement.

Section 10.7 Confidentiality. With respect to confidentiality:

(a) Confidentiality Agreement. Upon the execution of the
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate, and Sections
10.7(b) and (c) shall govern. Notwithstanding the Confidentiality

provide Buyer with prompt notice thereof so that Buyer may seek a
protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with
the provisions of this Section 10.7(b). In the event that such
protective order or other remedy is not obtained or Buyer waives

Confidential Information to furnish only that portion of the Buyer
Confidential Information that Seller or Seller's representative is

and (c) shall terminate three (3) years after the Closing Date.

Section 10.8 Entire Agreement and Construction. The Agreement
contains the entire agreement between the Parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby and all prior understandings and agreements
shall merge herein. There are no additional terms, whether consistent or
inconsistent, oral or written, which are intended to be part of the Parties'
understandings which have not been incorporated into the Agreement and the
Schedules and Exhibits. The Parties agree that they have jointly participated
in the drafting and preparation of the Agreement and the Subsidiary Agreements
and that the language of the Agreement shall be construed as a whole according
to its fair meaning and not strictly for or against any of the Parties hereto.

Section 10.9 Expenses. Except as otherwise expressly provided

Section 10.10 Waivers and Amendments. All amendments and other
modifications hereof shall be in writing and signed by each of the Parties.
Either Party may by written instrument (i) waive any inaccuracies in any of the
representations or warranties made to it by any other Party contained in the
Agreement or in any instruments and documents delivered to it pursuant to the
Agreement, or (ii) waive compliance or performance by the other Party with or
of any of the covenants or agreements made to it by the other Party contained
in the Agreement. The delay or failure on the part of a Party hereto to
insist, in any one instance or more, upon strict performance of any of the
terms or conditions of the Agreement, or to exercise any right or privilege
herein conferred shall not be construed as a waiver or any such terms,
conditions, rights or privileges but the same shall continue and remain in full
force and effect. All rights and remedies are cumulative. The waiver of a
condition to Closing by a Party regarding a warranty, representation or
covenant shall not constitute a waiver of a breach of such warranty,
representation or covenant; provided, however, that the Parties shall attempt
in good faith to agree prior to Closing upon the resolution of a breach of a
representation or warranty that arises after the date of the Agreement which
could result in liability to the breaching Party and of which the other Party
has actual Knowledge, and if the Parties cannot agree upon a resolution, the
breach shall be deemed waived if the Closing occurs.

Section 10.11 Survival of Warranties, Representations and
Covenants. All representations and warranties contained in the Agreement shall
survive the Closing and continue with respect to claims made on or before two
(2) years following the Closing Date. The covenants, indemnities and
agreements contained in the Agreement shall survive the Closing and continue in
accordance with their respective terms.

Section 10.12 Section Headings. The section headings in the
Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to
alter or affect the interpretation of any provision thereof.

Section 10.13 Termination.

(a) The Agreement may be terminated (i) by mutual written
consent of the Parties at any time prior to the Closing; (ii) by Buyer
by notice to Seller given on or before the Closing Date, if Buyer shall
discover any material fact or condition existing on the date of such
termination which is at variance with any of the representations and
warranties of Seller contained in the Agreement; or (iii) by Seller or
Buyer if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before March 31,
1995, other than through the fault of the terminating Party. Upon any
termination the Parties shall have no further obligations under the
Agreement; provided, however, Buyer shall hold all information which it
has obtained during the transaction contemplated hereby, subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, and the provisions of Sections 10.3, 10.5,
10.6, 10.7, 10.8, 10.9, 10.10, 10.12 and 10.13 shall remain in full
force and effect.

(b) If Seller elects to terminate the Agreement pursuant
to Section 10.13(a)(iii) and the Closing has not occurred solely by
reason of Buyer's failure to proceed under the terms of the Agreement
after satisfaction of all the conditions precedent to Buyer's
obligation to close as set forth in Section 9.1 then Seller shall
retain the Deposit and all interest thereon.

54
<PAGE> 63
(c) If the Agreement is terminated for any reason other
than the failure of Buyer to close under the circumstances set forth in
Section 10.13(b), Seller shall return the Deposit to Buyer within three
(3) Business Days following such termination with interest thereon at
the Agreed Rate from the date of the Agreement until the earlier of
March 1, 1995 or the date of return to Buyer.

Section 10.14 Dispute Resolution. The provisions of Schedule 10.14
(which address dispute resolution) shall apply to disputes between the Parties.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Parties hereto have entered into the Agreement
as of the date first herein above written.
