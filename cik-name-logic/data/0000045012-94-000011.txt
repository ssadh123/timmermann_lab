HALLIBURTON 1994 FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS

DALLAS, Texas -- Halliburton Company today reported 1994
first quarter net income of $17.8 million, or $.16 per share,
compared to net income of $18.8 million, or $.18 per share, for
the 1993 first quarter. The 1994 results reflect lower earnings
by the Company's Energy Services business segment that continues
to be challenged by difficult worldwide petroleum industry market
conditions.

The Energy Services business segment's 1994 first quarter
revenues were $599.0 million, 13 percent lower than the $689.8
million generated in the 1993 first quarter. The 1993 first
quarter included $104.8 million of revenues from the geophysical
business that was sold at the beginning of 1994. The 1994 first
quarter was aided by revenues of the directional drilling systems
business which was acquired at the beginning of the 1993 second
quarter. On a comparable basis, net of the geophysical and
directional drilling businesses, 1994 first quarter revenues
declined by about 4 percent.

Energy Services' operating income was $33.5 million in the
1994 first quarter, a decline of 14 percent from the year earlier
period. Lower profitability in the 1994 first quarter was
largely influenced by about one-third fewer natural gas well
completions in the U.S. compared to the 1993 first quarter.
Also, reduced business activity in the North Sea and delays in
projects in the Middle East and Africa constricted results.

The Engineering and Construction business segment's 1994
first quarter revenues were $716.2 million, 10 percent lower than
the prior year quarter. Operating income was $14.5 million in
the 1994 first quarter, an increase of 14 percent compared to the
1993 quarter. The 1994 results benefitted from a $5.0 million
gain on the sale of a subsidiary. Total backlogs were $4.2
billion at March 31, 1994 compared to $4.5 billion one year
earlier.

The Insurance Services business segment reported a $2.1
million operating loss during the 1994 first quarter, compared to
a $2.5 million loss a year ago. The 1994 first quarter includes
$3.5 million of losses from the California earthquake.

Thomas H. Cruikshank, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer, stated, "As we experience continued low levels
of activity worldwide occasioned by the lowest oil prices in over
20 years in real terms, we are taking further actions to reduce
our cost structure and improve financial performance. Company-
wide second quarter 1994 reductions in personnel of over 1,200
will benefit the last half of the year. Any benefits in the
second quarter will be offset by the severance costs. The Energy
Services business is also implementing price increases on
selected products and services in the U.S. during the 1994 second
quarter.

There are some signs of strengthening crude oil prices, but
the continued concern about Iraq's reentry into world oil markets
may keep prices dampened. Consequently, we have a number of
other programs underway to improve our efficiencies and to lower
costs further. In the meantime, we are concentrating on ways to
grow in our ever changing market place. Our concentration will
be on creating shareholder value regardless of market
conditions."

diversified energy services, engineering, maintenance, and
construction companies. Founded in 1919, Halliburton provides a
