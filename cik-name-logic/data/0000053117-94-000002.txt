CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)

(a) Other income for 1993 includes $14.3 million of interest income on
refunds resulting from the favorable settlement of certain prior years'
income tax returns, partially offset by a $2.1 million charge for the
write-off of preferred stock received in a prior divestiture (on a
combined basis, $7.4 million after taxes, or $.09 per share).

(b) On August 10, 1993, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993
(the "Budget Reconciliation Act") was enacted. The Budget
Reconciliation Act provided for an increase in the corporate income tax
rate from 34% to 35%, retroactive to January 1, 1993. Total income tax
expense for the year ended December 26, 1993 includes a charge of
approximately $11.0 million, or $.13 per share, to increase the deferred
tax liability as of the beginning of the year for the effect of this 1%
increase in tax rates.

(c) During the first quarter of 1992, James River accrued approximately
$13 million of pretax charges ($8.7 million net of tax benefits, or $.11
per share) for the refinement of estimates of final restructuring costs
and environmental and litigation costs. During the fourth quarter of
1992, the Company accrued approximately $18 million of pretax charges
($11 million net of tax benefits, or $.14 per share) including accruals
for landfill closure costs and certain environmental liabilities
associated with divested operations.

(d) During the fourth quarter of 1992, the Company recorded a pretax
charge of $111.7 million ($71.4 million net of tax benefits, or $.87 per
share) to cover costs associated with a productivity enhancement
program. This program includes the disposal and consolidation of
certain operations within each of the Company's three businesses,
organizational streamlining, and other cost reduction programs.

(e) During the fourth quarter of 1992, James River incurred an
extraordinary loss of $50.6 million ($31.4 million net of tax benefits,
or $.38 per share) on the early retirement of $566.8 million principal
amount of notes and debentures.

(f) During the first quarter of 1992, James River adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes"
("SFAS 109"), which requires the adoption of the liability method of
accounting for income taxes. In connection with the adoption of SFAS
109, the Company recorded a credit of $35.9 million, or $.44 per share.

(g) During the fourth quarter of 1992, James River adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" ("SFAS 106"), retroactive
to the first day of 1992. SFAS 106 requires the accrual of the cost of
providing postretirement benefits during the years that employees render
service. The Company elected immediate recognition of the full amount
of the transition liability by recording a one-time, non-cash charge of
$499.3 million ($309.8 million net of tax benefits, or $3.79 per share).<PAGE>
