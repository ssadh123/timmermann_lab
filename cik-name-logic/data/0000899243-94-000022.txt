ANR PIPELINE COMPANY

UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT

February 14, 1994

Citicorp Securities, Inc.
399 Park Avenue,
New York, New York 10043

Dear Sirs:

ANR Pipeline Company, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), proposes to
issue and sell from time to time certain of its senior unsecured debt
securities referred to below (the "Securities") registered under the
registration statement referred to below. The Securities will be issued under
an Indenture, as amended from time to time (the "Indenture"), to be dated as of
February 15, 1994, between the Company and Comerica Bank, Trustee, and will
have varying designations, interest rates and times of payment of any interest,
maturities, redemption provisions, currencies and other terms, with all such
terms for any particular series of the Securities being determined at the time
of the sale. Particular series of the Securities may be sold to you, and to
other firms on whose behalf you may act, for resale in accordance with the
terms of offering determined at the time of sale. The Securities involved in
any such offering are hereinafter referred to as the "Purchased Securities,"
and the firm or firms which agree to purchase the same are hereinafter referred
to as the "Underwriters" of such Purchased Securities and the representative or
representatives of the Underwriters, if any, specified in a "Terms Agreement"
are hereinafter referred to as the "Representatives"; provided, however, that
if the Terms Agreement does not specify any representative of the Underwriters,
the term "Representatives" as used in this Agreement shall mean the
Underwriters. The terms and conditions herein shall constitute a separate
agreement between the Company and the respective Underwriters in regard to each
offering of Purchased Securities.

This Agreement shall not limit or affect the right of the Company to offer or
sell any of the Securities through any other underwriters or agents or through
any other arrangements specified by the Company from time to time, and this
Agreement shall apply only to Securities in respect of which a Terms Agreement
shall have been executed as referred to herein.

This is to confirm the agreement concerning the purchase of the Securities
from the Company by the Underwriters.

1. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The Company represents and warrants to,
and agrees with each Underwriter that:

(a) A registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 33-50375), prepared by
the Company in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
(collectively, the "Securities Act"), has been filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") and has become effective for the
registration under the Securities Act of the Securities. Copies of such
registration statement and any amendments thereto, and all forms of the
related prospectuses contained therein have been delivered to each
Underwriter. Such registration statement, including the documents
incorporated by reference therein and all financial schedules and exhibits
thereto, as amended at the date of any Terms Agreement, is herein referred
to as the "Registration Statement". As used in this Agreement, the term
"Prospectus" means such prospectus included in the Registration Statement,
supplemented by a Prospectus Supplement as contemplated by Section 2
hereof, to reflect the terms of the Purchased Securities and the plan of
distribution thereof. Any reference herein to the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents
incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-3 under the
Securities Act, as of the date of the Prospectus, and any reference herein
to the terms "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with respect to any
Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed with
the Commission after such date under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as

1
<PAGE>

amended, and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated
thereunder (collectively, the "Exchange Act"), and so incorporated by
reference (all such incorporated documents being herein called the
"Incorporated Documents").

(b) As of the date of any Terms Agreement, when the Prospectus is first
filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act and when, prior to
the Closing Date (as defined in Section 2 hereof), any amendment to the
Registration Statement becomes effective (including the filing of any
document incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement) and at
the Closing Date, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as amended
or supplemented, shall comply in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission
thereunder (collectively, the "Trust Indenture Act"). No such document
shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, except that the foregoing shall not
apply to statements in or omissions from any such document in reliance upon
and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any
Underwriter specifically for use in the preparation thereof or to the part
of the Registration Statement which constitutes the Statement of
Eligibility of the Trustee under the Trust Indenture Act on Form T-1 (the
"Form T-1"), except statements or omissions in the Form T-1 made in reliance
on information furnished in writing to the Trustee by or on behalf of the
Company for use in preparation thereof. There is no contract or document
required to be described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or
required to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement that is
not described or filed as required.

(c) Deloitte & Touche, whose report is incorporated by reference in the
Prospectus, are independent certified public accountants as required by the
Securities Act. The financial statements and schedules (including the
related notes) included or incorporated by reference in the Registration
Statement and the Prospectus, present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial condition, the results of operations and cash flows of the
entities purported to be shown thereby at the dates and for the periods
indicated and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles.

(d) The Incorporated Documents, when they became effective or were filed
with the Commission, as the case may be, complied in all material respects
with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
applicable, and any documents so filed and incorporated by reference
subsequent to the date of the Prospectus shall, when they are filed with
the Commission, conform in all material respects to the requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as applicable.

(e) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been duly organized and
is validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its incorporation, with full power and authority (corporate
and other) to own or lease its properties and conduct its business as
described in the Prospectus, and is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction in which the character of the business
conducted by it or the location of the properties owned or leased by it
makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to so qualify
would not have a material adverse effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

(f) All of the outstanding shares of voting stock of each Subsidiary of
the Company have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid
and nonassessable and are owned directly or indirectly by the Company, free
and clear of any claim, lien, encumbrance or security interest.

(g) Except as described in or contemplated by the Prospectus, there has
not been any material adverse change in, or any adverse development which
materially affects, the condition (financial or other), results of
operation, business, prospects, net worth or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, from the date as of which information is
given in the Prospectus.

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is, nor with the
giving of notice or lapse of time or both would be, in violation of or in
default under, nor will the execution or delivery hereof or consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby result in a violation of, or
constitute a default

2
<PAGE>

under, the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or other governing
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any agreement,
indenture or other instrument to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound, or to which any
of their properties is subject where the effect of such violation or
default would have a material adverse effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the applicable Terms Agreement, the Indenture and any Delayed
Delivery Contract (as defined in Section 2(c) hereof), the authorization,
issuance and sale of the Purchased Securities, the fulfillment of this
Agreement, the applicable Terms Agreement, the Indenture, the Purchased
Securities and any Delayed Delivery Contract and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by each such agreement will not conflict with or
constitute a breach of, or default (with the passage of time or otherwise)
under, or result in the imposition of a lien on any properties of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or an acceleration of indebtedness pursuant to,
the certificate of incorporation or by-laws, or other governing documents
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any bond, debenture, note or
any other evidence of indebtedness or any indenture, mortgage, deed or
trust or any other material agreement or instrument to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of them is bound
or to which any of the property or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is subject, or any law, administrative regulation or order of
any court or governmental agency or authority applicable to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. Except for the orders of the Commission declaring
the Registration Statement effective under the Securities Act and
qualifying the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, and permits and
similar authorizations required under the securities or Blue Sky laws of
certain jurisdictions, no consent, approval, authorization or order of any
court, governmental agency or body or financial institution is required in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the applicable Terms Agreement.

(i) This Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement have been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and each constitutes the
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company.

(j) The Purchased Securities have been duly authorized and when executed,
authenticated and delivered in accordance with the terms of the Indenture
will be legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company enforceable in
accordance with their terms, except that (i) the enforceability thereof may
be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights
generally, (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other
forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the
discretion of the court before which any proceedings therefor may be
brought and (iii) the waiver as to usury may be unenforceable. The
Purchased Securities will be entitled to the benefits of the Indenture, and
will conform in all material respects to the description thereof in the
Prospectus.

(k) The Indenture has been duly authorized and when executed and
delivered by the Company will be the legal, valid and binding agreement of
the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms, except that (i) the
enforceability thereof may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect
relating to creditors' rights generally, (ii) the remedy of specific
performance and injunctive and other forms of equitable relief may be
subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion of the court before
which any proceedings therefor may be brought and (iii) the waiver as to
usury may be unenforceable. The Indenture conforms in all material respects
to its description in the Prospectus.

(l) The Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, have been duly authorized and
when executed and delivered by the Company will be the legal, valid and
binding agreements of the Company enforceable in accordance with their
terms, except that (i) the enforceability thereof may be subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights generally and (ii)
the remedy of specific performance and injunctive and other forms of
equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to the discretion
of the court before which any proceedings therefor may be brought.

(m) Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is given
in the Registration Statement and Prospectus and prior to the Closing Date,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or will have
incurred any liabilities or obligations for borrowed money, direct or
contingent, or entered into any transactions, not in the ordinary course of
business and material to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, and there has not been and will not have been any
material change in the capital stock or long-term indebtedness of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any material adverse change in the
business, prospects, financial position, net worth or assets or results of
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

(n) The Company and its Subsidiaries have such interests in their
respective real (including leasehold interests) and personal properties
that they reasonably believe are necessary, in the aggregate, to use such
properties in the manner presently used or proposed to be used by the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

(o) Except as described in the Prospectus, there is no litigation or
governmental proceeding to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party or to which any property of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
is subject or which is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
contemplated against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which might
result in any material adverse change in the condition (financial or
other), results of operations, business, prospects, net worth or assets of
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

(p) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is in violation of any law,
ordinance, governmental rule or regulation or court decree to which it may
be subject which violation might have a material adverse effect on the
condition (financial or other), results of operations, business, prospects,
net worth or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

(q) The conditions for use of Form S-3, set forth in the General
Instructions thereto, have been satisfied.

2. PURCHASE AND OFFERING.

(a) The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase the Purchased
Securities will be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic or other written
communications substantially in the form attached as Exhibit A hereto (a
"Terms Agreement") at each time the Company determines to sell Purchased
Securities, with such other provisions which the Representatives and the
Company shall agree upon. Each Terms Agreement shall specify the firms
which will be Underwriters (who shall become bound by the terms hereof when
the Terms Agreement has been entered into), the principal amount to be
purchased by each Underwriter, the purchase price to be paid by the
Underwriters and the terms of the Purchased Securities not already
specified in the Indenture, including, but not limited to, interest rates,
maturities, redemption provisions and sinking fund requirements. Each Terms
Agreement shall also specify the date of delivery and payment for the
Purchased Securities other than any Contract Securities (as defined in
Section 2(c) hereof) and any details of the terms of offering which should
be reflected in the Prospectus Supplement relating to the offering of the
Purchased Securities. Such Prospectus Supplement shall set forth the terms
contained in the Terms Agreement and such other information that you and
the Company agree at the time the Terms Agreement is entered into should be
included in the Prospectus Supplement. Insofar as any provision of this
Agreement is inconsistent with any provision of the applicable Terms
Agreement, the Terms Agreement shall be deemed to control. Purchased
Securities to be purchased by Underwriters are herein referred to as
"Underwriters' Securities", and any Purchased Securities to be purchased
pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts as hereinafter provided are herein
referred to as "Contract Securities". The obligations of the Underwriters
to purchase the Underwriters' Securities shall be several and not joint. It
is understood that the Underwriters propose to offer the Purchased
Securities for sale as set forth in such Prospectus Supplement.

4
<PAGE>

(b) Payment of the purchase price for the Underwriters' Securities shall
be made to the Company or its order in New York Clearing House funds, by
certified or official bank check, against delivery of the Underwriters'
Securities to you for the respective accounts of the Underwriters;
provided, however, that at the request of the Company, payment will be made
in immediately available funds, in which case the Company will reimburse
you for your cost of obtaining such funds. Such payment and delivery shall
be made at 10:00 A.M. New York time on the date of delivery specified in
the Terms Agreement (unless another time not later than 10:00 A.M. New York
time on the fifth business day thereafter shall be agreed to by you and the
Company or unless postponed in accordance with the provisions of Section 7
hereof). The time and date that such payment and delivery are actually made
is herein sometimes referred to as the "Closing Date". The Underwriters'
Securities shall be delivered to you in definitive form, in temporary or
final form, and in such names and denominations as you shall request at
least two business days prior to the Closing Date by written notice to the
Company. For the purpose of expediting the checking and packaging of the
Underwriters' Securities by you, the Company agrees to make them available
to you for such purpose at least 24 hours prior to the Closing Date.

(c) If any Terms Agreement provides for sales of Purchased Securities
pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts, the Company authorizes the
Underwriters to solicit offers to purchase Contract Securities pursuant to
Delayed Delivery Contracts substantially in the form of Schedule I attached
hereto (the "Delayed Delivery Contracts") with such changes therein as the
Company may approve. Delayed Delivery Contracts are to be with
institutional investors, including commercial and savings banks, insurance
companies, pension funds, investment companies and educational and
charitable institutions. At the time of purchase the Company will pay you
as compensation, for the accounts of the Underwriters, the compensation set
forth in such Terms Agreement in respect of the principal amount of
Contract Securities. The Underwriters will not have any responsibility in
respect of the validity or the performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts.
If the Company executes and delivers Delayed Delivery Contracts, the
Contract Securities shall be deducted from the Purchased Securities to be
purchased by the several Underwriters and the aggregate principal amount of
Purchased Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter shall be reduced
pro rata in proportion to the principal amount of Purchased Securities set
forth opposite each Underwriter's name in such Terms Agreement, except to
the extent that you determine that such reduction shall be otherwise
allocated and so advise the Company.

3. COVENANTS. The Company covenants and agrees with each Underwriter that
they will furnish to counsel for the Underwriters, without charge, one signed
copy of the Registration Statement, including all exhibits, in the form it
became effective and of all amendments thereto and that, in connection with
each offering of Securities:

(a) The Company shall notify you promptly of any request by the
Commission for any amendment of or supplement to the Registration Statement
or the Prospectus, or for additional information; the Company shall prepare
and file with the Commission, promptly upon your request, any amendments of
or supplements to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus which, in
your opinion after consultation with the Company, may be necessary or
advisable in connection with the distribution of the Securities and the
Company shall not file any amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus or file any document under the Exchange Act
before the termination of the offering of the Securities if such document
would be deemed to be incorporated by reference therein which is not
approved by you after reasonable notice thereof, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Company shall notify you promptly of
the filing with the Commission of the Prospectus supplemented by the
Prospectus Supplement relating to the Purchased Securities. The Company
shall advise you promptly of the issuance by the Commission or any State or
other regulatory body of any stop order or other order suspending the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement, suspending or preventing the
use of the Prospectus, or suspending the qualification of the Securities
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the institution of any
proceedings for any such purpose; and the Company shall use its best
efforts to prevent the issuance of any stop order or other such order and,
should a stop order or other such order be issued, to obtain as soon as
possible the lifting thereof.

5
<PAGE>

(b) The Company shall furnish to you, from time to time and without
charge, copies of the Registration Statement of which each Representative
shall receive a conformed copy and which shall include exhibits and all
amendments and supplements to any of such documents (including any
Incorporated Documents), in each case as soon as available and in such
quantities as you may from time to time reasonably request.

(c) If any event occurs as a result of which the Prospectus as then
amended or supplemented would include an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, or if it is necessary to amend the Registration Statement or
supplement the Prospectus to comply with the Securities Act, the Company
shall promptly notify you and shall amend the Registration Statement or
supplement the Prospectus or file such document (at the expense of the
Company) so as to correct such statement or omission or effect such
compliance.

(d) The Company shall take or cause to be taken all necessary action and
furnish to whomever you may direct such information as may be required in
qualifying the Purchased Securities for sale under the laws of such
jurisdictions as the Representative shall designate and to continue such
qualifications in effect for as long as may be necessary for the
distribution of the Purchased Securities; except that in no event shall the
Company be obligated in connection therewith to qualify as a foreign
corporation, or to execute a general consent for service of process.

(e) The Company shall make generally available to holders of the
Purchased Securities, in the manner contemplated by Rule 158(b) under the
Securities Act or otherwise, as soon as practicable after the date of the
applicable Terms Agreement, but in any event not later than 45 days after
the end of its fiscal quarter in which the first anniversary date of the
date of the Terms Agreement, an earnings statement satisfying the
requirements of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and covering a period
of at least 12 consecutive months beginning after the effective date of the
Registration Statement.

(f) The Company shall apply the net proceeds of the sale of Purchased
Securities as set forth in the Prospectus.

(g) Whether or not this Agreement becomes effective or is terminated or
the sale of the Purchased Securities to you is consummated, the Company
shall pay or cause to be paid (A) all expenses (including transfer taxes)
incurred in connection with the delivery to the Underwriters of the
Purchased Securities, (B) all fees and expenses (including, without
limitation, fees and expenses of the Company's accountants and counsel, but
excluding fees and expenses of counsel to the Underwriters except as set
forth in (C)) in connection with the preparation, printing, filing,
delivery and shipping of the Registration Statement (including the
financial statements therein and all amendments and exhibits thereto) and
the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, and the printing, delivery and
shipping of this Agreement, any Terms Agreement, any agreement among or
between Underwriters and other underwriting documents, including the Blue
Sky Survey and any legal investment survey, (C) all filing fees and fees
and disbursements of counsel to the Underwriters incurred in connection
with the qualification of the Purchased Securities under state securities
laws as provided in Section 3(d) hereof, (D) the filing fee of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., if any, (E) any applicable listing
fees, (F) the cost of printing the Indenture and certificates representing
the Purchased Securities, (G) the cost and charges of the Trustee, (H) any
fees payable to rating agencies in connection with the rating of the
Purchased Securities and (I) all other costs and expenses incident to the
performance of its obligations hereunder which are not otherwise provided
for in this Section. It is understood however, that, except as provided in
this Section 3(g), Section 5 and Section 6 hereof, each of the Underwriters
shall pay all of its own costs and expenses including the fees of its
counsel (except as set forth in (C) above) and any advertising expenses
connected with any offers it may make. If the sale of the Purchased
Securities provided for herein is not consummated by reason or acts of the
Company pursuant to Section 6 hereof which prevent this Agreement or Terms
Agreement from becoming effective, or by reason of any failure, refusal or
inability on the part of the Company to perform any agreement on its part
to be performed or because

6
<PAGE>

any other condition of the Underwriters' obligations hereunder is not
fulfilled, the Company shall reimburse each of the Underwriters for all
reasonable out-of-pocket disbursements (including fees and disbursements of
counsel) incurred by the Underwriters in connection with your investigation
of or any preparation by them in respect of marketing the Purchased
Securities or in contemplation of performing their respective obligations
hereunder.

(h) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company, at your request, shall
furnish to you as soon as they have been prepared by the Company a copy of
any unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the Company and
its Subsidiaries for any period subsequent to the period covered by the
financial statements appearing in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus.

Prospectus, and the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is registered

of such counsel's knowledge, any bond, debenture, note or any other
evidence of indebtedness or any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, or
any other material agreement or instrument to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is subject where such breach or default would have

a whole, or any law, administrative regulation or court or governmental
agency or authority ruling or decree known to such counsel to be
applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their

upon and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy, completeness

Prospectus (except to the extent stated in paragraph (ix) above), on the
basis of the foregoing (relying as to materiality to a large extent upon
the opinions of officers and other representatives of the Company), no
facts have come to the attention of such counsel that lead him to believe
that either the Registration Statement or any amendment thereto at the time
such Registration Statement or amendment became effective contained an
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading or that the Prospectus as of its date or any supplement
thereto as of its date, and as of the Closing Date, contained an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading (it being understood that such
counsel need not comment as to the financial statements, schedules and
other statistical and financial data included in the Registration Statement
or Prospectus or the exhibits (including the Form T-1) to the Registration
Statement).

(d) You shall have received on the Closing Date from Cahill Gordon &
Reindel, your counsel, an opinion to the effect set forth in clauses (ii),
(iii), (vi), (vii), (viii), (ix), (x)(a) (except with respect to the
Incorporated Documents) and (x)(b) of Section 4(c) hereof. In addition,
such counsel shall state that such counsel has participated in conferences
with officers and other representatives of the Company, counsel for the
Company, representatives of the independent public accountants for the
Company and your representatives at which the contents of the Registration
Statement and Prospectus and related matters were discussed and, although
such counsel is not passing upon and does not assume any responsibility for
the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the statements contained in the
Registration Statement and Prospectus (except to the extent provided in
paragraph (ix) of Section 4(c) hereof), on the basis of the foregoing
(relying as to materiality to a large extent upon the opinions of officers
and other representatives of the Company), no facts have come to the
attention of such counsel that lead them to believe that either the
Registration Statement or any amendment thereto at the time such
Registration Statement or amendment became effective contained an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading or that the Prospectus as of its date or any supplement thereto
as of its date contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted
to state a material fact necessary in order the make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading (it being understood that such counsel need express no comment
with respect to the financial statements, schedules and other financial or
statistical data included or incorporated by reference in the Registration
Statement or Prospectus or the exhibits (including the Form T-1) to the
Registration Statement).

(e) There shall have been furnished to you a certificate, dated the
Closing Date and addressed to you, signed by the President, the Chief
Financial Officer, any financial Vice President or the Treasurer of the
Company to the effect that: (i) the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in

9

this Agreement are true and correct, as if made at and as of the Closing
Date, and the Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied
all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to
the Closing Date; (ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement has been issued, and no proceedings for that purpose
have been initiated or threatened; (iii) all filings required by Rule 424
of the Securities Act have been made; (iv) the signers of said certificate
have carefully examined the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, and
any amendments or supplements thereto (including any documents filed under
the Exchange Act and deemed to be incorporated by reference therein), and
such documents contain all statements and information required to be
included therein, and do not include any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and (v) since the
execution of the Terms Agreement, there has occurred no event required to
be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus which has not been so set forth; and there has been no
document required to be filed under the Exchange Act that upon such filing
would be deemed to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus that
has not been so filed.

(f) Since the execution of the Terms Agreement, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall have sustained any loss by fire, flood,
accident or other calamity, or shall have become a party to or be subject
to any litigation, which is material to the Company and its Subsidiaries
taken as a whole, nor shall there have been a material adverse change in
the general affairs, business, key personnel, capitalization, financial
position or net worth of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
whether or not arising in the ordinary course of business, which loss,
litigation or change, in your judgment, shall render it inadvisable to
proceed with the delivery of the Purchased Securities.

(g) On the date of execution of the Terms Agreement and the Closing Date
you shall have received a letter of Deloitte & Touche, dated the date of
execution of the Terms Agreement and the Closing Date, as the case may be,
and addressed to you, confirming that they are independent certified public
accountants, within the meaning of the Securities Act, and stating, as of
the date of such letter (or, with respect to matters involving changes or
developments since the respective dates as of which specified financial
information is given or incorporated in the Prospectus, and a date not more
than five days prior to the date of such letter), the conclusions and
findings of such firm with respect to the financial information and other
matters requested to be covered by its letter delivered to you concurrently
with the execution of the Terms Agreement and, with respect to the letter

forth in such prior letter.

any case where sales of Contract Securities arranged by the Underwriters
have been approved by the Company.

(i) You shall have been furnished with such additional documents and
certificates as you may reasonably request.

(j) Since the execution and delivery of the Terms Agreement, there shall
not have been any downgrading in the rating of any of the debt securities
of the Company or any action threatening such a downgrading or placing the
Company under special surveillance by either Standard & Poor's Corporation
or Moody's Investors Service or any notice given of, or any other action
threatening, any intended or potential downgrading in any such rating or of
a possible change in any such rating that does not indicate the direction
of the possible change or any action placing the Company under special
surveillance.

All such opinions, certificates, letters and documents shall be in
compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to you and to counsel for the
Underwriters. The Company shall furnish to you such conformed copies of
such opinions, certificates, letters and other documents as you shall
reasonably request. If any of the conditions specified in this Section 4
shall not have been fulfilled when and as required by this Agreement, this
Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement and all obligations of the
Underwriters hereunder and thereunder may be

cancelled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing Date, by you. Any such
cancellation shall be without liability of the Underwriters to the Company.
Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the Company in writing, or by
telegraph or telephone and confirmed in writing.

5. INDEMNIFICATION AND CONTRIBUTION. (a) The Company shall indemnify and hold
harmless each of the Underwriters against any loss, claim, damage or liability
to which the Underwriters may become subject, under the Securities Act or
otherwise, insofar as such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in
respect thereof) arises out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement made by the Company in Section 1 hereof, or (ii) any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained (A)
in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto, or (B) in any Blue Sky application or other document executed by the
Company specifically for the purpose or based upon any written information
furnished by the Company filed in any state or other jurisdiction in order to
qualify any or all of the Purchased Securities under the securities laws
thereof (any such application, document or information being hereinafter called
"Blue Sky Information"), or (iii) the omission or alleged omission to state in
the Registration Statement or the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto or in any Blue Sky Information a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading; and shall
reimburse each of the Underwriters for any legal or other reasonable expenses
as incurred by the Underwriters in connection with investigating or defending
against or appearing as a third-party witness in connection with any such loss,
claim, damage, liability or action, notwithstanding the possibility that
payments for such expenses might later be held to be improper, in which case
the person receiving them shall promptly refund them; provided, however, that
the Company shall not be liable to an Underwriter in any such case to the
extent, but only to the extent, that any such loss, claim, damage or liability
arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
or omission or alleged omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter specifically
for use in the preparation of the Registration Statement, Prospectus or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or any Blue Sky Information.

(b) Each of the Underwriters, severally but not jointly, shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company against any loss, claim, damage or liability to which
the Company may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar
as such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) arises
out of or is based upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of
a material fact contained (A) in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus
or any amendment or supplement thereto, or (B) in any Blue Sky Information, or
(ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto or in any Blue Sky
Information a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading; and shall reimburse any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or
defending against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action,
notwithstanding the possibility that payments for such expenses might later be
held to be improper, in which case the Company shall promptly refund them;
provided, however, that such indemnification and expense reimbursement shall be
available from an Underwriter to the extent, but only to the extent, that such
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission
was made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished
to the Company by such Underwriter specifically for use in the preparation
thereof.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or
(b) above of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the
indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against
the indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in
writing of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided, however,
that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any
liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under such
subsection. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified
party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying
party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it
wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume
the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified
party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the

11
<PAGE>

indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or
action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party
under such subsection for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by
the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than
reasonable costs of investigation; except that you shall have the right to
employ counsel to represent you in connection with any claim in respect of
which indemnity may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company under
such subsection if, in your reasonable judgment, it is advisable for you to be
represented by separate counsel, and in that event the reasonable fees and
expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5 is unavailable or
insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or (b)
above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or
liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b) above (i) in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on
the one hand and the Underwriters on the other hand from the offering of the
Purchased Securities or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is
not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also
the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on the
other in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such
losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand
and the Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion
as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Purchased Securities (before
deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total underwriting
discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters as set forth in the
Prospectus Supplement covering the Purchased Securities. Relative fault shall
be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company or the
Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information
and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue statement or omission. The
Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were to be determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into
account the equitable considerations referred to in the first sentence of this
subsection (d). The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result of the
losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of
this subsection (d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating
or defending against any action or claim which is the subject of this
subsection (d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no
Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount
by which the total price at which the Purchased Securities underwritten by it
and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of
any damages that such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason
of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Each party entitled to
contribution agrees that upon the service of a summons or other initial legal
process upon it in any action instituted against it in respect of which
contribution may be sought, it shall promptly give written notice of such
service to the party or parties from whom contribution may be sought, but the
omission so to notify such party or parties of any such service shall not
relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought from any obligation it
may have hereunder or otherwise.

(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 5 shall be in addition
to any liability which the Company may otherwise have, and shall extend, upon
the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any
Underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act; and
the obligations of the Underwriters under this Section 5 shall be in addition
to any liability that the respective Underwriters may otherwise have, and shall
extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Company
(including any person who, with his or her consent, is named in the
Registration Statement as about to become a director of the Company), to each
officer of the Company who has signed the Registration Statement and to each
person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities
Act.

6. EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERMINATION OF TERMS AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall
become effective (a) at 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the first full
Business day following the date of the Terms Agreement or (b) at such earlier
time after the date of the Terms Agreement as you shall first release the
Purchased Securities for sale to the public. You shall notify the Company
immediately after you have taken any action which causes this Agreement to
become effective. Until this Agreement is effective, it may be terminated by
the Company by giving notice as hereinafter provided to you or by you by giving
notice as hereinafter provided to the Company, except that the provisions of
Section 3(g) and Section 5 shall at all times be effective.

Your obligations under any Terms Agreement may be terminated by you by giving
notice as hereinafter provided to the Company, if (i) the Company shall have
failed, refused or been unable, at or prior to the Closing Date to perform any
agreement on its part to be performed hereunder, (ii) any other condition of
the obligations of the Underwriters hereunder is not fulfilled, (iii) trading
in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") or the American
Stock Exchange or the over-the-counter market shall have been suspended or
minimum prices shall have been established on either of such exchanges or such
market by the Commission or by such exchange or other regulatory body or
governmental authority having jurisdiction, (iv) a general banking moratorium
shall have been declared by Federal or state authorities, (v) the United States
engages in hostilities or there is an escalation of hostilities involving the
United States or there is a declaration of war or national emergency by the
United States after the date hereof which, in your judgment, makes it
inadvisable or impracticable to proceed with the delivery of the Purchased
Securities, or (vi) there shall have been such a material change in general
economic, political or financial conditions or if the effect of international
conditions on the financial markets in the United States shall be such as, in
your judgment, makes it inadvisable or impracticable to proceed with the
delivery of the Purchased Securities. Any termination of this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 6 shall be without liability on the part of the
Company or the Underwriters except as otherwise provided in Sections 3(g) and 5
hereof.

Any notice referred to above may be given at the address specified in Section
9 hereof in writing or by telegraph or telephone, and if by telegraph or
telephone, shall be immediately confirmed in writing.

7. INCREASE IN UNDERWRITERS' COMMITMENTS. If any Underwriter shall default in
its obligation to take up and pay for the Purchased Securities to be purchased
by it under any Terms Agreement and if the principal amount of Purchased
Securities which all Underwriters so defaulting shall have so failed to take up
and pay for does not exceed 10% of the total principal amount of Purchased
Securities agreed to be purchased pursuant to such Terms Agreement, the non-
defaulting Underwriters shall take up and pay for (in addition to the principal
amount of Purchased Securities they are obligated to purchase pursuant to such
Terms Agreement) the principal amount of Purchased Securities agreed to be
purchased by all such defaulting Underwriters, as hereinafter provided. Such
Purchased Securities shall be taken up and paid for by such non-defaulting
Underwriter or Underwriters in such amount or amounts as you may designate with
the consent of each Underwriter so designated or, in the event no such
designation is made, such Purchased Securities shall be taken up and paid for
by all non-defaulting Underwriters pro rata in proportion to the principal
amount of Purchased Securities they have agreed to purchase under such Terms
Agreement.

Without relieving any defaulting Underwriter from its obligations hereunder,
the Company agrees with the non-defaulting Underwriters that it will not sell
any Purchased Securities under any Terms Agreement unless all of the
Underwriters' Securities under any such Terms Agreement are purchased by the
Underwriters (or by substituted underwriters selected by you with the approval
of the Company or selected by the Company with your approval).

If a new underwriter or underwriters are substituted by the Underwriters or
by the Company for a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters in accordance with
the foregoing provision, the Company or you shall have the right to postpone
the Closing Date for a period not exceeding five full business days in order
that necessary changes in the Registration Statement and Prospectus and other
documents may be effected.

13
<PAGE>

The term Underwriter as used in this Agreement shall refer to and include any
underwriter substituted under this Section 7.

8. SURVIVAL OF INDEMNITIES, CONTRIBUTIONS, WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS.
The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in Section 5 and the
representations, warranties and agreements of the Company in Sections 1 and 3
shall survive the delivery of the Purchased Securities to the Underwriters
hereunder and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any
termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or
on behalf of any indemnified party.

9. NOTICES. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (a) whenever
notice is required by the provisions of this Agreement to be given to the
Company, such notice shall be in writing addressed to the Company at The
Coastal Corporation, Coastal Tower, Nine Greenway Plaza, Houston, Texas 77046-

Agreement to be given to the Underwriters, such notice shall be in writing and

Company in writing for the purpose of communications hereunder.

10. INFORMATION FURNISHED BY UNDERWRITERS. The statements with respect to the
public offering of the Purchased Securities on the cover page of the Prospectus
Supplement covering the Purchased Securities and under the caption "Plan of
Distribution", if any in such Prospectus Supplement constitute the only
information furnished to the Company in writing on behalf of or by you
expressly for use in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto referred to in this Agreement.

11. PARTIES. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon
the Underwriters, the Company, any officer, director or controlling person
referred to in Section 5 hereof, and their respective successors and assigns,
and no other person shall acquire or have any right by virtue of this
Agreement. The term "successors and assigns", as used in this Agreement, shall
not include any purchaser of any of the Purchased Securities from the
Underwriters merely by reason of such purchase.

12. DEFINITION OF "BUSINESS DAY" AND "SUBSIDIARY". For purposes of this
Agreement, (a) "Business Day" means any day on which the NYSE is open for
trading, and (b) "Subsidiary" has the meaning set forth in Rule 405 of the
Securities Act.
