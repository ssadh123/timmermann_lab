SAFECARD ANNOUNCES MAJOR REORGANIZATION;
----------------------------------------
NAMES NEW MANAGEMENT TEAM
-------------------------

CHEYENNE, WY, April 18, 1994 -- SafeCard Services, Inc. (NYSE:
SSI), today announced a complete reorganization of its headquarter
operations and named a new senior management team.

Paul G. Kahn, chairman and chief executive officer, said the
following executives in the Cheyenne headquarters and Fort
Lauderdale offices will leave all offices held with the company and
its affiliates, effective April 30:

W.M. Stalcup, Jr., president; Gerald R. Cahill, chief
operating officer; John Bochak, senior executive vice president of
operations; Joanne J. Seehousen, executive vice president of sales;
Agneta K. Breslin, executive vice president and assistant
secretary; David Gallimore, executive vice president of marketing;
Barry I. Tillis, assistant general counsel; and Timothy T. Quinlan,
sales manager.

The reorganization came "after extended planning and a review
and consensus by the board of directors," Mr. Kahn said. "We felt
that the organization had to be streamlined and flattened and the
sales and marketing organizations revamped in order to move the
company on to a higher growth track and to diversify. In order to
do that, new management talent with broader skills were needed in
the organization. Today's reorganization simply reflects these
needs and should not be read in any other way."

He also thanked Messrs. Stalcup, Cahill, Bochak, Gallimore,
Tillis, Quinlan, Ms. Seehousen and Ms. Breslin for their many years
of faithful service to SafeCard. 

The company will take a onetime charge of approximately $3.5
million in the second quarter Mr. Kahn said, to cover the cost of
severance of the executives leaving the company and closing the
Fort Lauderdale office.
