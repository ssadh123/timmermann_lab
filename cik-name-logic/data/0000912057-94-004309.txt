TJ INTERNATIONAL, INC., SEALRITE WINDOWS, INC. AND OLDACH WINDOW
CORP. EXPLANATORY NOTES TO PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

TRANSACTION

On October 11, 1994, TJ International, Inc. (the "Company")
formed a Delaware general partnership (the "Partnership"),
combining the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Norco
Windows, Inc., a Wisconsin corporation ("Norco"), with
SealRite Windows, Inc., a Nebraska corporation ("SealRite")
and Oldach Window Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Oldach").
The Partnership, which was initially formed as the N-S&O
Partnership, will operate under the name "Outlook Window
Partnership ("Outlook")."

Under the terms of a Partnership Formation and Contribution
Agreement, the Company contributed to the Partnership all of
the assets and liabilities of Norco and all of the issued
and outstanding capital stock of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Dashwood Industries Limited, a corporation
organized under the laws of the Province of Ontario, Canada
("Dashwood"), and R. Laflamme & Frere, Quebec, ("Laflamme"),
in exchange for a 73.5% interest in the Partnership.

SealRite and Oldach contributed all of their respective
assets and liabilities in exchange for an aggregate 26.5%
interest in the Partnership. The Partnership Agreement of
the Partnership provides that the Company shall make an
additional cash contribution to the Partnership equal to the
amount of any operating losses for Norco, Dashwood and
Laflamme for the period October 3, 1994 to December 31, 1995.

The Company's acquisition of a 73.5% ownership interest in
the Partnership is accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting. The former Norco, Dashwood and Laflamme assets
and liabilities are recorded at their historical net book
value. The former S&O assets and liabilities are recorded at
their fair market value.

On October 27, 1994, the Company announced it has signed a
letter of intent to sell its Dashwood window subsidiary to
Andersen Corporation. Also, on December 5, 1994 Andersen
Corporation has expressed an intent to purchase the company's
Laflamme subsidiary. The sale of both these companies is
targeted to be effective at the end of the company's 1994
fiscal year. If the sale pursuant to the terms of the letter of
intent the company's interest in Outlook would decrease to
approximately 64%.

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The accompanying pro forma financial statements are required
by and prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The pro forma
portions of the accompanying statements make certain
assumptions concerning current and historical events, which
may or may not be applicable in the circumstances.
Accordingly, no assurances can be given that the pro forma
financial statements are necessarily indicative of the
results that may have happened in the past or might be
expected for the future.

The accompanying pro forma balance sheet shows how the
transaction might have affected the company's historical
balance sheet if the transaction had been fully consummated
on October 1, 1994. The audit of the assets and liabilities
contributed to the Partnership is not yet completed. Any
material adjustments as a result of the audit would affect
the balances reported in the accompanying pro forma
consolidated balance sheet.

The accompanying pro forma statements of income show how the
transaction might have affected the Company's historical
income statements had the transaction been consummated at the
beginning of the periods presented in the statements. The
pro forma income statements are based on the audited income
statements of the Company and S&O for the fiscal year ended
January 1, 1994, and on the unaudited income statements for
the Company and S&O for the nine months ended October 1,
1994. Pro forma adjustments to the historical financial
statements are described in the following notes:

<PAGE>

1. Adjustment to reflect the estimated unpaid transaction
related costs and liability.

2. Adjustment to reflect the pay off of short-term and certain
long-term borrowings of S&O through refinancing with a draw
on the Company's Revolving Credit Facility, coupled with a
cash payment.

3. Adjustment to reflect the distribution to former shareholders
of S&O funded by a draw on the Company's Revolving Credit
Facility.

4. Adjustment to reflect the fair market value of the businesses
acquired.

5. Adjustment to reflect the minority interest for the 26.5%
portion of the partnership owned by S&O.

6. Adjustment to reflect the amortization over 40 years of
goodwill arising from the acquisition.

7. Adjustment to reflect the additional interest expense on the
incremental borrowing described in note 3 above. For the
nine months ended October 1, 1994, all interest expense would
be capitalized into construction in progress.

8. Adjustment to reflect the allocation of 26.5% of S&O's
income to the minority interest. The pro forma results
assume the allocation to the Company of all the losses of
Norco, Dashwood and Laflamme for the periods presented,
consistent with the allocation of any such losses agreed to
by the partners for the period October 3, 1994 to December 31,
1995.
