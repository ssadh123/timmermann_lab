Item 5. Other Events.

On August 14, 1994, the Company entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger with Knogo Corporation ("Knogo") and Knogo's
wholly-owned subsidiary, Knogo North America Inc. ("Knogo North
America"), providing for the merger (the "Merger") of Knogo with and
into the Company. The agreement contemplates that immediately prior
to the Merger, Knogo's operations in the United States, Puerto Rico
and Canada will be contributed to Knogo North America and the stock of
Knogo North America distributed to Knogo's stockholders or otherwise
disposed of (the "Divestiture"), so that pursuant to the Merger,
Knogo's businesses outside the United States, Puerto Rico and Canada
will be combined with those of the Company.

Pursuant to the agreement, following the Divestiture and
upon the effectiveness of the Merger, each share of Knogo common stock
will be exchanged for the Company's Common Stock having a value (based
on the average of the closing prices of the Company's Common Stock for
the twenty trading days preceding the merger) of $18, which value
would be increased, in the event such average closing price exceeds
$33, by .273 times the amount of such excess. The Company has the
right to pay all or a portion of the merger consideration in cash in
the event that such average closing price of its Common Stock is less
than $28, subject, however, to Knogo's right in such event to require
that the merger consideration be paid entirely in the Company's Common
Stock at a fixed valuation of $28 per share.

Consummation of the Merger is subject to the expiration of
applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, approval of Knogo's shareholders and certain
other conditions. The agreement also has provisions for the payment
of break-up fees, under certain conditions, payable by either party
should the transaction fail to close.

In addition to a Contribution and Divestiture Agreement
governing the assets contributed by Knogo to Knogo North America and
the related liabilities to be assumed by Knogo North America, it is
contemplated by the agreement that under a Supply Agreement, the
Company will purchase certain products from Knogo North America over a
term of 30 months. It is also contemplated that the parties will
enter into a License Agreement governing the use of certain patent
rights and technology.

Knogo is an international, New York-based company engaged
primarily in the business of manufacturing, marketing and servicing
electronic article surveillance systems employing swept radio
frequency, dual radio frequency and magnetic technologies. Knogo also
markets closed circuit video systems. Knogo's worldwide revenues for
the fiscal year ended February 28, 1994 were $89.3 million, with net
income of $3.6 million or $0.65 per share. The Knogo operations being
acquired by the Company pursuant to the Merger posted revenues of
$70.6 million for the same period.

NOTE G -- SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

MERGER WITH SENSORMATIC AND SPIN-OFF

On June 27, 1994, Knogo announced that it was holding discussions
involving a possible merger or sale of Knogo or the addition of 
a significant investor.

On August 14, 1994, Knogo and its newly established, wholly-owned
subsidiary Knogo North America, Inc. ("Knogo N.A.") entered into a
Merger Agreement with Sensormatic Electronics Corporation
("Sensormatic"). The Merger Agreement contemplates that Knogo will be
merged into Sensormatic (the "Merger"). Consummation of the Merger
is subject to Knogo shareholder and regulatory approval. 

Immediately prior to the Merger, Knogo will contribute to Knogo N.A.
certain assets and liabilities of Knogo relative to its operations in
the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico (the "Knogo N.A. Territory"). 
The Knogo N.A. common stock will be distributed to the Knogo 
shareholders, or Knogo will otherwise dispose of the stock or assets 
of Knogo N.A. so that upon the effectiveness of the Merger, Knogo's 
business interests outside of the United States, Canada, and 
Puerto Rico will be combined with those of Sensormatic.

Each outstanding share of Knogo Common Stock will be converted in the 
Merger into a fraction of a share of Sensormatic Common Stock, having 
a value of $18, subject to certain adjustments. 

Supply and License Agreement

Pursuant to a related supply agreement, Sensormatic is obligated to 
purchase products from Knogo N.A. in the amount of $12,000,000 during 
the first 12 months and an additional $12,000,000 during the ensuing 18
months. Such products will be priced to yield Knogo N.A. a 35% gross 
margin.

Pursuant to a related license agreement, Knogo N.A. will have the 
exclusive right to manufacture and sell existing Knogo products within
the Knogo N.A. Territory, and Sensormatic shall have such right elsewhere, 
except that Knogo N.A. and Sensormatic will each have the right to 
develop and market the SuperStrip technology in the Knogo N.A. territory.

Decline in Operations

Subsequent to May 31, 1994, Knogo has experienced a decline in 
operating results principally as a result of declining revenues and
professional fees in connection with the proposed merger and related 
agreements. Should Sensormatic fail to consummate the Merger (other 
than for breach by Knogo of its obligations or failure to obtain 
shareholder approval), Knogo would receive from Sensormatic a 
payment of either four million or ten million dollars, depending
on the circumstances giving rise to the payment obligation. In 
the opinion of Knogo management, payment of such fees should provide 
sufficient funding for Knogo to maintain continuity of its existing
operations as it seeks to return to previous operating levels.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF KNOGO FOR THE FISCAL YEAR
ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 1994:

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Board of Directors
Knogo Corporation
Hauppauge, New York

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Knogo
Corporation and subsidiaries as of February 28, 1994 and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows
for the year then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements based on
our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Knogo Corporation
and subsidiaries as of February 28, 1994, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles. 

As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company has entered into a Merger Agreement with Sensormatic
Electronics Corporation.

KNOGO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
YEAR ENDED FEBRUARY 28, 1994

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

a. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Knogo
Corporation and its subsidiaries ("Knogo"), all of which are
wholly-owned. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

b. REVENUE RECOGNITION - Knogo manufactures security
devices which it offers for sale or lease. Revenue related
to the sale of equipment is recorded at the time of shipment
or upon acceptance by a third-party leasing company of a
customer lease and the related equipment. In addition, in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. l3, "Accounting for Leases", lease contracts which meet
the following criteria are accounted for as sales-type
leases: collection is reasonably assured, there are no
important uncertainties, and (l) the present value of the
rental payments over the term of the lease is at least 90%
of the fair value of the equipment or (2) the lease term is
equal to 75% or more of the estimated economic life of the
equipment or (3) the lease contains a bargain purchase
option. Under this method, revenue is recognized as a sale
at the time of installation or acceptance by the lessee in
an amount equal to the present value of the required rental
payments under the fixed, noncancellable lease term. The
difference between the total lease payments and the present
value is amortized over the term of the lease so as to
produce a constant periodic rate of return on the net
investment in the lease.

The operating method of accounting for leases is followed
for lease contracts not meeting the above criteria. Under 
this method of accounting, aggregate rental revenue is
recognized over the term of the lease (usually 12 to 48
months), which commences with date of installation or 
acceptance by the lessee.

Service revenues are recognized as earned and maintenance
revenues are recognized ratably over the service contract 
period. Warranty costs associated with products sold with 
warranty protection are estimated based on Knogo's historical 
experience and recorded in the period the product is sold.

c. CASH EQUIVALENTS AND INVESTMENTS - Knogo considers all
highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three
months or less as cash equivalents. Included in cash
equivalents are certificates of deposit of $516,000 at
February 28, 1994. Investments are stated at cost which
approximates market value. Investments consist principally
of tax exempt interest-bearing bonds of the Government
Development Bank of Puerto Rico.

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities",
which requires changes in the accounting and reporting of 
investments in debt and equity securities. Knogo is required 
to adopt SFAS No. 115 in fiscal 1995. The effect of adopting 
SFAS No. 115 on Knogo's consolidated financial statements is 
not expected to be material.

d. INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of
cost (first-in, first-out method) or market. Component
parts and systems in inventory available for assembly and
customer installation are considered as work-in-process.

e. SECURITY DEVICES ON LEASE - Security devices on lease
are stated at cost and consist of completed systems which
have been installed.

f. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION - Depreciation of
security devices on lease and property, plant and equipment
is provided for using the straight-line method over their
related estimated useful lives. The security devices
generally have estimated useful lives of six years, except
the cost of security devices related to operating leases
with bargain purchase options are depreciated over the life
of the lease.

g. INTANGIBLES - Costs and expenses incurred in obtaining
patents are amortized over the remaining life of the
patents, not exceeding l7 years, using the straight-line
method.

h. DEFERRED LEASE RENTALS - Deferred lease rentals consist
of amounts of rentals related to operating leases billed or
paid in advance.

i. INCOME TAXES - Knogo accounts for income taxes pursuant to 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS 109"), 
"Accounting for Income Taxes", which requires an asset and 
liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for 
income taxes. 

j. INCOME PER COMMON SHARE - Income per common share is
computed using the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the year, plus when dilutive, net
additional shares issuable upon exercise of stock options.

k. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - Assets and liabilities
of foreign subsidiaries are translated at year-end exchange
rates. Revenues and expenses are translated using the
average exchange rates prevailing throughout the period. 
Exchange rate changes arising from translation from the
foreign subsidiaries' functional currency to U.S. dollars
are included in the equity adjustment from foreign currency
translation component of shareholders' equity. Gains and
losses from foreign currency transactions denominated in a
currency other than the parent company's or its
subsidiaries' functional currencies are included in results
of operations.

2. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

MERGER WITH SENSORMATIC AND SPIN-OFF

On June 27, 1994, Knogo announced that it was holding discussions
involving a possible merger or sale of Knogo or the addition of 
a significant investor.

On August 14, 1994, Knogo and its newly established, wholly-owned
subsidiary Knogo North America, Inc. ("Knogo N.A.") entered into a
Merger Agreement with Sensormatic Electronics Corporation
("Sensormatic"). The Merger Agreement contemplates that Knogo will be
merged into Sensormatic (the "Merger"). Consummation of the Merger
is subject to Knogo shareholder and regulatory approval. 

Immediately prior to the Merger, Knogo will contribute to Knogo N.A.
certain assets and liabilities of Knogo relative to its operations in
the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico (the "Knogo N.A. Territory"). 
The Knogo N.A. common stock will be distributed to the Knogo 
shareholders, or Knogo will otherwise dispose of the stock or assets 
of Knogo N.A. so that upon the effectiveness of the Merger, Knogo's 
business interests outside of the United States, Canada, and 
Puerto Rico will be combined with those of Sensormatic.

Each outstanding share of Knogo Common Stock will be converted in the 
Merger into a fraction of a share of Sensormatic Common Stock, having 
a value of $18, subject to certain adjustments. 

Supply and License Agreement

Pursuant to a related supply agreement, Sensormatic is obligated to 
purchase products from Knogo N.A. in the amount of $12,000,000 during 
the first 12 months and an additional $12,000,000 during the ensuing 18
months. Such products will be priced to yield Knogo N.A. a 35% gross 
margin.

Pursuant to a related license agreement, Knogo N.A. will have the 
exclusive right to manufacture and sell existing Knogo products within
the Knogo N.A. Territory, and Sensormatic shall have such right elsewhere, 
except that Knogo N.A. and Sensormatic will each have the right to 
develop and market the SuperStrip technology in the Knogo N.A. territory.

Decline in Operations

Subsequent to May 31, 1994, Knogo has experienced a decline in 
operating results principally as a result of declining revenues and
professional fees in connection with the proposed merger and related 
agreements. Should Sensormatic fail to consummate the Merger (other 
than for breach by Knogo of its obligations or failure to obtain 
shareholder approval), Knogo would receive from Sensormatic a 
payment of either four million or ten million dollars, depending
on the circumstances giving rise to the payment obligation. In 
the opinion of Knogo management, payment of such fees should provide 
sufficient funding for Knogo to maintain continuity of its existing
operations as it seeks to return to previous operating levels. 

3. NET INVESTMENT IN SALES-TYPE LEASES AND OPERATING LEASE DATA

1994
(in thousands) 

Short-term lines of
credit, overdraft
facilities, and
other $ 9,900
Term loans 16,250
_______

$26,150

Knogo has various informal short-term overdraft and credit
lines available on which Knogo may borrow in various currencies at
prevailing market rates. At February 28, 1994, an amount of
$3,049,000 was outstanding under a domestic credit line at an annual
interest rate of 6%, maturing on July 14, 1994, subject to renewal. 
Amounts drawn in foreign currencies aggregated $5,278,000 with annual
interest rates approximating 7.1%.

Knogo has two equal term loan agreements with domestic banks. 
The term loans are payable in 13 remaining equal quarterly
installments of $1,250,000. All borrowings under these agreements
bear interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate plus 2.5% or the
Alternate Base Rate, as defined, plus 1%. At February 28, 1994, the
interest rate on outstanding borrowings was 6%. The terms of the
agreements, among other matters, provide restrictions on additional
borrowings, capital expenditures and payment of dividends and require
that Knogo maintain certain minimum net worth and working capital, as
defined. Knogo has pledged the shares of certain subsidiaries as
collateral for the loans. Knogo has received from its term loan 
lenders a waiver of the "no net loss" covenant of its existing term 
loans for the quarter ended May 31, 1994. 

Aggregate maturities of notes payable, banks, are as follows (in
thousands):

1995 $13,870
1996 5,278
1997 5,280
1998 1,474
1999 82
Thereafter 166

Subsequent to year end, Knogo received a commitment from a 
group of European banks to provide a three year credit financing 
of 40 million European Currency Units (ECU's) (approximately $44 
million) at an interest rate of 1 1/4% above the appropriate 
Interbank offered rate for each currency. Borrowings under the 
facility will be based upon eligible accounts receivable and 
lease contracts. As of September 16, the financing has not 
been consummated as a result of the Merger Agreement with 
Sensormatic (see Note 2).

8. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

a. Knogo's Stock Option Plan provides for grants of up to
950,000 options to purchase Knogo's common stock. In 
connection with the Merger Agreement with Sensormatic, the 
Knogo stock options will be cancelled and options of Sensormatic 
and Knogo N.A. issued in replacement therefor. Under the
Plan, options may be granted through May 4, l996 to executives
and key employees at prices determined by the Stock Option
Committee. Options become exercisable in whole or in part
from time-to-time as shall be determined by the Committee at
the time of grant of each option. Currently, options become
exercisable 20% per year over a five-year period. All options
granted in fiscal year 1994 were issued at fair market value
at date of grant. Transactions during the year ended February
28, 1994 were as follows:

Shares Under Option

Option Price Number
Per Share of Shares

Balance, February 28, l993 558,427
Granted $8.88 5,000
Exercised $5.13 - $7.75 (41,600)
Cancelled $5.13 - $6.25 (11,200)
__________

Balance, February 28, l994 510,627

Additionally, options to purchase 30,000 shares of Knogo's
common stock were granted to the outside directors of Knogo. The
option price per share was $l2.00 which was the fair market value on
the date of the grant. Such options were fully exercisable at
February 28, 1994 and expire in 1998.

As of February 28, 1994, options were outstanding at a
weighted average exercise price of $6.57 per share, and expire at
various dates beginning November 1, 1995. As of February 28, 1994,
options for 312,673 shares were available for future grants and
options for 331,187 shares were exercisable. As of February 28, 1994,
853,300 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance in
connection with the exercise of stock options.

b. Knogo has a Shareholders' Rights Plan that provides
rights to purchase new Knogo Corporation Participating
Cumulative Preferred Shares Series A, par value $.0l per
share ("Series A Preferred Shares") which would be
distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right per
common share. Rights become exercisable ten days after any
person or group acquires 20% or more or announces a tender
offer for 30% or more of Knogo's outstanding common stock. 
If and when the Rights become exercisable, each Right will
entitle the holder thereof to purchase one one-hundredth
(1/100th) of a Series A Preferred Share at an initial
exercise price of $l00. The terms of the Series A Preferred
Shares have been designed so that each one one-hundredth
(l/l00th) of a Series A Preferred Share will be entitled to
participate in dividends and to vote on an equivalent basis
with one whole share of Knogo's common shares. Rights 
under the Rights Plan, together with the outstanding shares 
of Knogo Common Stock, will be exchanged for Sensormatic 
Common Stock and extinguished in the Merger. 

9. DIVIDENDS

Knogo paid a regular quarterly cash dividend from July 1987
through December 1991. In January 1992, the Board of Directors
determined to eliminate the dividend in connection with the
restructuring of Knogo. Any further decision by the Board of
Directors as to the declaration and payment of dividends will depend
upon the earnings and financial condition of Knogo and such other
facts as the Board of Directors deems appropriate at such time. The
amount of cash dividends Knogo may pay is restricted under certain of
its bank credit agreements. As of February 28, 1994, based on the 
most restrictive of the debt covenants, approximately $2,711,000 is 
available for payment of dividends. 

10. INCOME TAXES

Sales-type leases 5,175
Deferred sales 475
Other 469
________

Gross deferred tax liabilities 9,588
________

Net deferred tax liability $ 1,181

The decrease in the valuation allowance of $1,838,000 
during the year ended February 28, 1994 was primarily the result 
of utilization of net operating loss carryforwards.

Knogo's Puerto Rico manufacturing subsidiary is exempt from
Federal income taxes under Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Also, Knogo was granted a partial income tax exemption under the
provisions of the Puerto Rico Industrial Incentives Act of l978 from
the payment of Puerto Rico taxes on income derived from marketing
certain products manufactured by the subsidiary. The grant provides
for a 90% exemption from Puerto Rico taxes until January 1, 2008. 
Knogo provides tollgate taxes on the earnings of the Puerto Rico
subsidiary which it intends to remit, in the form of a dividend, to
the parent company based upon the applicable rates. Such provision
amounted to $20,000 for the year ended February 28, 1994.

Knogo has approximately $2,800,000 in marketable securities
which Knogo intends to maintain in Puerto Rico in order to obtain
reduced tollgate taxes to be paid when the Puerto Rican source
earnings are repatriated.

Deferred income taxes have not been provided on the portion
of the earnings of foreign subsidiaries aggregating approximately
$14,585,000 which are to be indefinitely reinvested.

At February 28, 1994, Knogo had tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $250,000 for Federal tax purposes available to offset
future U.S. income tax liabilities through 2009. Knogo has available
domestic and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately
$22,800,000 for tax purposes expiring through 2009.

The prior years income tax returns of Knogo and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries are currently being examined by various
taxing authorities. Knogo has recorded the estimated settlement costs
for these matters. Management anticipates that adjustments, if any,
resulting from the conclusion of these examinations will not have a
material effect on the consolidated financial statements.

11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

a. Aggregate annual rent expense under leases for office,
warehouse, manufacturing facilities, automobiles and other
rental equipment amounted to approximately $2,498,000 for
1994. At February 28, 1994, the minimum rental commitments
under all noncancellable operating leases are $1,333,000
(1995), $648,000 (1996), $273,000 (1997), $158,000 (1998),
and $26,000 (1999).

b. Knogo has a severance compensation plan covering
certain officers and employees which provides that in the
event a participant's employment is terminated under certain
circumstances within two years following a change in
control, as defined, the participant would be entitled to a
severance payment, as defined. In addition, the participant
would be entitled to a cash payment in settlement of all
outstanding stock options and to the continuation for a
period of 18 months of certain benefits received under
Knogo's various employee benefit arrangements. This 
severance compensation plan will not apply to, and 
will be terminated as a result of, the Merger. (Note 2)

c. Knogo is a party to litigation arising in the normal
course of business. Management believes the final
disposition of such matters will not have a material adverse
effect on the consolidated financial statements.

d. Knogo has a voluntary profit sharing deferred
contribution plan, which complies with section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. The plan permits eligible employees
to make voluntary contributions to a trust, up to a maximum
of 10% of compensation, subject to certain limitations, with
Knogo making a matching contribution presently at 50% of the
first 6%. Knogo contributed to the plan approximately
$54,000 for the year ended February 28, 1994.

e. Knogo has an employment agreement with a senior
executive through May, 1996 for which Knogo has a
minimum annual commitment of approximately $300,000.

On May 10, 1994, Arthur J. Minasy, Chairman of the Board of
Directors and Chief Executive Officer, died. Knogo will pay 
a death benefit related to the termination of an employment 
contract in 24 equal monthly installments of $28,960, 
commencing in May 1994. This termination death benefit, 
with a present value of approximately $650,000 (computed at 
an effective rate of 7%), will be charged to expense in the 
first quarter of fiscal 1995.

f. In connection with intercompany transactions, Knogo
purchases future currency exchange contracts to hedge the
risk associated with fluctuations between the Belgian Franc
and the United States Dollar. At February 28, 1994, Knogo
had two equal contracts expiring through February 15, 1995
to purchase a total of $10 million United States dollars. 
The contracts mature at set rates in $400,000 increments
every two weeks during the contract period.

12. BUSINESS SEGMENT DATA

Knogo is engaged in only one segment and line of business,
the manufacture, distribution, installation and servicing of systems
designed to detect the unauthorized movement of articles and persons.

Knogo's customers are principally in the retail industry.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR 
THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1994, RELATING TO THE
COMPANY'S ACQUISITION OF KNOGO:

PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Introductory Note

The following tables set forth certain unaudited condensed
pro forma combined financial information for Sensormatic after
giving effect to the Divestiture and the Merger, using the purchase 
method of accounting as if such transaction had been consummated, 
with respect to the statement of income, on July 1, 1993 and, 
with respect to the balance sheet, as of June 30, 1994. The 
information contained in the following tables does not purport 
to be indicative of the results of operations and financial 
position of Sensormatic which may have been obtained had the 
Divestiture and the Merger with Knogo been consummated on the 
dates assumed.

The unaudited Knogo historical financial statements for the
12-month period ended May 31, 1994 have been adjusted to reflect
the division of Knogo into Knogo N.A. and "Knogo International" 
and the reversal of intercompany transactions and balances (net 
of the related income tax effect thereon) eliminated as part of 
determining the Knogo historical financial statements. The 
resulting balances (under the heading "Historical Knogo International") 
are combined with Sensormatic in the accompanying pro forma financial 
information. 

The unaudited condensed pro forma combined financial
information reflects a preliminary allocation of the purchase
price of Knogo and, accordingly, is subject to change upon, among
other things, completion of the Divestiture and the Merger with 
Knogo. A final determination of required purchase accounting 
adjustments, including the allocation of the purchase price to 
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their 
respective fair values, has not yet been made. Accordingly, 
the purchase accounting adjustments made in connection with 
the development of the unaudited condensed pro forma combined 
financial information appearing herein are preliminary and have 
been made solely for purposes of developing such pro forma 
combined financial information.

The pro forma information with respect to the Merger
assumes that 3,125,000 shares of Sensormatic Common Stock were
issued to the Shareholders at an Average Sensormatic Share Price of
$32.00 (which is equal to the closing price of a share of
Sensormatic Common Stock on the NYSE Composite Tape on August 12,
1994). If the Average Sensormatic Share Price for these purposes
had been $28.00, pro forma primary and fully diluted earnings per share
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994 would have been $1.22 and $1.18,
respectively.

*Adjustments represent primarily (i) the reversal of intercompany 
transactions and balances (and the related income tax effect thereon) 
eliminated as part of determining the Knogo Historical financial 
statement and (ii) an adjustment to reclassify depreciation on 
security devices from operating expenses to cost of revenues to 
conform to the presentation used in the Sensormatic financial 
statements.

** Knogo's historical year end is Feburary 28. These amounts represent
Knogo's operating results for the year ended February 28, 1994, minus
the quarter ended May 31, 1993, plus the quarter ended May 31, 1994.

(b) An adjustment to record the preliminary allocation
of the costs of the Merger ($100.0 million), the estimated
acquisition costs (approximately $3.0 million) and the amount of
stock issuance costs ($200,000). This adjustment also records
costs in excess of net assets acquired ($80.1 million) and
eliminates the historical Knogo International retained earnings
($37.1 million) and records additional purchase accounting reserves 
and adjustments, including the incremental costs related to the
supply agreement between Sensormatic and Knogo N.A. These 
additional purchase accounting reserves and adjustments were 
approximately $21.0 million, net of related income tax benefits.

(c) An adjustment to record the amortization of the
costs in excess of net assets acquired related to the Merger
(approximately $80.1 million) over 40 years. Amortization 
expense was approximately $2.0 million for the year ended 
June 30, 1994.

(d) An adjustment to record an estimate of the cost
savings associated with the implementation by Sensormatic of a
formal plan to reduce duplicative operating expenses arising from
the Merger. This adjustment was approximately $8.3 million for
the year ended June 30, 1994.

(e) Adjustment for costs associated with supply agreement
purchase accounting reserve (see (b) above). This adjustment was
approximately $3.6 million for the year ended June 30, 1994.

(f) To eliminate the income tax benefits related to net
operating losses of Historical Knogo International prior to the Merger,
which will be accounted for as a reduction of costs in excess of net
assets acquired as benefits are realized. This adjustment was
approximately $1.0 million for the year ended June 30, 1994.

(g) Adjustments to effectuate the Divestiture.

(h) Adjustments to record the income tax effect of the
pro forma adjustments, as applicable.
