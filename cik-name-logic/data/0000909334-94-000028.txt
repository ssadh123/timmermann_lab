Item 5. Other events - The company announced third quarter results on October
19, 1994.

Net earnings for the quarter, 12 weeks ended October 1, were $2.7 million, 
versus $20.3 million for the third quarter of 1993, a decrease of 87%. 
Quarterly earnings per share were seven cents, compared with 55 cents the
previous year, a decline of 87%.

Year to date, net sales were $11.06 billion, compared with $9.95 billion in the
same quarter in 1993, an increase of 11%. Net earnings were $45.7 million,
down 46% from $84.5 million in 1993. Earnings per share were $1.23, down 47%
from $2.30 for the same 1993 quarter.

Excluding sales from the recently acquired Scrivner, Fleming's sales for the
third quarter were $2.79 billion, a decrease of 5%, and year to date were $9.71
billion, a decrease of 2%. Sales comparisons, excluding Scrivner, were affected
by the anticipated loss of business from Albertson's and Wal-Mart, and the 
sale of a New Jersey perishables distribution facility. The partial loss of
Megafoods' business will affect future sales comparisons. An absence of
significant food inflation also contributed to the disappointing results. 
These losses were partially offset by new business from Randall's and Kmart.

Basic operating profits from food and general merchandise distribution centers
improved during the quarter, but a combination of other factors more than off-
set that performance. A major factor was the greater-than-expected losses from
certain company-owned stores, principally 21 Florida stores that have been
repositioned in the market, and the 23 recently acquired Consumers Markets in
Missouri, Arkansas and Kansas.

Third quarter credit loss expense was $21.6 million, compared to $9.3 million
in 1993, due to the continuing difficult retail environment and the bank-
ruptcy of Megafoods.

Other factors adversely affecting third quarter results included a higher tax
rate, lower sales in certain distribution centers, and larger losses from 
equity investments compared to 1993.

The current estimated annual tax rate for 1994 is 47.5%, up from 44.1% in 1993.
Scrivner-related goodwill amortization and its operations in higher tax rate
states account for much of this increase. To reach that higher level for the
year required a 73.2% effective rate in the third quarter.

The company experienced a LIFO charge of $4.7 million, compared to a LIFO
credit of $2 million in 1993. In addition, Fleming experienced higher 
interest expense, as expected, from debt related to the Scrivner acquisition.
