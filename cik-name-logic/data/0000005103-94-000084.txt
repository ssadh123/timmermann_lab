FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

AMERICAN GENERAL TO BUY 40% STAKE IN WESTERN NATIONAL CORPORATION FROM
CONSECO, INC.

Houston, December 2, 1994 -- American General Corporation (NYSE:AGC)
today announced that it has agreed to acquire 40% of the outstanding shares
of common stock of Western National Corporation (NYSE:WNH) from Conseco, Inc.
(NYSE:CNC) in an all-cash transaction. The agreement calls for American
General to purchase approximately 25 million shares of Western National common
stock for $11.00 per share or $274 million. Western National closed at $10.00
per share on December 1, 1994. The transaction, which is subject to requisite
regulatory approvals, is expected to close by year-end 1994.

In addition, American General has entered into a four-year agreement
with Western National that provides, among other things, for American General
to either vote its shares in the election of directors pro rata with the votes
cast by other holders, or vote for the slate of directors nominated by Western
National's board; to limit the form of share dispositions by American General;
and to limit additional purchases of shares by American General to not more
than 20% per year, with a total position limit of 79%. American General also
has the right to name, at its option, two directors to the Western National
board.

Western National Corporation, with headquarters in Houston has assets of
$8.5 billion and shareholders' equity of $421 million, and is the holding
company of Western National Life Insurance Company. Western National has
operating earnings of $83 million or $1.33 per share in 1993 and for the first
nine months of 1994, operating earnings were $72 million or $1.15 per share.

In commenting on the transaction, Harold S. Hook, chairman and chief
executive officer of American General, said, "Western National is a well-
managed, specialty marketer of annuity products through financial
institutions. American General has taken advantage of the opportunity to
acquire this large equity position in Western National because we believe it
represents an excellent long-term investment. And finally, it is no small
item that Western National is headed by Michael J. Poulos, retired vice
chairman of American General."
