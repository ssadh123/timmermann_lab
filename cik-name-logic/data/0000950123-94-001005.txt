EXHIBIT A

HECLA REPORTS UNFAVORABLE JURY VERDICT: $20 MILLION DAMAGES
For release 5:30 p.m. PDT, June 1, 1994

COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho -- Hecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL) announced today
that a jury sitting in Idaho State District Court entered a verdict holding
Hecla liable for $10 million in compensatory damages and an additional $10
million in punitive damages. The verdict came in a lawsuit filed by the
Star-Phoenix Mining Company, a former lessee of the Star-Morning mine, over a
dispute relating to the company's 1990 termination of Star-Phoenix's lease of
the mine. Hecla intends to vigorously appeal the verdict and strongly believes
that the evidence presented in the trial does not support the verdict.
