Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

(a) On August 31, 1994, Continental Bank Corporation ("CBC"), a
Delaware corporation, was merged (the "Merger") with and into BankAmerica
Corporation ("BAC") pursuant to a Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger dated
as of January 27, 1994 between CBC and BAC (the "Merger Agreement"). The
Merger Agreement was approved and adopted by the stockholders of CBC at the
Annual Meeting of Stockholders of CBC held on June 27, 1994. The Merger became
effective at 11:59 p.m., Pacific Time, on August 31, 1994, in accordance with
the Certificate of Merger filed by BAC with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware pursuant to Section 251 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.

In the Merger, (i) each outstanding share of CBC common stock was
converted into either .7993 shares of BAC common stock, subject to provisions
for the payment of cash for fractional shares, or $38.2970 per share in cash,
(ii) each outstanding share of CBC's Adjustable Rate Preferred Stock, Series 1
was converted into one share of BAC's Adjustable Rate Preferred Stock, Series 1
and (iii) each outstanding share of CBC's Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred
Stock, Series 2 was converted into one share of BAC's Adjustable Rate
Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 2. The terms and provisions of such BAC
preferred shares are substantially similar to the correlative series of CBC
preferred shares.

In connection with the Merger, CBC common stockholders were given the
opportunity to elect to receive either all cash or all BAC common stock, or to
make no election for their shares. According to figures from the Exchange
Agent for the transaction, holders of approximately 21.9 million CBC common
shares elected cash, holders of approximately 27.8 million CBC common shares
elected BAC common stock and holders of approximately .5 million CBC common
shares chose the "no election" preference. Shares for which no election forms
were submitted by the election deadline of August 16, 1994, were treated as "no
election" shares. Those CBC common stockholders who elected stock were also
given the opportunity to divide their CBC common stockholdings into stock
blocks of not less than 5,000 shares (the "Stock Blocks"). Holders who elected
stock and did not divide their holdings into Stock Blocks were each treated as
holding a single Stock Block.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the aggregate amount of BAC common
stock issued in the transaction was approximately 21.5 million shares and the
aggregate amount of cash paid to CBC common stockholders in the Merger was
approximately $952,000,000. Based on the allocation procedures set forth in the
Merger Agreement, there was an overelection by CBC common stockholders of
approximately .7 million shares of BAC common stock. As a result, all CBC
common stockholders who elected to receive cash or who chose or were deemed to
have chosen the "no election"

<PAGE> 3
preference, will receive cash in the amount of $38.2970 for each share of CBC
common stock. As to those CBC common stockholders who elected to receive BAC
common stock, the Exchange Agent for the transaction selected, at random, a
sufficient number of Stock Blocks to receive cash so that the number of shares
of BAC common stock issued in the Merger was approximately 21.5 million.

The funds used to pay the cash amount payable in respect to the
shares of CBC common stock and used to pay cash for fractional shares came from
BAC's general working capital funds. The nature and amount of consideration
paid to CBC stockholders in the Merger was determined by negotiation between
CBC and BAC.

The description of the Merger, and of the BAC Adjustable Rate
Preferred Stock, Series 1 and the BAC Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred
Stock, Series 2 is contained in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus of CBC and BAC
dated May 23, 1994, including the annexes thereto. A copy of the Merger
Agreement is attached as Exhibit 2 to BAC's Current Report on Form 8-K dated
March 11, 1994. Copies of the Certificates of Designation, Preferences and
Rights of BAC's Adjustable Rate Preferred Stock, Series 1, and BAC's Adjustable
Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 2 are attached as Exhibits 1 and 2,
respectively, to BAC's Registration Statement on Form 8-A dated August 1, 1994.

(b) The plant, equipment and other physical property acquired by
BAC in the Merger was not material.
