1. Representations and Warranties. The Company represents and
warrants to, each Underwriter as set forth below in this Section 1.

the Act and has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission") a registration statement (file number 33-52301) on such Form
including a Basic Prospectus, for the registration under the Act of the

-2-

Prospectus, each such amendment or Preliminary Final Prospectus has previously
been furnished to the Underwriters. Such registration statement, as amended,
has become effective. The offering of the Pass Through Certificates is a
Delayed Offering and, accordingly, it is not necessary that any further
information has been included in an amendment to such Registration Statement
prior to the Effective Date with respect to the Pass-Through Certificates and
the offering thereof required by the Act and the rules thereunder to be
included in the Final Prospectus. The Company will next file with the
Commission pursuant to Rules 415, 424(b)(2) or (5) and 429 a final supplement
to the form of prospectus included in such Registration Statement relating to
the Pass-Through Certificates and the offering thereof. As filed, such Final
Prospectus supplement shall include all required information with respect to
the Pass-Through Certificates and the offering thereof and, except to the
extent the Underwriters shall agree in writing to a modification, shall be in
all substantive respects in the form furnished to the Underwriters prior to the
Execution Time or, to the extent not completed at the Execution Time, shall
contain only such specific additional information and other changes (beyond
that contained in the Basic Prospectus and any Preliminary Final Prospectus) as
the Company has advised the Underwriters, prior to the Execution Time, will be
included or made therein.

(b) On the Effective Date, the Registration Statement did or will, and
when the Final Prospectus is first filed (if required) in accordance with Rule
424(b) and on the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined), the Final Prospectus

applicable requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act, and the respective
rules and regulations thereunder, on the Effective Date, the Registration
Statement did not or will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein not misleading; on the Effective Date
and on the Closing Date, the Basic Agreement and the Trust Supplement did or
will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), and the rules
thereunder; and, on the Effective Date, the Final Prospectus, if not filed
pursuant to Rule 424(b), did not or will not, and on the date of any filing
pursuant to Rule 424(b) and on the Closing Date, the Final Prospectus (together
with any supplements thereto) will not, include any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; provided, however, that the Company makes no
representations or warranties as to (i) that part of the Registration Statement
which shall constitute the Statement of Eligibility (Form T-1) under the Trust
Indenture Act of the Trustee and (ii) the information contained in or omitted

consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods
specified and have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved, except as indicated therein, and the supporting schedules

information required to be stated therein.

(d) The documents incorporated by reference in the Basic Prospectus,
any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the Final Prospectus, at the time they were

reference in any document filed with the Commission after the date as of which
this representation is being made) will comply in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.

default under, the Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws, as amended, of the
Company or any agreement or instrument binding upon the Company or any of its
subsidiaries that is material to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole, or any provision of applicable law, judgment, order or decree of any

2. Purchase and Sale. Subject to the terms and conditions and in
reliance upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company
agrees to cause the Trustee to sell to each Underwriter, and each Underwriter
agrees, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Trustee, at a purchase
price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest, if any, on
the Pass Through Certificates from August 16, 1994 to the Closing Date, the
principal amount of the Pass Through Certificates set forth opposite such
Underwriter's name in Schedule B hereto.

As compensation to the Underwriters for their commitment and obligations
hereunder in respect of the Pass Through Certificates, including their
undertaking to offer the Pass Through Certificates for sale to the public, the
Company will pay, or cause to be paid to the Underwriters by the Owner Trustee
pursuant to the Participation Agreement, an amount equal to 0.8% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Pass Through Certificates. Such payment
shall be made simultaneously with the payment by the Underwriters to the
Trustee of the purchase price of the Pass Through Certificates as specified in
Section 3 hereof. Payment of such compensation shall be made by Federal funds
check or other immediately available funds to the order of Salomon Brothers
Inc.

3. Delivery and Payment. Delivery of and payment for the Pass Through
Certificates shall be made on the date and at the time and location specified

<PAGE> 7
may be postponed by agreement between the Underwriters and the Company (such
date and time of delivery and payment for the Pass Through Certificates being
herein called the "Closing Date"). Delivery of the Pass Through Certificates
shall be made to each of the Underwriters' respective accounts at The
Depository Trust Company against payment by the Underwriters of the purchase
price thereof to or upon the order of the Trustee by Federal funds check or
other immediately available funds. The Pass Through Certificates shall be
registered in such names and in such denominations as each Underwriter may
request not less than three full business days in advance of the Closing Date
or such other date as may be agreed upon.

The Company agrees to have the Pass Through Certificates available for
inspection, checking and packaging by the Underwriters in New York, not later
than 1:00 p.m. on the business day prior to the Closing Date.

4. Offering by Underwriters. It is understood that, after this
Agreement has been entered into and the Registration Statement becomes
effective, the Underwriters propose to offer the Pass Through Certificates for
sale to the public as set forth in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final
Prospectus and the Final Prospectus.

5. Agreements. The Company agrees with the Underwriters that:

(a) The Company will use its best efforts to cause the Registration
Statement, if not effective at the Execution Time, and any amendment thereof,
to become effective and the Basic Agreement to be qualified under the Trust
Indenture Act. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company will not file any
amendment of the Registration Statement or supplement to the Final Prospectus
unless the Company has furnished the Underwriters a copy for your review prior
to filing and will not file any such proposed amendment or supplement to which
the Underwriters reasonably object. Subject to the foregoing sentence, if
filing of the Final Prospectus is required under Rule 424(b), the Company will
cause the Final Prospectus, properly completed, and any supplement thereto to
be filed with the Commission pursuant to the applicable paragraph of Rule
424(b) within the time period prescribed and will provide evidence satisfactory
to the Underwriters of such timely filing. The Company will promptly advise
the Underwriters (i) when the Registration Statement, if not effective at the
Execution Time, and any amendment thereto, shall have become effective, (ii)
when the Final Prospectus, and any supplement thereto, shall have been filed
(if required) with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b), (iii) when, prior to
termination of the offering of the Pass Through Certificates, any amendment to
the Registration Statement shall have been filed or become effective, (iv) of
any request by the Commission for any amendment of the Registration Statement
or

-7-
<PAGE> 8
supplement to the Final Prospectus or for any additional information, (v) of
the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness
of the Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any
proceeding for that purpose, (vi) of the receipt by the Company of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Pass
Through Certificates for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or
threatening of any proceeding for such purpose and (vii) during the period when
a prospectus relating to the Pass Through Certificates is required to be
delivered under the Act, of the mailing or the delivery to the Commission for
filing of any document to be filed pursuant to the Exchange Act. The Company
will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and,
if issued, to obtain as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.

(b) If at any time when a prospectus relating to the Pass Through
Certificates is required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a
result of which the Final Prospectus as then supplemented would include any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to
amend the Registration Statement or supplement the Final Prospectus to comply
with the Act or the Exchange Act or the respective rules and regulations
thereunder, the Company promptly will prepare and file with the Commission,
subject to paragraph (a) of this Section 5, an amendment or supplement which
will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect such
compliance.

(c) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally available
to its security holders and to the Underwriters an earnings statement or
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the
provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and the applicable rules and regulations
thereunder.

(d) The Company will furnish to each Underwriter and the Underwriters'
counsel, without charge, a signed copy of the Registration Statement (including
exhibits thereto and materials incorporated by reference therein) and, so long
as delivery of a prospectus by the Underwriters or a dealer may be required by
the Act, as many copies of the Basic Prospectus, each Preliminary Final
Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and any amendments thereof and supplements
thereto as any Underwriter may reasonably request.

(e) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Pass Through
Certificates for sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as each of you may
designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as required for
the distribution of the Pass Through Certificates; provided, however, that the
Company will not be required to file any general consent to service of process
or qualify to do business in any jurisdiction in order to effect such
qualification.

-8-
<PAGE> 9
(f) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, the
Company will not without the Underwriters' prior written consent offer, sell,
or enter into any agreement to sell, any public debt securities registered
under the Act which are substantially similar to the Pass Through Certificates
(other than the Pass Through Certificates).

(g) As of the date hereof it is in compliance with all provisions of
Section 1 of Laws of Florida, Chapter 92-198, An Act Relating to Disclosure of
Doing Business with Cuba, and the Company further agrees that if it commences
engaging in business with the government of Cuba or with any person or
affiliate located in Cuba after the date the Registration Statement becomes or
has become effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission or with the
Florida Department of Banking and Finance (the "Department"), whichever date is
later, or if the information reported in the Final Prospectus, if any,
concerning the Company's business with Cuba or with any person or affiliate
located in Cuba changes in any material way, the Company will provide the
Department notice of such business or change, as appropriate, in a form
acceptable to the Department.

6. Conditions to the Obligation of the Underwriters. The
Underwriters' obligation to purchase the Pass Through Certificates shall be
subject to the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of
the Company contained herein as of the Execution Time and the Closing Date, to
the accuracy of the statements of the Company made in any certificates
delivered pursuant to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company
of its obligations hereunder and to the following additional conditions:

(a) If the Registration Statement has not become effective prior to the
Execution Time, the Registration Statement shall have become effective not
later than (i) 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of determination of
the public offering price, if such determination occurred at or prior to 3:00
p.m., New York City time, on such date or (ii) 12:00 noon on the business day
following the day on which the public offering price was determined, if such
determination occurred after 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on such date; if
filing of the Final Prospectus, or any supplement thereto, is required pursuant
to Rule 424(b), the Final Prospectus, and any such supplement, shall have been
filed in the manner and within the time period required by Rule 424(b); and no
stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement shall
have been issued and no proceedings for that purpose shall have been instituted
or threatened.

(b) The representations and warranties of the Company contained in the
Participation Agreement, the Lease and other Operative Agreements shall be true
and correct in all material respects on and as of the Closing Date with the
same effect as

-9-
<PAGE> 10
though such representations and warranties had been made on and as of such
date, and the Company shall have delivered to you a certificate, dated the
Closing Date, signed in each case by the President or any Vice President and
its principal financial or accounting officer to the effect that the signers of
such certificate have carefully examined the Participation Agreement, the Lease
and other Operative Agreements, the Registration Statement, the Preliminary
Final Prospectus and the Final Prospectus and that:

(i) The representations and warranties of the Company in the
Participation Agreement, the Lease and the other Operative Agreements, to
which the Company is, or is to be, a party are true and correct in all
material respects on and as of the Closing Date as if made on and as of
the Closing Date.

(ii) The Company has complied with all the agreements and
satisfied all the conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied on
or prior to the Closing Date pursuant to the terms of the Basic
Agreement, the Trust Supplement, the Participation Agreement, the Lease
and the other Operative Agreements, to which the Company is, or is to be,
a party.

(iii) Nothing has come to their attention that would lead either
of them to believe that the Registration Statement contains any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(c) The Company shall have furnished to the Underwriters and the rating
agencies (if so required) the opinion of Ronald J. Ciancio, counsel to the
Company, dated the Closing Date, in form reasonably satisfactory to the
Underwriters, the rating agencies and to Winston & Strawn, special counsel for
the Underwriters, to the effect that:

(i) the Company and each Significant Subsidiary has been duly
incorporated and is validly existing as a corporation in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is chartered or organized,
with full corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct
its business as described in the Final Prospectus, and is duly qualified
to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the
laws of each jurisdiction which requires such qualification wherein it
owns or leases material properties or conducts material business, except
in such jurisdictions in which the failure to so qualify would not have a
material adverse effect on the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a
whole;

-10-
<PAGE> 11

Agreement, the Basic Agreement, the Trust Supplement, the Lease and the
other Operative Agreements to which the Company is, or is to be, a party;

through wholly owned subsidiaries free and clear of any perfected
security interest and, to the knowledge of such counsel, after due
inquiry, any other security interests, claims, liens or encumbrances;

(iv) there is no pending or, to the best knowledge of such

bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
affecting enforcement of creditors' rights generally and by general
principles of equity and, except, in the case of the Lease, as limited by
applicable laws which may affect the remedies provided in the Lease,
which laws, however, do not in such counsel's opinion make the remedies

Each of Ronald J. Ciancio, counsel to the Company, and Mayer, Brown & Platt,

not checked the accuracy or completeness of the statements contained in the
Registration Statement, in the course of such counsel's review and discussion
of the contents of the Registration Statement with certain officers and
employees of the Company, the Underwriters and their counsel and its
independent accountants, but without independent check or verification, such
counsel has no reason to believe that the Registration Statement or any
amendment thereof (other than the financial statements, including the notes
thereto, and related schedules and other financial and statistical information
contained therein as to which such counsel need express no opinion) at the
Effective Date contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading or that the Final Prospectus, as amended or
supplemented as of the Closing Date (other than the financial statements,
including the notes thereto, and related schedules and other financial and
statistical information contained therein as to which such counsel need express
no opinion), includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state
a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. In rendering the
foregoing opinions, each such counsel may rely as to matters of fact, to the
extent deemed proper, on certificates of responsible officers of the Company
and public officials.

(e) The Underwriters and the rating agencies (if so required) shall
have received from the Law Department of The First National

-15-

Bank of Chicago, counsel for The First National Bank of Chicago ("First
Chicago"), individually, as Trustee and Indenture Trustee, an opinion, dated
the Closing Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Underwriters, the rating agencies and Winston & Strawn, special counsel for the
Underwriters, to the effect that:

(i) First Chicago is a national banking association duly
organized and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the
United States, and, in its individual capacity or as Trustee or Indenture
Trustee, as the case may be, has full corporate power and authority to
execute, deliver and carry out the terms of the Indenture, the
Participation Agreement, the Basic Agreement, the Trust Supplement and
the other Operative Agreements to which it is, or is to be, a party;

(ii) First Chicago, the Trustee or the Indenture Trustee, as the
case may be, has duly authorized, executed and delivered the
Participation Agreement, the Basic Agreement, the Trust Supplement and
the Indenture; the Basic Agreement, the Trust Supplement and the
Participation Agreement constitute the valid and binding obligations of
First Chicago, the Trustee or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be,
enforceable against First Chicago, the Trustee or the Indenture Trustee,
as the case may be, in accordance with their respective terms, except as
enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar laws affecting enforcement of creditors'
rights generally, and except as enforcement thereof is subject to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law);

(iii) the Pass Through Certificates have been duly authorized and
validly executed, authenticated, issued and delivered by the Trustee,
pursuant to the Basic Agreement and the Trust Supplement; and the holders
of the Pass Through Certificates are entitled to the benefits of the
Basic Agreement and the Trust Supplement;

(iv) the authorization, execution, delivery and performance by
First Chicago, the Trustee or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be,
of the Indenture, the Participation Agreement, the Basic Agreement, the
Trust Supplement and the other Operative Agreements to which it is or
will be party and the consummation of the transactions therein
contemplated and compliance with the terms thereof and the issuance of
the Pass Through Certificates thereunder do not and will not result in
the violation of the provisions of the Articles of Association or By-Laws
of First Chicago, and do not and will not conflict with, or result in a
breach of any terms or provisions of, or constitute a default under, or

-16-
<PAGE> 17
result in the creation or the imposition of any lien, charge or
encumbrance upon any property or assets of First Chicago, the Trustee or
the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, under any indenture, mortgage
or other agreement or instrument known to such counsel to which the
Trustee or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, is a party or by
which it or any of its property is bound, or any state or Federal law,
rule or regulation governing First Chicago's, the Trustee's or the
Indenture Trustee's banking or trust powers, or of any judgment, order or
decree known to such counsel to be applicable to First Chicago, the
Trustee or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, of any court,
regulatory body, administrative agency, government or governmental body
having jurisdiction of First Chicago, the Trustee or the Indenture
Trustee or its properties;

(v) no authorization, approval, consent, license or order of,
giving of notice to, registration with, or taking of any other action in
respect of, any Federal or state governmental authority or agency
pursuant to any Federal or state law governing the banking or trust
powers of First Chicago, the Trustee or the Indenture Trustee is required
for the authorization, execution, delivery and performance by First
Chicago, the Trustee or the Indenture Trustee of the Indenture, the
Participation Agreement, the Basic Agreement, the Trust Supplement and
the other Operative Agreements to which it is or will be a party or the
consummation of any of the transactions by the Trustee or Indenture
Trustee contemplated thereby or the issuance of the Pass Through
Certificates under the Basic Agreement and the Trust Supplement (except
as shall have been duly obtained, given or taken); and such
authorization, execution, delivery, performance, consummation and
issuance do not conflict with or result in a breach of the provisions of
any such law;

(vi) no filing or recording of any document or instrument was or
is necessary to establish and perfect the security interest created by
the Indenture in all estate, right, title and interest of the Owner
Trustee in and to the Lease (and the Lease Supplement) covering the
Equipment (other than Excepted Property), and to establish and perfect
the Indenture Trustee's estate, right and interest in and to the
Equipment on the date of the Indenture, except for such filings with the
Interstate Commerce Commission as are required; and

(vii) assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of the
Indenture Supplements covering the Equipment by the Owner Trustee, such
Indenture Supplement will, to the extent that Illinois law is applicable
thereto and on the basis of the law on the date of the opinion, subject
the Equipment covered thereby to the security interest created by the
related Indenture.

-17-
<PAGE> 18
Such opinion shall be to such further effect with respect to other legal
matters relating to the Indentures, the Participation Agreements, the Basic
Agreement, the Trust Supplement and the other Operative Agreements, to which
First Chicago, the Trustee or the Indenture Trustee is, or is to be, a party,
and the sale of Pass Through Certificates hereunder as counsel for the
Underwriters may reasonably request. In giving such opinion, the Law
Department of The First National Bank of Chicago (A) may state that no opinion
is expressed as to laws other than the laws of the State of Illinois and
Federal law, (B) may rely as to the opinions expressed in clauses (ii) and
(iii), insofar as they involve matters relating to the laws of the State of New
York, upon the opinions referred to in Section 6(c) and (d) hereof, in which
case the opinion shall state that they believe that they and the Underwriters
are entitled to so rely and (C) may assume as to the opinions expressed in
clause (ii) relating to the Participation Agreement, insofar as they involve
matters relating to the laws of the State of New York, that such Participation
Agreement constitute legal, valid and binding instruments under such laws.

(f) The Underwriters shall have received from Winston & Strawn, special
counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or opinions, dated the Closing Date,
with respect to the issuance and sale of the Pass Through Certificates, the
Basic Agreement, the Trust Supplement, the Registration Statement, the Final
Prospectus and other related matters as the Underwriters may reasonably
require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such documents as
they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon such matters.

(g) The Company shall have furnished to the Underwriters a certificate
of the Company, signed by the President or any Vice President and the principal
financial officer of the Company, dated the Closing Date, to the effect that
the signers of such certificate have carefully examined the Registration
Statement, the Final Prospectus and this Agreement and that:

(i) the representations and warranties of the Company in this
Agreement are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the
Closing Date with the same effect as if made on the Closing Date and the
Company has complied with all the agreements and satisfied all the
conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied at or prior to the
Closing Date;

(ii) no stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement has been issued and, to the Company's knowledge,
no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or threatened; and

(iii) since the date of the most recent financial statements
included in the Final Prospectus, there has been no material adverse
change in the business, properties,

-18-
<PAGE> 19
condition (financial or otherwise) or results of operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, whether or not arising
from transactions in the ordinary course of business, except as set forth
in or contemplated in the Final Prospectus.

(h) At the Execution Time and at the Closing Date, Ernst & Young shall
have furnished to the Underwriters a letter or letters, dated, respectively, as
of the Execution Time and as of the Closing Date, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Underwriters, confirming that they are independent
accountants within the meaning of the Act and the Exchange Act and the
applicable published rules and regulations thereunder and stating in effect
that:

(i) in their opinion the audited financial statements and
financial statement schedules included or incorporated in the
Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and reported on by them
comply in form in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements of the Act and the Exchange Act and the related published
rules and regulations;

(ii) on the basis of a reading of the latest unaudited financial
statements made available by the Company and its subsidiaries; carrying
out certain specified procedures (but not an examination in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards) which would not necessarily
reveal matters of significance with respect to the comments set forth in
such letter; a reading of the minutes of the meetings of the
stockholders, directors of the Company and standing committees thereof;
and inquiries of certain officials of the Company who have responsibility
for financial and accounting matters of the Company and its subsidiaries
as to transactions and events subsequent to the date of the most recent
audited financial statements included or incorporated in the Final
Prospectus, nothing came to their attention which caused them to believe
that:

(1) any unaudited financial statements included or
incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus
do not comply in form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the Commission with respect to financial statements
included or incorporated in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q under
the Exchange Act; and said unaudited financial statements are not
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied
on a basis substantially consistent with that of the audited
financial statements included or incorporated in the Registration
Statement and the Final Prospectus;

(2) with respect to the period subsequent to the date of
the most recent financial statements (other than

-19-
<PAGE> 20
any capsule information), audited or unaudited, in or incorporated 
in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, there were 
any changes (except for changes occurring in the normal course of 
business), at a specified date not more than five business days 
prior to the date of the letter, in the advances to, investments 
in or receivables from related parties, or in the capital stock or 
long term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries or any decreases
in the shareholders' equity of the Company or consolidated net 
current assets or net assets as compared with the amounts shown on 
the most recent consolidated balance sheet included or incorporated
in the Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus, or for the 
period from the date of the most recent financial statements 
included or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the 
Final Prospectus to such specified date there were any decreases, 
as compared with the corresponding period in the preceding year in 
net operating revenues or in income before income taxes and net 
income of the Company and its subsidiaries, except in all instances
for changes or decreases set forth in such letter; or

(3) the amounts included in any unaudited "capsule"
information included or incorporated in the Registration Statement
and the Final Prospectus do not agree with the amounts set forth in
the unaudited financial statements for the same periods or were not
determined on a basis substantially consistent with that of the
corresponding amounts in the audited financial statements included
or incorporated in the Registration Statement and the Final
Prospectus; and

(iii) they have performed certain other specified procedures as a
result of which they determined that certain information of an
accounting, financial or statistical nature (which is limited to
accounting, financial or statistical information derived from the general
accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries) set forth in the
Registration Statement and the Final Prospectus and in Exhibit 12 to the
Registration Statement, agrees with the accounting records of the Company
and it subsidiaries, excluding any questions of legal interpretation.

References to the Final Prospectus in paragraph (h) include any supplement
thereto at the date of the letter.

(i) Subsequent to the Execution Time or, if earlier, the respective
dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the
Final Prospectus there shall not have been (i) any change or decrease specified
in the letters referred to in paragraph (h) of this Section 6 or (ii) any
change,

-20-
<PAGE> 21
or any development involving a prospective change, in or affecting the
business, properties, condition (financial or other), or results of operation
of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, the effect of which, in
any case referred to in clause (i) or (ii) above, is, in the reasonable
judgment of the Underwriters, so material and adverse as to make it impractical
or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the delivery of the Pass
Through Certificates as contemplated by the Registration Statement and the
Final Prospectus.

(j) Subsequent to the Execution Time and prior to the Closing Date,
there shall have been any decrease in the rating of any of the Company's
long-term debt securities by S&P or Moody's or any notice given of any intended
or potential decrease in any such rating or of any review of or possible change
in any such rating that does not indicate the direction of the possible change.

(k) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall have furnished or
caused to be furnished to the Underwriters and the rating agencies such further
information, certificates, opinions and documents as either Underwriter or the
rating agencies may reasonably request.

If any of the conditions specified in this Section 6 shall not have been
fulfilled in all material respects when and as provided in this Agreement, or
if any of the opinions and certificates mentioned above or elsewhere in this
Agreement shall not be in all material respects reasonably satisfactory in form
and substance to the Underwriters and your counsel, this Agreement and all your
obligations hereunder may be canceled at, or at any time prior to, the Closing
Date by the Underwriters. Notice of such cancellation shall be given to the
Company in writing or by telephone or telegraph confirmed in writing.

7. Payment by the Company of Certain Expenses. Whether or not any
sale of the Pass Through Certificates is consummated, the Company agrees to pay
or cause to be paid all of the Company's expenses incident to the performance
of its obligations under this Agreement, the Basic Agreement and the related
Trust Supplement, including, but not limited to:

(i) the preparation, printing and distribution of this
Agreement, the Registration Statement, the Basic Prospectus, the
Preliminary Final Prospectus, the Final Prospectus and all amendments and
supplements to the foregoing, the Basic Agreement, the Trust Supplement
and each of the other Operative Agreements,

(ii) the preparation, issuance and delivery of the Pass Through
Certificates,

-21-
<PAGE> 22
(iii) the fees and disbursements of the Company's counsel and
accountants,

(iv) the qualification of the Pass Though Certificates under
securities or Blue Sky laws in accordance with the provisions of Section
5(e), including filing fees and the fees and disbursements of your
counsel in connection therewith and in connection with the preparation of
any Blue Sky memorandum,

(v) the fees and expenses of the Trustee and the fees and 
disbursements of counsel for the Trustee, and

(vi) any fees charged by rating agencies for the rating of the
Pass Through Certificates,

provided, however, that the Company shall be under no obligation to pay or
cause to be paid, the fees and disbursements of your counsel in connection with
item (iv) above, if the sale of the Pass Through Certificates is not
consummated as a result of the breach by the Underwriters of their obligations
hereunder.

In addition to the foregoing, the Company agrees to pay certain fees and
disbursements of the Underwriters' counsel as agreed in the Participation
Agreement.

8. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter, the directors, officers,
employees and agents of each Underwriter and each person who controls any
Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act against
any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which
they or any of them may become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other
Federal or state statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise,
insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement for the
registration of the Pass Through Certificates as originally filed or in any
amendment thereof, or in the Basic Prospectus, any Preliminary Final Prospectus
or the Final Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such
indemnified party, as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any such loss,
claim, damage, liability or action, provided, however, that (i) the Company
will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim,
damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in
reliance upon and in conformity with

-22-
<PAGE> 23
written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of any Underwriter
specifically for inclusion therein, and (ii) such indemnity with respect to the
Basic Prospectus or any Preliminary Final Prospectus shall not inure to the
benefit of any Underwriter (or to the benefit of any person controlling such
Underwriter) if the person asserting any such loss, claim, damage or liability
purchased the Pass Through Certificates which are the subject thereof but did
not receive a copy of the Final Prospectus (or the Final Prospectus as amended
or supplemented), excluding documents incorporated therein by reference, at or
prior to the confirmation of the sale of such Pass Through Certificates, in any
case where (A) such delivery is required by the Act, (B) the untrue statement
or omission of a material fact contained in such Basic Prospectus or
Preliminary Final Prospectus was corrected in the Final Prospectus (or the
Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented) and (C) if a copy of such Final
Prospectus (or Final Prospectus as amended or supplemented) had been so sent or
given, such delivery would have cured the defect giving rise to the claim
asserted by such person. This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any
liability which the Company may otherwise have.

(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
the Company, each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the
Registration Statement, and each person who controls the Company within the
meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the
foregoing indemnity from the Company to each Underwriter, but only with
reference to written information relating to such Underwriter furnished to the
Company by or on behalf of such Underwriter specifically for inclusion in the
documents referred to in clause (a) of this Section 8. This indemnity
agreement will be in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may
otherwise have. The Company acknowledges that the statements set forth under
the heading "Underwriting" in any Preliminary Final Prospectus and the Final
Prospectus constitute the only information furnished in writing by or on behalf
of the Underwriters for inclusion in any Preliminary Final Prospectus or the
Final Prospectus, and the Underwriters confirm that such statements are
correct.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 8
of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under
this Section 8, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement
thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party (i) will not
relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and to the
extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results in
the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses and
(ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any
obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation
provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party

-23-
<PAGE> 24
shall be entitled to appoint counsel of the indemnifying party's choice at the
indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any action
for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party shall
not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate counsel
retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below);
provided, however, that such counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
indemnified party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to
appoint counsel to represent the indemnified party in an action, the
indemnified party shall have the right to employ one separate counsel and one
local counsel for all such indemnified parties in such action, and the
indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such
separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the indemnifying party to
represent the indemnified party would present such counsel with a conflict of
interest, (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or targets of, any such
action include both the indemnified party and the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded that there may be legal
defenses available to it and/or other indemnified parties which are different
from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, (iii) the
indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel satisfactory to the
indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within a reasonable time
after notice of the institution of such action or (iv) the indemnifying party
shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate counsel at the expense
of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will not, without the prior
written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim,
action, suit or proceeding in respect of which indemnification or contribution
may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or
potential parties to such claim or action) unless such settlement, compromise
or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all
liability arising out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding.

(d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or
(b) of this Section 8 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party for any reason, the Company and the Underwriters agree to
contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating or
defending same) (collectively "Losses") to which the Company and one or more of
the Underwriters may be subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect
the relative benefits received by the Company and by the Underwriters from the
offering of the Pass Through Certificates; provided, however, that in no case
shall any Underwriter (except as may be provided in any agreement among
underwriters relating to the offering of the Pass Through Certificates) be
responsible for any amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission
applicable to the Pass

-24-
<PAGE> 25
Through Certificates purchased by such Underwriter hereunder. If the
allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is unavailable for
any reason, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but
also the relative fault of the Company and of the Underwriters in connection
with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received by the Company shall
be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the offering (before
deducting expenses), and benefits received by the Underwriters shall be deemed
to be equal to the total underwriting discounts and commissions, in each case
as set forth on the cover page of the Prospectus. Relative fault shall be
determined by reference to whether any alleged untrue statement or omission
relates to information provided by the Company or the Underwriters. The
Company and the Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution were determined by pro rata allocation or any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred
to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of
the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty
of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 8, each
person who controls an Underwriter within the meaning of either the Act or the
Exchange Act and each director, officer, employee and agent of an Underwriter
shall have the same rights to contribution as such Underwriter, and each person
who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange
Act, each officer of the Company who shall have signed the Registration
Statement and each director of the Company shall have the same rights to
contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and
conditions of this paragraph (d).

9. Termination. This Agreement shall be subject to termination in the
Underwriters' absolute discretion by notice given to the Company prior to
delivery of and payment for the Pass Through Certificates, if prior to such
time (i) trading in securities of the Company or of GATX Corporation, the
Company's corporate parent (the "Parent"), shall have been suspended by the
Commission, trading in the Parent's securities shall have been suspended by the
New York Stock Exchange or the Chicago Stock Exchange or trading in securities
generally on the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited
or minimum prices shall have been established on such Exchange, (ii) a banking
moratorium shall have been declared either by Federal or New York State
authorities, or (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or material
escalation of hostilities, declaration by the United States of a national
emergency or war or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on financial
markets is such as to make it, in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriters,
impracticable to market the Pass Though Certificates.

-25-
<PAGE> 26
If the sale of the Pass Through Certificates provided for herein is not
consummated because any condition to the Underwriters' obligation set forth in
Section 6 hereof is not satisfied, because of any termination pursuant to
Section 9 hereof or because of any refusal, inability or failure on the part of
the Company to perform any agreement herein or comply with any provision hereof
other than by reason of a default by any Underwriter, the Company will
reimburse the Underwriters upon demand for all out-of-pocket expenses
(including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) that shall have been
incurred by each of you in connection with the proposed purchase and sale of
the Pass Through Certificates.

10. Representations and Indemnities to Survive. The respective
agreements, representations, warranties, indemnities and other statements of
the Company or its officers and of the Underwriters set forth in or made
pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of any Underwriter or the Company or any
of the officers, directors or controlling persons referred to in Section 8
hereof, and will survive delivery of and payment for the Pass Through
Certificates. The provisions of Sections 7 and 8 hereof shall survive the
termination or cancellation of this Agreement.

11. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and
effective only on receipt, and, if sent to the Underwriters, will be mailed,
delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to them, at the address specified in
Schedule A hereto; or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered or
telegraphed and confirmed to it at 500 West Monroe Street, Chicago, Illinois
60661-3676, Attention: Secretary.

12. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the parties hereto and their respective successors and the
officers and directors and controlling persons referred to in Section 8 hereof,
and no other person will have any right or obligation hereunder.

13. Applicable Law. This Agreement will be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

[REVERSE OF CERTIFICATE]

The Certificates do not represent a direct obligation of, or an
obligation guaranteed by, or an interest in, the Company or the Trustee or any
affiliate thereof. The Certificates are limited in right of payment, all as
more specifically set forth on the face hereof and in the Agreement. All
payments or distributions made to Certificateholders under the Agreement shall
be made only from the Trust Property and only to the extent that the Trustee
shall have sufficient income or proceeds from the Trust Property to make such
payments in accordance with the terms of the Agreement. Each Holder of this
Certificate, by its acceptance hereof, agrees that it will look solely to the
income and proceeds from the Trust Property to the extent available for
distribution to such Holder as provided in the Agreement. This Certificate
does not purport to summarize the Agreement and reference is made to the
Agreement for information with respect to the interests, rights, benefits,
obligations, proceeds, and duties evidenced hereby. A copy of the Agreement
may be examined during normal business hours at the principal office of the
Trustee, and at such other places, if any, designated by the Trustee, by any
Certificateholder upon request.

The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Certificateholders under the Agreement at any
time by the Company and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of
Certificates evidencing Fractional Undivided Interests aggregating not less
than a majority in interest in the Trust. Any such consent by the Holder of
this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder and upon all
future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued upon the
transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof whether or not notation
of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also permits the
amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the consent of the
Holders of any of the Certificates.

As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the
Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration of transfer at the
offices or agencies maintained by the Trustee in its capacity as Registrar, or
by any successor Registrar, in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York,
duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Trustee and the Registrar duly executed by the Holder
hereof or such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one
or more new Certificates of authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Fractional Undivided Interest in the Trust will be issued to the
designated transferee or transferees.

-1-
<PAGE> 14
The Certificates are issuable only as registered Certificates without
coupons in denominations of $1,000 Fractional Undivided Interest and any
integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof except that one Certificate may
be in a denomination of less than $1,000. As provided in the Agreement and
subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable
for new Certificates of authorized denominations and like series evidencing the
same aggregate Fractional Undivided Interest in the Trust, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer 
or exchange, but the Trustee shall require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

The Trustee, the Registrar, and any agent of the Trustee or the
Registrar may treat the person in whose name this Certificate is registered as
the owner hereof for all purposes, and neither the Trustee, the Registrar, nor

successors and assigns, for the security and benefit of the holders of the
Equipment Notes from time to time, a security interest in and mortgage lien on
all right, title and interest of the Owner Trustee in and to the following
described property, rights, interests and privileges insofar as it does not
constitute Excepted Property (which collectively, including all property
hereafter required to be subjected to the Lien of this Indenture by any
instrument supplemental hereto, but excluding Excepted Property, being herein
called the "Indenture Estate"), to wit:

(1) the Lease, including, without limitation, all amounts
of Basic Rent, Supplemental Rent, insurance proceeds and other
payments of any kind for or with respect to the Equipment, subject to
Lessee's rights under the Lease, including, without limitation,
Lessee's right of quiet enjoyment;

(2) the Equipment, the Replacement Units and all
substitutions therefor in which the Owner Trustee shall from time to
time acquire an interest under the Lease, all as more particularly
described in the Indenture Supplements and Lease Supplements executed
and delivered with respect to the Equipment or any such Replacement
Units or any substitutions therefor, as provided in this Indenture and
the Lease;

(3) all requisition proceeds with respect to the
Equipment or any Unit thereof (to the extent of the Owner Trustee's
interest therein pursuant to the terms of the Lease);

(4) all monies and securities now or hereafter paid or
deposited or required to be paid or deposited with the Indenture
Trustee pursuant to any term of this Indenture, the Lease or the
Participation Agreement or required to be held by the Indenture
Trustee hereunder or thereunder; and

(5) all proceeds of the foregoing.

(a) there shall be excluded from the foregoing sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance, mortgage, pledge or security
interest granted by this Indenture and from the Indenture
Estate all Excepted Property;

(b) (i) the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant

percentages relating to Stipulated Loss Value and Termination Value as
provided in Section 3.4 of the Lease and Section 2.6 of the
Participation Agreement;

-2-
<PAGE> 7
(ii) the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee shall
each retain the right to receive from Lessee all notices,
certificates, reports, filings, opinions of Counsel, copies of all
documents and all information which the Lessee is permitted or
required to give or furnish to the Lessor pursuant to the Lease or to
the Owner Trustee pursuant to any other Operative Agreement and to
exercise the inspection rights provided for in Section 13.2 of the
Lease, to give any notice of default under Section 15 of the Lease and
to retain the right to cause the Lessee to take any action and execute
and deliver such documents and assurances as the Lessor may from time
to time reasonably request pursuant to Section 16.2 of the Lease; and

(iii) so long as no Indenture Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing (but subject to the provisions of Section
9.05), the Owner Trustee shall retain the right, to the exclusion of
the Indenture Trustee, to exercise all rights of the Lessor under the
Lease (other than the right to receive any funds to be delivered to
the Lessor under the Lease (except funds which constitute or are
delivered with respect to Excepted Property)); and

(c) the leasehold interest granted to the Lessee under
the Lease shall not be subject to the security interest granted by
this Indenture, and nothing in this Indenture shall affect the rights
of the Lessee under the Lease so long as no Lease Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing.

(d) as between the Owner Trustee and the Indenture
Trustee, nothing contained in this Granting Clause shall prevent the
Owner Trustee, as the Lessor under the Lease, from seeking specific
performance of the covenants of the Lessee under the Lease relating to
the insurance, maintenance, possession and use of the Units and from
maintaining separate insurance with respect to the Units to the extent
permitted by Section 12.5 of the Lease.

TO HAVE AND TO HOLD all and singular the aforesaid property
unto the Indenture Trustee, its successors and assigns, in trust for the
benefit and security of the holders of the Equipment Notes from time to time,
without any priority of any one Equipment Note over any other, and for the uses
and purposes, and subject to the terms and provisions, set forth in this
Indenture.

It is expressly agreed that anything herein contained to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Owner Trustee shall remain liable under each of
the Operative Agreements to which it is a party to perform all of the
obligations, if any, assumed by it thereunder, all in accordance with and
pursuant to the terms and provisions thereof, and the Indenture Trustee and the
holders of the Equipment Notes shall have no obligation or liability under any
of the Operative Agreements to which the Owner Trustee is a party by reason of
or arising out of this assignment, nor shall the Indenture Trustee (unless the
Indenture Trustee shall have become the "Lessor" under the Lease) or the
holders of the Equipment Notes be required or obligated in any manner to
perform or fulfill any obligations of the Owner Trustee under or pursuant to
any of the Operative Agreements to which the Owner Trustee is a party or,
except as herein expressly

-3-
<PAGE> 8
provided, to make any payment, or to make any inquiry as to the nature or
sufficiency of any payment received by it, or present or file any claim, or
take any action to collect or enforce the payment of any amounts which may have
been assigned to it or to which it may be entitled at any time or times.

The Owner Trustee does hereby constitute the Indenture Trustee
the true and lawful attorney of the Owner Trustee, irrevocably, with full power
(in the name of the Owner Trustee or otherwise), upon the occurrence and during
the continuation of an Indenture Event of Default, to ask, require, demand,
receive, compound and give acquittance for any and all moneys and claims for
moneys due and to become due to the Owner Trustee (other than Excepted
Property), under or arising out of the Lease, or to endorse any checks or other
instruments or orders in connection therewith and to file any claims or take
any action or institute any proceedings which the Indenture Trustee may deem to
be necessary or advisable in the premises. The Owner Trustee has directed the
Lessee to make all payments of Rent (other than Excepted Property) payable to
the Owner Trustee by the Lessee and all other amounts which are required to be
paid to or deposited with the Owner Trustee pursuant to the Lease directly to
the Indenture Trustee at such address as the Indenture Trustee shall specify,
for application as provided in this Indenture. The Owner Trustee agrees that
promptly on receipt thereof, it will transfer to the Indenture Trustee any and
all moneys from time to time received by it constituting part of the Indenture
Estate, for distribution by the Indenture Trustee pursuant to this Indenture,
except that the Owner Trustee shall accept for distribution pursuant to the
Trust Agreement any amounts distributed to it by the Indenture Trustee as
expressly provided in this Indenture and any Excepted Property.

The Owner Trustee agrees that at any time and from time to
time, upon the written request of the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee will
promptly and duly execute and deliver or cause to be executed and delivered any
and all such further instruments and documents as the Indenture Trustee may
reasonably deem to be necessary in order to obtain the full benefits of this
assignment and of the rights and powers herein granted.

The Owner Trustee does hereby warrant and represent that it
has not assigned or pledged, and hereby covenants that it will not assign or
pledge, so long as the assignment hereunder shall remain in effect, any of its
right, title or interest hereby assigned, to anyone other than the Indenture
Trustee, and that it will not (other than in respect of Excepted Property),
except as provided in or permitted by this Indenture, accept any payment from
the Lessee, enter into an agreement amending or supplementing any of the
Operative Agreements, execute any waiver or modification of, or consent under
the terms of any of the Operative Agreements (other than the Tax Indemnity
Agreement), settle or compromise any claim (other than claims in respect of
Excepted Property) against the Lessee arising under any of the Operative
Agreements, or submit or consent to the submission of any dispute, difference
or other matter arising under or in respect of any of the Operative Agreements,
to arbitration thereunder.

All payments of principal and interest and premium, if any, to
be made hereunder and under the Trust Indenture and Security Agreement (GATC
Trust No. 94-1), dated as of August 9, 1994 as from time to time amended and
supplemented (herein called the "Indenture", the defined terms therein not
otherwise defined herein being used herein with the same meanings), between the
Owner Trustee and The First National Bank of Chicago, as Indenture Trustee
thereunder for the holder of this Equipment Note and the holders of other
Equipment Notes outstanding thereunder (herein in such capacity called the
"Indenture Trustee") shall be made only from the income and proceeds from the
Indenture Estate and only to the extent that the Indenture Trustee shall have
sufficient income or proceeds from the Indenture Estate to make such payments
in accordance with the terms of Article III of the Indenture. Each holder
hereof, by its acceptance of this Equipment Note, agrees that it will look
solely to the income and proceeds from the Indenture Estate to the extent
available for distribution to the holder hereof as provided in the Indenture
and that none of the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant, the Indenture
Trustee or their permitted successors and assigns is or shall be personally
liable to the holder hereof for any amount payable under this Equipment Note or

Payments with respect to the principal amount hereof, premium,
if any, and interest thereon shall be payable in U.S. dollars in immediately
available funds at the principal bond and trustee administration office of the
Indenture Trustee, or as otherwise provided in the Indenture. Each such
payment shall be made on the date such payment is due and without any
presentment or surrender of this Equipment Note. Whenever the date scheduled
for any payment to be made hereunder or under the Indenture shall not be a
Business Day, then such payment need not be made on such scheduled date but may
be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as
if made on such scheduled date and (provided such payment is made on such next
succeeding Business Day) no interest shall accrue on the amount of such payment
from and after such scheduled date to the time of such payment on such next
succeeding Business Day.

Each holder hereof, by its acceptance of this Equipment Note,
agrees that each payment received by it hereunder shall be applied, first, to
the payment of accrued but unpaid interest on this Equipment Note then due,
second, to the payment of the unpaid principal amount of this Equipment Note
then due, third, to the payment of any premium then due, and fourth, to the
payment of the remaining outstanding principal amount of this Equipment Note;
provided, that the Owner Trustee may only prepay this Equipment Note as
provided in Sections 2.10, 3.02 and 3.03 of the Indenture.

Section 2.02. Terms of Equipment Notes. There shall be
issued and delivered to the Loan Participant a single Equipment Note related to
such Lease Supplement executed and delivered in respect of the Units delivered
on the Closing Date in the maturity and bearing the interest rate as set forth
in Exhibit B hereto, in a principal amount equal to that portion of the loan
made by the Loan Participant to the Owner Trustee pursuant to Section 2 of the
Participation Agreement relating to the Units under such Lease Supplement.
Each such Equipment Note shall evidence the loan made by the Loan Participant
in connection with the purchase of the Equipment by the Owner Trustee from the
Lessee, each such Equipment Note to be substantially in the form set forth in
Section 2.01, with deletions and insertions as appropriate, duly authenticated
by the Indenture Trustee and dated the Closing Date of the Equipment, and as
having been issued in connection with the Equipment under a related Lease
Supplement.

The principal amount of and interest on each Equipment Note
issued pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture shall be payable as set
forth in the form thereof contained in Section 2.01 and Annex A. Interest
accrued on the Equipment Notes shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
of twelve 30-day months on the principal amount thereof remaining unpaid from
time to time from and including the date thereof to but excluding the date of
payment. The Owner Trustee shall furnish to the Indenture Trustee a copy of
each Equipment Note issued pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture.

The Equipment Notes shall be identical in respect of payment
dates. All Equipment Notes shall be identical except in respect of principal
amount thereof. The aggregate principal amount of Equipment Notes which may be
outstanding at any one time shall be limited to the aggregate amount set forth
in Exhibit B hereto.

No Equipment Note shall be entitled to any benefit under this
Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless it shall have been
authenticated by or on behalf of the Indenture Trustee by manual signature.

Section 2.03. Payment from Indenture Estate Only. All
payments to be made under the Equipment Notes and this Indenture shall be made
only from the income and the proceeds from the Indenture Estate and only to the
extent that the Indenture Trustee shall have

-8-
<PAGE> 13
received sufficient income or proceeds from the Indenture Estate to make such
payments in accordance with the terms of Article III hereof. Each holder of an
Equipment Note, by its acceptance of such Equipment Note, agrees that it will
look solely to the income and proceeds from the Indenture Estate to the extent
available for distribution to such holder as herein provided and that none of
the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant, the Indenture Trustee or their
permitted successors and assigns is or shall be personally liable to the holder
of any Equipment Note for any amount payable under such Equipment Note or the
Indenture or, except as expressly provided in the Participation Agreement or
the Indenture, for any liability under the Participation Agreement or (in the
case of the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee) the Indenture.

Section 2.04. Method of Payment. (a) The principal of and
premium, if any, and interest on each Equipment Note will be payable in U.S.
dollars in immediately available funds at the principal corporate trust
administration office of the Indenture Trustee or as otherwise directed in the
manner provided herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision in any
Equipment Note to the contrary, the Indenture Trustee will pay, or cause to be
paid, if so requested by any holder of an Equipment Note by written notice to
the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee, all amounts payable by the Owner
Trustee hereunder to such holder or a nominee therefor either (i) by
transferring by wire in immediately available funds to an account maintained by
such holder with a bank in the United States the amount to be distributed to
such holder or (ii) by mailing a check denominated in U.S. dollars to such
holder at such address as such holder shall have specified in such notice, in
any case without any presentment or surrender of any Equipment Note, except
that the holder of an Equipment Note shall surrender such Equipment Note to the
Indenture Trustee upon payment in full of the principal amount of and interest
on such Equipment Note and such other sums payable to such holder hereunder or
under the Equipment Note.

(b) Whenever the date scheduled for any payment to be
made hereunder or under any Equipment Note shall not be a Business Day, then
such payment need not be made on such scheduled date but may be made on the
next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on such
scheduled date and (provided such payment is made on such next succeeding
Business Day) no interest shall accrue on the amount of such payment from and
after such scheduled date to the time of such payment on such next succeeding 
Business Day.

Section 2.05. Application of Payments to Principal Amount and
Interest. In the case of each Equipment Note, each payment of principal
thereof and premium, if any, and interest thereon shall be applied, first, to
the payment of accrued but unpaid interest on such Equipment Note then due
thereunder, second, to the payment of the unpaid principal amount of such
Equipment Note then due thereunder, third, to the payment of any premium then
due thereon and fourth, to the payment of the remaining outstanding principal
amount of such Equipment Note; provided, that the Owner Trustee may only prepay
such Equipment Note in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.10, 3.02 and
3.03 hereof.

Section 2.06. Termination of Interest in Indenture Estate.
A holder shall have no further interest in, or other right with respect to, the
Indenture Estate when and if the

-9-
<PAGE> 14
principal amount of and interest on all Equipment Notes held by such holder and
all other sums payable to such holder hereunder and under such Equipment Notes
and under the Participation Agreement shall have been paid in full.

Section 2.07. Transfer of Equipment Notes. The Indenture
Trustee shall maintain at its corporate trust administration office in Chicago,
Illinois or in the city in which the corporate trust office of a successor
Indenture Trustee is located, a register for the purpose of registering
transfers and exchanges of Equipment Notes. A holder of an Equipment Note
intending to transfer such Equipment Note to a new payee, or to exchange any
Equipment Note or Equipment Notes held by it for an Equipment Note or Equipment
Notes of a different denomination or denominations, may surrender such
Equipment Note or Equipment Notes to the Indenture Trustee at such principal
corporate trust administration office of the Indenture Trustee, together with a
written request from such holder for the issuance of a new Equipment Note or
Equipment Notes, specifying the denomination or denominations (each of which
shall be not less than $1,000,000 or a whole multiple thereof or such smaller
denomination as may be necessary due to the original issuance of Equipment
Notes of the applicable maturity in an aggregate principal amount not evenly
divisible by $1,000,000) of the same, and, in the case of a surrender for
registration of transfer, the name and address of the transferee or
transferees. Promptly upon receipt of such documents, the Owner Trustee will
issue, and the Indenture Trustee will authenticate, a new Equipment Note or
Equipment Notes in the same aggregate principal amount and dated the same date
or dates as, with the same payment schedule, in the form set forth in Section
2.01 in the same maturity and bearing the same interest rate as the Equipment
Note or Equipment Notes surrendered, in such denomination or denominations and
payable to such payee or payees as shall be specified in the written request
from such holder. All Equipment Notes issued upon any registration of transfer
or exchange of Equipment Notes shall be the valid obligations of the Owner
Trustee evidencing the same respective obligations, and entitled to the same
security and benefits under this Indenture, as the Equipment Notes surrendered
upon such registration of transfer or exchange. The Indenture Trustee shall
make a notation on each new Equipment Note or Equipment Notes of the amount of
all payments or prepayments of principal and interest previously made on the
old Equipment Note or Equipment Notes with respect to which such new Equipment
Note or Equipment Notes is or are issued. From time to time, the Indenture
Trustee will provide the Owner Trustee and the Lessee with such information as
it may request as to the registered holders of Equipment Notes. The Owner
Trustee shall not be required to exchange any surrendered Equipment Notes as
above provided during the 10-day period preceding the due date of any payment
on such Equipment Notes.

Prior to the due presentment for registration of transfer of
an Equipment Note, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee may deem and
treat the registered holder of such Equipment Note as the absolute owner and
holder of such Equipment Note for the purpose of receiving payment of all
amounts payable with respect to such Equipment Note and for all other purposes
and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary.

The Indenture Trustee will promptly notify the Owner Trustee
and the Lessee of each request for a registration of transfer of an Equipment
Note. The Indenture Trustee will

-10-
<PAGE> 15
promptly cancel and destroy all Equipment Notes surrendered for transfer or
exchange pursuant to this Section.

Section 2.08. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Equipment
Notes. If any Equipment Note shall become mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen, the Owner Trustee shall, upon the written request of the holder of such
Equipment Note, issue, and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver
in replacement thereof, a new Equipment Note in the form set forth in Section
2.01, payable to the same holder in the same principal amount, of the same
maturity, with the same payment schedule, bearing the same interest rate and
dated the same date as the Equipment Note so mutilated, destroyed, lost or
stolen. The Indenture Trustee shall make a notation on each new Equipment Note
of the amount of all payments or prepayments of principal and interest
theretofore made on the Equipment Note so mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
and the date to which interest on such old Equipment Note has been paid. If
the Equipment Note being replaced has become mutilated, such Equipment Note
shall be surrendered to the Indenture Trustee and forwarded to the Owner
Trustee by the Indenture Trustee. If the Equipment Note being replaced has
been destroyed, lost or stolen, the holder of such Equipment Note shall furnish
to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee such security or indemnity as
may be required by them to save the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee
harmless and evidence satisfactory to the Owner Trustee and the Indenture
Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft of such Equipment Note and of the
ownership thereof.

Section 2.09. Payment of Transfer Taxes. Upon the transfer
of any Equipment Note or Equipment Notes pursuant to Section 2.07, the Owner
Trustee or the Indenture Trustee may require from the party requesting such new
Equipment Note or Equipment Notes payment of a sum to reimburse the Owner
Trustee or the Indenture Trustee for, or to provide funds for the payment of,
any tax or other governmental charge in connection therewith.

Section 2.10. Prepayments. (a) Each Equipment Note shall be
prepaid in whole or in part by the Owner Trustee on a Rent Payment Date (or, in
the circumstance provided in the last sentence of Section 10.3 of the Lease, on
a Determination Date) upon at least 25 days' prior notice from the Owner
Trustee (or the Lessee on its behalf) to the Indenture Trustee in the event
that the Lease as applicable to any Unit or Units related to such Equipment
Note is terminated pursuant to Section 10 thereof, at a price equal to the sum
of (i) as to principal thereof, an amount equal to the product obtained by
multiplying the unpaid principal amount of such Equipment Note as at the date
of such prepayment (after deducting therefrom the principal installment, if
any, due on or prior to the date of such prepayment) by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the Equipment Cost of such Unit or Units and the
denominator of which shall be the aggregate Equipment Cost of all Units
included in the Indenture Estate under the related Indenture Supplement
immediately prior to the date of such prepayment, (ii) as to interest, the
aggregate amount of interest accrued and unpaid in respect of the principal
amount to be prepaid pursuant to clause (i) above on the date of such payment
(after giving effect to the application of any Basic Rent paid on or prior to
the date of such prepayment) and (iii) if prepaid prior to the Premium
Termination Date, a premium in an amount equal to the Make-Whole Amount, if
any, applicable in respect of the principal amount to be prepaid pursuant to
clause (i) above on the date of such prepayment.

(b) Each Equipment Note shall be prepaid in whole or in
part by the Owner Trustee on a Rent Payment Date upon at least 25 days' prior

Trustee in connection with the occurrence of an Event of Loss with respect to
any Unit or Units related to such Equipment Note if such Unit or Units are not
replaced pursuant to Section 11.2(i) of the Lease, or in the event Lessee shall
be required to settle for more than 15 Units on a Determination Date pursuant
to Section 11.2 of the Lease, such prepayment shall be made on such
Determination Date, at a price equal to the sum of (i) as to principal thereof,
an amount equal to the product obtained by multiplying the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of such Equipment Note as at such prepayment date (after
deducting therefrom the principal installment, if any, due on such date) by a
fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Equipment Cost of such Unit or
Units and the denominator of which shall be the aggregate Equipment Cost of all
Units included in the Indenture Estate under the related Indenture Supplement
immediately prior to such date, and (ii) as to interest, the aggregate amount
of interest accrued and unpaid in respect of the principal amount to be prepaid
pursuant to clause (i) above to but not including the date of prepayment after
giving effect to the application of any Basic Rent paid on or prior to the date
of such prepayment, but without the payment of any premium.

(c) Each Equipment Note shall be prepaid in whole or in
part by the Owner Trustee on the Determination Date specified by Lessee to
Owner Trustee and Indenture Trustee in accordance with Section 6.9 of the
Participation Agreement, in the event that Lessee exercises the purchase option
under Section 6.9 of the Participation Agreement with respect to the Equipment,
at a price equal to the sum of (i) as to principal thereof, an amount equal to
the product obtained by multiplying the aggregate unpaid principal amount of
such Equipment Note as at the date of any prepayment under Section 6.9 of the
Participation Agreement (after deducting therefrom the principal installment,
if any, due on the prepayment date) by a fraction, the numerator of which shall
be the Equipment Cost of such Unit or Units to be purchased and the denominator
of which shall be the aggregate Equipment Cost of all Units included in the
Indenture Estate immediately prior to the date of such prepayment, (ii) as to
interest, the aggregate amount of interest accrued and unpaid in respect of the
principal amount to be prepaid pursuant to clause (i) above on the date of such
prepayment after giving effect to the application of any Basic Rent paid on or
prior to the date of such prepayment, and (iii) if prepaid prior to the Premium
Termination Date applicable to such Equipment Notes, a premium in an amount
equal to the aggregate Make-Whole Amount, if any, applicable in respect of the
principal amount to be prepaid pursuant to clause (i) above on the date of such
payment.

(d) On the Refunding Date specified by the Lessee to the
Owner Trustee and to the Indenture Trustee in accordance with Section 10.2(f)
of the Participation Agreement, all Equipment Notes shall be prepaid in whole
but not in part on such Refunding Date, in the event of a refunding or
refinancing pursuant to Section 10.2 of the Participation Agreement, at a price
in addition to any other amounts due to the holders of the Equipment Notes
under this Indenture equal to the unpaid principal amount thereof together with
accrued but unpaid interest thereon, plus if prepaid prior to the Premium
Termination Date, a premium in an amount equal to the Make-Whole Amount, if
any.

-12-
<PAGE> 17
(e) The Indenture Trustee shall give prompt notice of any
prepayment of any of the Equipment Notes to all holders of the Equipment Notes
as soon as the Indenture Trustee shall have knowledge that such prepayment is
to occur, which notice shall specify the Equipment Note or Notes to be prepaid,
the principal amount of such Equipment Note or Notes to be prepaid and the date
of prepayment which date shall be not less than 25 days after the date of such

provided in Section 3.03, each installment of Interim Interest and Basic Rent
as well as any installment of interest on overdue installments of Basic Rent,
and any other moneys paid over by the Lessee or the Owner Trustee to the
Indenture Trustee for such purpose, shall be distributed by the Indenture
Trustee as promptly as possible (it being understood that any payments of

one over any other, in the proportion that the amount to be prepaid on each
such Equipment Note bears to the aggregate amount to be paid on all such
Equipment Notes; and second, the balance, if any, of such amount remaining
thereafter shall be distributed to the Owner Trustee for distribution in
accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.03 or 3.05
hereof, any amounts received directly or through the Lessee from any

Section 3.03. Payments after Indenture Event of Default.
(a) Except as provided in Section 3.05, all payments received and amounts
realized by the Indenture Trustee after an Indenture Event of Default shall

(as assignee from the Owner Trustee of the Lease) the Lease to be in default
pursuant to Section 15 thereof or has declared the Equipment Notes to be
accelerated pursuant to Section 4.02, as the case may be, or has elected to
foreclose or otherwise exercise any remedies under this Indenture (including
any amounts realized by the Indenture Trustee from the exercise of any remedies
pursuant to Section 15 of the Lease, or Article IV), as well as all payments or
amounts then held or thereafter received by the Indenture Trustee as part of
the Indenture Estate while such Indenture Event of Default shall be continuing,
shall be distributed forthwith by the Indenture Trustee in the following order
of priority:

First, so much of such payments or amounts as shall
be required to reimburse the Indenture Trustee for any fees which are
due and payable for its services under this Indenture and any tax,
expense (including reasonable attorney's fees) or other loss incurred
by the Indenture Trustee (to the extent reimbursable and not
previously reimbursed and to the extent incurred in connection with
its duties as Indenture Trustee) shall be distributed to the Indenture
Trustee;

Second, so much of such payments or amounts as shall
be required to reimburse the holders of the Equipment Notes for
payments made by them to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section
5.03 (to the extent not previously reimbursed), and to pay such
holders of the Equipment Notes the amounts payable to them pursuant to
the provisions of the Participation Agreement, shall be distributed to

of acceleration pursuant to Section 4.02 or otherwise, and in case the
aggregate amount so to be distributed shall be insufficient to pay in
full the aforesaid amounts, then, ratably, without priority of one
over the other, in the proportion that the aggregate unpaid principal
amount of all Equipment Notes held by each such holder, plus the
accrued but unpaid interest thereon to the date of distribution, bears
to the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Equipment Notes, plus
the accrued but unpaid interest thereon to the date of distribution;
and

Fourth, the balance, if any, of such payments or
amounts remaining thereafter shall be distributed to the Owner Trustee
for distribution in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement.

(b) Except as provided in Sections 3.03(a) and 3.05, if

collateral security for the obligations secured hereby and invested as provided
in Section 6.04(b) until the earliest to occur of (a) the date on which such
Indenture Default or Indenture Event of Default shall have been cured or
waived, and (b) such acceleration occurs and such amounts are applied pursuant
to Section 3.03(a); provided, that if any amounts are held pursuant to this
Section 3.03(b) for a period of 180 days during which time the Equipment Notes

the Indenture Trustee under this Section 3.03(b) with respect to such Indenture
Default or Indenture Event of Default which have been so held for at least 90

distribution in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement and (y) any
such amounts which are being held pursuant to this Section 3.03(b) with respect
to such Indenture Default or Indenture Event of Default but which have not been
held for at least 90 days shall, on the 91st day following the date on which
such amount was initially received by the Indenture Trustee, thereafter be
distributed to the Owner Trustee for distribution in accordance with the terms
of the Trust Agreement.

Section 3.04. Other Payments. Except as otherwise provided
in Section 3.03 or 3.05, (e) any payments received by the Indenture Trustee for
which no provision as to the application thereof is made in the Lease or the
Participation Agreement or elsewhere in this Article III, and (f) all payments

provision as to the application thereof is made in the Lease or the
Participation Agreement but not elsewhere in this Indenture shall be applied to

Default (other than a Lease Event of Default by reason of a default by
the Lessee to pay any amounts which are part of the Excepted
Property); or

(b) default by the Owner Trustee in making any
payment when due of principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, any
Equipment Note or Equipment Notes, and the continuance of such default
unremedied for 10 Business Days after the same shall have become due

(c) any failure by the Owner Trustee or the Owner
Participant to observe or perform any covenant or obligation of them
or any of them, in this Indenture or the Equipment Notes (other than
as set forth in clause (b) above) or in the Participation Agreement,
if such failure is not remedied within a period of 30 days after there
has been given to the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant and the
Lessee by the Indenture Trustee or by any holder of an Equipment Note
a written notice specifying such failure and requiring it to be
remedied; or

(d) any representation or warranty made by the
Owner Trustee (except to the extent made with respect to State Street
Bank and Trust Company, in its individual capacity) or the Owner
Participant under the Participation Agreement, or by the Owner Trustee
hereunder, or by any representative of the Owner Trustee or the Owner
Participant in any document or certificate furnished to the Indenture
Trustee or the Loan Participant in connection herewith or therewith or
pursuant hereto or thereto, shall prove at any time to have been
incorrect in any material respect as of the date made and such
incorrectness shall remain material and continue unremedied for a
period of 30 days after there has been given to the Owner Trustee and
the Owner Participant a written notice specifying such incorrectness,
stating that such incorrectness is a default hereunder and 

-16-
<PAGE> 21

requiring it to be remedied by the Indenture Trustee or by any holder of
an Equipment Note; or

(e) the Owner Trustee (as Owner Trustee and not
in its individual capacity) or the Owner Participant shall consent to
the appointment of a custodian, receiver, trustee or liquidator of
itself or of a substantial part of its property or shall make a
general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or

(f) the Owner Trustee (as Owner Trustee and not
in its individual capacity) or the Owner Participant shall file, or
consent by answer or otherwise to the filing against it of, a petition
for relief or reorganization or arrangement or any other petition in
bankruptcy, for liquidation or to take advantage of any bankruptcy or
insolvency law of any jurisdiction; or

(g) an order, judgment or decree shall be entered
by any court of competent jurisdiction appointing, without the consent
of the Owner Trustee (as Owner Trustee and not in its individual
capacity) or the Owner Participant, a receiver, trustee or liquidator
of the Indenture Estate, the Owner Trustee (as Owner Trustee and not
in its individual capacity) or the Owner Participant, or of any

if, under the provisions of any law providing for reorganization or
winding-up of corporations which may apply to the Owner Trustee (as
Owner Trustee and not in its individual capacity) or the Owner
Participant, any court of competent jurisdiction shall assume
jurisdiction, custody or control of the Indenture Estate, the Owner
Trustee (as Owner Trustee and not in its individual capacity) or the
Owner Participant or of any substantial part of its property and such
jurisdiction, custody or control shall remain in force unrelinquished,
unstayed or unterminated for a period of 60 days.

Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, if an Indenture Event of
Default described in clause (e), (f), (g) or (h) of this Section 4.01 results
solely from the bankruptcy, reorganization, compromise, arrangement,
insolvency, readjustment of debt, dissolution or liquidation of Owner Trustee
solely in its individual capacity, and can be cured by the appointment of a
substitute Owner Trustee without adversely affecting the rights of the
Indenture Trustee hereunder, then Indenture Trustee shall refrain from the
exercise of any of the rights, powers or remedies pursuant to this Article IV
for a period of 45 days provided Owner

-17-
<PAGE> 22
Participant is diligently seeking to, and does replace the bank or trust
company then serving as Owner Trustee which replacement shall be deemed to cure
such Indenture Event of Default.

Section 4.02. Acceleration; Rescission and Annulment. If an
Indenture Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Indenture Trustee may,
and upon the directions of a Majority in Interest shall, subject to Section
4.04, declare the unpaid principal amount of all Equipment Notes then
outstanding and accrued interest thereon to be due and payable. At any time
after the Indenture Trustee has declared the unpaid principal amount of all
Equipment Notes then outstanding to be due and payable and prior to the sale of
any of the Indenture Estate pursuant to this Article IV, a Majority in
Interest, by written notice to the Owner Trustee, the Lessee and the Indenture
Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and thereby annul its
consequences if: (i) there has been paid to or deposited with the Indenture
Trustee an amount sufficient to pay all overdue installments of interest on the
Equipment Notes, and the principal of and premium, if any, on any Equipment
Notes that have become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration,
(ii) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree, and (iii)
all other Indenture Defaults and Indenture Events of Default, other than
nonpayment of principal or interest on the Equipment Notes that have become due
solely because of such acceleration, have been cured or waived.

Section 4.03. Remedies with Respect to Indenture Estate.
(9) After an Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and so long as
such Indenture Event of Default shall be continuing, then and in every such
case the Indenture Trustee, as assignee hereunder of the Lease or as mortgagee
hereunder of the Equipment or otherwise, may, and when required pursuant to the
provisions of Article V hereof shall, subject to Sections 4.04 and 4.05,
exercise any or all of the rights and powers and pursue any and all of the
remedies pursuant to Section 15 of the Lease and this Article IV and may
recover judgment in its own name as Indenture Trustee against the Indenture
Estate and may take possession of all or any part of the Indenture Estate, and
may exclude the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant and all persons
claiming under any of them wholly or partly therefrom; provided, however, that
nothing in this Indenture shall permit or require the Indenture Trustee to take
any action contrary to, or to disturb, the Lessee's rights under the Lease,
except in accordance with the provisions of the Lease. The Indenture Trustee,
after the occurrence of any Indenture Event of Default, shall give the Owner
Participant and the Owner Trustee 10 Business Days' (or such shorter period as
practical) prior notice of the date before which the Indenture Trustee shall
not exercise any remedy which would result in the exclusion of the Owner
Trustee from the Indenture Estate or any part thereof; provided, however, such
notice period shall not be in addition to any other notice period provided
herein and; provided, further, that the failure to give such notice shall have
no effect on any action taken by the Indenture Trustee.

(b) Subject to Section 4.04 and Section 4.05, the
Indenture Trustee may, if at the time such action may be lawful and always
subject to compliance with any mandatory legal requirements, either with or
without taking possession, and either before or after taking possession, and
without instituting any legal proceedings whatsoever, and having first given
notice of such sale by registered mail to the Owner Trustee, the Owner
Participant and the Lessee once at least 20 days prior to the date of such sale
or the date on which the Indenture

-18-
<PAGE> 23
Trustee enters into a binding contract for a private sale, and any other notice
which may be required by law, sell and dispose of the Indenture Estate, or any
part thereof, or interest therein, at public auction to the highest bidder or
at private sale in one lot as an entirety or in separate lots, and either for
cash or on credit and on such terms as the Indenture Trustee may determine, and
at any place (whether or not it be the location of the Indenture Estate or any
part thereof) and time designated in the notice above referred to; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the
Indenture Trustee shall not sell any of the Indenture Estate or exercise any
other remedies which would result in the exclusion of the Owner Trustee from
the Indenture Estate or any part thereof unless a declaration of acceleration
has been made pursuant to Section 4.02; provided further, that, in the event
the circumstances contemplated by Section 4.04(c) exist, the Indenture Trustee
shall not be allowed to deliver the notice required by this Section 4.03(b)
until the earlier of (x) such time as such circumstances no longer exist or (y)
the expiration of the 90 day period set forth in Section 4.04(c). Any such
public sale or sales may be adjourned from time to time by announcement at the
time and place appointed for such sale or sales, or for any such adjourned sale
or sales, without further notice, and the Indenture Trustee or the holder or
holders of any Equipment Notes, or any interest therein, may bid and become the
purchaser at any such public sale. The Indenture Trustee may exercise such
right without possession or production of the Equipment Notes or proof of
ownership thereof, and as representative of the holders may exercise such right
without including the holders as parties to any suit or proceeding relating to
foreclosure of any property in the Indenture Estate. The Owner Trustee hereby
irrevocably constitutes the Indenture Trustee the true and lawful
attorney-in-fact of the Owner Trustee (in the name of the Owner Trustee or
otherwise) for the purpose of effectuating any sale, assignment, transfer or
delivery for enforcement of the Lien of this Indenture, whether pursuant to
foreclosure or power of sale or otherwise, to execute and deliver all such
bills of sale, assignments and other instruments as the Indenture Trustee may
consider necessary or appropriate, with full power of substitution, the Owner
Trustee hereby ratifying and confirming all that such attorney or any
substitute shall lawfully do by virtue hereof. Nevertheless, if so requested
by the Indenture Trustee or any purchaser, the Owner Trustee shall ratify and
confirm any such sale, assignment, transfer or delivery, by executing and
delivering to the Indenture Trustee or such purchaser all bills of sale,
assignments, releases and other proper instruments to effect such ratification
and confirmation as may be designated in any such request.

(c) Subject to Section 4.04 and Section 4.05, the Owner
Trustee agrees, to the fullest extent that it lawfully may, that, in case one
or more of the Indenture Events of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, then, in every such case, the Indenture Trustee may take possession
of all or any part of the Indenture Estate and may exclude the Owner Trustee
and the Owner Participant and all persons claiming under any of them wholly or
partly therefrom. At the request of the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee
shall promptly execute and deliver to the Indenture Trustee such instruments of
title and other documents as the Indenture Trustee may deem necessary or
advisable to enable the Indenture Trustee or an agent or representative
designated by the Indenture Trustee, at such time or times and place or places
as the Indenture Trustee may specify, to obtain possession of all or any part
of the Indenture Estate. If the Owner Trustee shall fail for any reason to
execute and deliver such instruments and documents to the Indenture Trustee,
the Indenture Trustee may pursue all or part of the Indenture Estate

-19-
<PAGE> 24
wherever it may be found and may enter any of the premises of the Lessee
wherever the Indenture Estate may be or be supposed to be and search for the
Indenture Estate and, subject to Section 4.05, take possession of and remove
the Indenture Estate. Upon every such taking of possession, the Indenture
Trustee may, from time to time, at the expense of the Indenture Estate, make
all such expenditures for maintenance, insurance, repairs, replacements,
alterations, additions and improvements to any of the Indenture Estate, as it
may deem proper. In each such case, the Indenture Trustee shall have the right
to use, operate, store, control or manage the Indenture Estate, and to carry on
the business and to exercise all rights and powers of the Owner Trustee
relating to the Indenture Estate, as the Indenture Trustee shall deem best,
including the right to enter into any and all such agreements with respect to
the maintenance, operation, leasing or storage of the Indenture Estate or any
part thereof as the Indenture Trustee may determine; and the Indenture Trustee
shall be entitled to collect and receive all tolls, rents, revenues, issues,
income, products and profits of the Indenture Estate and every part thereof,
without prejudice, however, to the right of the Indenture Trustee under any
provision of this Indenture to collect and receive all cash held by, or
required to be deposited with, the Indenture Trustee hereunder. Such tolls,
rents, revenues, issues, income, products and profits shall be applied to pay
the expenses of holding and operating the Indenture Estate and of conducting
the business thereof, and of all maintenance, repairs, replacements,
alterations, additions and improvements, and to make all payments which the
Indenture Trustee may be required or may elect to make, if any, for taxes,
assessments, insurance or other proper charges upon the Indenture Estate or any
part thereof (including the employment of engineers and accountants to examine,
inspect and make reports upon the properties and books and records of the
Indenture Estate), and all other payments which the Indenture Trustee may be
required or authorized to make under any provision of this Indenture, as well
as just and reasonable compensation for the services of the Indenture Trustee,
and of all persons properly engaged and employed by the Indenture Trustee,
including the reasonable expenses of the Indenture Trustee.

(d) If an Indenture Event of Default occurs and is
continuing and the Indenture Trustee shall have obtained possession of a Unit,
the Indenture Trustee shall not be obligated to use or operate such Unit or
cause such Unit to be used or operated directly or indirectly by itself or
through agents or other representatives or to lease, license or otherwise
permit or provide for the use or operation of such Unit or Equipment by any
other Person unless (i) the Indenture Trustee shall have been able to obtain
insurance in kinds, at rates and in amounts satisfactory to it in its
discretion to protect the Indenture Estate and the Indenture Trustee, as
trustee and individually, against any and all liability for loss or damage to
such Unit and for public liability and property damage resulting from use or
operation of such Unit and (ii) funds are available in the Indenture Estate to
pay for all such insurance or, in lieu of such insurance, the Indenture Trustee
is furnished with indemnification from the holders of the Equipment Notes or
any other Person upon terms and in amounts satisfactory to the Indenture
Trustee in its discretion to protect the Indenture Estate and the Indenture
Trustee, as trustee and individually, against any and all such liabilities.

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein, so long as
the Pass Through Trustee under any Pass Through Trust Agreement is the
registered holder of any Equipment Note issued hereunder, the Indenture Trustee
is not authorized or empowered to acquire title to

-20-
<PAGE> 25
any Indenture Estate or take any action with respect to any Indenture Estate so
acquired by it if such acquisition or action would cause the trust created by
the Trust Agreement or the Pass Through Trust Agreement to fail to qualify as a
"grantor trust" for federal income tax purposes.

Section 4.04. Right to Cure; Option to Purchase; Etc.

(a) Right to Cure. (A) If there shall occur a Lease
Event of Default in respect of the payment of Basic Rent pursuant to Section
14(a) of the Lease, then as long as no other Indenture Event of Default (other
than arising from such failure to pay Basic Rent or which is concurrently being
cured pursuant to this Section 4.04(a)) shall have occurred and be continuing
the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee may (but need not) pay to the
Indenture Trustee, at any time prior to the expiration of a period of 10
Business Days (a "10-Day Period") after receiving written notice of such
default from the Indenture Trustee (prior to the expiration of which 10-Day
Period the Indenture Trustee shall not declare the Lease in default pursuant to
Section 15 thereof or exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies pursuant
to such Section 15 or this Article IV), an amount equal to the full amount of
such payment of Basic Rent, together with any interest due thereon on account
of the delayed payment thereof, and such payment by the Owner Participant or
the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to cure any Indenture Event of Default which
arose from such failure of the Lessee (but such cure shall not relieve the
Lessee of any of its obligations and shall not cure any other Indenture Event
of Default) or (B) if there shall occur a Lease Event of Default in respect of
any other payment of Rent (other than Basic Rent) or a Lease Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, which Lease Event of Default is curable
by the payment of money (it being understood that actions such as the obtaining
of insurance or the procuring of maintenance services can be so effected), then
as long as no other Indenture Event of Default (other than arising from such
Lease Event of Default or which is concurrently being cured pursuant to this
Section 4.04(a)) shall have occurred and be continuing the Owner Participant or
the Owner Trustee may (but need not) pay to the Indenture Trustee, at any time
prior to the expiration of a period of 30 days (a "30-Day Period") after
receiving written notice of such Lease Event of Default from the Indenture
Trustee (prior to the expiration of which 30-Day Period the Indenture Trustee
shall not declare the Lease in default pursuant to Section 15 thereof or
exercise any of the rights, powers or remedies pursuant to such Section 15 of
this Article IV), an amount equal to the full amount of such payment of Rent,
together with any interest due thereon on account of the delayed payment
thereof or otherwise make such payment as shall effect such cure, and such
payment by the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee shall be deemed to cure
any Indenture Event of Default which arose from such Lease Event of Default
(but such cure shall not relieve the Lessee of any of its obligations);
provided however, Owner Participant and Owner Trustee, collectively, shall not
be entitled to (x) cure more than three consecutive or six total defaults in
the payment of Basic Rent, or (y) cure other Lease Events of Default if the
outstanding amount which has been paid by the Owner Participant or the Owner
Trustee and not reimbursed to such parties by the Lessee pursuant to this
clause (y) exceeds in the aggregate $5,000,000, as adjusted annually for
inflation as of January 1 of each calendar year, by the percentage change in
the Consumer Price Index, All Urban Consumers, All Cities, as compared to the
prior calendar year as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the
United States Department of Labor. Upon any cure by the Owner Participant or
the Owner Trustee in accordance with the first sentence of this Section
4.04(a),

-21-
<PAGE> 26
the Owner Participant or the Owner Trustee shall, to the extent of their
respective payments, be subrogated to the rights of the Indenture Trustee, as
assignee hereunder of the Owner Trustee to receive such payment of Rent (and
any interest due thereon on account of the delayed payment thereof) or right of
reimbursement, and shall be entitled to receive such payment upon its receipt
by the Indenture Trustee as aforesaid (but in each case only if all amounts of
principal and interest at the time due and payable on the Equipment Notes shall
have been paid in full); provided that neither the Owner Participant nor the
Owner Trustee shall attempt to recover any such amount paid by it on behalf of
the Lessee pursuant to this Section 4.04(a) except by demanding of the Lessee
payment of such amount or by commencing an action against the Lessee to require
the payment of such amount.

(b) Option to Purchase Equipment Notes. In the event
that (i) at any time one or more Lease Events of Default shall have occurred
and any such Lease Event of Default shall have continued for a period of 180
days or more during which time the Equipment Notes could, but shall not, have
been accelerated pursuant to Section 4.02, (ii) the Equipment Notes shall have
been accelerated pursuant to Section 4.02, (iii) the Indenture Trustee, as
assignee hereunder of the Lease, shall have exercised (or given notice of its
intention to exercise) any remedy in respect of the Units under the Lease, or
(iv) the Indenture Trustee shall commence foreclosure of the Lien of this
Indenture or otherwise exercise remedies which would result in the exclusion of
the Owner Trustee from the Indenture Estate or any part thereof (or give notice
of its intention to foreclose or exercise remedies), then and in any such case,
so long as the Lessee and its Affiliates do not individually or in the
aggregate own more than 20% of the Beneficial Interest, upon 30 days' notice
from the Owner Trustee to the Indenture Trustee designating a date of purchase
(the "Purchase Date") which shall be a Determination Date, each holder of an
Equipment Note agrees that it will, upon and subject to receipt by the
Indenture Trustee from the Owner Trustee or its nominee of an amount equal to
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Equipment Notes, together with
accrued interest thereon to the Purchase Date, plus all other sums then due and
payable to such holder of an Equipment Note hereunder, but, except in the case
of purchase of the Equipment Notes pursuant to clause (iv) above if the right
to exercise any remedies arises because of an Indenture Event of Default
arising from action attributable to the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant,
without any Make-Whole Amount or other premium, forthwith sell, assign,
transfer and convey to the Owner Trustee or its nominee on the Purchase Date
all of the right, title and interest of such holder in and to the Equipment
Notes then held by such holder, and the Owner Trustee or its nominee shall
assume all of such holder's obligations under the Participation Agreement;
provided that the Owner Trustee or its nominee must purchase all and not less
than all of the Equipment Notes then outstanding.

(c) Restrictions on Certain Actions. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Indenture to the contrary, the Indenture Trustee shall not
foreclose the Lien of this Indenture or otherwise exercise remedies hereunder
which would result in the exclusion of the Owner Trustee from the Indenture
Estate or any part thereof as a result of an Indenture Event of Default that
constitutes or occurs solely by virtue of one or more Lease Events of Default
(at a time when no other Indenture Event of Default unrelated to any Lease
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing) unless the Indenture
Trustee as security assignee of the Owner Trustee has

-22-
<PAGE> 27
proceeded or is then currently proceeding, to the extent it is then entitled to
do so hereunder and under the Lease and is not then stayed or otherwise
prevented from doing so by operation of law, to exercise one (or more, as it
shall in its good faith discretion determine) of the comparable remedies
provided for in Section 15 of the Lease with respect to the Equipment, provided
that in the event the Indenture Trustee shall be so stayed or otherwise
prevented from exercising such remedies under the Lease, it shall in any event
refrain from so foreclosing or exercising such other remedies hereunder for a
period of not less than 90 days, and further provided that in the event the
Lessee as debtor in a proceeding under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (or
any trustee appointed for the Lessee as debtor in any such bankruptcy case)
shall have affirmed the Lease and no Lease Event of Default other than as
specified in Section 14(h) or Section 14(i) of the Lease has occurred and is
continuing, with the approval of the bankruptcy court having jurisdiction over
such case, under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code or any amended or successor
version thereof, the Indenture Trustee shall refrain from so foreclosing or
exercising such other remedies hereunder.

Section 4.05. Rights of Lessee. Notwithstanding the
provisions of this Indenture, including, without limitation, Section 4.03, so
long as no Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
neither the Indenture Trustee nor the Owner Trustee shall take any action
contrary to, or disturb, the Lessee's rights under the Lease, except in
accordance with the provisions of the Lease, including, without limitation, (i)
the right to receive all monies due and payable to it in accordance with the
provisions of the Lease and (ii) the Lessee's rights to possession and use of,
and of quiet enjoyment of, the Equipment.

Section 4.06. Waiver of Existing Defaults. A Majority in
Interest by notice to the Indenture Trustee on behalf of all holders of the
Equipment Notes may waive any past default hereunder and its consequences,
except a default: (i) in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or
interest on any Equipment Note, or (ii) in respect of a covenant or provision
hereof which under Article IX hereof cannot be modified or amended without the
consent of the holder of each Equipment Note affected. Upon any such waiver,
such default shall cease to exist, and any Indenture Event of Default arising
therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this
Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default
or impair any right consequent thereon.

ARTICLE V.
DUTIES OF THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE

Section 5.01. Action upon Indenture Event of Default. If
any payments of Interim Interest or Basic Rent or payments of the principal or
interest or premium, if any, on the Equipment Notes due and payable on any Rent
Payment Date shall not have been paid in full on such Rent Payment Date, the
Indenture Trustee shall give telephonic notice within one Business Day
(followed by prompt written notice) to the Owner Trustee, the Owner
Participant, the Loan Participant and the Lessee specifying the amount and
nature of such deficiency in payment. In the event the Indenture Trustee shall
have knowledge of an Indenture Event of Default or an Indenture Default, the
Indenture Trustee shall give prompt notice of such Indenture Event of Default
or Indenture Default to the Lessee, the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant

-23-
<PAGE> 28
and the Loan Participant by telegram, telex, or telephone (to be promptly
confirmed in writing). In the event the Owner Trustee shall have knowledge of
an Indenture Event of Default or an Indenture Default, the Owner Trustee shall
give notice of such Indenture Event of Default or Indenture Default in the same
manner to the Lessee, the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Participant and the Loan
Participant. Subject to the terms of Section 5.03, the Indenture Trustee shall
take such action, or refrain from taking such action, with respect to such
Indenture Event of Default or Indenture Default as the Indenture Trustee shall
be instructed in writing by a Majority in Interest. If the Indenture Trustee
shall not have received instructions as above provided within 20 days after the
mailing of notice of such Indenture Event of Default or such Indenture Default
to the Loan Participant by the Indenture Trustee, the Indenture Trustee may,
but shall not be obligated to, take such action, or refrain from taking such
action, with respect to such Indenture Event of Default or Indenture Default as
it shall determine to be advisable in the best interests of the Loan
Participant. Any provision of this Section 5.01 to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Indenture Trustee shall not declare the Lease to be in
default solely in respect of the Lessee's failure to make any payment of Basic
Rent within 5 Business Days after the same shall have become due, unless the
10-Day Period within which, pursuant to Section 4.04(a), the Owner Participant
or the Owner Trustee are entitled to cure such failure shall have expired. For
all purposes of this Indenture, in the absence of actual knowledge, neither the
Owner Trustee nor the Indenture Trustee shall be deemed to have knowledge of an
Indenture Event of Default (except, in the case of the Indenture Trustee, the
failure of the Lessee to pay any installment of Basic Rent that is required to
be paid directly to the Indenture Trustee within the 5 Business Days after the
same shall become due or the failure of the Lessee to maintain insurance as
required under Section 12 of the Lease if the Indenture Trustee shall receive
notice thereof from an insurer or insurance broker) unless notified in writing
by the Lessee, the Owner Trustee, one or more Loan Participants or the Owner
Participant; and "actual knowledge" (as used in the foregoing clause) of the
Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee shall mean actual knowledge of an
officer in the Corporate Trust Administration of the Owner Trustee or the
Corporate Trust Department of the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be.

Section 5.02 Action upon Instructions. Subject to the terms
of Sections 5.01 and 5.03, upon the written instructions at any time and from
time to time of a Majority in Interest, the Indenture Trustee shall take such
of the following actions as may be specified in such instructions (subject to
the rights of the other parties thereto, except to the extent assigned
hereunder): (i) subject to and solely to the extent permitted by the terms
hereof and of the Lease, give such notice, direction or consent, or exercise
such right, remedy or power hereunder or under the Lease or in respect of any
part or all of the Indenture Estate or take such other action as shall be
specified in such instructions; and (ii) after an Indenture Event of Default
shall have occurred and so long as such Indenture Event of Default shall be
continuing, approve as satisfactory to it all matters required by the terms of
the Lease to be satisfactory to the Owner Trustee, it being understood that
without the written instructions of a Majority in Interest the Indenture
Trustee shall not take any action described in clauses (i) and (ii) above.

Upon the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease Term
with respect to any Unit under the Lease and after payment of the portion of
the principal of, together with interest and premium, if any, on the Equipment
Notes in accordance with the terms of this Indenture,

-24-
<PAGE> 29
or, if and so long as no Indenture Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, upon the transfer by the Owner Trustee to the Lessee or its
designee of any Unit pursuant to Section 10 or 11 of the Lease or the retention
by the Owner Trustee of any Unit pursuant to Section 10.3 of the Lease, then
the Indenture Trustee shall in either such case, upon the written request of
the Owner Trustee, and receipt by the Indenture Trustee of funds necessary to
prepay the Equipment Notes required to be prepaid in connection with such
purchase, termination, retention or Event of Loss, execute and deliver to, or
as directed in writing by, the Owner Trustee an appropriate instrument (in due
form for recording) furnished by the Owner Trustee or the Lessee releasing such
property from the Lien of this Indenture.

Section 5.03 Indemnification. (a) The Indenture Trustee
shall not be required to take any action or refrain from taking any action
under Section 5.01 (other than the first two sentences thereof) or 5.02 or
Article IV if it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of
such funds or adequate indemnification against such risk is not reasonably
assured to it. The Indenture Trustee shall not be required to take any action
under Section 5.01 or 5.02 or Article IV, nor shall any other provision of this
Indenture be deemed to impose a duty on the Indenture Trustee to take any
action, if the Indenture Trustee shall have been advised in writing by
independent counsel that such action is contrary to the terms hereof or of the
Lease or the Participation Agreement, or is otherwise contrary to law.

(b) Each Loan Participant may, but shall not be required
to, participate in any indemnification of the Indenture Trustee given pursuant
to paragraph (a) of this Section 5.03. Each Loan Participant so participating
shall be entitled to reimbursement for such participation in accordance with
Article III.

Section 5.04. No Duties Except as Specified in Indenture or
Instructions. The Indenture Trustee shall not have any duty or obligation to
manage, control, use, sell, dispose of or otherwise deal with the Equipment or
any other part of the Indenture Estate, or to otherwise take or refrain from
taking any action under, or in connection with, this Indenture, the Lease, or
the Participation Agreement, except as expressly provided by the terms of this
Indenture or as expressly provided in written instructions received pursuant to
the terms of Section 5.01 or 5.02; and no implied duties or obligations shall
be read into this Indenture against the Indenture Trustee. Each of the Owner
Trustee (only in its individual capacity) and the Indenture Trustee
nevertheless agrees that it will, at its own cost and expense, promptly take
such action as may be necessary duly to discharge any liens or encumbrances on
any part of the Indenture Estate, or on any properties of the Owner Trustee
assigned, pledged or mortgaged as part of the Indenture Estate, which result
from claims against it in its individual capacity not related to the ownership
of the Equipment (in the case of the Owner Trustee), administration of the
Indenture Estate (in the case of the Indenture Trustee) or any other
transaction under this Indenture or the Trust Agreement or any document
included in the Indenture Estate.

Section 5.05. No Action Except under Lease, Indenture or
Instructions. The Indenture Trustee agrees that it will not manage, control,
use, sell, dispose of or otherwise deal with the Equipment or other property
constituting part of the Indenture Estate except (i) as required by the terms
of the Lease and the Participation Agreement, (ii) in accordance with the

-25-
<PAGE> 30
powers granted to, or the authority conferred upon, the Indenture Trustee
pursuant to this Indenture, or (iii) in accordance with the express terms
hereof or with written instructions pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.02.

Section 5.06. Disposition of Units. At any time and from
time to time prior to the expiration of the Lease Term, any Unit for which the
provisions of Section 11.4(a) of the Lease has been satisfied may be disposed
of in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.4(a) of the Lease, and the
Owner Trustee shall, from time to time, direct the Indenture Trustee to,
provided no Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
execute and deliver to it, or as directed in writing by the Owner Trustee, an
appropriate instrument furnished by the Owner Trustee or the Lessee releasing
such Unit from the Lien of the Indenture, but only in respect of such Unit.

Section 5.07. Indenture Supplements for Replacements. In
the event of a Replacement Unit being substituted as contemplated by Section
11.2 of the Lease, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee agree for the
benefit of the holders of the Equipment Notes and the Lessee, subject to
compliance by the Lessee with its obligations set forth in Section 11 of the
Lease, to execute and deliver an Indenture Supplement substantially in the form
of Exhibit A hereto and, provided no Lease Event of Default or Lease Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, execute and deliver to the Lessee an
appropriate instrument releasing the Unit being replaced from the Lien of the
Indenture.

Section 5.08 Effect of Replacements. In the event of the
substitution of a Replacement Unit, all provisions of this Indenture relating
to the Unit or Units being replaced shall be applicable to such Replacement
Unit with the same force and effect as if such Replacement Unit was the same
Unit being replaced.

Section 5.09. Withholding Taxes. The Indenture Trustee, as
agent for the Owner Trustee, shall exclude and withhold from each payment of
principal, premium, if any, and interest and other amounts due hereunder or
under the Equipment Notes any and all withholding taxes applicable thereto as
required by law. The Indenture Trustee agrees to act as such withholding agent
and, in connection therewith, whenever any present or future taxes or similar
charges are required to be withheld with respect to any amounts payable in
respect of the Equipment Notes, to withhold such amounts and timely pay the
same to the appropriate authority in the name of and on behalf of the holders
of the Equipment Notes, that it will file any necessary withholding tax returns
or statements when due, and that, as promptly as possible after the payment
thereof, it will deliver to each holder of an Equipment Note appropriate
documentation showing the payment thereof, together with such additional
documentary evidence as such holders may reasonably request from time to time.

Section 5.10. Lessee's Right of Quiet Enjoyment.
Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Indenture to the contrary, so
long as Lessee is in compliance with its obligations under the Lease (including
applicable grace periods) and no Lease Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing unremedied, the Indenture Trustee will comply with Section 8 of the
Participation Agreement to the same extent as if it were the Lessor under the
Lease. Each

-26-
<PAGE> 31
holder of an Equipment Note, by its acceptance thereof, consents in all
respects to the terms of the Lease and the Participation Agreement and agrees
to the provisions of this Section 5.10.

ARTICLE VI.
THE OWNER TRUSTEE AND THE INDENTURE TRUSTEE

Section 6.01. Acceptance of Trusts and Duties. The
Indenture Trustee accepts the trusts hereby created and applicable to it and
agrees to perform the same but only upon the terms of this Indenture and agrees
to receive and disburse all moneys received by it constituting part of the

Indenture Trustee by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby shall,
subject to the Lien and priorities of payment as herein provided, look only to
the Indenture Estate for payment or satisfaction thereof.

enforceable) on overdue interest shall be paid from the due date thereof at the

All payments of principal and interest and premium, if any, to be made
hereunder and under the Trust Indenture and Security Agreement (GATC Trust No.
94-1), dated as of August 9, 1994 as from time to time amended and supplemented
(herein called the "Indenture", the defined terms therein not otherwise defined

scheduled date to the time of such payment on such next succeeding Business
Day.

Each holder hereof, by its acceptance of this Equipment Note, agrees that

and conditions of the trusts created by the Indenture, to all of which terms
and conditions in the Indenture each holder hereof agrees by its acceptance of

Trustee; Satisfaction of Conditions.

Section 2.6. Calculation of Adjustments to Basic Rent, Stipulated
Loss Value and Termination Value; Confirmation and Verification.

(a) Calculation of Adjustments. In the event that (A) the Closing
Date is other than August 16, 1994 or (B) the Transaction Costs paid by the
Owner Participant pursuant to Section 2.5 prior to the Basic Term Commencement
Date are less or more than 1% of the Total Equipment Cost or (C) a refinancing
contemplated by Section 10.2 occurs, then, in each such case, the Owner
Participant shall recalculate the payments or amounts, as the case may be, of
Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values, Termination Values, Early Purchase Price
and Basic Term Purchase Price, (i) to preserve the Net Economic Return that the
Owner Participant would have realized had the Closing Date been August 16,
1994, had the Transaction Costs equaled 1% of the Total Equipment Cost or had
such refinancing not occurred, and (ii) to minimize to the greatest extent
possible, consistent with the foregoing clause (i), the present value
(discounted semiannually at an interest rate per annum equal to the Debt Rate)
of the payments of Basic Rent.

- 7 -

<PAGE> 12
Any such recalculation performed due to the occurrence of an event described in
clause (A) or (B) above shall be made prior to the Basic Term Commencement
Date. In performing any such recalculation and in determining the Owner
Participant's Net Economic Return, the Owner Participant shall utilize the same
methods and assumptions originally used in making the computations of Basic
Rent, Stipulated Loss Values, Termination Values, Early Purchase Price and
Basic Term Purchase Price with respect to the Basic Term initially set forth in
Schedules 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 to this Participation Agreement (other than those
assumptions changed as a result of any of the events described in clauses (A)
through (C) of the preceding sentence necessitating such recalculation; it
being agreed that such recalculation shall reflect solely any changes of
assumptions or facts resulting directly from the event or events necessitating
such recalculation). Such adjustments shall comply (to the extent the original
structure complied) with Section 467 of the Code and the requirements of
Sections 4.02(5), 4.07(1) and (2) and 4.08(1) of Revenue Procedure 75-28, as
amended calculated, except in the case of a refinancing pursuant to Section
10.2 or any rent adjustment pursuant to Section 5(a)(3)(B) of the Tax Indemnity
Agreement, without taking into account any change after the Closing Date in or
to Section 467 of the Code (and any regulations thereunder) and such
requirements of Revenue Procedure 75-28.

(b) Confirmation and Verification. Upon completion of any
recalculation described above in this Section 2.6, a duly authorized officer of
the Owner Participant shall provide a certificate to the Lessee either (x)
stating that the payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values, Termination
Values, Early Purchase Price and Basic Term Purchase Price with respect to the
Basic Term as are then set forth in Schedules 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8 of this
Participation Agreement do not require change, or (y) setting forth such
adjustments to the payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values, Termination
Values, Early Purchase Price or Basic Term Purchase Price with respect to the
Basic Term as have been calculated by the Owner Participant in accordance with
Section 2.6(a) above. Such certificate shall describe in reasonable detail the
basis for any such adjustments. Any such adjustment shall become effective on
the thirty-first (31st) day following delivery by the Owner Participant of such
certificate to the Lessee unless Lessee, prior to such day, requests
verification pursuant to the following sentence. Any such adjustment and
corresponding adjustments to the Stipulated Loss Values, Termination Values,
Early Purchase Price and Basic Term Purchase Price will be computed on a basis
consistent with that used by the Owner Participant in the original calculation
of Basic Rent. If the Lessee shall so request, the recalculation of any such
adjustments described in this Section 2.6 shall be verified by a nationally
recognized firm of independent accountants selected by the Owner Participant
and reasonably acceptable to the Lessee and any such recalculation of such
adjustment as so verified shall be binding on the Lessee and the Owner
Participant. Such accounting firm shall be requested to make its determination
within 30 days. The Owner Participant shall provide to a representative of
such accounting firm, on a confidential basis, such information as it may
reasonably require, including the original assumptions used by the Owner
Participant and the methods used by the Owner Participant in the original
calculation of, and any recalculation of, Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values,
Termination Values, Early Purchase Price and Basic Term Purchase Price and such
other information as is necessary to determine whether the computation is
accurate and in conformity with the provisions of this Agreement, provided that
in no event shall the Owner Participant have any obligation to provide the
Lessee with any such information;

- 8 -

<PAGE> 13
and provided, further, that the Owner Participant shall have no obligation to
disclose to the Lessee, such accounting firm or any other Person, or to permit
the Lessee, such accounting firm or any other Person, to examine any federal,
state or local income tax returns of the Owner Participant, or books or
accounting records related thereto, for any taxable year. The costs of such
verification shall be borne by the Lessee. If such accounting firm's
verification shall result in a decrease in the net present value (expressed as
a percentage of Total Equipment Cost) of the Basic Rent (discounted
semiannually at a rate per annum equal to the Debt Rate) under this Lease
calculated as of the Closing Date, as compared to the net present value of
Basic Rent proposed by the Owner Participant, by more than the greater of (x)
10 basis points or (y) 10% of the proposed adjustment, then the Owner
Participant agrees to reimburse the Lessee for any amounts paid for such
verification. Any revised adjustment resulting from such verification shall
become effective on the next Rent Payment Date after such verification has been
concluded, and shall take into account any underpayment or overpayment,
together with interest thereon at the Debt Rate, resulting from an earlier
effectiveness of the original adjustment.

(c) Compliance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any adjustment
made to the payments of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Values, Termination Values
or Early Purchase Price with respect to the Basic Term, pursuant to the
foregoing, shall comply with the following requirements: (i) each installment
of Basic Rent (together with any Advance payable under Section 3.5 of the
Lease), as so adjusted, under any circumstances and in any event, will be in an
amount at least sufficient for the Owner Trustee to pay in full as of the due
date of such installment any payment of principal of and interest on the
Equipment Notes required to be paid on the due date of such installment of
Basic Rent, and (ii) Stipulated Loss Value, Termination Value and Early
Purchase Price, as so adjusted, under any circumstances and in any event, will
be an amount which, together with any other amounts required to be paid by the
Lessee under the Lease in connection with an Event of Loss or a termination of
the Lease, as the case may be, will be at least sufficient to pay in full, as
of the date of payment thereof, the aggregate unpaid principal of, premium, if
any, and all unpaid interest on the Equipment Notes, accrued to the date on
which Stipulated Loss Value, Termination Value or Early Purchase Price, as the
case may be, is paid in accordance with the terms of the Lease.

(d) Invoices. All invoices in respect of Transaction Costs to the
extent not delivered on the Closing Date shall be directed to the Owner
Participant at the address set forth in Section 10.4, with a copy to the
Lessee.

Section 2.7. Postponement of Closing Date.

(a) The scheduled Closing Date may be postponed from time to time
with respect to all of the Units for any reason (but to no later than 15 days
following such scheduled Closing Date) if the Lessee gives the Owner
Participant, the Indenture Trustee, the Pass Through Trustee and the Owner
Trustee telex, telegraphic, facsimile or telephonic (confirmed in writing)
notice of the postponement and notice of the date to which such Closing Date
has been postponed, the notice of postponement to be received by each party no
later than 5:30 P.M., New York City

- 9 -

<PAGE> 14
time, on the originally scheduled Closing Date, and the term "Closing Date" as
used in this Agreement shall mean the postponed "Closing Date".

(b) In the event of any postponement of the originally scheduled
Closing Date pursuant to this Section 2.7 (the originally scheduled Closing
Date being referred to as the "Scheduled Closing Date" for the purposes of this
Section 2.7): (i) the Lessee will reimburse the Owner Participant for the loss
of the use of its funds with respect to each such Unit occasioned by such
postponement or failure to deliver or accept (unless such failure to accept is
caused by a default by the Owner Participant hereunder or by the Owner Trustee
(acting pursuant to instructions from the Owner Participant) under the Trust
Agreement, the Lease or the Indenture) by paying to the Owner Participant on
demand interest at the Debt Rate, for the period from and including the
Scheduled Closing Date to but excluding the earlier of the date upon which such
funds are returned to the Owner Participant (unless such funds are returned
after 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) in which case such date of return shall be
included) or the actual Closing Date; provided that the Lessee shall in any
event pay to the Owner Participant at least one day's interest at the Debt Rate
on the amount of such funds, unless the Owner Participant shall have received,
prior to 1:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the Business Day preceding the
Scheduled Closing Date, a notice of postponement of the Scheduled Closing Date
pursuant to Section 2.7(a), and (ii) the Indenture Trustee will return not
later than 10:00 A.M. New York City time, on the first Business Day following
the Scheduled Closing Date, any funds which it shall have received from the
Owner Participant as its Commitment for such Units, absent joint instructions
from the Lessee and the Owner Participant to retain such funds until the
specified date of postponement established under Section 2.7(a).

(c) The Indenture Trustee agrees that, in the event it has
received telephonic notice (to be confirmed promptly in writing) from the
Lessee on the Scheduled Closing Date that such Scheduled Closing Date is to be
postponed, it will if instructed in the aforementioned notice from the Lessee
(which notice shall specify the securities to be purchased) use reasonable best
efforts to invest, at the risk of the Lessee (except as provided below with
respect to the Indenture Trustee's gross negligence or willful misconduct), the
funds received by it from the Owner Participant with respect to its Commitment
in Specified Investments in accordance with the Lessee's instructions. Any
such Specified Investments purchased by the Indenture Trustee upon instructions
from the Lessee shall be held in trust by the Indenture Trustee (but not as
part of the Indenture Estate under the Indenture) for the benefit of the Owner
Participant whose funds are invested in Specified Investments upon instructions
from the Lessee and any net profits on the investment of such funds (including
interest), if any, shall be for the account of and shall on the Closing Date,
or on the date such funds are returned to the Owner Participant, be paid over
to, the Lessee. The Lessee shall pay to the Indenture Trustee on the Closing
Date (if such Unit or Units are delivered and accepted pursuant hereto) the
amount of any net loss on the investment of such funds invested at the
instruction of the Lessee. If the funds furnished by the Owner Participant

appropriate proceedings by the Lessee and none of which are material), and no
tax liens have been filed and no claims are being asserted with respect to any

or assignment of the Beneficial Interest in violation of this Section 6.1 shall
be of no effect as between the parties to this Agreement. Subject to the
rights of the Lessee pursuant to subsection 6.1(o), the provisions of this

discharge and satisfy in full any such Lessor's Lien (by bonding or otherwise,
so long as Lessee's operation and use of the Equipment and the interest of the
Indenture Trustee in the Indenture Estate is not impaired); provided that the
Owner Participant may contest any such Lessor's Lien in good faith by
appropriate proceedings so long as such proceedings do not involve any material
danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss of the Equipment or any interest therein
or interference with the use, operation, or possession of the Equipment by the
Lessee under the Lease or the rights of the Indenture Trustee under the
Indenture.

Section 6.3. Lessor's Liens Attributable to the Owner Trustee.
The Owner Trustee, in its individual capacity, hereby unconditionally agrees
with and for the benefit of the other

- 32 -
<PAGE> 37
parties to this Agreement that the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity
will not directly or indirectly create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any
Lessor's Liens on or against any part of the Trust Estate or the Equipment
attributable to the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, and the Owner
Trustee in its individual capacity agrees that it will, at its own cost and
expense, take such action as may be necessary to duly discharge and satisfy in
full any such Lessor's Lien attributable to the Owner Trustee in its individual
capacity (by bonding or otherwise, so long as Lessee's operation and use of the
Equipment and the interest of the Indenture Trustee in the Indenture Estate is
not impaired); provided that the Owner Trustee may contest any such Lessor's
Lien in good faith by appropriate proceedings so long as such proceedings do
not involve any material danger of the sale, forfeiture or loss of the
Equipment or any interest therein or interference with the use, operation, or
possession of the Equipment by the Lessee under the Lease or the right of the
Indenture Trustee under the Indenture.

Section 6.4. Liens Created by the Indenture Trustee and the Loan
Participant.

(a) The Indenture Trustee, in its individual capacity, covenants 
and agrees with the Lessee, the Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant and the 
Loan Participant that it shall not cause or permit to exist any Lien on the
Equipment or all or any portion of any Trust Estate or the Indenture Estate
arising as a result of (i) claims against the Indenture Trustee in its
individual capacity not related to its interest in the Equipment and any Trust
Estate, or to the administration of the Indenture Estate pursuant to the
Indenture, (ii) acts of the Indenture Trustee in its individual capacity not
contemplated by, or failure of the Indenture Trustee to take any action it is
expressly required to perform by, the Operative Agreements, (iii) claims
against the Indenture Trustee in its individual capacity relating to Taxes or
expenses that are not indemnified against by the Lessee pursuant to Section 7
attributable to the actions of the Indenture Trustee, solely in its individual
capacity, or (iv) claims against the Indenture Trustee arising out of the
transfer by the Indenture Trustee of all or any portion of its interest in the
Equipment, the Indenture Estate or the Operative Agreements, other than a
transfer permitted by the Operative Agreements and that the Indenture Trustee
will, at its own cost and expense (and without any right of reimbursement from
any other party hereto), promptly take such action as may be necessary duly to
discharge any such Lien.

(b) The Loan Participant covenants and agrees with the Lessee, the
Owner Trustee, the Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee that it shall
not cause or permit to exist any Lien on the Equipment or all or any portion of
any Trust Estate or the Indenture Estate arising as a result of (i) claims
against such Loan Participant not related to its interest in the Equipment and
any Trust Estate, (ii) acts of such Loan Participant not contemplated by, or
failure of such Loan Participant to take any action it is expressly required to
perform by, the Operative Agreements, (iii) claims against such Loan
Participant relating to Taxes or expenses that are not indemnified against by
the Lessee pursuant to Section 7, or (iv) claims against such Loan Participant
arising out of the transfer by such Loan Participant of all or any portion of
its interest in the Equipment, the Indenture Estate or the Operative
Agreements, other than a transfer permitted by the Operative Agreements and
that such Loan Participant will, at its own cost and expense (and

- 33 -
<PAGE> 38

without any right of reimbursement from the Lessee), promptly take such action
as may be necessary duly to discharge any such Lien.

Section 6.5. Covenants of Owner Trustee, Owner Participant and
Indenture Trustee. The Owner Participant, and the Owner Trustee in its
individual and trust capacity, hereby agree, as to their own actions only,
severally and not jointly, with the Lessee, the Loan Participant and the
Indenture Trustee (a) not to amend, supplement, or otherwise modify any
provision of the Trust Agreement in such a manner as to adversely affect the
rights of the Lessee, the Loan Participant or the Indenture Trustee without the
prior written consent of such party and (b) not to terminate or revoke the
Trust Agreement or the trusts created by the Trust Agreement prior to the
payment in full and discharge of the Equipment Notes and all other indebtedness
secured by the Indenture and the final discharge thereof pursuant to Section
7.1 thereof or prior to the expiration or early termination of the Lease. Each
of the Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee agrees, for the benefit of the
Lessee and the Owner Participant, to comply with the provisions of the
Indenture and not to amend, supplement, or otherwise modify any provision of
the Indenture except in the manner provided in Article IX thereof.
Notwithstanding any provision herein or in any of the Operative Agreements to
the contrary, the Indenture Trustee's obligation to take or refrain from taking
any actions, or to use its discretion (including, but not limited to, the
giving or withholding of consent or approval and the exercise of any rights or
remedies under such Operative Agreements), and any liability therefor, shall,
in addition to any other limitations provided herein or in the other Operative
Agreements, be limited by the provisions of the Indenture.

Section 6.6. Amendments to Operative Agreements. The Trustees
and Participants will not terminate the Operative Agreements to which the
Lessee is not or will not be a party, or amend, supplement, waive or modify
such Operative Agreements in any manner that increases the obligations or
liabilities, or decreases the rights, of the Lessee under such Operative
Agreements, except in accordance with such Operative Agreements in effect on
the date hereof (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in
accordance with the terms hereof and of such Operative Agreements). The Owner
Participant and the Trustees (as applicable) agree that, in any event, they
will not amend Section 2.10 or Article IX of the Indenture or Article IX of the
Trust Agreement without the prior written consent of the Lessee.

Section 6.7. Covenant of the Lessee. The Lessee hereby agrees
with the Owner Trustee, each Participant and the Indenture Trustee to deliver
to the Owner Trustee on the Closing Date the Bill of Sale evidencing the
purchase and transfer of title of each Unit to be settled for on the Closing
Date.

Section 6.8. Merger Covenant. The Lessee shall not consolidate
with or merge into any other Person, or permit any other Person to merge into
it, or convey, transfer or lease substantially all of its assets as an entirety
to any Person unless (i) the Person formed by such consolidation or surviving
such merger (if other than the Lessee) or the Person which acquires by
conveyance, transfer or lease substantially all of the assets of the Lessee as
an entirety is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the
United States or any state thereof or the

- 34 -
<PAGE> 39

District of Columbia and shall execute and deliver to the Owner Trustee, the
Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee an agreement containing the
assumption by such successor corporation of the due and punctual performance
and observance of each covenant and condition of this Agreement and each of the
other Lessee Agreements to be performed or observed by the Lessee, (ii)
immediately prior to and immediately after giving effect to such transaction,
no Lease Default or Lease Event of Default shall have occurred, whether as a
result of such consolidation or merger or such conveyance, transfer or lease or
otherwise, (iii) the Lessee shall have made all filings necessary or
appropriate in the reasonable opinion of the Owner Trustee and the Indenture
Trustee in order to preserve and protect the rights of the Lessor under the
Lease and of the Indenture Trustee under the Indenture and (iv) there shall
have been delivered to the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee an Officer's Certificate of the successor to the Lessee (or
such Person as is the surviving corporation) and an opinion of counsel (which
may be such Person's in-house counsel) in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee and the Indenture
Trustee, each stating that such consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer or
lease and the assumption agreement mentioned in clause (i) above comply with
this Section 6.8. Upon such consolidation or merger, or any conveyance,
transfer or lease of substantially all of the assets of the Lessee as an
entirety in accordance with this Section 6.8, the successor corporation formed
by such consolidation or into which the Lessee is merged or to which such
conveyance, transfer or lease is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for,
and may exercise every right and power of, the Lessee under this Agreement and
the other Operative Agreements with the same effect as if such successor
corporation had been named as the Lessee herein.

Section 6.9. Lessee's Purchase in Certain Circumstances. If an
Owner Participant, any subsequent transferee or any Affiliate thereof is or
acquires, is acquired by, merges or otherwise consolidates with any company or
Affiliate thereof engaged in full service railcar leasing, whether or not a
direct competitor to the Lessee or any Affiliate thereof, or any Person that
has a material interest (whether held directly or indirectly) in an enterprise
that engages in a business that is competitive with the Lessee's full service
railcar leasing business, the Lessee may, on a Determination Date which is
designated by the Lessee by written notice to the Owner Trustee and the
Indenture Trustee not less than 25 days prior to such Determination Date,
purchase the Equipment for a purchase price equal to the greater of Termination
Value or the Fair Market Sales Value, each calculated as of such Determination
Date, plus in either case all accrued and unpaid Rent for the Equipment as of
the date of purchase and any Make-Whole Amount then payable on the Equipment
Notes pursuant to Section 2.10(c) of the Indenture; provided, that Lessee's
rights to purchase the Equipment pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall terminate
90 days after receipt by Lessee of written notice from the Owner Participant or
any subsequent transferee or any Affiliate thereof, of any such acquisition,
merger or consolidation; provided further, that an institutional investor which
is a passive investor in the financing of equipment or facilities used in full
service railcar leasing shall not, solely by reason of such investment, be
deemed to be engaged in such businesses; provided, further, that none of any
Owner Participant or any subsequent transferee or Affiliate thereof shall be
deemed to (i) be engaged in full service railcar leasing or (ii) hold (directly
or indirectly) any material interest in any business that is competitive with
Lessee's full service railcar leasing business, solely by reason of any sale,
lease or other

- 35 -
<PAGE> 40

disposition (or any actions in furtherance of any of the foregoing), of any of
such Person's interest in any equipment or facilities directly or indirectly
owned, leased or otherwise controlled pursuant to any such Person's passive
investment or loan participation in the financing of any such equipment or
facilities used in full service railcar leasing or any re-leasing or sale of
any rail equipment which is returned to or repossessed by or on behalf of the
Owner Participant or any Affiliate from a lessee or borrower in connection with
a lease financing or lender transaction entered into by the Owner Participant
or such Affiliate as a passive lessor, investor or lender. In the event of
such a purchase by or on behalf of Lessee under this Section 6.9, payment of
the purchase price, together with all other amounts due and owing by Lessee
under the Operative Agreements, shall be made in immediately available funds
against delivery of a bill of sale transferring and assigning to the Lessee all
right, title and interest of the Lessor in and to the Equipment on an "as-is"
"where-is" basis and containing a warranty against Lessor's Liens.

Section 6.10. Owner Participant an Affiliate of Lessee. If at
any time the original or any successor Owner Participant shall be an Affiliate
of the Lessee, such Owner Participant and the Lessee agree that notwithstanding
Section 9.05 of the Indenture they will not vote its Beneficial Interest to
modify, amend or supplement any provision of the Lease or this Agreement or
give, or permit the Owner Trustee to give, any consent, waiver, authorization
or approval thereunder if any such action would adversely affect in a material
manner the Indenture Trustee or any holder of an Equipment Note unless such
action shall have been consented to by a Majority in Interest.

Section 6.11. Corporate Existence; Place of Business. The Lessee
shall at all times maintain its corporate existence except as permitted by
Section 6.8; and it shall do or cause to be done all things necessary to
preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate rights, powers,
privileges and franchises except for any corporate right, power, privilege or
franchise that it in good faith determines is no longer necessary or desirable
in the conduct of its business.

Section 6.12. No Impairment of Warranties. From and after the
Closing Date and throughout the Lease Term, the Lessee shall not take any
action (or fail to take any action) if the result of such action (or failure to
act) would abrogate or invalidate or otherwise materially adversely affect the
validity of any warranties applicable to the Units which would otherwise be
available with respect to the Units.

SECTION 7. LESSEE'S INDEMNITIES.

Section 7.1. General Tax Indemnity.

(a) Tax Indemnitee Defined. For purposes of this Section 7.1,
"Tax Indemnitee" means the Owner Participant, its Affiliates, the Owner Trustee
both in its individual capacity and as trustee, the Indenture Trustee both in
its individual capacity and as trustee, each of their respective successors or
assigns permitted under the terms of the Operative Agreements,

- 36 -
<PAGE> 41

any officer, director, employee or agent of any of the foregoing, the Trust
Estate and the Indenture Estate.

(b) Taxes Indemnified. All payments by the Lessee to any Tax
Indemnitee in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Operative
Agreements shall be free of withholdings of any nature whatsoever (and at the
time that the Lessee is required to make any payment upon which any withholding
is required the Lessee shall pay an additional amount such that the net amount
actually received will, after such withholding and on an After-Tax Basis, equal
the full amount of the payment then due) and shall be free of expense to each
Tax Indemnitee for collection or other charges, provided, however, that no such
additional amounts shall be paid by the Lessee and the Lessee assumes no
responsibility regarding any withholdings imposed by reason of any transfer of
the Equipment or any interest in the Operative Agreements by the Lessor or the
Owner Participant other than any Transfer which occurs during the continuance
of a Lease Default or Lease Event of Default. If, for any reason, the Lessee
is required to make any payment to a taxing authority with respect to, or as a
result of, any withholding tax imposed on any Tax Indemnitee in respect of the
transactions contemplated by the Operative Agreements which withholding tax is
not the responsibility of the Lessee under this Section 7.1 then such Tax
Indemnitee shall pay to the Lessee within 30 days of a demand an amount which
equals the amount paid by the Lessee with respect to, or as a result of, such
withholding tax, plus interest computed at such Tax Indemnitee's cost of funds
rate during the period commencing on the date the Lessee shall have paid an
additional amount pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph and ending
on the date the Lessee actually receives such payment. Subject to the
exclusions stated in subsection (c) below, the Lessee agrees to indemnify and
hold harmless each Tax Indemnitee, on an After-Tax Basis, taking into account
the income tax consequences to the Tax Indemnitee of the accrual or receipt of
an indemnity payment, against all fees (including, without limitation, license,
documentation or other fees and registration fees), taxes (including, without
limitation, income, gross receipts, franchise, sales, use, rental, turnover,
business, occupation, excise, value-added, tangible and intangible personal
property and stamp taxes), levies, assessments, imposts, duties, charges or
withholdings of any nature, together with any and all penalties, additions to
tax, fines or interest thereon ("Taxes") imposed upon any Tax Indemnitee, the
Lessee or any Person in possession of the Equipment or all or any part of the
Equipment by any federal, state or local government, political subdivision, or
taxing authority in the United States or its possessions, by any government or
taxing authority of or in a foreign country or by any international authority,
upon, with respect to or in connection with:

(i) the Equipment or any part of any of the Equipment or
interest therein;

(ii) the acquisition, financing, ownership, leasing,
possession, purchase, acceptance, rejection, condition, registration,
return, use, storage, operation, return, transfer of title,
maintenance, repair, improvement, replacement, substitution, delivery,
redelivery, non-delivery, transport, preparation, assembly, insurance,
construction, manufacture, insuring, modification, transfer, control,
occupancy, servicing, mortgaging, location, refinancing, disposition,
subleasing, repossession, abandonment, sale or other application

- 37 -
<PAGE> 42
or disposition of or with respect to the Equipment or any part of any
of the Equipment or interest therein;

(iii) the rental payments, receipts of earnings arising
from any Unit of Equipment or payable pursuant to the Lease;

(iv) the Equipment Notes, their issuance, acquisition,
transfer or refinancing or (as between the Lessee and any Tax
Indemnitee other than the Indenture Estate) the payment of principal,
interest or premium or other amounts with respect thereto; and

(v) the Operative Agreements or otherwise in connection
with the transactions contemplated thereby.

(c) Taxes Excluded. The indemnity provided for in paragraph (b)
above shall not extend to any of the following:

(i) In the case of the Owner Participant, the Owner
Trustee or the Trust Estate, Income Taxes (as defined in Section
7.1(l), below) imposed by (A) the United States federal government,
other than any United States federal Income Taxes imposed by way of
deduction or withholding upon or with respect to payments on any
Equipment Notes, together with any penalties, fines, additions to Tax
or interest related thereto (provided that this subclause (A) shall
not be construed as preventing Lessee from recouping any such
deduction or withholding from the Indenture Trustee, the Pass Through
Trustee or any Certificateholder or as giving to the Indenture Trustee
a right to indemnification by the Lessee for Taxes payable pursuant to
Section 5.09 of the Indenture), (B) any state or local tax
jurisdiction in the United States (unless such Tax Indemnitee would
not have been subject to tax in such jurisdiction but for this
transaction (including the operation or presence of any Unit (or part
thereof) and other leasing transactions between the Lessee (or its
Affiliates) and the Owner Participant (or its Affiliates) or the
Lessee making payment from or performing other actions in such
jurisdiction)), provided, however, that for purposes of this clause
(B), the determination of (y) whether any Tax Indemnitee is treated as
being incorporated or having its principal place of business in any
state or local tax jurisdiction under this clause (B), or (z) whether
any such Tax Indemnitee is deemed to be subject to tax in any state or
local tax jurisdiction but for this transaction under this clause (B),
shall be made by treating each corporation which is a Tax Indemnitee
on a stand-alone basis and without regard to any Affiliates, related
Tax Indemnitees or other entities, except to the extent that such Tax
Indemnitee files combined or consolidated tax returns in such state or
local jurisdiction, respectively, with one or more Affiliates which
are also Tax Indemnitees, (C) any foreign government or any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or any territory or possession
of the United States or by any international authority except to the
extent such Income Taxes would not have been imposed by such
jurisdiction but for the use, location, operation, presence or
registration of any Unit or part thereof in such jurisdiction or the
activities of the Lessee or any of its Affiliates in such jurisdiction
or the making of any

- 38 -
<PAGE> 43

payments from such jurisdiction by or on behalf of the Lessee pursuant
to the Operative Agreements or (D) any government or jurisdiction
described in (A), (B) or (C) of this clause (i) because the applicable
Tax Indemnitee is not a resident of the United States for tax
purposes.

(ii) Taxes imposed with respect to any period after the
earliest of (x) the return of possession of the Equipment to the Owner
Participant or the placement of the Equipment in storage at the
request of the Owner Participant, in either case pursuant to Section 6
of the Lease, (y) the termination of the Lease Term pursuant to
Section 22.1 or Section 22.3 of the Lease, or (z) the discharge in
full of the Lessee's obligation to pay the Termination Value or the
Stipulated Loss Value and all other amounts due, if any, under Section
10 or 11.2 of the Lease, as the case may be, with respect to the
Equipment; provided that the exclusion set forth in this clause (ii)
shall not apply to Taxes to the extent such Taxes relate to events
occurring or matters arising prior to or simultaneously with such
time;

(iii) As to any Tax Indemnitee, Taxes to the extent caused
by any misrepresentation or breach of warranty or covenant under the
Operative Agreements or by the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of such Tax Indemnitee;

(iv) As to any Tax Indemnitee, Taxes which become payable
as a result of a sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition
(whether voluntary or involuntary) by such Tax Indemnitee of all or
any portion of its interest in the Equipment or any part thereof, the
Trust Estate or any of the Operative Agreements or rights created
thereunder other than as a result of the substitution, modification or
improvement of the Equipment or any part thereof or a disposition
which occurs as the result of the exercise of remedies for a Lease
Event of Default, any disposition which occurs during the continuance
of a Lease Event of Default or a purchase of any Unit pursuant to the
Lease; provided, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Lessee shall not
be obligated to indemnify any Tax Indemnitee with respect to net
income taxes imposed within the United States as the result of a sale,
assignment, transfer or other disposition by such Tax Indemnitee or
any Taxes imposed as a result of the status of the Tax Indemnitee as
other than a resident of the United States for tax purposes;

(v) Taxes which result from the Owner Trustee's engaging
on behalf of the Trust Estate in transactions unrelated to those
permitted or contemplated by the Operative Agreements;

(vi) As to any Tax Indemnitee, Taxes to the extent they
exceed the Taxes that would have been imposed had the initial Tax
Indemnitee not transferred, sold or otherwise disposed of any interest
held by such Tax Indemnitee pursuant to any of the Operative
Agreements; and

- 39 -
<PAGE> 44
(vii) Taxes imposed on the Owner Trustee based on the
Owner Trustee's fee for services under the Trust Agreement.

(d) All Tax Obligations in this Section, etc. Notwithstanding any
other provision anywhere contained in the Operative Agreements, it is
understood that except as provided in Section 6.2, with respect to the Owner
Participant, and Section 6.3, with respect to the Owner Trustee, and except as
provided in Section 5.03 of the Indenture, the Owner Participant and the Owner
Trustee shall have no obligations with respect to Taxes or other charges to the
Indenture Trustee or the Loan Participant imposed under Section 7.16 of the
Pass Through Trust Agreement or Section 5.09 of the Indenture, or otherwise.

(e) Payments to Lessee.

(i) If any Tax Indemnitee shall realize a Tax benefit 
(net of any Tax detriment not otherwise paid or indemnified against 
by the Lessee hereunder) as a result of any Taxes paid or indemnified 
against by the Lessee under this Section 7.1 (whether by way of 
deduction, credit, allocation or apportionment or otherwise), such 
Tax Indemnitee shall pay to the Lessee an amount equal to the amount 
of such Tax benefit, increased by the Tax Indemnitee's additional 
saved Taxes attributable to the payment being made to the Lessee 
hereunder; provided, however, that in no event shall the aggregate 
amount paid by any Tax Indemnitee to the Lessee with respect to any 
realized Tax benefit exceed the aggregate amount previously advanced 
by the Lessee with respect to such Taxes but provided, further, that 
such excess shall be carried forward to reduce or offset any future 
obligations of the Lessee to such Tax Indemnitee under this Section 
7.1.

(ii) Upon receipt by a Tax Indemnitee of a refund or
credit of all or part of any Taxes paid or indemnified against by the
Lessee, such Tax Indemnitee shall pay to the Lessee an amount equal to
the amount of such refund plus any interest received by or credited to
such Tax Indemnitee with respect to such refund increased or
decreased, as the case may be, by the Tax Indemnitee's net additional
or saved taxes attributable to the receipt of such amounts from the
taxing authority and the payment being made to the Lessee hereunder.

(iii) The Tax Indemnitee shall in good faith file its Tax
returns and deal with taxing authorities to seek and claim any such
tax benefits or refunds.

(f) Procedures. Any amount payable to a Tax Indemnitee pursuant
to paragraph (b) shall be paid within 30 days after receipt of a written demand
therefor from such Tax Indemnitee accompanied by a written statement describing
in reasonable detail the basis for such indemnity and the computation of the
amount so payable, provided that such amount need not be paid prior to (i) the
date on which such Taxes are due, or (ii) in the case of amounts which are
being contested pursuant to paragraph (g) hereof, the time such Taxes are due
and payable pursuant to the resolution of such contest (including all appeals).
Any amount payable to the Lessee pursuant

- 40 -
<PAGE> 45

to paragraph (e) shall be paid within 30 days after the Tax Indemnitee realizes
a net tax benefit or receives a refund giving rise to a payment under paragraph
(e), and shall be accompanied by a written statement by the Tax Indemnitee
setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for computing the amount of such
payment. Within 15 days following the Lessee's receipt of any computation from
the Tax Indemnitee, the Lessee may request that the accounting firm that
regularly prepares the certified financial statements of the Tax Indemnitee
determine whether such computations of the Tax Indemnitee are correct. Such
accounting firm shall be requested to make the determination contemplated by
this paragraph (f) within 30 days of its selection. In the event such
accounting firm shall determine that such computations are incorrect, then such
firm shall determine what it believes to be the correct computations. The Tax
Indemnitee shall cooperate with such accounting firm and supply it with all
information necessary to permit it to accomplish such determination on a
confidential basis. The computations of such accounting firm shall be final,
binding and conclusive upon the parties and the Lessee shall have no right to
inspect the books, records or tax returns of the Tax Indemnitee to verify such
computation or for any other purpose. All fees and expenses of the accounting
firm payable under this Section 7.1(f) shall be borne by the Lessee except that
if such accounting firm determines that the Tax Indemnitee's computations were
incorrect and understated the payments owing to the Lessee or overstated the
payments owing to such Tax Indemnitee by 10% or more of the correct amount as
determined by such accounting firm, then the Tax Indemnitee shall bear the fees
and expenses of such accounting firm.

(g) Contest. If a written claim is made against a Tax Indemnitee
for Taxes with respect to which the Lessee may be liable for indemnity
hereunder, the Tax Indemnitee shall give the Lessee prompt notice in writing of
such claim (and in any event within 30 days after its receipt) and shall
promptly furnish the Lessee with copies of the claim and all other writings
received from the taxing authority relating to the claim; provided however,
that the failure of such Tax Indemnitee to timely provide such written notice
shall not affect the Lessee's obligations under this Section 7.1(g) except to
the extent that the same materially adversely affects the ability of the Lessee
to contest such Taxes. The Tax Indemnitee shall not pay such claim prior to
the 30 days after providing the Lessee with such written notice, unless
required to do so by law or unless deferral of payment would cause material
adverse consequences to the Tax Indemnitee. The Tax Indemnitee shall in good
faith, with due diligence and at the Lessee's expense, if requested in writing
by the Lessee, contest (including pursuing all appeals permitted hereby) in the
name of the Tax Indemnitee (or, if requested by the Lessee and permissible as a
matter of law, in the name of the Lessee), or shall permit the Lessee to
contest in either the name of the Lessee or with the Tax Indemnitee's consent,
in the name of the Tax Indemnitee the validity, applicability or amount of such
Taxes by,

(i) resisting payment thereof if practical;

(ii) not paying the same except under protest if protest
is necessary and proper;

- 41 -
<PAGE> 46
(iii) if the payment be made, using reasonable efforts to
obtain a refund thereof in appropriate administrative and judicial
proceedings; or

(iv) taking such other reasonable action as is reasonably
requested by the Lessee from time to time.

provided, however, that to the extent the contest is carried on in the name of
the Lessee or an Affiliate, or is brought in the name of a Tax Indemnitee and
involves only Taxes for which the Lessee is or will be liable hereunder, such
contest shall be undertaken by the Lessee at the Lessee's expense (unless at
any time the Tax Indemnitee determines in its reasonable good faith judgment
that based upon the Lessee's conduct of such contest the Lessee's continued
control of such contest is reasonably likely to have a material adverse impact
on the Tax Indemnitee) and at no-after-tax cost to any Tax Indemnitee, but if
such contest would involve any other Taxes or any Taxes in the nature of a tax
on net income then such Tax Indemnitee may in its sole discretion control such
contest (including selecting the forum for such contest). In no event shall
any Tax Indemnitee be required or the Lessee be permitted to contest any Taxes
for which the Lessee is obligated to indemnify pursuant to this Section unless:
(i) such Lessee shall have acknowledged its liability to such Tax Indemnitee
for an indemnity payment pursuant to this Section as a result of such claim if
and to the extent such Indemnitee or the Lessee, as the case may be, shall not
prevail in the contest of such claim; (ii) such Tax Indemnitee shall have
received the opinion of tax counsel (which may, in the case of Taxes imposed by
a taxing authority located in the United States, include in-house counsel of
the Lessee) selected by the Lessee and satisfactory to the Tax Indemnitee
furnished at Lessee's sole expense, to the effect that a reasonable basis
consistent with ABA Opinion 85-352 exists for contesting such claim or, in the
event of an appeal, that it is more likely than not that an appellate court
will reverse or substantially modify the adverse determination (and provided
that no appeal shall be required to the United States Supreme Court); (iii) the
Lessee shall have agreed to pay such Tax Indemnitee on demand (and at no
after-tax cost to any Tax Indemnitee) all reasonable costs and expenses that
such Tax Indemnitee actually incurs in connection with contesting such claim
(including, without limitation, all costs, expenses, reasonable legal and
accounting fees, disbursements, penalties, interest and additions to the
Taxes); (iv) no Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and shall have been
continuing; (v) such Tax Indemnitee shall have determined that the action to be
taken will not result in any risk of imposition of criminal penalties or
substantial danger of sale, forfeiture or loss of, or the creation of any Lien
(except if such Lessee shall have adequately bonded such Lien or otherwise made
provision to protect the interests of such Tax Indemnitee in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to such Tax Indemnitee) on the Equipment or any portion
thereof or any interest therein; and (vi) if such contest shall be conducted in
a manner requiring the payment of the claim, the Lessee shall have paid the
amount required (at no after-tax cost to such Tax Indemnitee). The Lessee
shall cooperate with the Tax Indemnitee with respect to any contest controlled
and conducted by the Tax Indemnitee and the Tax Indemnitee shall consult with
the Lessee regarding the conduct of such contest. The Tax Indemnitee shall
cooperate with the Lessee with respect to any contest controlled and conducted
by the Lessee and the Lessee shall consult with the Tax Indemnitee regarding
the conduct of such contest.

<PAGE> 47
In no event will a Tax Indemnitee be required to contest any Taxes if
such Tax Indemnitee shall waive its right to an indemnity under this Section
7.1. Unless a Tax Indemnitee obtains the consent of the Lessee, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld (provided, however, the Lessee shall not be
considered to have unreasonably withheld such consent because of (i) any
failure by the Lessee to consider any issue or dispute of the Tax Indemnitee
not directly related to the claim giving rise to the contest rights in issue or
(ii) the Lessee's consideration of the effects of such settlement on issues of
the Lessee which are not the subject of such claim), the settlement of any
contest required under Section 7.1 by a Tax Indemnitee shall constitute a
waiver by such Tax Indemnitee of its rights to indemnification hereunder as to
such contest and as to any future claims for which the Lessee's right to
contest shall have been precluded by such Tax Indemnitees' failure to contest.

(h) For purposes of this Section 7.1 and Section 7.2, in
determining the order in which any Tax Indemnitee utilizes withholding or other
foreign taxes as a credit against such Tax Indemnitee's United States income
taxes, such Tax Indemnitee shall be deemed to utilize (i) first, all foreign
taxes other than those described in clause (ii) below; provided, however, that
such other foreign taxes which are carried back to the taxable year for which a
determination is being made (other than any carrybacks which are known to be
available at the time such determination is made) pursuant to such clause (i)
shall be deemed utilized after the foreign taxes described in clause (ii)
below, and (ii) then, on a pro rata basis, all foreign taxes (including fees,
taxes and other charges hereunder) with respect to which such Tax Indemnitee is
entitled to obtain indemnification pursuant to an indemnification provision
contained in any lease, loan agreement, financing document or participation
agreement (including the Lease).

(i) In the event any reports with respect to Taxes are required to
be made, the Lessee will either prepare and file such reports (and in the case
of reports which are required to be filed on the basis of individual items of
Equipment, such reports shall be prepared and filed in such manner as to show
as required the interests of each Tax Indemnitee in such item of Equipment) or,
if it shall not be permitted to file the same, it will notify each Tax
Indemnitee of such reporting requirements, prepare such reports in such manner
as shall be reasonably satisfactory to each Tax Indemnitee and deliver the same
to each Tax Indemnitee within a reasonable period prior to the date the same is
to be filed. The Lessee shall provide such information as the Owner
Participant or the Lessor may reasonably require from the Lessee to enable the
Owner Participant and the Lessor to fulfill their respective tax filing, tax
audit, and tax litigation obligations.

(j) The provisions of this Section 7.1 shall continue in full
force and effect, notwithstanding the expiration or termination of any
Operative Agreement, until all obligations hereunder have been met and all
liabilities hereunder paid in full.

(k) Any amount payable to the Lessee pursuant to the terms of this
Section 7.1 shall not be paid or retained by the Lessee if at the time of such
payment or retention a Lease Default relating to Sections 14(a), 14(b), 14(g)
or 14(h) or a Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing.
Such otherwise paid or retained amounts may be applied by the related Tax
Indemnitee to satisfy the obligations of the Lessee under the Operative
Agreements. At such time

- 43 -
<PAGE> 48

as there shall not be continuing any such Lease Default or Lease Event of
Default, such amount shall be paid to the Lessee without interest to the extent
not previously applied in accordance with the preceding sentence.

(l) For purposes of this Section 7.1, the term "Income Tax" means
any Tax based on or measured by or with respect to gross, adjusted gross or net
income (including without limitation, capital gains taxes, minimum taxes and
tax preferences) or gross or net receipts and Taxes which are capital, net
worth, conduct of business, franchise or excess profits taxes and interest,
additions to tax, penalties, or other charges in respect thereof (provided,
however, that sales, use, rental, value-added (other than a value-added tax
which is a tax or is in the nature of a tax on net or adjusted gross income),
excise, or property taxes shall not constitute an Income Tax).

Section 7.2. General Indemnification and Waiver of Certain Claims.

(a) Claims Defined. For the purposes of this Section 7.2,
"Claims" shall mean any and all costs, expenses, liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions or suits or claims of whatsoever kind or
nature (whether or not on the basis of negligence, strict or absolute liability
or liability in tort) which may be imposed on, incurred by, suffered by, or
asserted against an Indemnified Person, as defined herein, or any Unit and,
except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 7.2, shall include, but
not be limited to, all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, disbursements and
expenses (including legal fees and expenses) paid or incurred by an Indemnified
Person in connection therewith or related thereto.

(b) Indemnified Person Defined. For the purposes of this Section
7.2, "Indemnified Person" means the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee (both
in its individual capacity and as Owner Trustee), the Indenture Trustee and the
Pass Through Trustee, and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees, successors and permitted assigns, agents and servants, the Trust
Estate and the Indenture Estate (the respective directors, officers, employees,
successors and permitted assigns, agents and servants of the Owner Participant,
the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee, as
applicable, together with the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, the
Indenture Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee, as the case may be, being
referred to herein collectively as the "Related Indemnitee Group" of the Owner
Participant, the Indenture Trustee, the Owner Trustee and the Pass Through
Trustee, respectively).

(c) Claims Indemnified. Whether or not any Unit is accepted under
the Lease, or a closing occurs with respect thereto, and subject to the
exclusions stated in subsection (d) below, Lessee agrees to indemnify, protect,
defend and hold harmless each Indemnified Person on an After-Tax Basis against
Claims directly or indirectly resulting from or arising out of or alleged to
result from or arise out of (whether or not such Indemnified Person shall be
indemnified as to such Claim by any other Person):

any Unit, or by the performance of any Unit or any risks relating

anticipated profits or consequential damages;

(ii) the construction, manufacture, financing,
refinancing, design, purchase, acceptance, rejection, delivery,

for patent, trademark or copyright infringement);

(iii) any act or omission (whether negligent or otherwise)

occur of (x) the payment of all amounts due from the Lessee in
connection with any such event, (y) the release of the Lien of the
Indenture on such Unit, and (z) legal transfer of title to such Unit
to any Person other than Lessor, except in the case of a retention of
any Unit by Lessor pursuant to the terms and provisions of Section
10.3 of the Lease, and in the case of any such retention, upon the
effective date of the termination of the Lease Term with respect to
such Unit retained by Lessor pursuant to Section 10.3 or (ii) in all
other cases (except in any case where remedies are being exercised

for the purpose of this clause (ii) shall be the last day of the
Storage Period), and (z) the release of the Lien of the Indenture on
such Unit, except, in any instance referenced in the foregoing clause
(i), to the extent such Claim is fairly attributable to acts or events
occurring prior to any such date or occurrence;

(ii) Claims which are Taxes, whether or not the Lessee is
required to indemnify therefor under Section 7.1 hereof or the Tax
Indemnity Agreement;

(iii) with respect to any particular Indemnified Person,
Claims to the extent resulting from (x) the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person, or (y) any breach of
any covenant to be performed by such Indemnified Person under any of
the Operative Agreements, or the falsity of any representation or
warranty of such Indemnified Person in any of the Operative Agreements
or in a document or certificate delivered in connection therewith;

(iv) any Claim to the extent attributable to any transfer
by the Lessor of the Equipment or any portion thereof or any transfer
by the Owner Participant of all or any portion of its interest in the
Trust Estate other than (A) any transfer after a Lease Default or
Lease Event of Default, (B) the transfer of the Equipment or any Owner
Participant's interest in the Equipment to the Lessee, (C) the
transfer of the Equipment to a third party pursuant to Lessee's
election to terminate the Lease or (D) any transfer of the Equipment
pursuant to Section 6.9;

(v) with respect to any particular Indemnified Person,
any Claim resulting from the imposition of any Lessor's Lien

Indemnified Person in connection with the exercise by such Indemnified
Person of the right of inspection granted under

- 46 -
<PAGE> 51

Section 6.2, inspection or restenciling under Section 6.3 or
inspection under Section 13.2 of the Lease.

(e) Insured Claims. In the case of any Claim indemnified by the
Lessee hereunder which is covered by a policy of insurance maintained by the
Lessee pursuant to Section 12 of the Lease or otherwise, each Indemnified
Person agrees to provide reasonable cooperation to the insurers in the exercise
of their rights to investigate, defend or compromise such Claim as may be
required to retain the benefits of such insurance with respect to such Claim.

(f) Claims Procedure. An Indemnified Person shall, after
obtaining knowledge thereof, promptly notify the Lessee of any Claim as to
which indemnification is sought; provided, however, that the failure to give
such notice shall not release the Lessee from any of its obligations under this
Section 7.2, except to the extent that failure to give notice of any action,
suit or proceeding against such Indemnified Person shall have a material
adverse affect on Lessee's ability to defend such Claim or recover proceeds
under any insurance policies maintained by Lessee hereunder. The Lessee shall,
after obtaining knowledge thereof, promptly notify each Indemnified Person of
any indemnified Claim affecting such Person. Subject to the provisions of the
following paragraph, the Lessee shall at its sole cost and expense be entitled
to control, and shall assume full responsibility for, the defense of such claim
or liability; provided that the Lessee shall keep the Indemnified Person which
is the subject of such proceeding fully apprised of the status of such
proceeding and shall provide such Indemnified Person with all information with
respect to such proceeding as such Indemnified Person shall reasonably request.

Notwithstanding any of the foregoing to the contrary, the Lessee shall
not be entitled to control and assume responsibility for the defense of such
claim or liability if (1) a Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, (2) such proceeding will involve any material danger of the sale,
forfeiture or loss of, or the creation of any lien (other than any lien
permitted under the Operative Agreements or a lien which is adequately bonded
to the satisfaction of such Indemnified Person) on, any Unit, (3) the amounts
involved, in the good faith opinion of such Indemnified Person, are likely to
have a materially adverse effect on the business of such Indemnified Person
other than the ownership, leasing and financing of the Equipment, (4) in the
good faith opinion of such Indemnified Person, there exists an actual or
potential conflict of interest such that it is advisable for such Indemnified
Person to retain control of such proceeding or (5) such claim or liability
involves the possibility of criminal sanctions or liability to such Indemnified
Person. In the circumstances described in clauses (1) - (5), the Indemnified
Person shall be entitled to control and assume responsibility for the defense
of such claim or liability at the expense of the Lessee. In addition, any
Indemnified Person may participate in any proceeding controlled by the Lessee
pursuant to this Section 7.2, at its own expense, in respect of any such
proceeding as to which the Lessee shall have acknowledged in writing its
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Person pursuant to this Section 7.2,
and at the expense of Lessee in respect of any such proceeding as to which the
Lessee shall not have so acknowledged its obligation to the Indemnified Person
pursuant to this Section 7.2. Lessee may in any event participate in all such
proceedings at its own cost. Nothing contained in this Section 7.2(f) shall be
deemed to require

- 47 -
<PAGE> 52

an Indemnified Person to contest any Claim or to assume responsibility for or
control of any judicial proceeding with respect thereto.

(g) Subrogation. If a Claim indemnified by the Lessee under this
Section 7.2 is paid in full by the Lessee and/or an insurer under a policy of
insurance maintained by the Lessee, the Lessee and/or such insurer, as the case
may be, shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to the rights and
remedies of the Indemnified Person (other than under insurance policies
maintained by such Indemnified Person) on whose behalf such Claim was paid with
respect to the transaction or event giving rise to such Claim. So long as no
Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, should an
Indemnified Person receive any refund, in whole or in part, with respect to any
Claim paid by the Lessee hereunder, it shall promptly pay over the amount
refunded (but not in excess of the amount the Lessee or any of its insurers has
paid) to the Lessee.

(h) Waiver of Certain Claims. The Lessee hereby waives and
releases any Claim now or hereafter existing against any Indemnified Person
arising out of death or personal injury to personnel of the Lessee, pollution
incidents, loss or damage to property of the Lessee, or the loss of profits or
use of any property of the Lessee, which may result from or arise out of the
condition, use or operation of the Equipment during the Lease Term, including
without limitation any latent or patent defect whether or not discoverable.

(i) No Guaranty. The general indemnification provisions of this
Section 7.2 do not constitute a guaranty by the Lessee that the principal of,
interest on or any amounts payable with respect to the Equipment Notes will be
paid.

SECTION 8. LESSEE'S RIGHT OF QUIET ENJOYMENT.

Each party to this Agreement acknowledges notice of, and consents in
all respects to, the terms of the Lease, and expressly, severally and as to its
own actions only, agrees that, so long as no Lease Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, it shall not take or cause to be taken any action
contrary to Lessee's rights under the Lease, including, without limitation, the
right to possession, use and quiet enjoyment by Lessee or any permitted
sublessee of the Equipment.

SECTION 9. SUCCESSOR INDENTURE TRUSTEE.

In the event that the Indenture Trustee gives notice of its
resignation pursuant to Section 8.02 of the Trust Indenture, the Owner Trustee
shall promptly appoint a successor Indenture Trustee reasonably acceptable to
the Lessee and the Pass Through Trustee.

SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS.

Section 10.1. Consents. Each Participant covenants and agrees
(subject, in the case of the Loan Participant, to all of the terms and
provisions of the Trust Indenture) that it shall not unreasonably withhold its
consent to any consent requested of the Owner Trustee or the Indenture

- 48 -
<PAGE> 53

Trustee, as the case may be, under the terms of the Operative Agreements that
by its terms is not to be unreasonably withheld by the Owner Trustee or the
Indenture Trustee.

Section 10.2. Refinancing. So long as no Lease Default or Lease
Event of Default shall be in existence, the Lessee shall have the right not
more than twice during the Lease Term to request the Owner Participant and the
Owner Trustee to effect an optional prepayment of all, and not less than all,
of the Equipment Notes pursuant to Section 2.10(d) of the Indenture as part of
a refunding or refinancing operation. The Owner Participant agrees to
cooperate in good faith with the Lessee in effecting any such refunding or
refinancing and, as soon as practicable after receipt of such request, the
Owner Participant and the Lessee will enter into good faith negotiations in
order to document the terms of such refunding or refinancing as follows:

(a) the Lessee, the Owner Participant, the Indenture Trustee, the
Owner Trustee, and any other appropriate parties will enter into a financing or
loan agreement (which may involve an underwriting agreement in connection with
a public offering), in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
parties thereto, providing for (i) the issuance and sale by the Owner Trustee
or such other party as may be appropriate on the date specified in such
agreement (for the purposes of this Section 10.2, the "Refunding Date") of debt
securities in an aggregate principal amount (in the lawful currency of the
United States) equal to the principal amount of the Equipment Notes outstanding
on the Refunding Date, having the same maturity date as said Equipment Notes
and having a weighted average life which is not less than or greater than the
Remaining Weighted Average Life of said Equipment Notes by more than three
months, (ii) the application of the proceeds of the sale of such debt
securities to the prepayment of all such Equipment Notes on the Refunding Date,
and (iii) payment by Lessee to the Person or Persons entitled thereto of all
other amounts, in respect of accrued interest, any Make Whole Amount or other
premium, if any, payable on such Refunding Date;

(b) the Lessee and the Owner Trustee will amend the Lease in a
manner in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Owner Participant
such that (i) if the Refunding Date is not a Rent Payment Date and the accrued
and unpaid interest on the Equipment Notes is not otherwise paid pursuant to
Section 10.2(a), the Lessee shall on the Refunding Date prepay that portion of
the next succeeding installment of Basic Rent as shall equal the aggregate
interest accrued on the Equipment Notes outstanding to the Refunding Date, (ii)
Basic Rent payable in respect of the period from and after the Refunding Date
shall be recalculated to preserve the Net Economic Return which the Owner
Participant would have realized had such refunding not occurred, provided that
the net present value of Basic Rent shall be minimized to the extent consistent
therewith, and (iii) amounts payable in respect of Stipulated Loss Value, Early
Purchase Price, Basic Term Purchase Price and Termination Value from and after
the Refunding Date shall be appropriately recalculated to preserve the Net
Economic Return which the Owner Participant would have realized had such
refunding not occurred (it being agreed that any recalculations pursuant to
subclauses (ii) and (iii) of this clause (b) shall be performed in accordance
with the requirements of Section 2.6 hereof);

- 49 -
<PAGE> 54
(c) the Owner Trustee will enter into an agreement to provide for
the securing thereunder of the debt securities issued by the Owner Trustee
pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 10.2 in like manner as the Equipment
Notes and/or will enter into such amendments and supplements to the Indenture
as may be necessary to effect such refunding or refinancing, which agreements,
amendments and/or supplements shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to the Owner Participant; provided that, no such agreement or
amendment shall provide for any increase in the security for the new debt
securities; and provided further that, notwithstanding the foregoing (but
subject to the provisions of clause (a) above), the Lessee reserves the right
to set the economic terms and other terms not customarily negotiated between an
owner participant and a lender of the refunding or refinancing transaction to
be so offered to the extent that they are passed through to the Lessee in, or
define rights or obligations of the Lessee under, the Operative Agreements;
provided, further, that no such amendment or supplement will increase the
obligations or impair the rights of the Owner Participant under the Operative
Agreements without the consent of the Owner Participant;

(d) in the case of a refunding or refinancing involving a public
offering of debt securities, neither the Owner Trustee nor the Owner
Participant shall be an "issuer" for securities law purposes or an "obligor"
within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended, the offering
materials (including any registration statement) for the refunding or
refinancing transaction shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Owner
Participant and the Lessee shall provide satisfactory indemnity to the Owner
Trustee and Owner Participant with respect thereto;

(e) unless otherwise agreed by the Owner Participant, the Lessee
shall pay to the Owner Trustee as Supplemental Rent an amount equal to the
Make-Whole Amount or other premium, if any, payable in respect of Equipment
Notes outstanding on the Refunding Date, and all reasonable fees, costs,
expenses of such refunding or refinancing;

(f) the Lessee shall give the Indenture Trustee not less than 25
days prior written notice of the Refunding Date;

(g) the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture
Trustee and the Pass Through Trustee shall have received (i) such opinions of
counsel as they may reasonably request concerning compliance with the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and any other applicable law relating to
the sale of securities and (ii) such other opinions of counsel and such
certificates and other documents, each in form and substance satisfactory to
them, as they may reasonably request in connection with compliance with the
terms and conditions of this Section 10.2; and

(h) all necessary authorizations, approvals and consents shall
have been obtained;

provided, however, that the Lessee will, to the extent then known, promptly
provide to the Owner Participant, the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and
the Pass Through Trustee substantially final terms and conditions of any such
refunding or refinancing within 20 days prior to the execution and delivery of
the documents contemplated hereunder in connection therewith; and

- 50 -
<PAGE> 55

provided, further, that (v) no refunding or refinancing of the Equipment Notes
will be permitted unless within 20 days after receipt by the Owner Participant
of a request from the Lessee to effect a refunding or refinancing pursuant to
this Section 10.2 and of information regarding the terms of such refunding or
refinancing necessary to render the opinion referred to below, the Lessee has
provided the Owner Participant with (a) a tax opinion from Mayer, Brown & Platt
or other tax counsel reasonably acceptable to the Owner Participant to the
effect that the Owner Participant would have a reasonable basis within the
meaning of Section 6662(d)(2)(B)(ii) of the Code not to report any adverse
federal income tax consequences as a result of such refunding or refinancing
and (b) an agreement to indemnify the Owner Participant against any adverse
federal income tax consequence suffered as a result of such refinancing or
refunding; alternatively, in the event such reasonable basis tax opinion cannot
be provided and the Lessee wishes to effect such refunding or refinancing, the
Lessee will, at such time as the Lessee receives written notice from the Owner
Participant that the Owner Participant has filed any income tax return wherein
such adverse income tax consequences are recognized, make an indemnity payment
to the Owner Participant in the incremental amount of such adverse tax
consequence (on an After-Tax Basis) attributable to such refunding or
refinancing; (w) the Lessee shall pay to or reimburse the Participants, the
Owner Trustee and the Indenture Trustee for all costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' and accountants' fees) paid or incurred by them in
connection with such refunding or refinancing; (x) no refunding or refinancing
of the Equipment Notes will be permitted if it shall cause the Owner
Participant to account for the transaction contemplated hereby as other than a
"leveraged lease" under the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
Statement No. 13, as amended (including any amendment effected by means of the
adoption by FASB of a new statement in lieu of FASB Statement No. 13); (y) no
refunding or refinancing of the Equipment Notes may, without the consent of the
Owner Participant, constitute assets of any "employee benefit plan" (as defined
in Section 3(3) of ERISA) or any other entity subject to Section 4975 of the
Code other than a "governmental plan" or "church plan" (as defined in Section
3(32) of ERISA) organized in a jurisdiction not having prohibitions on
transactions with such governmental plan or church plan substantially similar
to those contained in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code; and (z)
in no event, in connection with or after giving effect to such refunding or
refinancing shall the Owner Participant be exposed to any unindemnified non-de
minimis risk (including tax risk) to which it is not exposed prior to such
refunding or refinancing.

Section 10.3. Amendments and Waivers. Except as otherwise
provided in the Indenture, no term, covenant, agreement or condition of this
Agreement may be terminated, amended or compliance therewith waived (either
generally or in a particular instance, retroactively or prospectively) except
by an instrument or instruments in writing executed by each party against which
enforcement of the termination, amendment or waiver is sought.

Section 10.4. Notices. Unless otherwise expressly specified or

Agreements, no party hereto may assign their interests herein without the
consent of the parties hereto.

Section 10.8. Business Day. Notwithstanding anything herein or in

is to be made pursuant to this Agreement or any other Operative Agreement is
not a Business Day, the payment otherwise payable on such date shall be payable

succeeding Business Day.

Section 10.10. Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of
this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be

ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement.

Section 10.11. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each executed counterpart constituting an original but
all together only one Agreement.

Section 10.12. Headings and Table of Contents. The headings of the
Sections of this Agreement and the Table of Contents are inserted for purposes
of convenience only and shall not be construed to affect the meaning or
construction of any of the provisions hereof.

Section 10.13. Limitations of Liability.

(a) Liabilities of Participants. Neither the Indenture Trustee,
the Owner Trustee nor any Participant shall have any obligation or duty to the
Lessee, to any other Participant or to others with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, except those obligations or duties of such Participant
expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Operative Agreements, and
neither the Indenture Trustee nor any Participant shall be liable for
performance by any other party hereto of such other party, obligations or
duties hereunder. Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing, under
no circumstances whatsoever shall the Indenture Trustee or any Participant be
liable to the Lessee for any action or inaction on the part of the Owner
Trustee in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, whether or not
such action or inaction is caused by willful misconduct or gross negligence of
the Owner Trustee unless such action or inaction is at the direction of the
Indenture Trustee or any Participant, as the case may be, and such direction is
expressly permitted hereby.

(b) No Recourse to the Owner Trustee. It is expressly understood
and agreed by and between the Owner Trustee, the Lessee, the Owner Participant,
the Indenture Trustee, and the Loan Participant, and their respective
successors and permitted assigns that, subject to the proviso contained in this
Section 10.13(b), all representations, warranties and undertakings of the Owner
Trustee hereunder shall be binding upon the Owner Trustee, only in its capacity
as Owner Trustee under the Trust Agreement, and (except as expressly provided
herein) the Owner Trustee shall not be liable in its individual capacity for
any breach thereof, except for its gross negligence or willful misconduct, or
for breach of its covenants, representations and warranties contained herein,
except to the extent covenanted or made in its individual capacity; provided,
however, that nothing in this Section 10.13(b) shall be construed to limit in
scope or substance those representations and warranties of the Owner Trustee
made expressly in its individual capacity set forth herein. The term "Owner
Trustee" as used in this Agreement shall include any successor trustee under
the Trust Agreement, or the Owner Participant if the trust created thereby is
revoked.

- 54 -
<PAGE> 59
Section 10.14. Maintenance of Non-Recourse Debt. The parties hereto
agree that if the Owner Trustee becomes a debtor subject to the reorganization
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. Section 101 et seq. (the
"Bankruptcy Code") or any successor provision, the parties hereto will make an
election under 1111(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Bankruptcy Code. If (a) the Owner
Trustee becomes a debtor subject to the reorganization provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code or any successor provision, (b) pursuant to such reorganization
provisions the Owner Trustee is required, by reason of the Owner Trustee being
held to have recourse liability to the Pass Through Trustee or the Indenture
Trustee, directly or indirectly, to make payment on account of any amount
payable under the Equipment Notes or any of the other Operative Agreements and
(c) the Pass Through Trustee and/or the Indenture Trustee actually receives any
Excess Amount (as hereinafter defined) which reflects any payment by the Owner
Trustee on account of (b) above, then the Pass Through Trustee and/or the
Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, shall promptly refund to the Owner
Trustee such Excess Amount. For purposes of this Section 10.14 "Excess Amount"
means the amount by which such payment exceeds the amount which would have been
received by the Pass Through Trustee or the Indenture Trustee if the Owner
Trustee had not become subject to the recourse liability referred to in (b)
above.

Section 10.15. Ownership of and Rights in Units. The sale of the
Units contemplated hereby is intended for all purposes to be a true sale of all
of the Lessee's right, title and interest in and to the Units to the Owner
Trustee, which shall be the legal owner thereof. Upon consummation of the sale
and leaseback transactions contemplated hereby, the Lessee's interest in the
Units is intended to be that of a lessee only. It is intended that for federal
and state income tax purposes the Owner Participant will be the owner of the
Units. The rights of the Indenture Trustee in and to the Units pursuant to the
Indenture is intended to be that of a secured party holding a security
interest, subject to the Lease and the rights of the Lessee thereunder. No
holder of an Equipment Note is intended to have any right, title or interest in
or to the Units except as a beneficiary of the security interest granted by the
Owner Trustee to the Indenture Trustee pursuant to the Indenture in trust for
the equal and ratable benefit of the holders from time to time of the Equipment
Notes.

delivery of each Unit from Lessee and to lease such Unit to Lessee hereunder,

Unit for all purposes of this Lease.

Section 3.1 Lease Term. The interim term of this Lease (the "Interim
Term") for each Unit shall commence on the Closing Date and shall terminate on
the day before the Basic Term Commencement Date. The basic term of this Lease
(the "Basic Term") shall commence on the Basic Term Commencement Date and,

Section 3.2 Basic Rent. Lessee hereby agrees to pay Lessor as Basic Rent

consecutive semi-annual installments payable on each Rent Payment Date. Each
such semi-annual payment of Basic Rent shall be in an amount equal to the
product of the Equipment Cost for such Unit multiplied by

the Basic Rent percentage for such Unit set forth opposite such Rent Payment
Date on Schedule 3 to the Participation Agreement (as such Schedule 3 shall be
adjusted pursuant to Section 2.6 of the Participation Agreement). Basic Rent

certain Rent Payment Dates, as specified in Schedule 3 to the Participation
Agreement, as so adjusted, such Schedule 3 as so adjusted from time to time
being incorporated herein by reference.

Anything contained herein or in the Participation Agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding, each installment of Basic Rent (both before and after any
adjustment pursuant to Section 2.6 of the Participation Agreement) shall be,
under any circumstances and in any event, in an amount at least sufficient for
Lessor to pay in full as of the due date of such installment, any payment of
principal of and interest on the Equipment Notes required to be paid by Lessor
pursuant to the Indenture on such due date.

Section 3.3 Supplemental Rent. Lessee also agrees to pay to Lessor, or to
whomsoever shall be entitled thereto, any and all Supplemental Rent, promptly
as the same shall become due and owing, or where no due date is specified,
promptly after demand by the Person entitled thereto, and in the event of any
failure on the part of Lessee to pay any Supplemental Rent, Lessor shall have
all rights, powers and remedies provided for herein or by law or equity or
otherwise as in the case of nonpayment of Basic Rent. Lessee will also pay, as
Supplemental Rent, (i) on demand, to the extent permitted by applicable law, an
amount equal to interest at the Late Rate on any part of any installment of
Basic Rent not paid when due for any period for which the same shall be overdue
and on any payment of Supplemental Rent not paid when due or demanded, as the
case may be, for the period from such due date or demand until the same shall
be paid, (ii) in the case of the termination of this Lease with respect to any
Unit pursuant to Section 10, on the applicable Termination Date, an amount
equal to the Make-Whole Amount, if any, with respect to the principal amount of
each Equipment Note to be prepaid as a result of such termination, (iii) in the
case of the purchase of any Unit pursuant to Section 22.1 or Section 6.9 of the
Participation Agreement, on such date of purchase, an amount equal to the
Make-Whole Amount, if any, with respect to the principal amount of each
Equipment Note to be prepaid as a result of such purchase, (iv) an amount equal
to any other amount payable by Lessor on the Equipment Notes in excess of the
principal and interest payments due thereunder, as and when such amount shall
be due and payable, in accordance with the terms of the Equipment Notes and the
Indenture, and (v) in the case of any refinancing of the Equipment Notes
pursuant to Section 10.2 of the Participation Agreement, on the Refunding Date,
an amount equal to the Make-Whole Amount, if any, with respect to the aggregate
principal amount of the Equipment Notes being prepaid. All Supplemental Rent
to be paid pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall be payable in the type of funds
and in the manner set forth in Section 3.6.

Section 3.4 Adjustment of Rent. Lessee and Lessor agree that the Basic
Rent, Stipulated Loss Value and Termination Value percentages and the Early

Section 3.5 Advances. Lessor agrees to give notice to Lessee and the
Indenture Trustee at least five Business Days prior to the Basic Term
Commencement Date if the funds for the payment of interest on the Equipment
Notes contemplated to be made by Owner Trustee pursuant to Section 2.2(c) of
the Participation Agreement will not be paid by Owner Trustee to the Indenture
Trustee in an amount equal to the amount contemplated to be paid pursuant to
Section 2.2(c) of the Participation Agreement. If and to the extent that the
Indenture Trustee on the Basic Term Commencement Date shall not have received
funds from Owner Trustee sufficient for the payment in full of the interest
then due and owing on the Equipment Notes, Lessee shall pay as Supplemental
Rent, in one installment due on the Basic Term Commencement Date, an amount, if
any, equal to such deficiency (such payment being referred to herein as an
"Advance"). In the event Lessee makes any Advance pursuant to this Section 3.5
and is not promptly reimbursed therefor by Owner Participant after demand for
such reimbursement in the manner set forth in Section 20 and provided no Lease
Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessee shall be entitled to
offset and deduct (without duplication) against that portion of each succeeding
payment of Basic Rent, Stipulated Loss Value, or Termination Value which
becomes payable to or to the order of Owner Trustee under the Indenture and
distributable to Owner Participant under the Trust Agreement, an amount equal
to such Advance plus interest on such amount at the Late Rate until Lessee has
been fully reimbursed for such Advance plus such interest and in each such
case, such offset shall be deemed to constitute a reduction in the amount of
such Advance so payable. No such offset or aggregate combined effect of
separate offsets shall reduce the amount of any indemnity or other claim
payable by Lessee to any holder of an Equipment Note, the Indenture Trustee or
Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, nor reduce any installment of Basic
Rent, or any payment of Stipulated Loss Value or Termination Value, to an
amount that is insufficient to pay in full the payments then required to be
made on account of the principal and interest on the Equipment Notes then
outstanding.

Section 3.6 Manner of Payments. All Rent (other than Supplemental Rent
payable to Persons other than Lessor, which shall be payable to such other
Persons in accordance with written instructions furnished to Lessee by such
Persons, as otherwise provided in any of the Operative Agreements or as
required by law) shall be paid by Lessee to Lessor at its office at 225
Franklin Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02110, Attention: Corporate Trust
Department. All Rent shall be paid by Lessee in funds consisting of lawful
currency of the United States of America, which shall be immediately available
to the recipient not later than 12:00 noon (New York City time) on the date of
such payment, provided, that so long as the Indenture shall not have been
discharged pursuant to the terms thereof, Lessor hereby directs, and Lessee
agrees, that all Rent (excluding Excepted Property) payable to Lessor shall be
paid directly to the Indenture Trustee at the times and in funds of the type
specified in this Section 3.6 at the office of the Indenture Trustee at One

Section 4. Ownership and Marking of Equipment.

Section 4.1 Retention of Title. Lessor shall and hereby does retain full
legal title to and beneficial ownership of the Equipment notwithstanding the
delivery to and possession and use of the Equipment by Lessee hereunder or any
sublessee under any sublease permitted hereby.

Section 4.2 Duty to Number and Mark Equipment. With respect to the Units
to be delivered on the Closing Date, Lessee has caused, and as soon as
practicable after the date on which a Lease Supplement is executed and
delivered in respect of a Replacement Unit pursuant to Section 11.4(b), Lessee
will cause, each Unit to be numbered with its reporting mark shown on the Lease
Supplement dated the date on which such Unit was delivered and covering such
Unit, and will from and after such date keep and maintain, plainly, distinctly,
permanently and conspicuously marked by a plate or stencil printed in
contrasting colors upon each side of each Unit, in letters not less than one
inch in height, a legend substantially as follows:

"OWNERSHIP SUBJECT TO A SECURITY AGREEMENT
FILED WITH THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE
COMMISSION"

with appropriate changes thereof and additions thereto as from time to time may
be required by law in order to protect Lessor's right, title and interest in
and to such Unit, its rights under this Lease and the rights of the Indenture
Trustee. Except as provided hereinabove, Lessee will not place any such Units
in operation or exercise any control or dominion over the same until the
required legend shall have been so marked on both sides thereof, and will
replace promptly any such word or words in such legend which may be removed,
defaced, obliterated or destroyed. Lessee will not change the reporting mark
of any Unit except in accordance with a statement of new reporting marks to be
substituted therefor, which statement shall be delivered by Lessee to Lessor
and, so long as the Indenture shall not have been discharged pursuant to its
terms, to the Indenture Trustee prior to or contemporaneously with such change.
A supplement to this Lease and, if not so discharged, the Indenture, with
respect to such new reporting marks, shall, prior to or contemporaneously with
the substitution of such reporting marks, be filed or recorded in all public
offices where this Lease and the Indenture shall have been filed or recorded
and in such other places, if any, where Lessor and, so long as the Indenture
shall not have been discharged pursuant to its terms, the Indenture Trustee may
reasonably request in order to protect, preserve and maintain its right, title
and interest in the Units. The costs and expenses of all such supplements,
filings and recordings shall be borne by Lessee.

Section 4.3 Prohibition Against Certain Designations. Except as above
provided, Lessee will not allow the name of any Person to be placed on any Unit
as a designation that might reasonably be interpreted as a claim of ownership;
provided, however, that subject to the delivery of the statement specified in
the penultimate sentence of Section 4.2, Lessee may cause the Equipment to be
lettered with the names or initials or other insignia customarily used by
Lessee or any permitted sublessees or any of their respective Affiliates on
railroad equipment used by it of the same or a similar type for convenience of
identification of the right of Lessee

4

<PAGE> 9
to use the Equipment hereunder or any permitted sublessee to use the Equipment
pursuant to a sublease permitted hereby.

Section 5. Disclaimer of Warranties.

Section 5.1 Disclaimer of Warranties. Without waiving any claim Lessee may
have against any seller, supplier or manufacturer, LESSEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT, (i) EACH UNIT IS OF A SIZE, DESIGN, CAPACITY AND MANUFACTURE
SELECTED BY AND ACCEPTABLE TO LESSEE, (ii) LESSEE IS SATISFIED THAT EACH UNIT
IS SUITABLE FOR ITS PURPOSES AND LESSEE HAS ACCEPTED EACH UNIT, (iii) NEITHER
LESSOR NOR OWNER PARTICIPANT IS A MANUFACTURER OR A DEALER IN PROPERTY OF SUCH
KIND OR HAS INSPECTED THE UNITS PRIOR TO DELIVERY TO AND ACCEPTANCE BY LESSEE,
(iv) EACH UNIT IS LEASED HEREUNDER SUBJECT TO ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS NOW IN EFFECT OR HEREAFTER ADOPTED, AND (v) LESSOR
LEASES AND LESSEE TAKES EACH UNIT "AS-IS", "WHERE-IS" AND "WITH ALL FAULTS", IN
WHATEVER CONDITION IT MAY BE, AND LESSEE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NEITHER LESSOR, AS
LESSOR OR IN ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, NOR OWNER PARTICIPANT MAKES NOR SHALL BE
DEEMED TO HAVE MADE, AND EACH EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS, ANY AND ALL RIGHTS, CLAIMS,
WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AS TO THE VALUE,
CONDITION, FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE, DESIGN, OPERATION,
MERCHANTABILITY THEREOF OR AS TO THE TITLE, OF THE EQUIPMENT, THE QUALITY OF
THE MATERIAL OR WORKMANSHIP THEREOF OR CONFORMITY THEREOF TO SPECIFICATIONS,
FREEDOM FROM PATENT, COPYRIGHT OR TRADEMARK INFRINGEMENT, THE ABSENCE OF ANY
LATENT OR OTHER DEFECT, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE, OR AS TO THE ABSENCE OF
ANY OBLIGATIONS BASED ON STRICT LIABILITY IN TORT OR ANY OTHER EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT THERETO AND EACH OF
LESSOR AND OWNER PARTICIPANT EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS SELECTION OF THE UNITS, except
that Lessor, in its individual capacity, represents and warrants that on the
Closing Date, Lessor shall have received whatever title to the Equipment as was
conveyed to Lessor by Lessee and each Unit will be free of Lessor's Liens
attributable to Lessor and provided that the foregoing disclaimer in clause (v)
shall not extend to Owner Participant's representation and warranty contained
in Section 3.6(e) of the Participation Agreement. Lessor hereby appoints and
constitutes Lessee its agent and attorney-in-fact during the Lease Term to
assert and enforce, from time to time, in the name and for the account of
Lessor and Lessee, as their interests may appear, but in all cases at the sole
cost and expense of Lessee, whatever claims and rights Lessor may have as owner
of the Equipment against the manufacturers or any prior owner thereof;
provided, however, that if at any time a Lease Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, at Lessor's option, such power of attorney shall
terminate, and Lessor may assert and enforce, at Lessee's sole cost and
expense, such claims and rights. Lessor shall have no responsibility or
liability to Lessee or any other Person with respect to any of the following:
(i) any liability, loss or damage caused or alleged to be caused directly or
indirectly by any Unit, or by any of the commodities, items or

5

<PAGE> 10
materials from time to time contained therein, whether or not permitted by the
terms hereof, or by any inadequacy thereof or deficiency or defect therein or
by any other circumstances in connection therewith; (ii) the use, operation or
performance of any Unit or any risks relating thereto; (iii) any interruption
of service, loss of business or anticipated profits or consequential damages;
or (iv) the delivery, operation, servicing, maintenance, repair, improvement or
replacement of any Unit. Lessee's delivery of a Lease Supplement shall be
conclusive evidence as between Lessee and Lessor that all Units described
therein are in all the foregoing respects satisfactory to Lessee, and Lessee
will not assert any claim of any nature whatsoever against Lessor based on any
of the foregoing matters.

Section 6. Return of Equipment; Storage.

Section 6.1 Return; Holdover Rent. (a) Not less than 120 days prior to
the end of the Basic Term, the end of any Fixed Rate Renewal Term, or the end
of any Fair Market Renewal Term, in each case with respect to any Units which
Lessee has elected to return under Section 22.2, Lessee will provide Lessor
with seven alternative storage locations used for the storage of rolling stock
within the continental United States (excluding Alaska), which locations, to
the extent practicable, shall be geographically diverse. Not less than 90 days
prior to the end of the Lease Term with respect to any Unit which has not been
purchased by Lessee, Lessor will give Lessee irrevocable notice of its decision
either to take possession of or store such Unit. If Lessor shall have decided
to take possession of such Unit, the terms of Section 6.1(b) will apply. If
Lessor shall have decided to store such Unit, the terms of Section 6.1(c)
hereof will apply.

(b) If Lessor shall have decided to take possession of such Unit, Lessee
will, at its own cost and expense, deliver possession of such Unit at any track
location, f.o.b. such location, (i) as may be agreed upon by Lessor and Lessee
in writing or (ii) in the absence of such agreement as Lessor may reasonably
select by written notice to Lessee on or before the 90th day before the end of
the Lease Term; provided, that (x) there shall be no more than five such
locations designated by Lessor (each of which shall be located within the
continental United States, exclusive of Alaska), (y) there shall be no less
than 100 Units returned to each location, and (z) Lessor's notice shall specify
the total number and type of Units to be delivered to each location.

(c) (i) If Lessor shall have elected to store any Unit upon the expiration
of the Lease Term with respect thereto, Lessee shall store such Unit, free of
charge for a period (the "Storage Period") beginning on the expiration of the
Lease Term and ending not more than 60 days after the later of (A) the date
of such expiration, and (B) the date on which such Unit is in compliance with
the conditions set forth in Section 6.2. On or before the 90th day before
the end of the Lease Term, Lessor shall provide Lessee with written notice
designating its choices from among the alternative storage locations provided
by Lessee pursuant to Section 6.1(a). Any storage provided by Lessee during
the Storage Period shall be at the sole risk and expense of Lessee, and
Lessee shall maintain the insurance required by Section 12.1 with respect to
all stored Units. During the Storage Period, Lessee will permit Lessor or
any person designated by it, including

6

<PAGE> 11
the authorized representative or representatives of any prospective purchaser
or user of such Unit, to restencil the marks on such Unit and to inspect the
same during Lessee's normal business hours upon at least three Business Days'
prior telephonic notice; provided, however, that such inspection and
restenciling shall not interfere with the normal conduct of Lessee's business;
and provided, further, that (x) such inspection and restenciling shall be at
such Person's own risk, (y) Lessee shall be protected against any loss or
damage incurred by it in connection with any such inspection or restenciling by
such Person through indemnification, insurance or other means reasonably
satisfactory to Lessee and (z) Lessee (except in the case of Lessee's gross
negligence or wilful misconduct) shall not be liable for any injury to, or the
death of, any person exercising, either on behalf of Lessor or any prospective
purchaser or user, the rights of inspection and restenciling granted pursuant
hereto. Lessee shall not be required to store the Equipment after the Storage
Period. If Lessee does store any Unit after the expiration of the Storage
Period, such storage shall be at the sole risk and expense of Lessor.

(ii) Upon the request and direction of Lessor (and at Lessor's sole risk
and expense), on not more than one occasion with respect to each stored Unit
and upon not less than 30 days' prior written notice from Lessor to Lessee,
Lessee will, on or before the expiration of the Storage Period, transport
such Units to any railroad interchange point or points (not to exceed five in
total), within the continental United States (except Alaska) with a minimum
of 100 Units per interchange point on any railroad lines or to any connecting
carrier for shipment, whereupon Lessee shall have no further liability or
obligation with respect to such Units.

(iii) Upon receipt of Lessor's written notice designating its choices from
among the alternative storage locations provided by Lessee under Section
6.1(a), Lessee shall have the option to store such Units at such storage
track locations anywhere within the continental United States as it shall
choose (provided that to the extent such location can reasonably accommodate
such storage, there shall be no less than 100 Units stored at each such
location). If Lessee shall exercise such option, it shall on or before the
expiration of the Storage Period transport the Equipment to up to five
locations within the continental United States (except Alaska) with a minimum
of 100 Units at each location, designated by Lessor upon not less than 30
days' prior written notice. The movement of any Unit from such Unit's
location as designated by Lessee pursuant to this Section 6.1(c)(iii) to a
point within 500 miles thereof will be at the risk and expense of Lessee;
thereafter, any movement of such Unit will be at Lessor's risk and expense
for any movement exceeding 500 miles. During any Storage Period pursuant to
Section 6.1(c)(i) or where Lessee shall have exercised its option under this
Section 6.1(c)(iii), Lessee shall store the Equipment in such manner as
Lessee normally stores similar units of railroad equipment owned or leased by
it.

(d) Upon the later of (i) expiration of the Lease Term with respect to
such Unit, (ii) tender of such Unit at the location determined in accordance
with Section 6.1(b) or, as applicable, the tender of such Unit for storage in
accordance with Section 6.1(c), and (iii) compliance with Section 6.2, this
Lease and the obligation to pay Basic Rent for such Unit

7

<PAGE> 12
accruing subsequent to the expiration of the Lease Term with respect to such
Unit shall terminate.

(e) Provided no Lease Default referred to in Section 14(g) or (h) or Lease
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all amounts earned in respect
of a Unit after the date of expiration of the Lease Term with respect to such
Unit and prior to the return of such Unit hereunder shall belong to Lessee, and
if received by Lessor, shall be promptly turned over to Lessee. In the event
any Unit is not returned to Lessor in accordance with the provisions of Section
6.1(b) on the last day of the Lease Term with respect thereto, or if requested
by Lessor pursuant to Section 6.1(c), delivered and stored on such last day of
the Lease Term, and, in either case, in the condition specified in Section 6.2,
Lessee shall pay to Lessor for each such day from and after the expiration of
the Lease Term with respect to such Unit an amount equal to the daily
equivalent of the average Basic Rent for the Basic Term or the Renewal Term as
applicable to such Unit; provided that, during such holdover period, Lessee
shall use its best efforts to secure the return of the Equipment as required
under this Section 6 in the condition specified in Section 6.2. Nothing herein
shall be in abrogation of Lessor's right to have such Unit returned to it for
possession or storage.

Section 6.2 Condition of Equipment. Each Unit when returned to Lessor
pursuant to Section 6.1 shall be (i) capable of performing the functions for
which it was designed, with all loading and unloading components operating in
good working order with allowance for normal wear and tear, (ii) suitable for
use in interchange in accordance with the Field Manual of the AAR and FRA rules
and regulations, (iii) suitable for continued commercial use in the commodity
last carried immediately prior to such return, (iv) in all material respects in
the condition required by Section 8.1, (v) in conformance with any requirement
pertaining to warranties of the manufacturer of the Units during the warranty
period, (vi) fit for loading and acceptable for interchange service generally
in the transportation industry after giving effect to a transfer or change in
ownership (in accordance with applicable interchange rules), (vii) empty,
(viii) steam cleaned or otherwise cleaned in a comparable commercially
acceptable manner, and (ix) free and clear of all Liens except Lessor's Liens
and Permitted Liens of the type described in clause (iii) of the definition of
Permitted Liens to the extent arising as a result of a fleet wide action which
includes such Unit. All logs, records, books and other materials relating to
the maintenance of such Unit shall, upon request, be delivered to Lessor or its
designee upon the return of such Unit. Lessor shall have the right to inspect
any Unit that is returned pursuant to Section 6.1 to ensure that such Unit is
in compliance with the conditions set forth in this Section 6.2, at Lessor's
sole cost, expense and risk (including, without limitation, the risk of
personal injury or death), by its authorized representatives, during Lessee's
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to Lessee; provided,
however, that Lessee shall not be liable for any injury to, or the death of,
any Person exercising, on behalf of Lessor, the rights of inspection granted
under this Section 6.2 unless caused by Lessee's gross negligence or wilful
misconduct; and further provided, that if such Unit is not in compliance with
the conditions set forth in this Section 6.2 then Lessee will in addition to
amounts otherwise owing under Section 6.1(e), if any, (i) promptly take such
steps as are necessary to bring such Unit in compliance with the conditions set
forth in this Section 6.2 and (ii) pay the reasonable cost and expense of any
reinspection of such Unit conducted by Lessor required because of such
non-compliance

8

<PAGE> 13
with Section 6.2. No inspection pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall interfere
with the normal conduct of Lessee's business or the normal conduct of any
sublessee's business, and Lessee shall not be required to undertake or incur
any additional liabilities in connection therewith. A Unit shall not be deemed
to have been returned to Lessor for purposes of this Lease unless and until it
is in compliance with the conditions set forth in this Section 6.2.

Section 7. Liens.

Lessee will not directly or indirectly create, incur, assume, permit or
suffer to exist any Lien on or with respect to any Units or Lessee's leasehold
interest therein under this Lease, except Permitted Liens, Lessor's Liens and
Liens described in Section 6.4(a) and 6.4(b) of the Participation Agreement,
and Lessee shall promptly, at its own expense, take such action or cause such
action to be taken as may be necessary to duly discharge (by bonding or
otherwise) any such Lien not excepted above if the same shall arise at any
time.

Section 8. Maintenance; Possession; Compliance with Laws.

Section 8.1 Maintenance and Operation. (a) Lessee, at its own cost and
expense, shall maintain, repair and keep each Unit, (i) according to prudent
industry practice, in good working order, and in good physical condition for
railcars of a similar age and usage, normal wear and tear excepted, (ii) in a
manner consistent with maintenance practices used by Lessee in respect of
equipment owned or leased by Lessee similar in type to such Unit, (iii) in
accordance in all material respects with all manufacturer's warranties and in
accordance with all applicable provisions, if any, of insurance policies
required to be maintained pursuant to Section 12, and (iv) in compliance in all
material respects with any applicable laws and regulations, including, without
limitation, the Field Manual of the AAR, FRA rules and regulations and
Interchange Rules as they apply to the maintenance and operation of the
Equipment in interchange regardless of upon whom such applicable laws and
regulations are nominally imposed; provided, however, that Lessee may, in good
faith and by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted, contest the
validity or application of any such standard, rule or regulation in any
reasonable manner which does not materially interfere with the use, possession,
operation or return of any of the Units or materially adversely affect the
rights or interests of Lessor and the Indenture Trustee in the Equipment or
hereunder or otherwise expose Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or any Participant
to criminal sanctions or release Lessee from the obligation to return the
Equipment in compliance with the provisions of Section 6.2. Lessee shall
provide Lessor and the Indenture Trustee with notice of any contest of the type
described in the preceding sentence in detail sufficient to enable Lessor and
the Indenture Trustee to ascertain whether such contest may have an effect of
the type described in the preceding sentence. In no event shall Lessee
discriminate as to the use or maintenance of any Unit (including the
periodicity of maintenance or recordkeeping in respect of such Unit) as
compared to equipment of a similar nature which Lessee owns or leases. Lessee
will maintain all records, logs and other materials required by relevant
industry standards or any governmental authority having jurisdiction over the
Units required to be maintained in respect of any Unit, all as if Lessee were
the owner of such Units, regardless of whether any such requirements, by their
terms, are nominally imposed on Lessee, Lessor or Owner Participant.

9

<PAGE> 14
(b) Lessee shall not or expressly permit any sublessee to change a DOT
classification (as provided for in 49 C.F.R. Part 179 or any successor
thereto), or expressly permit any sublessee to operate any Unit under a
different DOT classification, from that classification in effect for such Unit
on the Closing Date, except for any change in tank test pressure rating
provided such change does not increase the pressure rating of the Unit above
the tank test pressure to which the Unit was manufactured; provided however,
that in the event Lessor shall not have provided Lessee with a written waiver
or consent to such a reclassification or operation of any Unit within 10
Business Days of Lessee's written request therefor (or Lessor expressly rejects
such a request by Lessee), Lessee may replace such Unit in accordance with and
subject to the provisions of Section 11.2(i), 11.3 and 11.4.

Section 8.2 Possession. Lessee shall be entitled to the possession of the
Equipment and to the use of the Equipment by it or any Affiliate, in the United
States, Canada and Mexico, only in the manner for which it was designed and
intended and so as to subject it only to ordinary wear and tear. In no event
shall Lessee make use of any Equipment in any jurisdiction not included in the
insurance coverage required by Section 12. The Equipment shall be used
primarily on domestic routes in the United States, and in no event shall more
than 20% of the Units be used (as determined by mileage records) outside the
continental United States (exclusive of Alaska) during any taxable year in
which the transaction generates tax losses. Nothing in this Section 8.2 shall
be deemed to constitute permission by Lessor to any Person that acquires
possession of any Unit to take any action inconsistent with the terms and
provisions of this Lease and any of the other Operative Agreements. The rights
of any person that acquires possession of any Unit pursuant to this Section 8.2
shall be subject and subordinate to the rights of Lessor hereunder.

Section 8.3 Sublease. Provided Lessor shall not have declared the Lease to
be in default (or the Lease shall be deemed to have been declared in default)
pursuant to Section 15.1 hereof, Lessee shall be entitled, without the prior
approval of Lessor, to enter into a sublease for any Unit or Units (pursuant to
a car service contract or otherwise) to, or to grant permission for the use
thereof under car contracts by, (i) a railroad company or companies
incorporated under the laws of the United States of America or any state
thereof or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province thereof, or Mexico
or any state thereof, upon lines of railroad owned or operated by such railroad
company or companies or over which such railroad company or companies have
trackage rights or rights for operation of their trains, and upon connecting
and other carriers in the usual interchange of traffic or (ii) responsible
companies other than railroad companies for use in their business (leases to
such sublessees being herein referred to as "Permitted Subleases"); provided,
however, that if Lessee subleases any Unit to a sublessee which operates
primarily in Canada (or any territory thereof) or Mexico (or any state
thereof), Lessee shall first have made all filings and deposits which are
necessary or advisable under then-current prudent industry practice (including
any actions reasonably requested by Lessor or the Indenture Trustee) to protect
the right, title and interest of Lessor under this Lease and the Indenture
Trustee under the Indenture in and to the Units to be so subleased, and, in the
case of a sublease to a sublessee which operates primarily in Canada, Lessee
shall furnish to Lessor and the Indenture Trustee, upon written request, an
opinion of Canadian counsel, reasonably satisfactory to Lessor and the
Indenture Trustee, to the effect that such action is all

10

<PAGE> 15
that is necessary to protect such right, title and interest of Lessor and the
Indenture Trustee in and to such Units and that the security interest of the
Indenture Trustee in the Units and the interest of Lessor and Owner Participant
in the Units and in this Lease will be respected under the laws of Canada. All
subleases shall include appropriate provisions so that such subleases, (i)
shall in all events be subject and subordinate to this Lease and the rights and
interests of Lessor and its respective successors and assigns hereunder and
shall confirm such subordination by a provision substantially in the form
currently contained in Lessee's standard car service contract delivered to
Lessor and the Indenture Trustee prior to the Closing Date, or otherwise as
satisfactory to Lessor and the Indenture Trustee, (ii) shall not be for a term
which extends beyond the Basic Term and any agreed upon Renewal Term, and (iii)
shall not include any term or provision which could reasonably be expected to
result in material adverse consequences to Lessor, Owner Participant or the
Indenture Trustee. In the event Lessee desires to sublease one or more Units
for a term which extends beyond the Basic Term or Renewal Term, Lessee will
have the option to replace such Unit on or prior to the expiration of the Basic
Term or any Renewal Term with another Unit in accordance with and subject to
the provisions of Section 11.2(i), 11.3 and 11.4. Except in connection with an
assignment pursuant to a transaction permitted by Section 6.8 of the
Participation Agreement, no sublease entered into by Lessee hereunder shall
relieve Lessee of any liability or obligation hereunder, which shall be and
remain those of a principal and not a surety. Nothing in this Section 8.3
shall be deemed to constitute permission to any Person in possession of any
Unit pursuant to any such sublease to take any action inconsistent with the
terms and provisions of this Lease or any of the other Operative Agreements.

Section 9. Modifications.

Section 9.1 Required Modifications. In the event the AAR, the United
States Department of Transportation, or any other United States, state or local
governmental agency or any other applicable law requires that any Unit be
altered, replaced or modified (a "Required Modification"), Lessee agrees to
make such Required Modification at its own expense; provided, however, that
Lessee may, in good faith and by appropriate proceedings diligently conducted,
contest the validity or application of any such law, regulation, requirement or
rule in any reasonable manner which does not materially interfere with the use,
possession, operation or return of any Unit or materially adversely affect the
rights or interests of Lessor and the Indenture Trustee in the Equipment or
hereunder or otherwise expose Lessor, the Indenture Trustee or any Participant
to criminal sanctions or relieve Lessee of the obligation to return the
Equipment in compliance with the provisions of Section 6.2. Title to any
Required Modification shall immediately vest in Lessor. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, if Lessee determines in good faith that any
Required Modification to a Unit would be economically impractical, in lieu of
making the Required Modification as provided above, Lessee may provide written
notice of such determination to Lessor and either (i) treat such Unit as if an
Event of Loss had occurred as of the date of such written notice with respect
to such Unit, provided that upon such occurrence Lessee shall only have the
right to replace such Unit under the provisions of Section 11.2(i), 11.3 and
11.4, or (ii) if such determination is made on or after the seventh anniversary
of the Basic Term Commencement Date, treat such Unit as provided in clause (i)
above or treat such Unit as a Terminated Unit on the terms and conditions set
forth in Section

11

<PAGE> 16
10.1; provided that Lessee shall not discriminate against such Unit in making
such determination of economic impracticality as compared with other equipment
of the same type as such Unit which is owned or leased by Lessee.

Section 9.2 Optional Modifications. Lessee at any time may in its
discretion and at its own cost and expense modify, alter or improve any Unit in
a manner which is not required by Section 9.1 (a "Modification"); provided that
no Modification shall diminish the fair market value, utility, or remaining
economic useful life of such Unit below the value, utility, or remaining
economic useful life thereof immediately prior to such Modification, other than
in a de minimis manner, assuming such Unit was then in the condition required
to be maintained by the terms of this Lease or cause such Unit to become
Limited Use Property. Title to any Non-Severable Modification shall be
immediately vested in Lessor. Title to any Severable Modification shall remain
with Lessee unless it is a Required Modification, in which case title shall
vest in Lessor pursuant to Section 9.1. If Lessee shall at its cost cause such
Severable Modifications (which are not Required Modifications) to be made to
any Unit, Lessor shall have the right, upon 90 days prior written notice in the
case of a return other than pursuant to Section 15.6, prior to the return of
such Unit to Lessor hereunder, to purchase such Severable Modifications (other
than Severable Modifications consisting of proprietary or communications
equipment) at their then Fair Market Sales Value (taking into account their
actual condition). If Lessor does not so elect to purchase such Severable
Modifications, Lessee may remove such Severable Modifications at Lessee's cost
and expense, and if requested (which request shall be made by not less than 90
days prior written notice in the case of a return other than pursuant to
Section 15.6) by Lessor will so remove such Severable Modifications at Lessee's
cost and expense.

Section 9.3 Removal of Property; Replacements. Lessee may, in the ordinary
course of maintenance or repair of any Unit, remove any item of property
constituting a part of such Unit, and unless the removal of such item is
required by Section 9.1 hereof, Lessee shall replace such item as promptly as
practicable by an item of property that is free and clear of all Liens (other
than Permitted Liens) and in as good operating condition as, and with a value,
utility and useful life at least equal to, the item of property being replaced,
assuming that such replaced item was in the condition required to be maintained
by the terms of this Lease. Any item of property removed from such Unit as
provided in the preceding sentence shall remain the property of Lessor free and
clear of all rights of Lessee until replaced in accordance with the terms of
such sentence, but shall then, without further act, become the property of
Lessee. Any such replacement property shall, without further act, become the
property of Lessor and be deemed part of such Unit for all purposes hereof.

Section 10. Voluntary Termination.

Section 10.1 Right of Termination. So long as no Lease Default or Lease
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessee shall have the
right, at its option at any time or from time to time during the Basic Term on
or after the seventh anniversary of the Basic Term Commencement Date to
terminate the Lease Term with respect to any or all of the Units (provided
that, if such termination is for less than all Units in a Functional Group, the

12

<PAGE> 17
determination as to which Units are subject to termination shall be made by
Lessee on a random or other reasonable basis without discrimination based on
maintenance status or operating condition of the Units in question) (the
"Terminated Units") if Lessee determines in good faith (as evidenced by a
certified copy of a resolution adopted by Lessee's Board of Directors and a
certificate executed by the Chief Financial Officer of Lessee) either (i) that
such Units have become obsolete or surplus to Lessee's requirements, or (ii) in
the circumstances described in clause (ii) of the last sentence of Section 9.1,
that a Required Modification to such Units would be economically impractical,
and in either such event by delivering at least 120 days' prior notice to
Lessor and the Indenture Trustee (i) specifying a proposed date of termination
for such Units (the "Termination Date"), which date shall, except as provided
in the last sentence of Section 10.3, be a Rent Payment Date, any such
termination to be effective on the Termination Date, and (ii) if some but less
than all of the Units in a Functional Group are designated as Terminated Units,
describing the nondiscriminatory manner in which Lessee proposes to determine
which Units in that Functional Group are to be Terminated Units. Except as
expressly provided herein, there will be no conditions to Lessee's right to
terminate this Lease with respect to the Terminated Units pursuant to this
Section 10.1. So long as (a) Lessor shall not have given Lessee a notice of
election to retain the Terminated Units in accordance with Section 10.3, or (b)
notice of prepayment of the Equipment Notes shall not have been given pursuant
to Section 2.10 of the Indenture, Lessee may withdraw the termination notice
referred to above at any time prior to the Termination Date, whereupon this
Lease shall continue in full force and effect; provided that Lessee (i) may not
exercise its right to withdraw such a termination notice more than once
annually, and (ii) may not withdraw any termination notice with respect to any
Terminated Units after receipt by Lessee of a bid equal to or greater than
Termination Value with respect to such Terminated Units or later than sixty
(60) days prior to the scheduled Termination Date. Lessee agrees that if it
withdraws a termination notice it will reimburse Lessor, Owner Participant and
the Indenture Trustee for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by any thereof in
connection therewith.

Section 10.2 Sale of Equipment. During the period from the date of such
notice given pursuant to Section 10.1 to the Termination Date, Lessee, as agent
for Lessor and, except as provided in Section 10.3, at Lessee's sole cost and
expense, shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain bids from Persons other
than Lessee or Affiliates thereof for the cash purchase of the Terminated
Units, and Lessee shall promptly, and in any event at least five Business Days
prior to the proposed date of sale, certify to Lessor in writing the amount and
terms of each such bid, the proposed date of such sale and the name and address
of the party submitting such bid. Unless Lessor shall have elected to retain
the Terminated Units in accordance with Section 10.3, on the Termination Date:
(i) Lessee shall, subject to the prior or concurrent receipt (x) by Lessor of
all amounts owing to Lessor pursuant to the next sentence, and (y) by the
Persons entitled thereto of all unpaid Supplemental Rent due on or before the
Termination Date, deliver the Terminated Units (excluding any optional
Severable Modifications removed by Lessee pursuant to Section 9.2) to the
bidder (which shall not be Lessee or any Affiliate thereof), if any, which
shall have submitted the highest cash bid prior to such date (or to such other
bidder as Lessee and Lessor shall agree), in the same manner and condition as
if delivery were made to Lessor pursuant to Section 6 and (ii) Lessor shall,
without recourse or warranty (except as to

13

<PAGE> 18
the absence of any Lessor's Lien) simultaneously therewith transfer all of its
right, title and interest in and to the Terminated Units to such bidder. The
net proceeds of sale realized at such sale shall be paid to and retained by
Lessor and, in addition, on the Termination Date, Lessee shall pay to Lessor,
(A) all unpaid Rent with respect to such Terminated Units due and payable on or
prior to the Termination Date (exclusive of any in advance Basic Rent due on
such date), (B) the excess, if any, of (1) the Termination Value for the
Terminated Units computed as of the Termination Date, over (2) the net cash
sales proceeds (after the deduction of all reasonable costs and expenses of
Lessor and Owner Participant in connection with such sale) of the Terminated
Units, and (C) an amount equal to the Make-Whole Amount, if any, in respect of
the principal amount of the Equipment Notes to be prepaid in accordance with
Section 2.10(a) of the Indenture. If no sale shall have occurred, whether as a
result of Lessee's failure to pay all of the amounts hereinabove required or
otherwise, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect with respect to
such Units and Lessee agrees to reimburse Lessor, Owner Participant and the
Indenture Trustee for all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
legal fees and expenses) incurred by any thereof in connection therewith;
provided that if such sale shall not have occurred solely because of Lessee's
failure to pay the amounts hereinabove required, Lessee shall have no further
right to terminate this Lease with respect to such Units. Lessee, in acting as
agent for Lessor, shall have no liability to Lessor for failure to obtain the
best price, shall act in its sole discretion and shall be under no duty to
solicit bids publicly or in any particular market. Lessee's sole interest in
acting as agent shall be to use its reasonable best efforts to sell the Units
at the highest price then obtainable consistent with the terms of this Lease.

Section 10.3 Retention of Equipment by Lessor. Notwithstanding the
provisions of Sections 10.1 and 10.2, Lessor may irrevocably elect by written
notice to Lessee, no later than 60 days after receipt of Lessee's notice of
termination, not to sell the Terminated Units on the Termination Date,
whereupon Lessee shall (i) deliver the Terminated Units to Lessor in the same
manner and condition as if delivery were made to Lessor pursuant to Section 6,
treating the Termination Date as the termination date of the Lease Term with
respect to the Terminated Units, and (ii) pay to Lessor, or to the Persons
entitled thereto, all Basic Rent and all Supplemental Rent due and owing on the
Termination Date and unpaid (exclusive of any in advance Basic Rent due on such
date but inclusive of any Supplemental Rent measured by the Make-Whole Amount).
If Lessor elects not to sell the Terminated Units as provided in this Section
10.3, then Lessor shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Indenture Trustee in
funds of the type and in an amount equal to the outstanding principal amount of
the Equipment Notes issued in respect of such Terminated Units and all accrued
and unpaid interest to the date of prepayment of such Equipment Notes on such
Termination Date and an amount equal to the Make-Whole Amount, if any, in
respect of the principal amount of the Equipment Notes to be prepaid without in
any manner relieving the Lessee of its obligation to pay any such amount
pursuant to the preceding sentence; provided that unless Lessor shall have paid
all such amounts to the Indenture Trustee on the Termination Date, this Lease
shall continue in full force and effect. If Lessor shall fail to pay the
amounts required pursuant to this Section 10.3 and as a result thereof this
Lease shall not be terminated with respect to the Terminated Units on a
proposed Termination Date, Lessor shall (x) thereafter no longer be entitled to
exercise its election to retain such Terminated Units, and (y) reimburse Lessee
for any expenses (including

14

<PAGE> 19
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by it in attempting to sell the
Terminated Units pursuant to Section 10.2 immediately prior to Lessor's
exercise of such preemptive election, and Lessee may at its option at any time
thereafter prior to the immediately following Rent Payment Date submit a new
termination notice pursuant to Section 10.1 with respect to such Terminated
Units specifying a proposed Termination Date occurring on a Determination Date
occurring not earlier than 25 days from the date of such notice; provided that
for purposes of determining the amount to be paid by Lessee pursuant to Section
10.2, the Termination Date shall be deemed to be the Termination Date on which
Lessor failed to make the payments provided in this Section 10.3.

Section 10.4 Termination of Lease. In the event of either (x) any such
sale and receipt by Lessor and the Indenture Trustee of all of the amounts
provided in Section 10.2 or (y) retention of the Equipment and payment in full
by Lessor in compliance with Section 10.3, and upon compliance by Lessee with
the other provisions of this Section 10, the obligation of Lessee to pay Basic
Rent hereunder for such Terminated Units shall cease and the Lease Term for the
Terminated Units shall end.

Section 11. Loss, Destruction, Requisition, Etc.

Section 11.1 Event of Loss. In the event that any Unit (i) shall suffer
damage or contamination which, in Lessee's reasonable judgment (as evidenced by
an Officers' Certificate to such effect), makes repair uneconomic or renders
such Unit unfit for commercial use, (ii) shall suffer destruction, or shall
suffer theft or disappearance for a period exceeding 12 months, (iii) shall be
permanently returned to the manufacturer pursuant to any patent indemnity
provisions, (iv) shall have title thereto taken or appropriated by any
governmental authority, agency or instrumentality under the power of eminent
domain or otherwise (v) shall suffer an actual or constructive total loss, (vi)
shall, in the normal course of interstate rail transportation, have been
prohibited from being used for a continuous period in excess of six months as a
result of any rule, regulation, order or other action by the United States
government or any agency or instrumentality thereof, (vii) shall be subject to
a sublease with any Person which operates primarily outside the United States
and shall not be returned to Lessee within 60 days of a demand by Lessee for
return of such Units following the termination or other expiration of the term
of such sublease, or (viii) shall be taken or requisitioned for use by any
governmental authority or any agency or instrumentality thereof under the power
of eminent domain or otherwise, and such taking or requisition is for a period
that exceeds the remaining Basic Term or any Renewal Term then in effect
(unless such taking or requisition is by Mexico or any governmental authority,
agency or instrumentality thereof, in which case such period shall be the
lesser of the period as aforesaid or 365 days) (any such occurrence being
hereinafter called an "Event of Loss"), Lessee, in accordance with the terms of
Section 11.2, shall promptly and fully inform Lessor and the Indenture Trustee
of such Event of Loss; provided, however, that if any Unit shall suffer a theft
or disappearance as described in clause (ii) above for a period exceeding 6
months, Lessee shall use its reasonable best efforts to inform Lessor and the
Indenture Trustee of such theft or disappearance as an Event of Loss once it
has knowledge thereof, regardless of whether the 12-month period referred to in
said clause (ii) has run.

15

<PAGE> 20
Section 11.2 Replacement or Payment upon Event of Loss. Upon the
occurrence of an Event of Loss or an election to replace pursuant to Section
8.1(b), Section 8.3 or Section 9.1 with respect to any Unit, Lessee shall as
soon as reasonably practical and in any event within 30 days after a
Responsible Officer of Lessee shall have actual knowledge of such occurrence or
election give Lessor and the Indenture Trustee notice of such occurrence of
such Event of Loss or election to replace (which notice shall identify the Unit
involved) and then within the 90 day period following such notice give Lessor
and the Indenture Trustee notice as to which of the following options Lessee
shall elect to perform:

(i) Upon Lessee's election to perform under this clause (i), as promptly
as practicable following such election, and in any event on or before the
90th day following the date of notice of such Event of Loss, or the date
Lessee exercises an option to replace pursuant to Section 8.1(b), Section 8.3
or Section 9.1, as the case may be, Lessee shall comply with Section 11.4(b)
and shall convey or cause to be conveyed to Lessor a Replacement Unit to be
leased to Lessee hereunder, such Replacement Unit to be of the same car type
and DOT classification (or otherwise approved by Lessor, which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld), the same or a later year of manufacture of the
Unit replaced and free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens of
the type described in clause (ii) with respect to sublessees, and in clauses
(iii), (iv), (vi) and (vii) of the definition thereof) and to have a Fair
Market Sales Value, utility, remaining economic useful life, residual value
and condition at least equal to the Unit so replaced (assuming such Unit was
in the condition required to be maintained by the terms of this Lease);
provided that, if, at the time of such replacement, only railcars (x) of a
later year of manufacture or (y) with a greater Fair Market Sales Value than
the replaced Units are available as Replacement Units, Lessee shall convey
such Replacement Unit to Lessor as set forth above but Lessee may, at a later
date, replace such Replacement Units with other Units that are closer in Fair
Market Sales Value to the original replaced Units; provided further that, if
Lessee shall fail to elect either such option within such 90-day period, or
shall elect the option under this clause (i) within such period but shall
fail to perform its obligation to effect such replacement under this
paragraph (i) within such 90-day period then (except in the case of a failure
to perform an election to replace pursuant to Section 8.1(b), Section 8.3 or
Section 9.1) at the end of such 90-day period Lessee shall immediately give
Lessor and the Indenture Trustee notice of such failure and specify that
Lessee shall pay to Lessor on the next succeeding Rent Payment Date that is
at least 25 days after the end of such 90-day period, or in the case of
Supplemental Rent, to the person entitled thereto, the amounts specified in
paragraph (ii) below as of such next succeeding Rent Payment Date, and Lessee
shall pay such amounts on such Rent Payment Date; and provided further that
Lessee shall have no right to elect replacement under this paragraph (i) if
at the time of the notice under Section 11.2 above a Lease Event of Default
or a Lease Default described in Section 14(a), Section 14(g) or Section 14(h)
shall have occurred and be continuing; or

(ii) on the Rent Payment Date which is not less than 25 days following the
date of notice of Lessee's election to perform under this clause (ii), Lessee
shall pay or cause to be paid to Lessor (or in the case of Supplemental Rent,
to the Persons entitled

16

<PAGE> 21
thereto) in funds of the type specified in Section 3.6, (a) an amount
equal to the Stipulated Loss Value of each such Unit suffering an Event of
Loss or deemed Event of Loss determined as of such Rent Payment Date, (b)
all Basic Rent payable on such date in respect of such Unit (exclusive of
any in advance Basic Rent due on such date), and (c) all other Rent then
due and payable hereunder, it being understood that until such Stipulated
Loss Value and other sums are paid, there shall be no abatement or
reduction of Basic Rent;

provided that in the event at any time a Responsible Officer of Lessee shall
have actual knowledge of the occurrence or deemed occurrence of an Event of
Loss with respect to an aggregate of 15 or more Units as to which Lessee would
otherwise be obligated to make payment pursuant to the proviso to paragraph (i)
above or pursuant to paragraph (ii) above on a Rent Payment Date, then Lessee
shall thereupon give Lessor and the Indenture Trustee notice that in lieu of
making payments with respect to such Units as otherwise above provided on a
Rent Payment Date, Lessee will make a payment with respect to such Units on the
next succeeding Determination Date which is at least 25 days after such notice,
and on such Determination Date Lessee shall pay, in lieu of the amounts
otherwise required to be paid in respect of such Units on a Rent Payment Date
as provided above, (a) an amount equal to the Stipulated Loss Value of such
Units determined as of such Determination Date, (b) if such Determination Date
is also a Rent Payment Date, all Basic Rent payable on such date in respect of
such Units (exclusive of any in advance Basic Rent due on such date) and (c)
all other Rent then due and payable hereunder, it being understood that until
such Stipulated Loss Value and other sums are paid, there shall be no abatement
or reduction of Basic Rent.

Section 11.3 Rent Termination. Upon the replacement of any Unit or Units
in compliance with Section 11.2(i) (but only as to replaced Units and not any
Replacement Unit) or upon the payment of all sums required to be paid pursuant
to Section 11.2 in respect of any Unit or Units, the Lease Term with respect to
such Unit or Units and the obligation to pay Basic Rent for such Unit or Units
accruing subsequent to the date of payment of Stipulated Loss Value or date of
conveyance of such Replacement Unit or Units pursuant to Section 11.2 shall
terminate; provided that Lessee shall be obligated to pay all Rent in respect
of such Unit or Units which is payable under Section 11.2 with respect to such
payment of Stipulated Loss Value or such replacement of such Unit or Units and
in respect of all other Units then continuing to remain subject to this Lease;
provided further that it is understood and agreed that, in the event of a
replacement in compliance with Section 11.2(i), the Rent paid with respect
thereto on the Rent Payment Date next following the conveyance of the
Replacement Unit or Units shall be deemed paid in respect of, and allocated
between, both the Replacement Unit or Units and the original Unit or Units it
or they replaced.

Section 11.4 Disposition of Equipment; Replacement of Unit. (a) Upon the
payment of all sums required to be paid pursuant to Section 11.2 in respect of
any Unit or Units, Lessor will convey to Lessee or its designee all right,
title and interest of Lessor in and to such Unit or Units, "as is", "where is",
without recourse or warranty, except for a warranty against Lessor's Liens, and
shall execute and deliver to Lessee or its designee such bills of sale and
other documents and instruments as Lessee or its designee may reasonably
request to evidence

17

<PAGE> 22
such conveyance. As to each separate Unit so disposed of, so long as no Lease
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessee or its designee
shall be entitled to any amounts arising from such disposition, plus any
awards, insurance or other proceeds and damages received by Lessee, Lessor or
the Indenture Trustee by reason of such Event of Loss after having paid the
Stipulated Loss Value attributable thereto.

(b) At the time of or prior to any replacement of any Unit, Lessee, at its
own expense, will (A) furnish Lessor with a Bill of Sale with respect to the
Replacement Unit substantially in the form delivered pursuant to Section 4.1(g)
of the Participation Agreement, (B) cause a Lease Supplement substantially in
the form of Exhibit A hereto, subjecting such Replacement Unit to this Lease,
and duly executed by Lessee, to be delivered to Lessor for execution and, upon
such execution, to be filed for recordation in the same manner as provided for
the original Lease Supplement in Section 16.1, (C) so long as the Indenture
shall not have been satisfied and discharged, cause an Indenture Supplement
substantially in the form of Exhibit A to the Indenture for such Replacement
Unit, to be delivered to Lessor and to the Indenture Trustee for execution and,
upon such execution, to be filed for recordation in the same manner and within
the same time periods as provided for the original Indenture Supplement in
Section 16.1, (D) furnish Lessor with an opinion of Lessee's counsel (which may
be Lessee's General Counsel or Assistant General Counsel), to the effect that
(x) the Bill of Sale referred to in clause (A) above constitutes an effective
instrument for the conveyance of title to the Replacement Unit to Lessor, (y)
legal and beneficial title to the Replacement Unit has been delivered to
Lessor, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens of the type
described in clause (ii) with respect to sublessees, and in clauses (iii),
(iv), (vi) and (vii) of the definition thereof), and (z) all filings and
recordings and other action necessary or appropriate to protect the respective
interests of Lessor and the Indenture Trustee in the Replacement Units have
been accomplished, (E) furnish to Owner Participant (x) a tax opinion from
Mayer, Brown & Platt or other tax counsel reasonably acceptable to Owner
Participant to the effect that Owner Participant would have a reasonable basis
consistent within the meaning of Section 6662(d)(2)(B)(ii) of the Code not to
recognize gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes with respect to such
replacement and (y) an agreement to indemnify Owner Participant against any
adverse tax consequences suffered as a result of such replacement; provided,
however, that in the event that such reasonable basis tax opinion cannot be
furnished and Lessee wishes to make such replacement, Lessee will, at such time
as Lessee receives written notice from Owner Participant that Owner Participant
has filed its Federal income tax returns wherein such gain or loss is
recognized, make an indemnity payment to Owner Participant in the incremental
amount of such adverse tax consequence (on a net after-tax basis) attributable
to the conveyance of such Replacement Unit, (F) furnish Lessor with an
engineer's certificate (which may be from an employee of Lessee) certifying as
to the utility, condition and remaining useful life required under clause (i)
of Section 11.2, (G) furnish to Lessor and the Indenture Trustee an Officer's
Certificate certifying that the Replacement Unit is free and clear of all Liens
(other than Permitted Liens of the type described in clause (ii) with respect
to sublessees, and in clauses (iii), (iv), (vi) and (vii) of the definition
thereof), and (H) furnish such other documents and evidence as Owner
Participant, Lessor or the Indenture Trustee, or their respective counsel, may
reasonably request in order to establish the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Section 11.4. For all purposes hereof, upon passage of
title thereto to Lessor the

18

<PAGE> 23
Replacement Unit shall be deemed part of the property leased hereunder and the
Replacement Unit shall be deemed a "Unit" of Equipment as defined herein. Upon
such passage of title, Lessor will transfer to Lessee, without recourse or
warranty (except as to Lessor's Liens), all Lessor's right, title and interest
in and to the replaced Unit, and upon such transfer, Lessor will request in
writing that the Indenture Trustee execute and deliver to Lessee an appropriate
instrument releasing such replaced Unit from the lien of the Indenture. Lessee
shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
legal fees and expenses) incurred by Lessor, Owner Participant and the
Indenture Trustee in connection with any replacement pursuant to this Section
11.4.

Section 11.5 Eminent Domain. In the event that during the Lease Term the
use of any Unit is requisitioned or taken by any governmental authority under
the power of eminent domain or otherwise for a period which does not constitute
an Event of Loss, all of Lessee's obligations under the Operative Agreements,
including without limitation, Lessee's obligation to pay all installments of
Basic Rent, shall continue for the duration of such requisitioning or taking.
Lessee shall be entitled to receive and retain for its own account all sums
payable for any such period by such governmental authority as compensation for
requisition or taking of possession. Any amount referred to in this Section
11.5, in Section 11.4(a) or in Section 12 which is payable to Lessee shall not
be paid to Lessee, or if it has been previously paid directly to Lessee, shall
not be retained by Lessee, if at the time of such payment a Lease Default under
Section 14(g) or Section 14(h) or a Lease Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, but shall be paid to and held by Lessor pursuant to Section
24, or if the Indenture shall not then have been discharged pursuant to its
terms, to the Indenture Trustee, as security for the obligations of Lessee
under this Lease, and at such time as there shall not be continuing any such
Lease Default or Lease Event of Default, such amount shall be paid to Lessee.

Section 12. Insurance.

Section 12.1 Physical Damage and Public Liability Insurance. Lessee will
at all times after delivery and acceptance of each Unit, at its own expense,
keep or cause to be kept such Unit insured by a reputable insurance company or
companies in amounts and against risks and with deductibles and terms and
conditions not less than the insurance, if any, maintained by Lessee with
respect to similar equipment which it owns or leases, but in no event shall
such coverage be for amounts or against risks less than the prudent industry
standard for companies engaged in full service leasing of tank and hopper
railcars. Without limiting the foregoing, Lessee will in any event;

(a) keep each Unit of the Equipment insured against physical damage in an
amount not less than the Stipulated Loss Value attributable thereto as shown on
Schedule 4 to the Participation Agreement, subject to a limit of not less than
$10 million per occurrence (except for a $10 million annual aggregate each for
flood and earth movement), provided that such coverage may provide for
deductible amounts of not more than $1,000,000 per occurrence; and

19

<PAGE> 24
(b) maintain public liability insurance naming Owner Participant, Lessor,
as Lessor of the Equipment and in its individual capacity, and the Indenture
Trustee as additional insureds (but only with respect to liability arising out
of or related to the Operative Agreements and the Equipment) against bodily
injury, death or property damage arising out of the use or operation of the
Equipment with general and excess liability limits of not less than $50,000,000
per occurrence or in the aggregate, provided that such coverage may provide for
deductible amounts not exceeding the lesser of (x) $10,000,000 or (y) 5% of the
book value of the railcar fleet of Lessee.

It is understood and agreed that the insurance required hereunder may be
part of a company-wide insurance program, including risk-retention and
self-insurance. Any policy of insurance maintained in accordance with this
Section 12.1 and any policy purchased in substitution or replacement for any of
such policies shall provide that if any such insurance is cancelled or
terminated (other than upon normal policy expiration) for any reason whatever,
Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and Owner Participant shall receive 30 days'
prior written notice of such cancellation or termination.

Section 12.2 Physical Damage Insurance. (a) The insurance maintained
pursuant to Section 12.1(a) shall provide that (i) so long as the Equipment
Notes remain outstanding, the proceeds up to the Stipulated Loss Value for any
loss or damage to any Unit shall be made to the Indenture Trustee under a
standard mortgage loss payable clause, and thereafter to Lessor and (ii) so
long as no Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessee
will be entitled, at its own expense, to make all proofs of loss and take all
other steps necessary to collect the proceeds of such insurance.

(b) In lieu of maintaining the physical damage insurance required by
Section 12.1.(a), Lessee may self-insure with respect to the Equipment for such
amounts and against such risks as shall be consented to by Lessor and the
Indenture Trustee, which consent shall be based upon reasonable practices then
in effect in the railcar leasing and insurance industries and upon the
financial condition of Lessee.

(c) The entire proceeds of any property insurance or third party payments
for damages to any Unit received by Lessor or the Indenture Trustee shall be
held by such party until, with respect to such Unit, the repairs referred to in
clause (i) below are made as specified therein or payment of the Stipulated
Loss Value is made, and such entire proceeds will be paid, so long as no Lease
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, either:

(i) to Lessee promptly following receipt by the Indenture Trustee or
Lessor, as the case may be, of a written application signed by Lessee for
payment to Lessee for repairing or restoring the Units which have been
damaged so long as (1) Lessee shall have complied with the applicable
provisions of the Lease, and (2) Lessee shall have certified that any damage
to such Units shall have been fully repaired or restored; or

20

<PAGE> 25
(ii) if this Lease is terminated with respect to such Unit because of an
Event of Loss and Lessee has paid the Stipulated Loss Value due as a result
thereof, such proceeds shall promptly paid over to, or retained by, Lessee.

Section 12.3 Public Liability Insurance. (a) The public liability
insurance referred to in paragraph 12.1(b) shall (i) provide that in as much as
such policies cover more than one insured, all terms, conditions, insuring
agreements and endorsements, with the exception of limits of liability and
liability for premiums, commissions, assessments or calls (which shall be
solely a liability of Lessee), shall operate in the same manner as if there
were a separate policy or policies covering each insured, (ii) waive any rights
of subrogation of the insurers against Owner Participant, Lessor, as Lessor of
the Equipment and in its individual capacity, and the Indenture Trustee, (iii)
provide that neither Owner Participant, Lessor, as Lessor of the Equipment and
in its individual capacity, or the Indenture Trustee shall have any
responsibility for any insurance premiums, whether for coverage before or after
cancellation or termination of any such policies as to Lessee and (iv) be
primary without contribution from any similar insurance maintained by Owner
Participant, Lessor or the Indenture Trustee.

(b) Lessee shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain public liability
insurance policies stipulating that coverage thereunder will not be invalidated
(as to Owner Participant, Lessor, as Lessor of the Equipment and in its
individual capacity, and the Indenture Trustee) due to any action or inaction
of Lessee or any other Person (other than Owner Participant, Lessor or the
Indenture Trustee, but only in respect of their respective coverages), but
shall be under no obligation to obtain such policies containing such
stipulations if they are not available to Lessee at commercially reasonable
rates in the markets in which Lessee has then placed its insurance program.

(c) In the event any public liability insurance policy or coverage
thereunder which are required to be maintained under Section 12.1(b) shall not
be available to Lessee in the commercial insurance market on commercially
reasonable terms, Lessor shall not unreasonably withhold its agreement to waive
such requirement to the extent the maintenance thereof is not so available upon
application therefore as set forth herein. Lessee shall make written request
for any such waiver in writing, accompanied by written reports prepared, at
Lessee's option, either by (i) one independent insurance advisor chosen by
Lessee and Lessor or (ii) three independent insurance advisors, one chosen by
Lessor, one chosen by Lessee and one chosen by the other two advisors (one of
which may be the regular insurance broker or brokers of Lessee) - in either
case, such independent insurance advisors being of recognized national
standing. The fees and expenses of all such advisors shall be paid by Lessee.
The written reports required hereunder shall (x) state that such insurance (or
the required coverage thereunder) is not reasonably available to Lessee at
commercially reasonable premiums in the commercial insurance markets within
which Lessee normally purchases its insurance from insurers, acceptable to
Lessee, with a Best's rating of A- or better for railcars of similar type and
capacity and (y) explain in detail the basis for such conclusions. Upon the
granting of any such waiver, Lessee shall within 15 days thereafter certify to
Lessor in writing the cost (on a fleet-wide basis) of liability insurance
premiums for the coverage required by Section 12.1(b) for the immediately
preceding fiscal year; and in the event that any such certificate is not

21

<PAGE> 26
received by Lessor within such 15 day period, any such waiver shall be deemed
revoked. At any time after the granting of such waiver, but not more often
than once a year, Lessor may make a written request for a supplemental report
(in form reasonably acceptable to Lessor) from such insurance advisor(s)
updating the prior report and reaffirming the conclusions set forth therein.
Lessee shall provide any such required supplemental report within 60 days after
receipt of the written request therefor. Any such waiver shall be effective
for only as long as such insurance is not reasonably available to Lessee in the
commercial markets in which Lessee normally purchases its insurance at
commercially reasonable rates, it being understood that the failure of Lessee
to furnish timely any such supplemental report shall be conclusive evidence
that such condition no longer exists. If such supplemental report shows that
such coverage is available, Lessee shall within 90 days of such report obtain
such insurance coverage. During any period with respect to which such waiver
has been granted and remains in effect under this Section 12.3(c), Lessee shall
obtain public liability insurance as set forth in Section 12.1(b) from such
carriers, in such amounts and with coverage limits and deductibles as is
prudent under the circumstances, but in any event in an amount that may be
purchased for a premium equal to 110% of Lessee's cost (on a fleet-wide basis)
of public liability insurance premiums for the coverage required by Section
12.1(b) for the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year in which such
waiver first was granted.

Section 12.4 Certificate of Insurance. Lessee shall, prior to the Closing
Date and when the renewal certificate referred to below is sent (but in any
event not less than annually), furnish Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and the
Owner Participant with a certificate signed by the insurer or an independent
insurance broker showing the insurance then maintained by Lessee pursuant to
Section 12.1 and, with respect to any renewal policy or policies, furnish
certificates or binders evidencing such renewal as soon as practicable, but in
no event later than 30 days after the earlier of the date such renewal is
effected or the expiration date of the original policy or policies.
Simultaneously, with the furnishing of such certificate, Lessee will provide
appropriate evidence, reasonably satisfactory to Lessor and the Indenture
Trustee, that all premiums due on such insurance have been paid.

Section 12.5 Additional Insurance. In the event that Lessee shall fail to
maintain insurance as herein provided in Section 12.1 or, if applicable,
Section 12.3, Lessor may at its option, upon prior written notice to Lessee,
provide such insurance and, in such event, Lessee shall, upon demand from time
to time reimburse Lessor for the cost thereof together with interest from the
date of payment thereof at the Late Rate, on the amount of the cost to Lessor
of such insurance which Lessee shall have failed to maintain. If after Lessor
has provided such insurance, Lessee then obtains the coverage provided for in
Section 12.1 which was replaced by the insurance provided by Lessor, and Lessee
provides Lessor with evidence of such coverage reasonably satisfactory to
Lessor, Lessor shall cancel the insurance it has provided pursuant to the first
sentence of this Section 12.5. In such event, Lessee shall reimburse Lessor
for all costs to Lessor of cancellation, including without limitation any short
rate penalty, together with interest from the date of Lessor's payment thereof
at the Late Rate. In addition, at any time Lessor (either directly or in the
name of Owner Participant) may at its own expense carry insurance with respect
to its interest in the Units, provided that such insurance does not interfere
with Lessee's ability to insure the Equipment as required by this Section 12 or
adversely affect

22

<PAGE> 27
Lessee's insurance or the cost thereof, it being understood that all salvage
rights to each Unit shall remain with Lessee's insurers at all times. Any
insurance payments received from policies maintained by Lessor pursuant to the
previous sentence shall be retained by Lessor without reducing or otherwise
affecting Lessee's obligations hereunder, other than with respect to Unit(s)
with respect to which such payments have been made.

Section 12.6 Pollution Coverage. The public liability insurance policy
that is maintained pursuant to Section 12.1 on the date hereof includes
coverage for pollution incidents (other than as may occur on property owned,
leased or occupied by Lessee) of a sudden and accidental nature, including,
without limiting the generality of the foregoing, collision and overturn of
railcars arising out of the use or operation of the Units. Such insurance
provides coverage for clean up should Lessee become legally obligated to pay,
subject to a limit of not less than $5,000,000 per occurrence. The coverage
under such insurance shall be maintained as long as it remains available at a
reasonable cost under such public liability insurance policy.

Section 13. Reports; Inspection.

Section 13.1 Duty of Lessee to Furnish. On or before April 30, 1995, and
on or before each April 30 thereafter, Lessee will furnish to Lessor, Owner
Participant and the Indenture Trustee an accurate statement, as of the
preceding December 31, (a) showing the amount, description and reporting marks
of the Units then leased hereunder, the amount, description and reporting marks
of all Units that may have suffered an Event of Loss during the 12 months
ending on such December 31 (or since the Closing Date, in the case of the first
such statement), and such other information regarding the condition or repair
of the Equipment as Lessor may reasonably request, (b) stating that, in the
case of all Equipment repainted during the period covered by such statement,
the markings required by Section 4.2 hereof shall have been preserved or
replaced, and (c) showing the percentage of use in both Canada and Mexico based
on the total mileage travelled by all railcars in Lessee's fleet for the prior
calendar year as reported to Lessee by railroads, and stating that Lessee is
not aware of any condition of any Unit which would cause such Unit not to
comply in any material respect with the rules and regulations of the Federal
Railroad Administration and the Interchange Rules as they apply to the
maintenance and operation of the Equipment in interchange.

Section 13.2 Lessor's Inspection Rights. Lessor, Owner Participant and the
Indenture Trustee each shall have the right, but not the obligation, at their
respective sole cost, expense and risk (including, without limitation, the risk
of bodily injury or death), by their respective authorized representatives, to
inspect (a) the Equipment and Lessee's records with respect thereto, and (b)
following the occurrence of a Lease Default and during the continuance thereof,
or following notice by Lessee that it will be returning any Unit to Lessor
pursuant to Section 10 or Section 22, any sublease of the Equipment and
Lessee's records with respect thereto. All inspections shall be conducted
during Lessee's normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to
Lessee. Lessee shall not be liable for any injury to, or the death of, any
Person exercising, either on behalf of Lessor, any Owner Participant, the
Indenture Trustee or any prospective user, the rights of inspection granted
under this Section 13.2 unless caused by Lessee's gross negligence or wilful
misconduct. No inspection pursuant to this Section 13.2

23

<PAGE> 28
shall interfere with the use, operation or maintenance of the Equipment or the
normal conduct of Lessee's business, and Lessee shall not be required to
undertake or incur any additional liabilities in connection therewith. Upon
request by Lessor, which request shall not be made more than once in any
calendar year, Lessee, upon three Business Days' prior notice from Lessor, will
provide Lessor with reasonable access at Lessee's office where such information
is located to information regarding the location and Person in possession of
any or all Units as specified in such request; provided that, prior to
providing Lessor with access to such information, Lessee and Lessor shall have
executed a confidentiality agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Lessee with respect to such information.

Section 14. Lease Events of Default.

The following events shall constitute Lease Events of Default hereunder
(whether any such event shall be voluntary or involuntary or come about or be
effected by operation of law or pursuant to or in compliance with any judgment,
decree or order of any court or any order, rule or regulation of any
administrative or governmental body) and each such Lease Event of Default shall
be deemed to exist and continue so long as, but only as long as, it shall not
have been remedied:

(a) Lessee shall fail to make any payment of Basic Rent, Early Purchase
Price, Basic Term Purchase Price or any other purchase price to be paid by
Lessee for any Units pursuant to this Lease or the Participation Agreement,
Stipulated Loss Value or Termination Value within 10 Business Days after the
same shall have become due; or

(b) Lessee shall fail to make any payment of Supplemental Rent, including
indemnity or tax indemnity payments, but not including Stipulated Loss Value,
Early Purchase Price, Basic Term Purchase Price or any other purchase price to
be paid by Lessee for any Units pursuant to this Lease or the Participation
Agreement, Stipulated Loss Value or Termination Value, after the same shall
have become due and such failure shall continue unremedied for 10 Business Days
after receipt by Lessee of written notice of such failure from Lessor or the
Indenture Trustee; or

(c) Lessee shall fail to maintain in effect the insurance required by
Section 12 and such failure shall not have been waived as provided for therein;
or

(d) Lessee shall make or permit any possession of the Equipment or any
portion thereof not permitted by this Lease, provided that such unauthorized
possession shall not constitute a Lease Event of Default for a period of 45
days after the occurrence thereof; or Lessee shall make or permit any
unauthorized assignment or transfer of this Lease in violation of Section 18.2;
or

(e) Lessee shall fail to observe or perform any of the covenants or
agreements to be observed or performed by Lessee in Section 6.8 of the
Participation Agreement, and such failure shall continue unremedied for 30
days; or

24

<PAGE> 29
(f) any representation or warranty made by Lessee in any Lessee Agreement
(other than the Tax Indemnity Agreement) is untrue or incorrect in any material
respect as of the date of making thereof and such untruth or incorrectness
shall continue to be material and unremedied for a period of 30 days after
receipt by Lessee of written notice thereof from Lessor or the Indenture
Trustee; provided that, if such untruth or incorrectness is capable of being
remedied, no such untruth or incorrectness shall constitute a Lease Event of
Default hereunder for a period of 60 days after receipt of such notice so long
as Lessee is diligently proceeding to remedy such untruth or incorrectness and
shall in fact remedy such untruth or incorrectness within such period; provided
that such untrue or incorrect representation or warranty shall be deemed to be
remedied only after all adverse consequences thereof, if any, have been
remedied; or

(g) Lessee shall (i) commence a voluntary case or other proceeding seeking
liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to itself or its debts
under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or hereafter in
effect, or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator,
custodian or other similar official of it or any substantial part of its
property, or (ii) consent to any such relief or to the appointment of or taking
possession by any such official in any voluntary case or other proceeding
commenced against it, or (iii) admit in writing its inability to pay its debts
generally as they come due, or (iv) make a general assignment for the benefit
of creditors, or (v) take any corporate action to authorize any of the
foregoing; or

(h) an involuntary case or other proceeding shall be commenced against
Lessee seeking liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to it
or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law now or
hereafter in effect, or seeking the appointment of a trustee, receiver,
liquidator, custodian or other similar official of it or any substantial part
of its property, and such involuntary case or other proceeding shall remain
undismissed and unstayed for a period of 60 days; or

(i) Lessee shall fail to observe or perform any other of the covenants or
agreements to be observed or performed by Lessee under any Lessee Agreement
(other than the Tax Indemnity Agreement) and such failure shall continue
unremedied for 30 days after notice from Lessor or the Indenture Trustee to
Lessee, specifying the failure and demanding the same to be remedied; provided
that, if such failure is capable of being remedied, and the remedy requires an
action other than, or in addition to, the payment of money, no such failure
(other than one relating to the payment of such money) shall constitute a Lease
Event of Default hereunder for a period of 90 days after receipt of such notice
so long as Lessee is diligently proceeding to remedy such failure and shall in
fact remedy such failure within such period; or

(j) Lessee shall have given notice of its intention to retain any Units at
the end of the Basic Term or any Renewal Term and, prior to the last day of the
Basic Term or such Renewal Term, as the case may be, Lessee shall not have
notified Lessor of its election to purchase or continue leasing such Unit;

25

<PAGE> 30
provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Lease, any failure of Lessee to perform or observe any covenant or agreement
herein shall not constitute a Lease Event of Default if such failure is caused
solely by reason of an event referred to in the definition of "Event of Loss"
so long as Lessee is continuing to comply with the applicable terms of Section
11.

Section 15. Remedies.

Section 15.1 Remedies. Upon the occurrence of any Lease Event of Default
and at any time thereafter so long as the same shall be continuing, Lessor may,
at its option, declare this Lease to be in default by a written notice to
Lessee (except that this Lease shall, without any action on the part of Lessor,
be automatically deemed to have been declared in default upon the occurrence of
a Lease Event of Default described in Section 14(g) or (h)); and at any time
thereafter, unless Lessee shall have remedied all outstanding Lease Events of
Default prior to the commencement of the exercise by Lessor of any of its
remedies hereunder, Lessor may do one or more of the following as Lessor in its
sole discretion shall elect, to the extent permitted by, and subject to
compliance with any mandatory requirements of, applicable law then in effect:

(a) proceed by appropriate court action or actions, either at law or in
equity, to enforce performance by Lessee of the applicable covenants of this
Lease or to recover damages for the breach thereof;

(b) by notice in writing to Lessee, Lessor may demand that Lessee, and
Lessee shall, upon written demand of Lessor and at Lessee's expense, forthwith
return all or any part of the Equipment to Lessor or its order in the manner
and condition required by, and otherwise in accordance with all of the
provisions of Section 15.6; or Lessor with or without notice or judicial
process may by its agents enter upon the premises of Lessee or other premises
where any of the Equipment may be located and take possession of and remove all
or any of the Units, and Lessor may use and employ in connection with such
removal any services, aids, equipment, trackage and other facilities of Lessee
as is reasonably required to remove such Units and thenceforth hold, possess
and enjoy the same free from any right of Lessee, or its successor or assigns,
to use such Units for any purpose whatever, and in connection with the
foregoing, Lessee hereby agrees that it will, if requested by Lessor, give
prompt notice of such demand for return of the Equipment to the Association of
American Railroads and all railroads having possession of any such Unit;

(c) sell any Unit at public or private sale by such advertisement or
publication, if any, as Lessor may determine, free and clear of any rights of
Lessee and without any duty to account to Lessee with respect to such sale or
for the proceeds thereof (except to the extent required by paragraph (f) below
if Lessor elects to exercise its rights under said paragraph), in which event
Lessee's obligation to pay Basic Rent with respect to such Unit hereunder due
for any periods subsequent to the date of such sale shall terminate (except to
the extent that Basic Rent is to be included in computations under paragraph
(e) or (f) below if Lessor elects to exercise its rights under either of said
paragraphs);

26

<PAGE> 31
(d) hold, keep idle or lease to others any Unit as Lessor in its sole
discretion may determine, free and clear of any rights of Lessee and without
any duty to account to Lessee with respect to such action or inaction or for
any proceeds with respect thereto;

(e) whether or not Lessor shall have exercised, or shall thereafter at any
time exercise, any of its rights under paragraph (a), (b), (c) or (d) above
with respect to any Unit, Lessor, by written notice to Lessee specifying a
payment date (which date shall be a Determination Date for the purposes of
computing Stipulated Loss Value) which shall be not earlier than 30 days after
the date of such notice, may demand that Lessee pay to Lessor, and Lessee shall
pay to Lessor, on the payment date specified in such notice, as liquidated
damages for loss of a bargain and not as a penalty (in lieu of the Basic Rent
for such Unit due after the payment date specified in such notice), all Rent
due and payable, or accrued, for such Unit as of the payment date specified in
such notice (exclusive of any in advance Basic Rent due on such date) plus
whichever of the following amounts Lessor, in its sole discretion, shall
specify in such notice: (i) an amount with respect to each such Unit which
represents the excess of the present value, at the time of such payment date,
of all rentals for such Unit which would otherwise have accrued hereunder from
such payment date for the remainder of the Basic Term or any Renewal Term then
in effect over the then present value of the then Fair Market Rental Value of
such Unit (taking into account its actual condition) for such period computed
by discounting from the end of such Term to such payment date rentals which
Lessor reasonably estimates to be obtainable for the use of such Unit during
such period, such present value to be computed in each case on a basis of a per
annum discount at the Debt Rate, compounded semiannually from the respective
dates upon which rentals would have been payable hereunder had this Lease not
been terminated; or (ii) an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the
Stipulated Loss Value for such Unit computed as of the payment date specified
in such notice over the Fair Market Sales Value of such Unit (taking into
account its actual condition) as of the payment date specified in such notice;
or (iii) if Lessor shall not have sold such Unit pursuant to the exercise of
its rights under paragraph (c) above with respect to such Unit, an amount equal
to the higher of Stipulated Loss Value for such Unit computed as of the payment
date specified in such notice or the Fair Market Sales Value of such Unit
(assuming it is in the condition required by this Lease) as of the payment date
specified in such notice, and upon payment by Lessee pursuant to this clause
(iii) of such Stipulated Loss Value or Fair Market Sales Value, as the case may
be, and of all other amounts payable by Lessee under this Lease and under the
other Operative Agreements in respect of such Unit, Lessor shall transfer
without recourse or warranty all right, title and interest of Lessor in and to
such Unit to Lessee or as it may direct, and Lessor shall execute and deliver
such documents evidencing such transfer as Lessee shall reasonably request;

(f) if Lessor shall have sold any Unit pursuant to paragraph (c) above,
Lessor, in lieu of exercising its rights under paragraph (e) above with respect
to such Unit may, if it shall so elect, demand that Lessee pay to Lessor, and
Lessee shall pay to Lessor, as liquidated damages for loss of a bargain and not
as a penalty (in lieu of the Basic Rent for such Unit due subsequent to the
Rent Payment Date next preceding such sale), any accrued and unpaid Rent for
such Unit as of the date of such sale (Basic Rent for this purpose accruing at
a per diem rate equal to the semiannual amount due on the next following Rent
Payment Date divided by 180) and, if that date is a Rent Payment Date, the
Basic Rent due on that date (exclusive of any in

27

<PAGE> 32
advance Basic Rent due on such date), plus the amount, if any, by which the
Stipulated Loss Value of such Unit computed as of the Rent Payment Date next
preceding the date of such sale or, if such sale occurs on a Rent Payment Date,
then computed as of such Rent Payment Date, exceeds the net proceeds of such
sale, plus interest on such amounts from the date of such sale to the date of
payment at the Late Rate; and

(g) Lessor may terminate the leasing of any or all Units under this Lease
or may exercise any other right or remedy that may be available to it under
applicable law.

In addition, Lessee shall be liable, except as otherwise provided above, for
any and all unpaid Rent due hereunder before or during the exercise of any of
the foregoing remedies (exclusive of any in advance Basic Rent due on such
date), and for legal fees and other costs and expenses incurred by reason of
the occurrence of any Lease Event of Default or the exercise of Lessor's
remedies with respect thereto, including without limitation the repayment in
full of any costs and expenses necessary to be expended in repairing any Unit
in order to cause it to be in compliance with all maintenance and regulatory
standards imposed by this Lease.

Section 15.2 Cumulative Remedies. The remedies in this Lease provided in
favor of Lessor shall not be deemed exclusive, but shall be cumulative and
shall be in addition to all other remedies in its favor existing at law or in
equity. Lessee hereby waives any mandatory requirements of law, now or
hereafter in effect, which might limit or modify any of the remedies herein
provided, to the extent that such waiver is permitted by law. Lessee hereby
waives any and all existing or future claims of any right to assert any offset
or counterclaim against the Rent payments due hereunder, and agrees to make the
rent payments regardless of any offset or counterclaim or claim which may be
asserted by Lessee on its behalf in connection with the lease of the Equipment.
To the extent permitted by applicable law, Lessee hereby waives any rights now
or hereafter conferred by statute or otherwise that may require Lessor to sell,
lease or otherwise use the Equipment in mitigation of Lessor's damages as set
forth in Section 15.1 or that may otherwise limit or modify any of Lessor's
rights and remedies provided in this Section 15.

Section 15.3 No Waiver. No delay or omission to exercise any right, power
or remedy accruing to Lessor upon any breach or default by Lessee under this
Lease shall impair any such right, power or remedy of Lessor, nor shall any
such delay or omission be construed as a waiver of any breach or default, or of
any similar breach or default hereafter occurring; nor shall any waiver of a
single breach or default be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach or
default.

Section 15.4 Notice of Lease Default. Lessee agrees to furnish to Lessor,
Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee, promptly upon any officer
acquiring actual knowledge of any condition which constituted or constitutes a
Lease Default under this Lease, written notice specifying such condition and
the nature and status thereof.

28

<PAGE> 33
Section 15.5 Lessee's Duty to Furnish Information with Respect to
Subleases. Upon the occurrence of a Lease Event of Default pursuant to Section
14(a), (b), (g) or (h), Lessor may request that Lessee deliver to Lessor, and
upon such request Lessee agrees that it will promptly provide to Lessor, a
detailed list of all Units that are then being subleased by Lessee, the
identity of the sublessees with respect to such Units, the identity of an
employee or other agent of each such sublessee with whom Lessee regularly
communicates with in respect of such Units and the most recent known location
of such Units.

Section 15.6 Lessee's Duty to Return Equipment Upon Default. If Lessor or
any assignee of Lessor shall terminate this Lease pursuant to this Section 15
and shall have provided to Lessee the written demand specified in Section
15.1(b), Lessee shall forthwith deliver possession of the Equipment to Lessor
(except where Lessor has received all amounts payable by Lessee pursuant to any
notice provided by Lessor under Section 15.1(e)(iii)). For the purpose of
delivering possession of any Unit to Lessor as above required, Lessee shall at
its own cost, expense and risk (except as hereinafter stated):

(a) Forthwith place such Equipment upon such storage tracks of Lessee or
any of its affiliates or, at the expense of Lessee, on any other storage
tracks, as Lessor may designate or, in the absence of such designation, as
Lessee may select;

(b) Permit Lessor to store such Equipment on such tracks without charge
for insurance, rent or storage until such Equipment has been sold, leased or
otherwise disposed of by Lessor and during such period of storage Lessee
shall continue to maintain all insurance required by Section 12.1 hereof; and

(c) Transport the Equipment to any place on any lines of railroad or to
any connection carrier for shipment, all as Lessor may direct in writing.

All Equipment returned shall be in the condition required by Section 6.2
hereof.

All amounts earned in respect of the Equipment after the date of termination
of this Lease pursuant to this Section 15, but not exceeding amounts actually
received therefor, shall be paid to Lessor or, so long as the Indenture shall
not have been discharged pursuant to its terms, the Indenture Trustee, and, if
received by Lessee, shall be promptly turned over to Lessor or the Indenture
Trustee as aforesaid. In the event any Unit is not assembled, delivered and
stored as hereinabove provided within 15 days after the termination of the
leasing of such Unit pursuant to Section 15, Lessee shall, in addition, pay to
Lessor or the Indenture Trustee as aforesaid as liquidated damages and not as a
penalty, for each day thereafter an amount equal to the amount, if any, by
which the higher of (i) an amount equal to 110% of the daily equivalent of the
Basic Rent in effect immediately prior to the expiration of the Lease for such
Unit and (ii) 125% of the Fair Market Rental Value for such Unit for each such
day exceeds the amount, if any, received by Lessor or the Indenture Trustee as
aforesaid (either directly or from Lessee) for such day for such Unit pursuant
to the preceding sentence.

29

<PAGE> 34
Section 15.7 Specific Performance; Lessor Appointed Lessee's Agent. The
assembling, delivery, storage and transporting of the Equipment as provided in
Section 15.6 are of the essence of this Lease, and upon application to any
court of equity having jurisdiction in the premises, Lessor shall be entitled
to a decree against Lessee requiring specific performance of the covenants of
Lessee so to assemble, deliver, store and transport the Equipment. Without in
any way limiting the obligation of Lessee under the provisions of Section 15.6,
Lessee hereby irrevocably appoints Lessor as the agent and attorney of Lessee,
with full power and authority, at any time while Lessee is obligated to deliver
possession of any Units to Lessor pursuant to this Section 15, to demand and
take possession of such Unit in the name and on behalf of Lessee from whosoever
shall be at the time in possession of such Unit.

Section 16. Filings; Further Assurances.

Section 16.1 Filings. This Lease or a counterpart or copy hereof or
evidence hereof may be filed or recorded in any public office as may be
necessary or appropriate to protect the interest of Lessor, Owner Participant
or the Indenture Trustee herein or in the Units. On or prior to the Closing
Date Lessee will cause this Lease, the Lease Supplements dated the Closing
Date, the Indenture and the Indenture Supplements dated the Closing Date (i) to
be duly filed and recorded with the ICC in accordance with 49 U.S.C. Section
11303, (ii) to be deposited with the Registrar General of Canada pursuant to
Section 90 of the Railway Act of Canada (and all necessary actions shall have
been taken for publication of such deposit in The Canada Gazette in accordance
with said Section 90) and (iii) will furnish Lessor, the Indenture Trustee and
Owner Participant proof thereof.

Section 16.2 Further Assurances. Lessee will duly execute and deliver to
Lessor such further documents and assurances and take such further action as
Lessor may from time to time reasonably request or as may be required by
applicable law or regulation in order to effectively carry out the intent and
purpose of this Lease and to establish and protect the rights and remedies
created or intended to be created in favor of Lessor, Owner Participant and the
Indenture Trustee hereunder, including, without limitation, the execution and
delivery of supplements or amendments hereto, in recordable form, subjecting to
this Lease any Replacement Unit and the recording or filing of counterparts
hereof or thereof in accordance with the laws of such jurisdiction as Lessor
may from time to time deem advisable.

Section 16.3 Other Filings. If, at any time during the Lease Term, Mexico,
or one or more states in Mexico, or any of the Canadian provinces establishes a
state or provincial or other system for filing and perfecting the security
and/or ownership interests of entities such as Lessor and/or the Indenture
Trustee, Lessee shall cause any and all of the Operative Agreements to be
recorded with or under such system and shall cause all other filings and
recordings and all such other action required under such system to be effected
and taken, in order to perfect and protect the respective right, title and
interests of Lessor, Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee.

Section 16.4 Expenses. Lessee will pay all costs, charges and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incident to any such filing, refiling,
recording and

30

<PAGE> 35
rerecording or depositing and re-depositing of any such instruments or incident
to the taking of such action.

Section 17. Lessor's Right to Perform.

If Lessee fails to make any payment required to be made by it hereunder or
fails to perform or comply with any of its other agreements contained herein,
Lessor may itself make such payment or perform or comply with such agreement,
after giving not less than five Business Days' prior notice thereof to Lessee
(except in the event that an Indenture Default resulting from a Lease Default
or a Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, in which
event Lessor may effect such payment, performance or compliance to the extent
necessary to cure such Indenture Default with notice given concurrently with
such payment, performance or compliance), but shall not be obligated hereunder
to do so, and the amount of such payment and of the reasonable expenses of
Lessor incurred in connection with such payment or the performance of or
compliance with such agreement, as the case may be, together with interest
thereon at the Late Rate from such date of payment, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, shall be deemed to be Supplemental Rent, payable by Lessee to
Lessor on demand.

Section 18. Assignment.

Section 18.1 Assignment by Lessor. Lessee and Lessor hereby confirm that
concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Lease, Lessor has executed
and delivered to the Indenture Trustee the Indenture, which assigns as
collateral security and grants a security interest in favor of the Indenture
Trustee in, to and under this Lease and certain of the Rent payable hereunder
(excluding Excepted Property), all as more explicitly set forth in the
Indenture. Lessor agrees that it shall not otherwise assign or convey its
right, title and interest in and to this Lease, the Equipment or any Unit,
except as expressly permitted by and subject to the provisions of the
Participation Agreement, the Trust Agreement and the Indenture.

Section 18.2 Assignment by Lessee. Except as otherwise provided in Section
8.3 or in the case of any requisition for use by any governmental authority or
any agency or instrumentality thereof referred to in Section 11.1, Lessee will
not, without the prior written consent of Lessor and the Indenture Trustee,
assign any of its rights hereunder, except as provided herein and in the
Participation Agreement; provided that Lessee may assign its rights and/or
obligations hereunder to any corporation in accordance with the provisions of
Section 6.8 of the Participation Agreement or to any corporation which is an
Affiliate of Lessee, provided that in the case of an assignment to an
Affiliate, (a) Lessor shall have received an instrument or instruments
reasonably satisfactory to it, Owner Participant and the Indenture Trustee
under which such Affiliate assumes the obligations of Lessee hereunder, and (b)
Lessee irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, pursuant to an agreement in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lessor, Owner Participant and the
Indenture Trustee, such assignee's performance of all of such obligations as
primary obligor and not as a surety.

31

<PAGE> 36
Section 18.3 Sublessee's Performance and Rights. Any obligation imposed on
Lessee in this Lease shall require only that Lessee perform or cause to be
performed such obligation, even if stated herein as a direct obligation, and
the performance of any such obligation by any permitted assignee, sublessee or
transferee under an assignment, sublease or transfer agreement then in effect
and permitted by the terms of this Lease shall constitute performance by Lessee
and discharge such obligation by Lessee. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, any right granted to Lessee in this Lease shall grant Lessee
the right to (a) exercise such right or permit such right to be exercised by
any such assignee or transferee, or (b) in Lessee's capacity as sublessor
pursuant to any sublease permitted pursuant to Section 8.3 hereof, permit any
sublessee to exercise substantially equivalent rights under any such sublease
as are granted to Lessee under this Lease; provided, however, that Lessee's
right to terminate this Lease pursuant to Section 10 and Lessee's purchase and
renewal options set forth in Section 22 may be exercised only by Lessee itself
or by any assignee or transferee of, or successor to, Lessee in a transaction
permitted by Section 6.8 of the Participation Agreement; provided, further,
that nothing in this Section 18.3 shall or shall be deemed to (i) create any
privity of contract between any such sublessee, on the one hand, and any of
Lessor, any Owner Participant or any subsequent transferee or Affiliate of any
such Person, on the other hand, (ii) create any duty or other liability of any
nature whatsoever on the part of any of Lessor, any Owner Participant or any
subsequent transferee or Affiliate of any such Person, to any such sublessee or
any Affiliate thereof, or (iii) modify or waive any term or provision of
Section 8.3 hereof, which Section 8.3 shall control if any conflict arises
between any of the provisions thereof and this Section 18.3. The inclusion of
specific references to obligations or rights of any such assignee, sublessee or
transferee in certain provisions of this Lease shall not in any way prevent or
diminish the application of the provisions of the two sentences immediately
preceding with respect to obligations or rights in respect of which specific
reference to any such assignee, sublessee or transferee has not been made in
this Lease.

Section 19. Net Lease, etc.

This Lease is a net lease and Lessee's obligation to pay all Rent payable
hereunder shall, subject to Section 3.5, be absolute, unconditional and
irrevocable and shall not be affected by any circumstance of any character
including, without limitation, (i) any set-off, abatement, counterclaim,
suspension, recoupment, reduction, rescission, defense or other right that
Lessee may have (other than pursuant to Section 3.5 hereof) against Lessor,
Owner Participant, the Indenture Trustee or any holder of an Equipment Note or
Pass Through Certificate, any vendor or manufacturer of any Unit, or any other
Person for any reason whatsoever, (ii) any defect in or failure of title,
merchantability, condition, design, compliance with specifications, operation
or fitness for use of all or any part of any Unit, (iii) any damage to, or
removal, abandonment, requisition, taking, condemnation, loss, theft or
destruction of all or any part of any Unit or any interference, interruption,
restriction, curtailment or cessation in the use or possession of any Unit by
Lessee or any other Person for any reason whatsoever or of whatever duration,
(iv) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding by or
against Lessee, Lessor, Owner Participant, the Indenture Trustee, any holder of
an Equipment Note or Pass Through Certificate or any other Person, (v) the
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of this Lease, any other Operative
Agreement, or any other instrument referred to herein or therein or any

32

<PAGE> 37
other infirmity herein or therein or any lack of right, power or authority of
Lessee, Lessor, Owner Participant, the Indenture Trustee, any holder of an
Equipment Note or Pass Through Certificate or any other Person to enter into
this Lease or any other Operative Agreement or to perform the obligations
hereunder or thereunder or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or any doctrine of force majeure, impossibility, frustration or failure
of consideration, (vi) the breach or failure of any warranty or representation
made in this Lease or any other Operative Agreement by Lessee, Lessor, Owner
Participant, the Indenture Trustee, any holder of an Equipment Note or Pass
Through Certificate or any other Person, (vii) the requisitioning, seizure or
other taking of title to or use of such Unit by any government or governmental
authority or otherwise, whether or not by reason of any act or omission of
Lessor, Lessee or the Indenture Trustee, or any other deprivation or limitation
of use of such Unit in any respect or for any length of time, whether or not
resulting from accident and whether or not without fault on the part of Lessee,
or (viii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing, any present or future law to the contrary
notwithstanding to the extent permitted by applicable law. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, Lessee hereby waives any and all rights which it
may now have or which at any time hereafter may be conferred upon it, by
statute or otherwise, to terminate, cancel, quit or surrender this Lease with
respect to any Unit, except in accordance with the express terms hereof. If
for any reason whatsoever this Lease shall be terminated in whole or in part by
operation of law or otherwise, except as specifically provided herein, Lessee
nonetheless agrees, subject to Section 3.5, to the maximum extent permitted by
law, to pay to Lessor or to the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, an
amount equal to each installment of Basic Rent and all Supplemental Rent due
and owing, at the time such payment would have become due and payable in
accordance with the terms hereof had this Lease not been terminated in whole or
in part. Each payment of Rent made by Lessee hereunder shall be final and
Lessee shall not seek or have any right to recover all or any part of such
payment from Lessor or any Person for any reason whatsoever. Nothing contained
herein shall be construed to waive any claim which Lessee might have under any
of the Operative Agreements or otherwise or to limit the right of Lessee to
make any claim it might have against Lessor or any other Person or to pursue
such claim in such manner as Lessee shall deem appropriate, except in the
manners precluded by this Section 19.

the contrary, the Indenture Trustee's obligation to take or refrain from taking
any actions, or to use its discretion (including,

<PAGE> 39
but not limited to, the giving or withholding of consent or approval and the
exercise of any rights or remedies under such Operative Agreements), and any
liability therefor, shall, in addition to any other limitations provided herein
or in the other Operative Agreements, be limited by the provisions of the
Indenture, including, but not limited to, Article VI thereof.

Section 21.2 Right, Title and Interest of the Indenture Trustee Under
Lease. It is understood and agreed that the right, title and interest of the
Indenture Trustee in, to and under this Lease and the Rent due and to become

Section 22. Purchase Options; Renewal Options.

Section 22.1 Early Purchase Option. Provided that no Lease Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing either at the time of the notice
described below or on the Early Purchase Date (unless Lessor shall have waived
such Lease Event of Default solely for the purpose of this Section 22.1) and
Lessee shall have duly given the notice required by the next succeeding
sentence, Lessee shall have the right and, upon the giving of such notice, the
obligation to purchase any or all of the Units then leased hereunder (as
specified in such notice) on the Early Purchase Date at a price equal to the
Early Purchase Price of such Units, provided that if Lessee elects to purchase
some but less than all of the Units in any Functional Group the determination
as to which Units are to be purchased shall be made on a random or other
reasonable basis without discrimination based on maintenance status or
operating condition of the Units in question and such notice shall describe
such manner in which Lessee proposes to determine the Units in such Functional
Group which will be purchased. Lessee shall give Lessor written notice not
less than 90 days prior to the Early Purchase Date of its election to exercise
the purchase option provided for in this Section 22.1, which notice shall be
irrevocable. Payment of the Early Purchase Price, together with all other
amounts due and owing by Lessee under the Operative Agreements, with respect to
such Units, including, without limitation, all unpaid Basic Rent therefor due
and payable on or prior to the Early Purchase Date (exclusive of any in advance
Basic Rent due on such date) and any Make-Whole Amount with respect to the
Equipment Notes then being prepaid, shall be made on the Early Purchase Date at
the place of payment specified in Section 3.6 hereof in immediately available
funds against delivery of a Bill of Sale transferring and assigning to Lessee
all right, title and interest of Lessor in and to such Units on an "as-is"
"where-is" basis and containing a warranty against Lessor's Liens; provided,
however, that Lessee shall have the option of specifying in such notice under
this Section 22.1 its election to defer payment of the Deferred Portion of the
Early Purchase Price in four (4) equal installments on the Quarterly Dates
immediately following the Early Purchase Date, which Deferred Portion (i) may
be prepaid by Lessee at any time in whole and (ii) will be secured under a
security agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Lessor; and
provided, further, that the portion of the Early Purchase Price payable by
Lessee on the Early Purchase Date in the event of any such election by Lessee,
under any circumstances and in any event, together with other amounts of
Supplemental Rent paid by Lessee on such date will be at least sufficient to
pay in full, as of the date of payment thereof, the aggregate unpaid principal
of, the Make-Whole Amount if any, and all unpaid interest of the Equipment
Notes issued in respect of such Units and all other amounts owed by Lessee
under the Operative

35

<PAGE> 40
Agreements with respect to such Units. Lessor shall not be required to make
any other representation or warranty as to the condition of such Units or any
other matters, and may specifically disclaim any such representations or
warranties. In the event of any such purchase and receipt by Lessor and the
Indenture Trustee of all of the amounts provided in this Section 22.1, the
obligation of Lessee to pay Basic Rent hereunder for such Units shall cease and
the Lease Term for such Units shall end.

Section 22.2 Election to Retain or Return Equipment at End of Basic or
Renewal Term. Not less than 120 days prior to the end of the Basic Term, the
end of any Fixed Rate Renewal Term or the end of any Fair Market Renewal Term,
Lessee shall give Lessor irrevocable written notice of its decision to return
or retain any or all of the Units at the end of the Basic Term or such Renewal
Term, provided that if Lessee elects to retain less than all of the Units in a
Functional Group, the determination as to which Units are to be retained shall
be made on a random or other reasonable basis without discrimination based on
maintenance status or operating condition of the Units in question, and Lessee
shall describe in such notice such manner in which it proposes to determine the
Units in such Functional Group which will be retained. If Lessee elects to
retain some or all of the Units, Lessee shall comply with Section 22.3 and/or
22.4 hereof, as it may elect in accordance with the provisions thereof
including the notice requirements stated therein. If Lessee fails to give the
120 days' notice required by this Section 22.2, Lessee shall be deemed to have
irrevocably elected to return the Units at the end of the Basic Term or the
applicable Renewal Term, as the case may be, in accordance with Section 6.

Section 22.3 Purchase Options. Provided that no Lease Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing either at the time of notice or the
expiration of the Lease Term (unless Lessor shall have waived such Lease Event
of Default solely for the purpose of this Section 22.3) and Lessee shall have
duly given the notice required by Section 22.2 and by the next succeeding
sentence of this Section 22.3, Lessee shall have the right and, upon the giving
of such notice under this Section 22.3, the obligation to purchase any or all
of the Units (as specified in such notice) either (x) at the expiration of the
Basic Term at a price equal to the Basic Term Purchase Price of such Units or
(y) at the expiration of the Basic Term or any Renewal Term at a price equal to
the Fair Market Sales Value of such Units. Lessee shall give Lessor written
notice not less than 90 days prior to the end of the Basic Term, the Fixed Rate
Renewal Term or the Fair Market Renewal Term, as the case may be, of its
election to exercise the purchase option provided for in this Section 22.3,
which notice shall be irrevocable. Payment of the purchase price, together
with all other amounts due and owing by Lessee under the Operative Agreements,
shall be made at the place of payment specified in Section 3.6 hereof in
immediately available funds against delivery of a Bill of Sale transferring and
assigning to Lessee all right, title and interest of Lessor in and to such
Units on an "as-is" "where-is" basis and containing a warranty against Lessor's
Liens. Lessor shall not be required to make any other representation or
warranty as to the condition of such Units or any other matters, and may
specifically disclaim any such representations or warranties.

Section 22.4 Renewal Options. Provided that no Lease Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing either at the time of notice or the
expiration of the Lease Term

36

<PAGE> 41
(unless Lessor shall have waived such Lease Event of Default solely for the
purpose of this Section 22.4) and Lessee shall have duly given the notice
required by Section 22.2, Lessee shall have the right and, upon the giving of a
notice under this Section 22.4 as below provided, the obligation to lease
pursuant to this Lease any or all of the Units at the expiration of the Basic
Term or any applicable Renewal Term which Lessee has not elected to purchase
pursuant to Section 22.3, which obligation may be fulfilled by Lessee electing
to renew this Lease under either of the following Section 22.4(a) or (b):

(a) Fixed Rate. Lessee may give Lessor written notice not less than 90
days prior to the end of the Basic Term (or, in the circumstances described in
the fifth sentence of this Section 22.4(a), the then Fixed Rate Renewal Term)
that Lessee elects to renew this Lease under this Section 22.4(a) with respect
to any or all of the Units then leased hereunder, which notice shall be
irrevocable. In such event, promptly following such notice, a determination in
accordance with Section 22.5 shall be made of the date such that (1) the period
from the Closing Date to such date would not exceed 80% of the useful life of
such Units from and after the Closing Date, and (2) the Fair Market Sales Value
(determined without regard to inflation or deflation) on such date would not be
less than 20% of the Equipment Cost of such Units. Such date shall thereafter
be the latest date to which this Lease may be renewed pursuant to this Section
22.4(a) (the "Outside Fixed Renewal Date"). Lessee shall promptly following
the determination of the Outside Fixed Renewal Date give Lessor written notice
of the term (the "Fixed Rate Renewal Term") which Lessee selects for its
initial renewal under this Section 22.4(a), which shall be for one or more
years as Lessee shall select, but in no event longer than the Outside Fixed
Renewal Date. If Lessee selects a Fixed Rate Renewal Term such that the period
following such term until the Outside Fixed Renewal Date is longer than one
year, then Lessee may elect one or more further renewals of one or more years
pursuant to this Section 22.4(a) so long as no such term extends beyond the
Outside Fixed Renewal Date. The Basic Rent for each Unit during any Fixed Rate
Renewal Term shall be 50% of the average of the semiannual Basic Rent
installments payable hereunder for such Unit during the Basic Term, payable
semiannually in arrears. Each Fixed Rate Renewal Term shall commence
immediately upon the expiration of the Basic Term or the preceding Fixed Rate
Renewal Term, as the case may be.

(b) Fair Market. Lessee may give Lessor written notice not less than 90
days prior to the end of the Basic Term, a Fixed Rate Renewal Term or a Fair
Market Renewal Term (subject to the limitations otherwise provided in this
Section 22.4(b)) that Lessee elects to renew this Lease under this Section
22.4(b) with respect to any or all of the Units then leased hereunder for a
term of one or more years as Lessee shall specify in such notice (the "Fair
Market Renewal Term"), which notice shall be irrevocable. The Basic Rent for
the Units leased during the Fair Market Renewal Term shall be the Fair Market
Rental Value thereof, payable semiannually in arrears. The Fair Market Renewal
Term shall commence immediately upon the expiration of the Base Term or the
preceding Fixed Rate Renewal Term or Fair Market Renewal Term, as the case may
be.

Section 22.5 Appraisal. Promptly following Lessee's written notice
pursuant to Section 22.2 of its election to retain any Units at the end of the
Basic Term or a Renewal Term,

37

<PAGE> 42
as the case may be, Lessor and Lessee shall determine the useful life (based on
the actual condition of a reasonable sampling of such Units), Fair Market Sales
Value and Fair Market Rental Value of the Units to be retained, in each case
assuming the Units are in the condition required by this Lease.

Section 22.6 Stipulated Loss Value and Termination Value During Renewal
Term. All of the provisions of this Lease, other than Section 10, shall be
applicable during any renewal term for such Units, except as specified in the
next sentence. During any Renewal Term, the Stipulated Loss Value and
Termination Value of any Unit shall be determined on the basis of the Fair
Market Sales Value of such Unit as of the first day of such Renewal Term,
reduced in equal monthly increments to the Fair Market Sales Value of such Unit
as of the last day of such Renewal Term; provided that in no event during any
Fixed Rate Renewal Term shall the Stipulated Loss Value and Termination Value
of any Unit be less than 20% of the Equipment Cost of such Unit.

Section 23. Limitation of Lessor's Liability.

It is expressly agreed and understood that all representations, warranties
and undertakings of Lessor hereunder (except as expressly provided herein)
shall be binding upon Lessor only in its capacity as Owner Trustee under the
Trust Agreement and in no case shall State Street Bank and Trust Company be
personally liable for or on account of any statements, representations,
warranties, covenants or obligations stated to be those of Lessor hereunder,
except that Lessor (or any successor Owner Trustee) shall be personally liable
for its gross negligence or wilful misconduct and for its breach of its
covenants, representations and warranties contained herein to the extent
covenanted or made in its individual capacity.

Section 24. Investment of Security Funds.

Any moneys received by Lessor or the Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section
12.2 which are required to be paid to Lessee after completion of repairs to be
made pursuant to Section 12.2 or pursuant to Section 11.4(a) or 11.5, as the
case may be, until paid to Lessee as provided in Section 11.4(a), 11.5 or 12.2
or the curing of a Lease Default or Lease Event of Default or as otherwise
applied as provided herein or in the Trust Agreement and Indenture, shall be
invested at the risk and expense of Lessee in Specified Investments by Lessor
(unless the Indenture shall not have been discharged, in which case, by the
Indenture Trustee as provided in Section 6.04(b) of the Indenture) from time to
time as directed by telephone (and confirmed promptly thereafter in writing) by
Lessee if such investments are reasonably available for purchase. There shall
be promptly remitted to Lessee, so long as no Lease Default relating to Section
14(a), (b), (g) or (h) or Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, any gain (including interest received) realized as the result of
any such investment (net of any fees, commissions and other expenses, if any,
incurred in connection with such investment) and Lessee will promptly pay to
Lessor or the Indenture Trustee, as the case may be, on demand, the amount of
any loss realized as the result of any such investment (together with any fees,
commissions and other expenses, if any, incurred in connection with such
investment), such

38

<PAGE> 43
amount to be disposed of in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement
and the Indenture.

manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision
of this Lease shall be prohibited by or invalid under the laws of any

the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the
remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Lease in any
other jurisdiction.

Section 25.2 Execution in Counterparts. This Lease may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each executed counterpart constituting an original and
in each case such counterparts shall constitute but one and the same
instrument; provided, however, that to the extent that this Lease constitutes

security interest in this Lease may be created through the transfer or
possession of any counterpart hereof other than the counterpart bearing the
receipt therefor executed by the Indenture Trustee on the signature page
hereof, which counterpart shall constitute the only "original" hereof for
purposes of the Uniform Commercial Code.

Section 25.3 Headings and Table of Contents; Section References. The

income taxes or for franchise taxes measured by income, and that this Lease
conveys to Lessee no right, title or interest in any Unit except as lessee.
Nothing contained in this Section 25.5 shall be construed to limit Lessee's use
or operation of any Unit or constitute a representation, warranty or covenant
by Lessee as to tax consequences.

Section 25.6 Amendments and Waivers. No term, covenant, agreement or
condition of this Lease may be terminated, amended or compliance therewith
waived (either

39

<PAGE> 44

by an instrument or instruments in writing executed by each party hereto and
except as may be permitted by the terms of the Indenture.

Section 25.7 Survival. All warranties, representations, indemnities and
covenants made by either party hereto, herein or in any certificate or other
instrument delivered by such party or on the behalf of any such party under
this Lease, shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other party
hereto and shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby on the Closing Date regardless of any investigation made by either such
party or on behalf of either such party, and to the extent having accrued and

and effect as if made or taken on such scheduled date and as to any payment
(provided any such payment is made on such succeeding Business Day) no interest
shall accrue on the amount of such payment from and after such scheduled date
to the time of such payment on such next succeeding Business Day.

Section 25.9 Directly or Indirectly. Where any provision in this Lease
refers to action to be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited
from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action is taken
directly or indirectly by such Person.

interest in this Lease Supplement may be created through the transfer or

part thereof including, without limitation, (A) any inadequacy or
deficiency or defect therein, including latent defects, whether
or not discoverable or any claim based on negligence or arising
from any violation of law or for strict liability in tort or any
claim for patent, trademark or copyright tort or any claim for
patent, trademark or copyright infringement, and (B) any loss or
damage to property or the environment or injury or death to any
Person; except only that the Owner Participant shall not be
required to indemnify Trust Company for Trust Expenses arising or
resulting from any of the matters described in clauses (i)
through (v) of the last sentence of Section 5.1; provided that
the Owner Participant shall be liable under this Section 6.1 only
to the extent that the Owner Trustee is indemnified by the Lessee
pursuant to Section 7 of the Participation Agreement (with the
exception of the limitations to Lessee's indemnification
obligations set forth in Sections 7.2(d)(i), 7.2(d)(iv) to the
extent relating to any such transfer by the Owner Participant or
transfer by the Owner Trustee at the direction of the Owner
Participant and 7.2(d)(vi) (when the Owner Trustee is acting on
instructions from the Owner Participant) of the Participation
Agreement); provided, further, that before asserting its right to
indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.1, the Owner Trustee
shall first demand its corresponding right to indemnification, if
any, pursuant to Section 7 of the Participation Agreement (but
need not exhaust any or all remedies available thereunder), and
the Owner Participant shall have the right to pursue any such
remedies against the Lessee which are not pursued by the Owner
Trustee. The indemnities contained in this Section 6.1 shall
survive the termination of this Trust Agreement. To secure the
foregoing indemnities, the Owner Trustee shall be entitled to
apply any amount otherwise distributable to the Owner Participant
pursuant to Section 3.2 against any such indemnity which has not
been paid when due. The indemnities contained in this
Section 6.1 extend to Trust Company only and shall not be
construed as indemnities of the Trust Estate. The payor of any
indemnity under this Section 6.1 shall be subrogated to any right
of the Person indemnified in respect of the matter as to which
such indemnity was paid.

Section 6.2. Expenses. The Owner Participant shall
pay, or reimburse the Owner Trustee for, all reasonable expenses
of the Owner Trustee, including, without limitation, the
reasonable expenses and disbursements of such agents,
representatives, experts and counsel as the Owner Trustee may
employ in connection with the exercise and performance of its
rights and duties under the Operative Agreements, unless and to
the extent that the Owner Trustee otherwise receives payment or
reimbursement pursuant to any Operative Agreement, whether or not
the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated; provided
that the Owner Participant shall have no obligation hereunder to
the extent Lessee is not obligated to pay such amounts pursuant
to Section 2.5 of the Participation Agreement. The Owner Trustee
agrees to look first to the Lessee for such payment pursuant to
Section 2.5 of the Participation Agreement. Except as provided
herein, the Owner Trustee and Trust Company shall have no right
to compensation with respect to the transactions contemplated by
the Operative Agreements.

upon the earlier of (i) the sale or other final disposition by
the Owner Trustee of all property constituting part of the Trust
Estate and the final distribution by the Owner Trustee of all
moneys or other property or proceeds constituting part of the
Trust Estate in accordance with the terms of Article III and
(ii) twenty-one (21) years less one day after the death of the

this Trust Agreement of Joseph P. Kennedy, the late ambassador of
the United States to Great Britain, but if any rights, privileges
or options hereunder shall be or become valid under applicable
law for a period subsequent to the twenty-first anniversary of

generality of the foregoing, if legislation shall become
effective providing for the validity or permitting the effective
grant of such rights, privileges and options for a period in
gross exceeding the period for which such rights, privileges and
options are hereinabove stated to extend and be valid), then such
rights, privileges or options shall not terminate as aforesaid

nontermination and extension shall then be valid under applicable
law, until such time as the same shall cease to be valid under
applicable law.

Participant. The provisions of Section 7.1 notwithstanding, this

Trustee to revoke the trusts created hereby; provided that, in
addition to the giving of such notice, the Owner Participant,
with the cooperation of the Owner Trustee, shall execute and
deliver such written agreements and instruments and take such
actions as shall be necessary in order to cause the succession of
the Owner Participant to all the rights, title, interests, duties
and liabilities of the Owner Trustee under the Operative
Agreements (other than obligations attributable to any gross
negligence or willful misconduct of Trust Company or any breach
by the Owner Trustee of its obligations under the Operative
Agreements). The written agreements and instruments referred to

AND SEPARATE OWNER TRUSTEES

Section 8.1. Resignation of the Owner Trustee;
Appointment of Successor.

(a) The Owner Trustee may resign as the Owner Trustee
at any time without cause by giving at least thirty (30) days'
prior written notice to the Owner Participant, the

-10-
<PAGE> 14

Indenture Trustee and the Lessee, such resignation to be
effective on the acceptance of appointment by a successor to the
Owner Trustee under paragraph (b) of this Section 8.1. In
addition, the Owner Participant at any time may remove the Owner
Trustee without cause by an instrument in writing delivered to
the Owner Trustee, the Indenture Trustee and the Lessee, such
removal to be effective upon the acceptance of appointment by a
successor to the Owner Trustee under paragraph (b) of this
Section 8.1. In case of the resignation or removal of the Owner
Trustee, the Owner Participant may appoint a successor to the
Owner Trustee by an instrument in writing, signed by the Owner
Participant. If a successor to the Owner Trustee shall not have
been appointed within thirty (30) days after the giving of
written notice of such resignation or the delivery of the written
instrument with respect to such removal, the Owner Trustee or the
Owner Participant may apply to any court of competent
jurisdiction to appoint a successor to the Owner Trustee to act
until such time, if any, as a successor shall have been appointed
as above provided in this Section 8.1. Any successor to the
Owner Trustee so appointed by such court shall immediately and
without further act be superseded by any successor to the Owner
Trustee appointed as above provided in this Section 8.1.

(b) Any successor Owner Trustee, however appointed,
shall execute and deliver to the predecessor Owner Trustee an
instrument accepting such appointment and shall give the Owner
Participant, the Indenture Trustee and Lessee written notice of
such acceptance. Upon the execution and delivery of such
instrument, such successor Owner Trustee, without further act,
shall become vested with all the estates, properties, rights,
powers, duties and trusts of the predecessor Owner Trustee in the
trusts hereunder with like effect as if originally named a
trustee herein; provided, however, that upon the written request
of such successor Owner Trustee, such predecessor Owner Trustee
shall execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such
successor Owner Trustee, upon the trusts herein expressed, all
the estates, properties, rights, powers, duties and trusts of
such predecessor trustee as the Owner Trustee hereunder, and such
predecessor trustee shall duly assign, transfer, deliver and pay
over to such successor Owner Trustee all moneys or other property
then held by such predecessor trustee as the Owner Trustee upon
the trusts herein expressed. Upon the appointment of any
successor Owner Trustee hereunder, the predecessor Owner Trustee,
pursuant to written instructions of the Owner Participant, will
execute all documents and take all reasonable action within its
control in order to cause title to the Trust Estate to be
transferred to the successor Owner Trustee.

(c) Any successor Owner Trustee, however appointed,
shall be a bank or trust company incorporated and doing business
within the United States of America and having a combined capital
and surplus of at least $100,000,000, if there be such an
institution willing, able and legally qualified to perform the
duties of the Owner Trustee hereunder upon reasonable or
customary terms.

(d) Any corporation into which the Owner Trustee may
be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or
any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Owner Trustee shall be a party, or any
corporation to which substantially all the corporate trust
business of the Owner Trustee may be transferred, shall be,
subject to compliance with the terms of paragraph (c) of this
Section 8.1, the Owner Trustee under this Trust Agreement without
further act; provided, that such corporation shall in no event be
the Indenture Trustee.

Section 8.2. Additional and Separate Trustees.

(a) If the Owner Trustee or the Owner Participant
shall conclude that it is necessary or prudent in order to
conform to the law of any jurisdiction in which all or any part
of the Trust Estate shall be situated, or to make or defend any
claim or bring or defend any suit with respect to the Trust
Estate or any Operative Agreement, or pursuant to advice of
counsel satisfactory to it, or if the Owner Trustee shall have
been instructed to do so by the Owner Participant, the Owner
Trustee shall appoint another Person to act as additional or
separate trustee for all or any part of the Trust Estate with
such property, title, right, power or duty of the Owner Trustee
as the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant may determine. In
case any such additional trustee or separate trustee shall resign
or be removed, all the assets, property, rights, powers or duties
of such additional trustee or separate trustee, as the case may
be, so far as permitted by any applicable law, shall vest in and
be exercised by a new successor to such additional trustee,
appointed in the manner otherwise provided in this Trust
Agreement.

(b) In the event that either the Owner Participant or
the Owner Trustee shall determine to appoint another Person as
additional or separate trustee, the Owner Trustee and the Owner
Participant shall execute and deliver an agreement supplemental
hereto, and all other instruments and agreements necessary or
proper to constitute another bank or trust company, or one or
more Persons approved by the Owner Trustee and the Owner
Participant, either to act as an additional trustee or trustees
of all or any part of the Trust Estate, jointly with the Owner
Trustee, or to act as separate trustee or trustees of all or any
part of the Trust Estate, in any such case with such powers of
the Owner Trustee as may be provided in such agreement
supplemental hereto, and to vest in such bank, trust company or
Person as such additional trustee or separate trustee, as the
case may be, any property, title, right or power of the Owner
Trustee deemed necessary or proper by the Owner Trustee or the
Owner Participant, subject to the remaining provisions of this
Section 8.2. The Owner Trustee may execute, deliver and perform
any deed, conveyance, assignment or other instrument in writing
as may be required by an additional trustee or separate trustee
for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such
person any property, title, right or power which, by the terms of
such agreement supplemental hereto, are expressed to be conveyed
or conferred to or upon such additional trustee or separate
trustee, and the Owner Participant shall, upon the Owner
Trustee's request, join therein and execute, acknowledge and
deliver the same.

(c) Every additional trustee and separate trustee
hereunder shall, to the extent permitted by law, be appointed to
act and the Owner Trustee shall act, subject to the following
provisions and conditions:

(i) all powers, duties, obligations and rights
conferred or imposed upon the Owner Trustee in respect
of the receipt, custody, investment and payment of
moneys, shall be exercised solely by the Owner Trustee;

(ii) all other rights, powers, duties, and
obligations conferred or imposed upon the Owner Trustee
shall be conferred or imposed upon and exercised or
performed by the Owner Trustee and such additional
trustee or trustees and separate trustee or trustees
jointly, except to the extent that under any

-12-
<PAGE> 16
law of the jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts
are to be performed by the Owner Trustee shall be
incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in
which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations
(including the holding of title to the Trust Estate in any
such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed by such
additional trustee or trustees or separate trustee or
trustees;

(iii) no power hereby given to, or which may be
exercised by, any such additional trustee or separate
trustee shall be exercised hereunder by such additional
trustee or separate trustee except jointly with, or
with the consent of, the Owner Trustee; and

(iv) no trustee hereunder shall be personally
liable by reason of any act or omission of any other
trustee hereunder.

(d) If at any time the Owner Trustee and the Owner
Participant shall deem it no longer necessary or prudent in order
to conform to any applicable law or shall be advised by its
counsel that it is no longer necessary or prudent in the interest
of the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant to maintain the
appointment of such additional or separate trustee as provided
herein, the Owner Trustee and the Owner Participant shall execute
and deliver any agreement supplemental hereto and all other
instruments and agreements necessary or proper to remove any such
additional or separate trustee. The Owner Participant, at any
time, by an instrument in writing may remove any separate trustee
or additional trustee.

(e) Any additional trustee or separate trustee may at
any time by an instrument in writing constitute the Owner Trustee
its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and authority, to
the extent which may be authorized by applicable law, to do all
acts and things and exercise all discretion which it is
authorized or permitted to do or exercise, for and in its behalf
and in its name. In case any such additional trustee or separate
trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be
removed, all the assets, property, rights, powers, trusts, duties
and obligations of such additional trustee or separate trustee,
as the case may be, so far as permitted by law, shall vest in and
be exercised by the Owner Trustee without necessity of any act by
any party and without the appointment of a new successor to such
additional or separate trustee, unless and until a successor is
appointed in the manner provided in this Section 8.2.
