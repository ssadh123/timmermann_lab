NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
First Quarter Ended April 1, 1994
(Unaudited; in millions)

The Company's press release on the results of operations for the
first quarter of 1994 was released to the public on April 13, 1994.
This condensed financial information is prepared for the purpose of
filing a summary of first quarter 1994 financial information, which
was included in the Company's press release on April 13, 1994, with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.

(1) On June 30, 1993, the Company acquired from The Coca-Cola
Company: (i) Coca-Cola Beverages Nederland B.V. in the
Netherlands; (ii) Roddy Coca-Cola Bottling Company, Inc.;
and (iii) Coca-Cola Bottling of Johnson City, Tennessee.
The results of operations of these companies are included
in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations from
the date of the acquisition.

(2) Per share data calculated prior to rounding to millions.

(3) Reported first quarter 1994 cash operating profit includes
the effect of acquisitions referred to in note (1) above. 
After appropriate adjustments to first quarter 1993 for 
the effects of these acquisitions, comparable first-quarter 
1994 cash operating profit increased approximately 2% as 
compared to first quarter 1993.

(4) Adjusting 1993 volume for the effect of acquisitions,
physical case bottle/can volume would have increased
approximately 1.5%, and fountain gallon volume would have
increased approximately 6%, for first-quarter 1994 as
compared to first-quarter 1993.
