ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

As of August 8, 1994, Tele-Communications, Inc. (formerly TCI/Liberty
Holding Company or "TCI"), TCI Communications, Inc. ("TCIC") (formerly
Tele-Communications, Inc. or "Old TCI") and TeleCable Corporation ("TeleCable")
entered into a definitive merger agreement, whereby TeleCable will be merged
into TCIC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of TCI (the "TeleCable Merger"). The
aggregate $1.6 billion purchase price will be satisfied by TCIC's assumption of
approximately $300 million of TeleCable's net liabilities and the issuance to
TeleCable's shareholders of shares of TCI Class A common stock (currently
estimated to be approximately 42 million shares) and 1 million shares of TCI
Convertible Preferred Stock, Series D with an aggregate initial liquidation
value of $300 million. Such preferred stock, which will accrue dividends at a
rate of 5.5% per annum, will be convertible into 10 million shares of TCI Class
A common stock and will be redeemable by TCI after five years. Although the
amount of net liabilities to be assumed by TCIC and the number of TCI Class A
common shares to be issued to TeleCable's shareholders are subject to closing
adjustments, management does not believe that any such adjustments will be
material. The merger agreement requires the approval of TeleCable's
shareholders and various franchise and government authorities.

At June 30, 1994, TeleCable operated approximately 13,500 miles of
cable distribution systems that served approximately 740,000 basic subscribers
in 15 states. Historical and pro forma financial information reflecting the
TeleCable Merger is included herein under Item 7 of this Report.

Note 1 - Basis of presentation:

The accompanying unaudited financial statements of TeleCable
Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company or TeleCable) have been 
prepared using accounting principles consistent with those disclosed 
in the December 31, 1993 financial statements. Due to the interim 
nature of the financial statements, they do not include all of the 
disclosures and notes required by generally accepted accounting 
principles. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting
only of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair 
presentation have been included. The results of operations for the 
six month periods ended June 30, 1994 and 1993 are not necessarily 
indicative of results that may be expected for the entire year or any 
interim period. These financial statements should be read in 
connection with the Company's December 31, 1993 financial statements.

On January 1, 1994, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115 (FAS 115), "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities". One of the provisions of
FAS 115 requires that equity securities be classified as available for
sale, or trading. Available for sale securities are carried at their
fair values with the amount of unrealized gains and losses, net of
income taxes, reported as a separate component of stockholders'
equity. The Company does not have any securities classified as
trading. Accordingly, the Company classified equity securities with a
fair value of $8.0 million at June 30, 1994 as available for sale.
Stockholders' deficit at June 30, 1994 includes $3.5 million relating
to unrealized gains on securities available for sale, net of income
taxes.

Note 2 - Debt:

In March 1994, the Company repaid $30 million of expiring term debt
with proceeds from a new unsecured $40 million note that is due 2004.
Interest is payable semi-annually at a fixed rate of 6.52%.

Note 3 - Subsequent event:

On August 8, 1994, the Company, Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI), and 
TCI Communications, Inc. (TCIC) entered into a definitive merger 
agreement, whereby TeleCable will be merged into TCIC, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of TCI. The aggregate $1.6 billion purchase price will be
satisfied by TCIC's assumption of approximately $300 million of 
TeleCable's net liabilities and the issuance to TeleCable's 
shareholders of shares of TCI Class A Common Stock (currently
estimated to be approximately 42 million shares) and 1 million shares
of TCI Convertible Preferred Stock with an aggregate initial 
liquidation value of $300 million. Such preferred stock, which will
accrue dividends at a rate of 5.5% per annum, will be convertible into
10 million shares of TCI Class A Common Stock and will be redeemable
by TCI after (5) five years. Although the amount of net liabilities
to be assumed by TCIC and the number of TCI Class A Common shares to
be issued to TeleCable's shareholders are subject to closing
adjustments, the Company does not believe that any such adjustments
will be material. The merger agreement requires the approval of the
Company's shareholders and various franchise and government
authorities.

Report of Independent Accountants

February 4, 1994

The Stockholders and Directors
TeleCable Corporation and Subsidiaries

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and the related
consolidated statements of income and retained earnings and of cash flows
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of TeleCable
Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of TeleCable Corporation and its subsidiaries (the "Company").
Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to
conform with the current year presentation with no effect on previously
reported net income.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments, including
repurchase agreements, with an original maturity of three months or less
to be cash equivalents.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND DEPRECIATION

Property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and assets
acquired under capital leases, are recorded at cost and depreciated over
their estimated useful lives using accelerated and straight-line methods
for tax and financial reporting purposes, respectively. The asset cost
and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts
when assets are fully depreciated. The cost of cable television systems
constructed by the Company includes all costs and expenses, including, if
appropriate, capitalized interest incurred prior to receipt of the first
subscriber revenues from the system. From that time until completion of
construction, costs capitalized include all direct construction costs and
a portion of certain fixed operating expenses based on progress toward
achieving expected subscriber levels.

Maintenance, repairs and minor renewals are charged to operations. Major
renewals and betterments are capitalized.

Estimated lives used to compute depreciation are:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Distribution plant and other equipment 8 - 12 years
Building and improvements 8 - 25 years
Vehicles 5 years
</TABLE> 

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Costs associated with developing and acquiring cable television
franchises are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over
the expected life of the franchise, generally 8 to 15 years.

- 6 -
<PAGE> 17
Goodwill consists of acquisition costs in excess of the fair value of net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired (principally cable
television franchises and purchased minority interests). Goodwill is
being amortized over 40 years.

INCOME TAXES

On January 1, 1992, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard No. 109 (FAS 109), "Accounting for Income Taxes," which uses an
asset and liability method to recognize the deferred income tax effects
of transactions which are reported in different periods for financial
reporting and income tax return purposes. Under this approach, deferred
income tax balance sheet amounts are measured using currently enacted tax
rates. The deferred income tax provision is the difference between such
beginning and ending balance sheet amounts. Prior to the adoption of FAS
109, the Company used Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 96,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." This change in accounting principles did
not have a material effect on the Company's financial position or its
results of operations.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Earnings per share are calculated using the annual weighted average
number of common shares outstanding.

NOTE 2 - RETIREMENT PLANS

The Company sponsors an employee savings plan covering substantially all
employees. The Company contributes an amount which, when added to
forfeitures, equals fifty percent of employee contributions up to four
percent of compensation. The Company's contributions were $727,000 and
$675,000 for 1993 and 1992, respectively.

The Company also sponsors a defined benefit pension plan covering
substantially all employees. The plan provides retirement benefits to
eligible employees based primarily on years of service and career
compensation. The Company's annual funding policy is to contribute no
less than the minimum required by the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 and no more than the maximum which can be deducted under
relevant IRS regulations. Contributions to the plan reflect benefits
attributed to employees' services to date, as well as services expected
to be rendered in the future. At December 31, 1993 plan assets were
invested primarily in marketable securities.

For financial reporting purposes, pension expense was $632,000 and
$432,000 for 1993 and 1992, respectively, and was comprised of the
following:

Net pension liability included in other liabilities $1,661 $1,029

</TABLE>

The weighted average discount rate used to measure the projected benefit
obligation was reduced from 8% at December 31, 1992 to 7% at December 31,
1993. In addition, the rate of increase in future compensation levels
was reduced from 6.5% at December 31, 1992 to 4.5% at December 31, 1993.
The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on assets was 8.0%
for both 1993 and 1992.

The Company also sponsors a supplemental benefit plan which provides
supplemental retirement benefits on a nonqualified basis to certain
executives whose benefits under the pension plan are restricted by
various limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. Supplemental
benefit expense was $182,000 and $152,000 for 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

- 8 -
<PAGE> 19
On January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standard No.
106 "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions" which deals principally with employers' recognition of retiree
medical and life insurance benefit costs and obligations. The Company
recognized $122,000 of net periodic postretirement benefit cost in 1993
related to the accounting change. Adoption of this new standard had an
immaterial impact on the Company's financial position and results of
operations.

NOTE 3 - INCOME TAXES

The provision for income taxes consists of the following:

</TABLE>
Income taxes paid during the year were $24.4 million in 1993 and $18.2
million in 1992. Included in deferred income taxes and the provision for
income taxes as of and for the year ended December 31, 1993 is an
additional accrual of approximately $1.2 million to reflect the effect of
the 1993 increase in income tax rates on the temporary differences
existing at the date of enactment.

The provision for income taxes differs from the amount computed by
applying the statutory federal tax rate to income before income taxes as
follows:

------- ------- 

Net deferred tax liability $45,163 $45,382
======= =======

</TABLE>

The Internal Revenue Service has proposed tax adjustments for the years
1986 through 1989 in the approximate amount of $3,100,000. The IRS
challenged the investment tax credits (ITC) claimed on transitional
property under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, certain intangible allocations
of a 1988 acquisition, and the treatment of make-ready expenditures as
part of cable plant costs. The years 1990 and 1991 are also part of this
audit, but the IRS does not intend to propose adjustments until the
appeal for the prior years has been considered. Management believes that
its original filing position was correct and will file an appeals protest
of all issues in early 1994. Since 1985, the Company has recognized
$5,500,000 in net transitional ITC tax benefits and approximately
$1,000,000 in tax benefits for the amortization of the 1988 acquisition
intangibles being challenged.

NOTE 4 - ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from the Company's
subscribers for cable and related services and amounts due from
advertisers. During 1993, the Company ceased charging subscribers for
certain equipment which was not returned to the Company upon
disconnection of service. Since equipment charges were fully offset by a
provision for doubtful accounts, the change in policy resulted in a
significant decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts. The
components of accounts receivable and the related allowance consist of:

</TABLE>
The Company's remaining rights to provide cable and telecoms services
within the United Kingdom were sold in April and July 1993 for $3.9
million resulting in a gain of $2.2 million.

In January 1992, the Company sold its investment in QVC Network, Inc.
resulting in a gain of $1.2 million.

Other investments include marketable equity investments which are
recorded at a cost of $2.3 million and have a market value of $12.3
million at December 31, 1993. The remainder of other investments
consists primarily of equity investments for which a ready market does
not exist; however, management believes that the existing carrying value
approximates the fair value of such investments.

NOTE 6 - LONG-TERM DEBT

Long-term debt consists of the following:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
December 31,

---- ----

<S> <C> <C>

<PAGE> 22
(A) The Company issued privately-placed unsecured, medium-term notes in
1986, 1988 and 1991. The notes were issued at par in the aggregate
amount of $310 million with interest payable semi-annually at rates
ranging from 8.75% to 9.44%. Through December 31, 1993, the
Company has repaid $85 million. The Company intends to refinance
notes due in 1994 with either funds available under the revolving
credit agreements or a new term loan. The remaining note balances
mature as follows:

<TABLE>
<S> <C> <C> <C>
1994 $30 million 1997 $50 million
1995 $40 million 1998 $50 million
1996 $40 million 1999 $15 million
</TABLE>

The loan agreements contain restrictive provisions relating to
stock redemptions, dividend payments, total debt in relation to
cash flow, limitations on secured debt, and limitations regarding
certain sales, mergers and other transactions. Through December
31, 1993, the Company was in compliance with all such restrictive
provisions.

(B) The Company's unsecured revolving credit and term loan agreements
with four commercial banks provide $100 million of revolving credit
lines which mature in early 1997. The Company has the option to
convert revolving loans outstanding on the maturity dates into term
loans payable in six equal annual installments.

At the Company's option, loans bear interest tied to the bank prime
rate, the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the bank
Certificate of Deposit (CD) rate, or a rate agreed upon from time
to time between the Company and each bank. The rates can be fixed
for periods ranging from one day to one year and are subject to
certain adjustments at varying levels of debt in relation to
operating cash flow. The banks charge commitment fees ranging from
1/8% to 3/8% on the unused portion of the revolving credit lines.
The agreements contain restrictive provisions similar to those
described in (A) above.

(C) Other notes payable include amounts due for capital lease
obligations and sundry other notes.

Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the corporation for
loans with similar terms and average maturities, the fair value of term
notes payable approximated $234 million and $263 million at December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively. The carrying value of the Company's
revolving credit and term loan agreements at December 31, 1993 and 1992
approximated fair value.

The Company paid interest of $23.9 million in 1993 and $28.4 million in
1992.

<PAGE> 23
NOTE 7 - STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT

The Company has a capital deficit at December 31, 1993 and 1992 resulting
from a return of capital paid to stockholders in May, 1988.

Notes received in exchange for stock sold to employees are full recourse
notes and are shown in the accompanying balance sheet as a contra-equity
account. The notes bear interest ranging from 6.50% to 9.25%. The
interest rates on the notes receivable are established annually at rates
which approximate market.

NOTE 8 - COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Effective September 1, 1993, the Company adjusted subscriber rates to
comply with FCC standards issued to regulate such rates as contemplated
by the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992.
The Company's adjusted subscriber rates are subject to local and/or
federal governmental review. Management does not expect that rate
reviews will have an adverse impact on established rates.

TeleCable and its subsidiaries lease utility poles and certain other
facilities used in their operations. Total rent expense was $2.8 million
and $2.7 million in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

On December 31, 1993, TeleCable and its subsidiaries were committed under
non-cancelable operating leases which expire at various dates through
2069 and require the following minimum rents:

<TABLE>

Condensed Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements

June 30, 1994
(unaudited)

The following unaudited condensed pro forma combined balance sheet of
TCIC, dated as of June 30, 1994, assumes that (i) the proposed TeleCable Merger
and (ii) the combination of TCIC and Liberty Media Corporation ("Liberty"),
whereby TCIC and Liberty each became a wholly-owned subsidiary of TCI (the
"TCI/Liberty Mergers"), had occurred as of such date. See notes 1 and 2.

In addition, the following unaudited condensed pro forma combined
statements of operations of TCIC for the six months ended June 30, 1994 and the
year ended December 31, 1993 assume that the proposed TeleCable Merger and the 
TCI/Liberty Mergers (collectively the "Mergers") had occurred prior to 
January 1, 1993.

The unaudited pro forma results do not purport to be indicative of the
results of operations that would have been obtained if the Mergers had occurred
prior to January 1, 1993. These condensed pro forma combined financial 
statements of TCIC should be read in conjunction with the condensed pro forma 
financial statements and the related notes thereto of TCI and Liberty included 
elsewhere herein and the respective historical financial statements and the 
related notes thereto of TCIC and Liberty. The pro forma financial statements
of TCI represent a combination of the separate pro forma statements of TCIC and
Liberty in giving effect to the Mergers.

(1) As of August 8, 1994, TCI, TCIC and TeleCable entered into a
definitive merger agreement whereby TeleCable will be merged into
TCIC. The aggregate $1.6 billion purchase price will be satisfied by
TCIC's assumption of approximately $300 million of TeleCable's net
liabilities and the issuance to TeleCable's shareholders of shares of
TCI Class A common stock (currently estimated to be approximately 42
million shares) and 1 million shares of TCI Convertible Preferred 
Stock, Series D with an aggregate initial liquidation value of $300 
million. Such preferred stock, which will accrue dividends at a rate
of 5.5% per annum, will be convertible into 10 million shares of TCI 
Class A common stock and will be redeemable by TCI after five years. 
Although the amount of net liabilities to be assumed by TCIC and the 
number of TCI Class A common shares to be issued to TeleCable's 
shareholders are subject to closing adjustments, management does not 
believe that any such adjustments will be material. The merger 
agreement requires the approval of TeleCable's shareholders and 
various franchise and government authorities.

(2) The TCI/Liberty Mergers, which were consummated on August 4, 1994,
were structured as a tax free exchange whereby the common stock of Old
TCI and Liberty and the preferred stock of Liberty were exchanged for
like shares of TCI. The merger agreement provided that each share of
Old TCI's and Liberty's common stock (including shares held by Old
TCI's or Liberty's subsidiaries) would be converted into one share and
0.975 of a share, respectively, of the corresponding class of TCI's
common stock. Shares of Liberty Class E Preferred Stock were
converted into shares of a preferred stock of TCI having designations,
preferences, rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions
substantially identical to the shares of preferred stock being
converted. Shares of the remaining Liberty preferred stock held by
subsidiaries of Old TCI were converted into shares of a class or
series of TCI preferred stock having an equivalent value.

(3) Represents the conversion of Old TCI's investment in Liberty common
stock into an investment in TCI common stock and the conversion of Old
TCI's investment in Liberty preferred stock into an investment in TCI
preferred stock having an equivalent value. Such amount is reflected
as a reduction of stockholders' equity due to its related party
nature. Such conversion of shares is reflected at the carryover basis
of Old TCI's investment in Liberty. See note (2) above.

(4) Represents an allocation of the $1.6 billion purchase price of
TeleCable to its tangible and intangible assets. The cost
allocations were estimated using information available at the date of
preparation of these condensed pro forma combined financial statements
and will be adjusted upon final appraisal of the assets acquired. 
Therefore, the actual allocations may differ from those allocations
reflected herein.

(5) Represents the estimated incremental deferred income tax liability
associated with the TeleCable purchase price allocations, as described
in note (4) above. The adjustment assumes a combined federal and
state income tax rate of 41%.

(6) Represents the elimination of TeleCable's historical stockholders'
deficit, including the note receivable from the employee stock
purchase plan. Pursuant to the TeleCable Merger agreement, any
portion of such note receivable that remains unpaid at closing will
not be included in the calculation of net liabilities to be assumed
by TCIC at closing.

(7) Represents TCI's capital contribution to TCIC resulting from the 
issuance by TCI to TeleCable shareholders of shares of TCI Class A 
common stock (currently estimated to be approximately 42 million
shares) and 1 million shares of TCI Convertible Preferred Stock, 
Series D with an aggregate liquidation of $300 million. The number of
TCI Class A common shares to be issued, which will be calculated using
a per share value of $24, is dependent upon the amount of net 
liabilities of TeleCable that is assumed by TCIC at closing and 
certain other factors. See note (1) above.

(8) Reflects the reclassification to "Investment in TCI" of 79,335,038
shares of Old TCI Class A common stock held by subsidiaries of Old TCI
replaced with TCI common stock of the corresponding class. See note
(2) above.

(9) Represents depreciation and amortization of the allocated TeleCable
purchase price, based upon weighted average lives of 12-1/2 years for
property and equipment and 40 years for franchise costs. See note (4)
above.

(10) Reflects the elimination of Old TCI's share of Liberty's historical
earnings. See notes (2) and (3) above.

(11) Reflects the estimated income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments.

(12) Reflects the elimination of the preferred stock dividend requirement
on Old TCI preferred stock converted into common stock of Old TCI
during the year ended December 31, 1993.

The following unaudited condensed pro forma balance sheet of Liberty, 
as of June 30, 1994, assumes Liberty had changed its accounting for its
investment in QVC, Inc. ("QVC") to the cost method and that the sale by Liberty
of the 49.9% partnership interest in American Movie Classics Company ("AMC")
had occurred as of such date. Additionally, such balance sheet also assumes
that the TCI/Liberty Mergers, had occurred as of such date (see note 4).

In addition, the following unaudited condensed pro forma statements of
operations of Liberty for the six months ended June 30, 1994 and for the year
ended December 31, 1993 assume the following had occurred prior to January 1,
1993:

(a) the change in accounting for Liberty's investment in QVC to
the cost method,

(b) the sale by Liberty of its 49.9% partnership interest in AMC,

(c) the Recapitalization Agreement, as defined in note 10,

(d) the acquisition of 20 million shares of Class B common stock
of Home Shopping Network, Inc. ("HSN"),

(e) the Tender, as defined in note 11,

(f) the acquisition of all general and limited partnership
interests in Mile Hi Cablevision Associates, Ltd. ("Mile Hi")
as described in note 12,

(g) the conversion of all the outstanding shares (10,974 shares)
of Liberty's Class A Convertible Preferred Stock ("Class A
Preferred Stock") into 4,405,678 shares of Liberty Class A
common stock and 55,070 shares of Class E, 6% Cumulative
Redeemable Exchangeable Junior Preferred Stock ("Class E
Preferred Stock"), and

(h) the TCI/Liberty Mergers.

The unaudited pro forma results do not purport to be indicative of the
results of operations that would have been obtained if the foregoing events had
actually occurred prior to January 1, 1993. These condensed pro forma
financial statements of Liberty should be read in conjunction with the
condensed pro forma financial statements and related notes thereto of TCIC and
TCI included elsewhere herein and the respective historical financial
statements and the related notes thereto of Liberty and TCIC. The pro forma
financial statements of TCI represent a combination of the separate pro forma

June 30, 1994
(unaudited)

(1) On July 11, 1994, Rainbow Program Enterprises ("Rainbow") purchased a
49.9% general partnership interest in AMC from Liberty under the terms
of a buy/sell provision contained in the AMC partnership agreement.
In connection with the purchase, Rainbow acquired an option to
purchase the remaining 0.1% general partnership interest in AMC from
Liberty for $373,000. The proceeds of $180,249,000 included the
economic benefit of Liberty's consulting agreement with AMC assigned
by Liberty to Cablevision Systems Corporation, the parent company of
Rainbow.

(2) On November 11, 1993, Liberty entered into an agreement with the staff
of the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to which Liberty agreed to
divest all of its equity interests in QVC during an 18 month time
period if QVC was successful in its offer to buy Paramount
Communications, Inc. ("Paramount") and not to vote or otherwise
exercise or influence control over QVC until such time as QVC withdrew
its offer for Paramount. Simultaneously, Liberty agreed to withdraw
from a stockholders' agreement pursuant to which Liberty and certain
other stockholders exercised control over QVC (the "Stockholders'
Agreement"). On February 15, 1994, QVC terminated its offer for
Paramount. Upon termination of such offer, Liberty had the right to
be reinstated as a party to the Stockholders' Agreement so long as
such option was exercised within 90 days after such termination.

On November 16, 1993, Liberty sold 1,690,041 shares of common stock of
QVC to Comcast Corporation ("Comcast") for aggregate consideration of
approximately $31,461,000. The sale to Comcast reduced Liberty's
interest in QVC common stock (on a fully diluted basis) from 21.6% to
18.5%. Liberty continued to account for its investment in QVC under
the equity method, although it no longer exercised significant control
over such affiliate, due to the pending determination of whether the
Company would rejoin the control group under the Stockholders'
Agreement. As a result of the election on May 13, 1994 by Liberty to
forego the exercise of its option to be reinstated as a party to the
Stockholders' Agreement, Liberty began as of that date to account for
its investment in QVC under the cost method.

(3) Represents cash received from the sale of the 49.9% partnership
interest in AMC by Liberty, pursuant to the terms of the buy/sell
provision contained in the AMC partnership agreement (see note 1), and
the corresponding increase in investment in affiliates, payables and
accruals, and common stockholders' equity. Such increase in
investment in affiliates is due to a negative balance in Liberty's
carrying value due to distributions in excess of Liberty's basis in
such investment. The increase in payables and accruals represents the
estimated current income taxes payable on the sale. Increase in
deferred income taxes represents the reversal of the temporary
difference resulting from basis for income tax purposes in excess of
basis for financial statement purposes. The increase in common
stockholders' equity is due to the difference between Liberty's
carrying value of such investment and the purchase price of the same
reduced by the estimated income tax effect. Such gain ($183,208,000)
is not reflected in the pro forma combined statement of operations due
to its non-recurring nature.

(4) The TCI/Liberty Mergers, which were consummated on August 4, 1994,
were structured as a tax free exchange whereby the common stock of Old
TCI and Liberty and the preferred stock of Liberty were exchanged for
like shares of TCI. The merger agreement provided that each share of
Old TCI's and Liberty's common stock (including shares held by Old
TCI's or Liberty's subsidiaries) would be converted into one share and
0.975 of a share, respectively, of the corresponding class of TCI's
common stock. Shares of Liberty Class E Preferred Stock were
converted into shares of a preferred stock of TCI having designations,
preferences, rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions
substantially identical to the shares of preferred stock being
converted. Shares of the remaining Liberty preferred stock held by
subsidiaries of Old TCI were converted into shares of a class or
series of TCI preferred stock having an equivalent value. Adjustment
represents the conversion of Liberty's investment in Old TCI common
stock into an investment in TCI common stock. Such amount is
reflected as a reduction of stockholders' equity due to its related
party nature. Such conversion of shares is reflected at the carryover
basis of Liberty's investment in Old TCI.

(5) Reflects the elimination of the historical preferred stock of Liberty
held by Old TCI or its subsidiaries. Such historical preferred stock
of Liberty was converted into TCI preferred stock having an equivalent
value. See note 4.

(6) Elimination of share of earnings of QVC through May 13, 1994.

(7) Elimination of share of earnings of AMC.

(8) Estimated income tax effect of the pro forma adjustments.

(9) Reflects the elimination of the preferred stock dividend requirement
on Liberty preferred stock converted into preferred stock of TCI. See
note 4.

(10) On June 3, 1993, Liberty completed the transaction contemplated by the
Recapitalization Agreement entered into on March 26, 1993 with certain
subsidiaries of Old TCI (such transaction is included in the Liberty
historical column of the pro forma balance sheet). Pursuant to the
Recapitalization Agreement, Liberty purchased 100% of the outstanding
shares of its Class C Redeemable, Exchangeable Preferred Stock (the
"Class C Preferred Stock") and 927,900 shares of its Class A common
stock. Liberty paid a purchase price of approximately $175 million
for the Class C Preferred Stock and approximately $19 million for the
Class A common stock. The aggregate purchase price of approximately
$194 million was satisfied by delivery of $12 million in cash and four
promissory notes totaling $182 million. In the accompanying unaudited
condensed pro forma statements of operations, the preferred stock
dividend requirement on such purchased preferred stock has been
eliminated.

(11) On February 11, 1993, Liberty acquired from RMS Limited Partnership
20,000,000 shares of Class B common stock (the "Class B Stock") of HSN
for an aggregate purchase price of $58 million in cash and 8,000,000
shares of the Class A common stock of Liberty. Additionally, on June
1, 1993, Liberty completed the purchase of approximately 16 million
shares of the common stock ("Common Stock") of HSN at a price of $7.00
per share (the "Tender"). In addition, Liberty had acquired Common
Stock of HSN previous to the acquisition of the Class B Stock (such
transactions are included in the Liberty historical column of the pro
forma balance sheet).

(12) On March 15, 1993, Mile Hi Cable Partners, L.P. ("New Mile Hi")
completed the acquisition (the "Acquisition") of all the general and
limited partnership interests in Mile Hi, the owner of the cable
television system serving Denver, Colorado (such acquisition is
included in the Liberty historical column of the pro forma balance
sheet). New Mile Hi is a limited partnership formed among Community
Cable Television ("CCT") (78% limited partnership interest), Daniels
Communications, Inc. ("DCI") (1% limited partnership interest) and P &
B Johnson Corp. (21% general partnership interest), a corporation
controlled by Robert L. Johnson, a member of the Board of Directors of
Liberty. CCT is a general partnership in which a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Liberty is a 50.001% partner and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of TCIC is a 49.999% partner. New Mile Hi is a
consolidated subsidiary of Liberty for financial reporting purposes.

Prior to the Acquisition, Liberty, through a wholly-owned subsidiary,
indirectly owned a 32.175% interest in Mile Hi through its ownership
of a limited partnership interest in Daniels & Associates Partners
Limited ("DAPL"), one of Mile Hi's general partners.

DAPL was liquidated on March 12, 1993, at which time a subsidiary of
Liberty (and partner in DAPL) received a liquidating distribution
consisting of a portion of DAPL's partnership interest in Mile Hi
representing the 32.175% interest in Mile Hi and a loan receivable of
approximately $50 million (the "Mile Hi Note").

Of the $110 million in cash required by New Mile Hi to complete the
transaction, $105 million was loaned to New Mile Hi by CCT and $5
million was provided by Mr. Johnson's corporation as a capital
contribution to New Mile Hi. Of the $5 million contributed by Mr.
Johnson's corporation, approximately $4 million was provided by CCT
through loans to Mr. Johnson and trusts for the benefit of his
children. CCT funded its loans to New Mile Hi and the Johnson
interests by drawing down $93 million under its revolving credit
facility and by borrowing $16 million from TCIC in the form of a
subordinated note.

(13) Depreciation and amortization of the purchase price of Mile Hi and HSN
allocated to its tangible and intangible assets are based upon
weighted average lives of 12-1/2 years for tangible assets, 30 years
for intangible assets and 40 years for franchise costs.

(14) Represents interest on borrowings to finance the cash portion of the
consideration for the acquisition of the partnership interests in Mile
Hi and the interest on the promissory notes delivered to Old TCI
pursuant to the Recapitalization Agreement (see note 10). Interest on
the borrowings for the Mile Hi acquisition is calculated at the
weighted average rate of 6% in effect for the year ended December 31,
1993.

(15) Reflects the reduction in interest expense arising from the assumed
repayment of Mile Hi debt at January 1, 1993 and the elimination of
the intercompany interest expense recorded by Mile Hi on its debt to
CCT.

(16) Elimination of share of losses of Mile Hi through March 15, 1993.

(17) Represents the interest income on the loan to a minority partner (see

(18) Represents the minority partners' 22% interest in the pro forma losses
of Mile Hi adjusted for the effects of the Acquisition (see note 12).

Notes to Condensed Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements

June 30, 1994
(unaudited)

(1) As of August 8, 1994, TCI, TCIC and TeleCable entered into a 
definitive merger agreement whereby TeleCable will be merged into 
TCIC. The aggregate $1.6 billion purchase price will be satisfied by 
TCIC's assumption of approximately $300 million of TeleCable's net 
liabilities and the issuance to TeleCable's shareholders of shares of
TCI Class A common stock (currently estimated to be approximately 42 
million shares) and 1 million shares of TCI Convertible Preferred 
Stock, Series D with an aggregate initial liquidation value of $300 
million. Such preferred stock, which will accrue dividends at a rate 
of 5.5% per annum, will be convertible into 10 million shares of TCI 
Class A common stock and will be redeemable by TCI after five years. 
Although the amount of net liabilities to be assumed by TCIC and the 
number of TCI Class A common shares to be issued to TeleCable's 
shareholders are subject to closing adjustments, management does not 
believe that any such adjustments will be material. The merger 
agreement requires the approval of TeleCable's shareholders and 
various franchise and government authorities.

(2) The TCI/Liberty Mergers, which were consummated on August 4, 1994,
were structured as a tax free exchange whereby the common stock of Old
TCI and Liberty and the preferred stock of Liberty were exchanged for
like shares of TCI. The merger agreement provided that each share of
Old TCI's and Liberty's common stock (including shares held by Old
TCI's or Liberty's subsidiaries) would be converted into one share and
0.975 of a share, respectively, of the corresponding class of TCI's
common stock. Shares of Liberty Class E Preferred Stock were
converted into shares of a preferred stock of TCI having designations,
preferences, rights and qualifications, limitations and restrictions
substantially identical to the shares of preferred stock being
converted. Shares of the remaining Liberty preferred stock held by
subsidiaries of Old TCI were converted into shares of a class or
series of TCI preferred stock having an equivalent value.

(3) Represents the elimination of intercompany indebtedness between TCIC
and Liberty. See note (2) above.

(4) Represents the elimination of TCIC's minority interest in the equity
of a consolidated subsidiary of Liberty. See note (2) above.

(5) Represents the reclassification to treasury stock of shares of TCI
held by TCIC, Liberty or their respective subsidiaries previously
reflected as "Investment in TCI". All preferred stock of TCI held by 
TCIC or its subsidiaries (also reflected in the TCIC pro forma 
financial information as "Investment in TCI") has been eliminated in 
consolidation with TCI. See note (2) above.

(6) Represents the elimination of temporary differences associated with
TCIC's and Liberty's investments in TCI preferred and common stock.
See note (2) above.

(7) Represents the issuance to TeleCable shareholders of TCI Convertible
Preferred Stock, Series D and Class A common stock in connection with 
the TeleCable Merger.

(8) Reflects the net conversion of Old TCI and Liberty common stock held
other than by Old TCI, Liberty or their subsidiaries, at the exchange
ratios described in note 2, into like shares of TCI.

(9) Represents the elimination of intercompany revenue and operating
expenses between TCIC and Liberty arising from the sale of certain
cable television programming to their respective cable television
subscribers. See note (2) above.

(10) Represents the elimination of interest on intercompany indebtedness
between TCIC and Liberty. See note (2) above.

(11) Represents the dividend requirements on TCI's (i) Convertible
Preferred Stock, Series D (to be issued in connection with the
TeleCable Merger - see note 1) and Class B, 6% Cumulative Redeemable
Exchangeable Junior Preferred Stock (issued in connection with the
TCI/Liberty Mergers - see note 2).

(12) Amount not eliminated for pro forma purposes as a reserve for an
impairment would have been required (based upon fair market value of
underlying asset) equal to the loss recognized by Liberty. See note
(2) above.

(13) Reflects primary and fully diluted earnings per common and common
equivalent share based upon 652,017,732 weighted average shares. Such
amount is calculated utilizing (i) 492,134,730 weighted average shares
of Old TCI at June 30, 1994 (such amount representing Old TCI's
weighted average shares, as disclosed in its historical financial
statements) reduced by 6,525,721 shares of Old TCI common stock
previously held by Liberty (ii) 127,799,557 weighted average shares of
Liberty at June 30, 1994 (such amount representing Liberty's weighted
average shares, as disclosed in its historical financial statements,
adjusted by 0.975 of a share) reduced by 3,390,834 shares of Liberty
common stock (as adjusted by 0.975 of a share) previously held by Old
TCI and (iii) 42,000,000 shares of TCI Class A common stock to be
issued in connection with the TeleCable Merger. Shares issuable upon
conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock, Series D (see note 1)
have not been included in the computation of weighted average shares
outstanding for the six months ended June 30, 1994 because their
inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

(14) Reflects loss per common share based upon 592,232,340 weighted average
shares. Such amount is calculated utilizing (i) 432,566,150 weighted 
average shares of Old TCI at December 31, 1993 (such amount 
representing Old TCI's weighted average shares, as disclosed in its 
historical financial statements) reduced by 6,525,721 shares of Old 
TCI common stock previously held by Liberty (ii) 127,582,745 weighted
averages shares of Liberty at December 31, 1993 (such amount 
representing Liberty's weighted average shares, as disclosed in its 
historical financial statements, shares of Liberty common stock issued
in the HSN merger and Liberty common stock repurchased from Old TCI 
in 1993, all of which have been adjusted by 0.975 of a share) reduced 
by 3,390,834 shares of Liberty common stock (as adjusted by 0.975 of 
a share) previously held by Old TCI and (iii) 42,000,000 shares of 
TCI Class A common stock to be issued in connection with the TeleCable
Merger. Shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Preferred 
Stock, Series D (see note 1) have not been included in the computation
of weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended December 31,
1993 because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.
