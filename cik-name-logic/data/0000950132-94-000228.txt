MELLON ANNOUNCES DIVIDEND INCREASE AND THREE-FOR-TWO STOCK SPLIT

PITTSBURGH, Sept. 20, 1994 -- The board of directors of Mellon Bank

The three-for-two stock split is being structured as a special
stock dividend of one additional share of common stock being paid

additional shares resulting from the split will be distributed on
