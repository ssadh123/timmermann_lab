NOTES TO SUMMARY OF REVENUES AND CERTAIN RENTAL EXPENSES

The summaries of revenues and certain rental expenses reflect the
operations of Griffin Crossing Apartments, Regatta Shores Apartments,
Clear Run Apartments, Alexander Glen Apartments, Hampton Greene Apartments
and Santa Barbara Landing Apartments (the "Properties") for the year ended
December 31, 1993 based upon the audited statement of rental operations of
the properties appearing elsewhere herein and for the six month period ended
June 30, 1994 based upon the unaudited combined statements of rental
operations of the properties through the date on which it was acquired.
During 1993 and a portion of 1994, the properties were owned and operated by an
entity other than United Dominion Realty Trust (the "Trust").

The summaries have been prepared on the accrual method of accounting.
Rental expenses include repair and maintenance expenses, utilities, real
estate taxes, insurance and certain other expenses. In accordance with
the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, mortgage interest
expenses, depreciation, and general and administrative costs have been
excluded from operating expenses, as they are dependent upon a particular
owner, purchase price or financial arrangement.

In assessing the properties, management considered the existing and
potential tenant base, expected job growth in the area, occupancy rates, the
competitive nature of the market and comparative rental rates. Furthermore,
current and anticipated maintenance and repair costs, real estate taxes and
anticipated capital improvements were assessed.
