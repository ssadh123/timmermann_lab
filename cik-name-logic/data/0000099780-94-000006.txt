Item 5. Other Events.

On May 19, 1994, the Jury in Morris-Diesel, Inc. v. Mosher
Steel Company (a former subsidiary), the Registrant and Aetna
Insurance Company in Cause No. 84 Civ. 5791 (LAP) in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York awarded
judgment against Mosher, the Registrant and Aetna in the amount of
$25,775,933 plus statutory interest from September 1985.

The suit arose out of a contract entered into between Mosher
and Morris-Diesel for the fabrication and erection of structural
steel in the construction of the Marriott Marquis Hotel at Time
Square, New York City, New York, New York. In August 1984, Morris-
Diesel commenced the action for alleged damages caused by Mosher's
and its erection subcontractor's performance of the structural
steel contract. Aetna Insurance Company is the bonding company for
Mosher and Registrant on the contract.

The Registrant has been advised by legal counsel that there
remain substantial defenses and remedies and intends to pursue all
available avenues in the post trial and appellate review processes. 
The Registrant has not engaged in the fabrication of structural
steel for multi-story buildings since 1989.
