ITEM 5: OTHER EVENTS

Beginning on August 25, 1994, Ames will distribute, to its
banks and other lenders, principal trade vendors and
factors, summaries of its unaudited financial results for
the four and twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 1994. These
monthly and year-to-date results (collectively, the
"monthly results") are attached hereto as Exhibit 20 and
are incorporated by reference herein. 
Compared with the projections contained in the Form 8-K
dated May 27, 1994 (referred to herein as the "Plan"),
sales for the four weeks ended July 30, 1994 were $4.6
million less than Plan and EBITDA (as defined in Exhibit
20) was $.6 million worse than Plan. In July, the
unfavorable sales variance was primarily due to sales
shortfalls in apparel and convenience goods. July's gross
margin rate was also less than Plan due primarily to
higher-than-planned advertising and clearance markdowns,
particularly in apparel. The unfavorable impact on July's
EBITDA from the lower-than- planned sales and gross margin
rate was partially offset by lower-than- planned expenses
and a gain on the sale of certain property. Store, field
and home office expenses were all less than Plan in July.

Sales for the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 1994 were
$12.1 million less than Plan; however, EBITDA was $.2
million better than Plan. The major portion of the year-
to-date unfavorable sales variance was in apparel and
convenience goods. The lower year-to-date gross margin
rate was due to higher-than-planned advertising
markdowns.The unfavorable impact on the year-to-date EBITDA
from the lower-than-planned sales and gross margin rate was
more than offset by lower-than-planned expenses and higher-
than-planned gains on property sales. Year-to-date store,
field and home office expenses were all less than Plan.

As of July 30, 1994, LIFO inventories were $4.7 million
greater than Plan, primarily in hardline categories. Trade
payables were $18.5 million greater than Plan due primarily
to improved payment terms. Outstanding borrowings under
the Company's new revolving line of credit as of July 30,
1994 were $18.6 million less than Plan due primarily to the
better-than- planned trade payable terms. 

Ames is distributing the monthly results to its banks and
other lenders, principal trade vendors and factors to
facilitate their credit analyses. The summary results
SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE and should 

Page 2 of 7
<PAGE>
be read in conjunction with the Company's Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended January 29, 1994, the Company's Form 10-Q
for the first fiscal quarter ended April 30, 1994, the
Company's Form 8-K dated May 27, 1994, and the Company's
Form 10-Q to be filed for the second fiscal quarter ended
July 30, 1994. The monthly results are being reported
publicly solely because they are being distributed to a
large number of the Company's vendors for purposes of their
credit analyses.

During the pendency of its reorganization case, Ames
disclosed publicly its monthly results through filings with
the Office of the U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee and continued to
report publicly its monthly results during the fiscal year
ended January 29, 1994. Although Ames expects to continue
to make its monthly results public for the fiscal year
ending January 28, 1995, Ames does not believe it is
obligated to provide such information indefinitely, other
than as required by applicable regulations, and Ames may
cease making such disclosures and updates at any time. The
monthly results were not examined, reviewed or compiled by
Ames' independent certified public accountants. Moreover,
Ames does not believe that it is obligated to update the
monthly results to reflect subsequent events or
developments. The reported monthly results are subject to
future adjustments, if any, that could materially affect
such results. However, in the opinion of the Company, the
monthly results contain all adjustments (consisting of
normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair
statement of the results for the periods presented.
