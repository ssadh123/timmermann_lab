INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On April 20, 1994, CBT Corporation (the "Company") reported net income of
$2.1 million for the quarter ended March 31, 1994. Net income per common share
was $0.77 and return on equity was 12.70% for the quarter. Return on assets
for the period was 1.44%. After adjusting first quarter 1993 results for a
significant non-recurring gain, first quarter 1994 net income represented a
12.4% increase and a $0.12 improvement in net income per common share. Return
on equity and return on assets for the first quarter of 1994 exceeded the
adjusted 1993 marks by .36% and .40%, respectively. The 1993 results have been
restated to include Pennyrile Bancshares, acquired on November 30, 1993 in a
pooling-of-interests transaction.

Average earnings assets increased 11% over 1993 while net interest margin
held steady at 5.11%, resulting in a $712 thousand increase in tax-equivalent
net interest income. Continued sterling credit quality allowed a prudent 20%
reduction in the provision for credit losses for the period. Allowance
coverage of non-performing assets improved to 618%, in spite of the provision
reduction.

Core fee income growth of 6.3% was masked by the timing of cash-based fees
in various trust products. Other significant fee categories posted 20 to 30%
increases over 1993 as the Company continues to emphasize fee-based financial
services.

Non-interest expenses increased 10.7% over 1993. Excluding additional
holding company expenses related to acquisition activity, the increase was
8.2%. Increases were experienced in all major categories and were related
primarily to growth in core businesses.

Financial highlights and comparative consolidated balance sheets and
income statements are set out below.
