STANLEY REPORTS IMPROVED FIRST QUARTER SALES AND EARNINGS 

New Britain, Connecticut...The Stanley Works announced today improve-
ments in first quarter sales and earnings. Richard H. Ayers, 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, noted, "First quarter sales of 
$586 million were the highest first quarter sales ever experienced by 
Stanley and represented a 6% increase over the prior year. Net 
earnings of $26 million represented an 11% increase over first 
quarter 1993 and was slightly higher than the record set in the first 
quarter 1989. These improvements are the result not only of 
strengthening markets, but of our continued focus on operational 
excellence." 

Net sales growth was generated primarily by unit volume increases, 
the most significant of which was in the U.S. Only minor price 
increases were realized increasing sales by 1%; however, this 
increase was offset by the negative effects of currency. The incre-
mental effect of acquisitions increased sales by an additional 1%. 

First quarter earnings per share of $.57 represented a 12% increase 
over comparable earnings per share of $.51 reported in 1993. The 
$.51 per share reported for 1993 excludes the effects of the 
accounting change for FAS 112. 

Gross margins improved to 32.7% from 32.3% in the prior year quarter. 
The improvement in margins was even more notable when compared with 
31.2% reported in the fourth quarter 1993. Manufacturing effi-
ciencies achieved from increased volume, especially in our Mechanics 
Tools division, were principally responsible for the improvement. 
Operating expenses were also reduced, as a percent of sales, to 22.8% 
compared with 23.5% in the first quarter 1993. 

Interest-net expenses of $7 million were 1.3% of first quarter sales, 
generally consistent with the prior year. Other-net expenses for the 
period were $9 million compared with $4 million in the same quarter a 
year ago. Included in Other-net in 1993 was a pretax gain of $24 
million ($.33 per share) from the sale of a non-operating asset and 
charges of $22.7 million ($.31 per share) for contingency reserves. 

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS Net sales in the U.S. were up 6%, principally from 
internal growth. The U.S. industrial, engineered and construction 
markets continued to exhibit strong growth. Price increases of 1% 
were offset by the net incremental effects of acquisitions and 
divestitures. 

Net sales in Europe for the first quarter were 6% higher than last 
year, reflecting a 3% unit volume increase primarily within the 
consumer tools businesses. Recent acquisitions increased sales by 
5%. Minor price increases added 1% to sales, while the currency 
effects of a stronger dollar decreased sales by 3%.<PAGE>

<PAGE>
Net sales in Other Areas increased 5% for the quarter compared with 
the same period a year ago. Strong internal growth in the Pacific 
Rim more than offset continued weakness in Canada and Australia and 
resulted in a net 3% increase in unit sales. In addition, the 
incremental effect of acquisitions increased sales by 3%. The net 
effect of currency and price was a 1% decrease in sales. Operating 
profits of $6 million were lower than the prior year as a result of 
the integration costs associated with a recent acquisition. 

SEGMENTS Net sales in the Tools segment increased 6% for the quarter 
primarily the result of internal growth in our industrial and 
engineered tools categories. Consumer tool businesses continued to 
experience only modest growth. Price increases of 1% were offset by 
the negative effects of currency. The incremental effect of 
acquisitions added 1% to sales. Operating profits increased 28% from 
the first quarter 1993 to $48 million. Operating profits reported in 
1993 included approximately $4 million of restructuring charges. 
Operating margins of 11% were much improved over prior year margins 
reported of 9.1% (10.0% without the one-time charges). 

Hardware segment net sales were 2% lower than first quarter sales 
reported a year ago. Unit volume declined by 2% and was the result 
of weak consumer activity in Canada and Europe and, to a lesser 
extent, in the U.S. Net price increases of 1% were offset by the 
negative effects of currency. Operating profits of $9 million 
included costs associated with an earthquake that damaged our 
Chatsworth, California mirror manufacturing facility. Operating 
margins of 11.5% would have been 13.2% excluding the incurred 
property losses related to the earthquake. Operating margins in the 
first quarter 1993 were 13.6%. 

Specialty Hardware sales for the first quarter 1994 were 13% higher 
than the first quarter of 1993. The gain was almost entirely the 
result of higher unit volume in the U.S. Operating margins, which 
are generally lower in the first quarter for this segment, were 4.7%, 
representing a significant improvement over margins of 1.2% reported 
last year. Prior year margins were depressed due to raw material 
cost increases, especially in wood, and manufacturing process 
problems. 

OUTLOOK We consider the first quarter results to be early 
confirmation that our optimism for 1994 is well founded. Strength in 
the industrial and construction markets in the U.S. should continue 
to contribute to our results. We expect improving conditions in our 
consumer markets as the year progresses assuming that the interest 
rate environment remains favorable for homeowners and consumers. We 
continue to feel positive about the outlook for 1994.
