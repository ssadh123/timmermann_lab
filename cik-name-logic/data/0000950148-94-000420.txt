THE TRUST

Section 2.1 Name

The Trust shall be designated as THE PEREGRINE REAL ESTATE TRUST in
which name the Trustees may conduct business; make and execute deeds,
mortgages, leases, contracts, and other instruments; acquire, mortgage, lease,
convey, and transfer real estate and other property; and sue and be sued.
Insofar as may be practicable, the business of the Trust shall be conducted and
transacted in the name of the Trust.

Section 2.2 Principal Office

The principal office of the Trust shall be located at 1300 Ethan Way,
Sacramento, California 95825, or at such other places as the Trustees may
designate. The Trustees may also establish branch offices in such other places
as they may determine.

Section 2.3 Purpose

The purpose of the Trust shall be to conduct its business in such a
manner so that the Trust qualifies as a "real estate investment trust" as
defined in Section 856 of the Code. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, if
circumstances arise in which the Trustees shall deem it advisable to take any
action inconsistent with such purpose, they shall have the power to do so.
Failure of the Trust to qualify under the foregoing statute shall not in any
manner whatsoever invalidate the Trust nor cause the termination of its term.

Section 2.4 Investment Objective

The Trustees may invest assets of the Trust pursuant to the powers
granted them in Article 3 hereof. The primary investment objective of the
Trust shall be to invest in income-producing real estate and related interests,
principally, but not limited to, office buildings, shopping centers, industrial
and commercial buildings, hotels, apartment houses, and motels.

Section 2.5 Qualification as "Real Estate Investment Trust"

So long as the Trustees deem it advisable to establish and maintain
the qualification of the Trust as a "real estate investment trust" for federal
income tax purposes, the Trustees shall use their best efforts to preserve such
qualification. In so doing, the Trustees will be protected in relying on the
written advice and opinions of their duly selected lawyers and accountants

16
<PAGE> 10
and upon facts as represented to them in writing by any Shareholder, Trustee, or
independent contractor of the Trust. Should the Trust fail or cease to qualify
at any such time, the Trustees shall incur no liability to the Shareholders by
reason of this event to the extent that their actions were based upon such
advice or opinions or such representations. To the extent that their actions
were not so based, they shall incur liability to the Shareholders only to the
extent that their acts or omissions constitute bad faith, wilful misfeasance,
gross negligence, or reckless disregard of duties.

Section 2.6 No Partnership Relationship

Nothing contained herein or in any share certificate, and no act done
or any writing or agreement made during the continuance of the Trust, shall be
construed as, or have the effect of constituting the Trustees, the
Shareholders, or any of them or any other person, copartners or otherwise
members of any association.

Section 2.7 Third-Party Reliance

Any act done by the Trustees or under their authority shall, as to
third parties dealing in good faith with the Trust, be conclusively deemed to
be within the purposes of the Trust and within the powers and authority of the
person or person acting.

Section 2.8 Nonliability and Indemnification of Shareholders

All persons dealing with or having any claim against the Trustees or
any officer, agent or employee of the Trust shall look only to the Trust for
the payment of any debt, claim, obligation or damages, or of any money or
other thing that might become due or payable in any way, whether founded upon
contract, tort, or otherwise, and no Shareholder shall be personally or
individually liable therefor. Every written contract to which the Trust is a
party shall include a provision that the Shareholders not be personally liable
thereon. The Trustees shall maintain adequate liability insurance for the
protection of the Trust and those connected therewith. Each Shareholder shall
be entitled to pro rata indemnity from the Trust's assets if, contrary to the
provisions hereof, such shareholder is held personally liable for any
obligation of the Trust.

Section 2.9 Responsibility of Trust Agents

No Trustee, officer, employee or agent of the Trust shall be liable to
the Trust or to any other person for any act or omission except for his own
willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of duty
or his failure to act in good faith in the reasonable belief that his actions
are in the best interests of the Trust. The Trustees, officers, employees and
agents of the Trust in incurring any debts, liabilities or obligations, or in
taking or omitting any other action for or in connection with the

17
<PAGE> 11
Trust are, and shall be deemed to be, acting as Trustees, officers, employees
or agents of the Trust and not in their own individual capacities. 
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, no Trustee, officer, employee or
agent of the Trust shall be liable for any debt, claim, demand, judgment,
decree, liability or obligation of any kind in tort, contract or otherwise of,
against or with respect to the Trust arising out of any action taken or omitted
for or on behalf of the Trust, and the Trust shall be solely liable therefor
and resort shall be had solely to the assets of the Trust for the payment or
performance thereof. The Trustees shall obtain at the expense of the Trust and
shall file with the Trust and maintain thereafter a good and sufficient 
fidelity bond, by a corporate surety qualified to do business in California.

Section 2.10 Indemnification

Any person made a party to any action, suit or proceeding or against
whom a claim or liability is asserted by reason of the fact that he, his
testator or intestate was or is a Trustee, officer, employee or agent of the
Trust or active in such capacity on behalf of the Trust shall be indemnified
and held harmless by the Trust against judgments, fines, amounts paid on
account thereof (whether in settlement or otherwise) and reasonable expenses,
including attorneys' fees, actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection with the defense of such action, suit or proceeding or in connection
with any appeal therein, whether or not the same proceeds to judgment or is
settled or otherwise brought to a conclusion. Notwithstanding the above, no
person shall be so indemnified or reimbursed for any claim, obligation or
liability which shall have been adjudicated, or, in case of settlement, which
in the opinion of counsel for the Trust would, if adjudicated, have likely been
adjudicated to have arisen out of or been based upon such person's willful
misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of duty or for
his failure to act in good faith in the reasonable belief that his action was
in the best interests of the Trust. Any person seeking indemnification under
this provision must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Trustees that such
person (1) gave prompt notice to the Trust of the claim, alleged liability,
action, suit or proceeding, and (2) has executed such documents, and taken such
action as to permit the Trust to conduct the defense or settlement of any such
claim, alleged liability, action, suit or proceeding. Such rights of
indemnification and reimbursement shall be satisfied only out of the assets of
the Trust.

The rights accruing to any person under these provisions shall not
exclude any other right to which he may be lawfully entitled, nor shall
anything contained herein restrict the right of the Trust to indemnify or
reimburse such person in any proper case even though not specifically provided
for herein, nor shall anything contained herein restrict such rights of a
Trustee to contribution as may be available under applicable law. The Trustees
may make advance payments in connection with indemnification under this section
provided that the indemnified person shall have given a

18
<PAGE> 12
written undertaking to reimburse the Trust in the event it is subsequently
determined that he is not entitled to such indemnification. For purposes of
this section, any investment advisor, investment manager or independent
property manager of the Trust shall be considered an agent of the Trust.

In order to carry out the intent and purposes of this section, the
Trust shall have the power to enter into individual indemnification agreements
with any person or entity entitled to be indemnified under this section,
without specific approval thereof by the Shareholders of the Trust, provided
that the substantive provisions of any such agreement shall be consistent in
all material respects with the provisions of this section at the time such
agreement is entered into. The terms of any such agreement need not be
identical to the terms of any other such agreement and any such agreement which
has been entered into may subsequently be amended or changed by mutual
agreement of the parties thereto, without specific approval thereof by the
Shareholders of the Trust, so long as at the time such agreement is entered
into or amended or changed, as the case may be, its substantive provisions are
consistent in all material respects with the provisions of this section.

The Trust shall have the power to use the assets of the Trust to
establish arrangements for funding its indemnification obligations under this
section, including but not limited to depositing assets in trust funds,
obtaining bank letters of credit in favor of indemnified persons or entities,
purchasing policies of insurance or establishing specific reserve accounts and
otherwise funding special self-insurance arrangements for these purposes.

Section 2.11 Notice to Trust Agents

No notice to the Trustees or any officer of the Trust shall be
effective for any purpose unless given in writing, and until the same is
received.

Section 2.12 Notice by Trust Agents

Any notice required or permitted by this Declaration or by law to be
given by the Trustees or by any officer or authorized agent of the Trust, shall
be conclusively deemed to have been given when such notice is enclosed in an
envelope addressed to the proper person at the last address shown in the
records of the Trust, and such envelope is deposited in the United States mail,
postage prepaid; and the date of mailing shall be deemed the date such notice
is given. All distributions from Trust assets may be made by mailing the same
in like manner.

Section 2.13 Representations and Guarantees

No officer, agent, representative or employee of the Trust or of the
Trustees, nor anybody other than the Trustees, has authority to make any
representations or guarantees concerning the Trust; nor

19
<PAGE> 13
shall any Trustee or officer of the Trust be responsible for or with respect to
the validity or sufficiency of the Trust or of the share certificates issued
hereunder; nor has any such officer, agent, representative, employee or other
person any authority to change the terms and conditions of the Trust or any
certificates issued hereunder, or to bind the Trust or its agents by any
representation, statement, agreement or interpretation, written or oral, not
contained herein or in such certificate.

Section 2.14 Merger

As provided in California Corporations Code Section 23006, the Trust
is hereby specifically authorized to merge with one or more real estate
investment trusts, with any participating trust as the surviving trust,
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 2.14. The trustees of each trust
which desires to merge shall approve an agreement of merger. The constituent
trusts shall be parties to the agreement of merger and other persons may be
parties to the agreement of merger. The agreement shall state all of the
following:

2.14.1 The terms and conditions of the merger.

2.14.2 The amendments to the declaration of trust of the
surviving trust to be effected by the merger, if any; if any amendment changes
the name of the surviving trust the new name may be the same as or similar to
the name of a disappearing trust subject to Corporations Code Section 201(b).

2.14.3 The name and place of organization of each
constituent trust and which of the constituent trusts is the surviving trust.

2.14.4 The manner of converting the shares of each of the
constituent trusts into shares or other securities of the surviving trust and,
if any shares of any of the constituent trusts are not to be converted solely
into shares or other securities of the surviving trust, the cash, property,
rights, or securities of any entity which the holders of those shares are to
receive in exchange for the shares, which cash, property, rights or securities
of any entity may be in addition to or in lieu of shares or other securities
of the surviving trust, or that the shares are canceled without consideration.

2.14.5 Such other details or provisions as are desired, if
any, including, without limitation, a provision for the payment of cash in lieu
of fractional shares or for any other arrangements with respect thereto
consistent with the provisions of Corporations Code Section 407 relating to
fractional shares.

Each share of the same class or series of any constituent
trust (other than the cancellation of shares held by a constituent trust in
another constituent trust) shall, unless all shareholders of the class or
series consent and except as provided in

20
<PAGE> 14
corporations Code Section 407, be treated equally with respect to any
distribution of cash, property, rights or securities.

ARTICLE III.

THE TRUSTEES

Section 3.1 Trustees' General Authority

Except as in this Declaration expressly otherwise provided, the
business, affairs and assets of the Trust shall be entrusted to the exclusive
management and control of the Trustees. The Trustees shall exercise their
powers hereunder in good faith and for the exclusive benefit of the
shareholders.

Section 3.2 Action as Board

In managing the business, affairs and assets of the Trust, the
Trustees shall act as a Board of Trustees. One member of the Board shall be
designated to serve as Chairman of the Board for such term as the Board fixes.
The full Board shall not be less than five nor more than thirteen, the number
to be established by resolution of the Board from time to time, subject to
Section 3.3.3. Ownership of all Trust assets, legal, equitable or both, shall
be vested jointly in those Trustees in office at any time. A successor Trustee
shall succeed immediately upon accepting office to the interest of his
predecessor, without the necessity of any transfer or conveyance.

Section 3.3 Independence and Term of Trustees

3.3.1 A majority of the Trustees shall not be an affiliate
or associate of the investment manager or advisor of the Trust or with any
person who is an affiliate or associate of such investment manager or advisor.
The terms "affiliate" and "associate" shall have the meaning assigned to them
in Rule 12b-2 under the 1934 Act; provided, that a person shall not be deemed
to be an affiliate or associate of any other person solely by reason of being a
Trustee or officer of the Trust.

3.3.2 Subject to the terms of Sections 3.3.3 and 5.2.4.3,
relating to voting rights of the Preferred Shares, and Section 8.8.4, relating
to cumulative voting for Trustees, Trustees shall be elected by a vote of a
majority of the Common Shares represented in person or by proxy at the annual
meeting of Shareholders. Subject to the terms of Sections 3.4 and 3.5, each
Trustee so elected shall serve until his term of office expires and until the
election and qualification of his successor. Each Trustee shall qualify
following his election, whether by the Shareholders or by the remaining
Trustees, by filing a notice of acceptance with the Trustees. The secretary of
the Trust and the Chairman of the Trustees shall, from time to time when
necessary to reflect any changes, execute and file for record an instrument
which sets forth the then existing membership of the Trustees.

21
<PAGE> 15

3.3.3 So long as any Preferred Shares shall be outstanding,
the authorized number of Trustees shall be five, none of whom need be
Shareholders and each of whom is to be elected for a term ending upon the next
succeeding annual meeting of Shareholders and his successor being elected and
qualified, subject to earlier termination as provided below. The holders of at
least a majority of the then outstanding Preferred Shares shall be entitled to
elect one Trustee (the "Preferred Designee"); provided that if no Trustee is
elected by the holders of a majority of the then outstanding Preferred Shares,
the unfilled position shall be left vacant. The other Trustees (the "Other
Trustees") shall be elected by the holders of all of the then outstanding
Common Shares. The person so elected as the Preferred Designee, together with
such persons elected as the Other Trustees, shall constitute the duly elected
Trustees of the Trust.

3.3.4 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Declaration, Frank A. Morrow, John McMahan, E. Lawrence Hill, Jr., John F.
Salmon and Kenneth T. Seeger are hereby designated as Trustees to serve from
the date hereof until their successors are elected at the next annual meeting
of Shareholders and qualified. During the period commencing on the date of
this Declaration until the date of the first annual meeting of Shareholders,
any of these designated Trustees may only be removed for cause pursuant to
Section 3.4.2 below.

Section 3.4 Removal of Trustees

A Trustee may be removed from office at any time either:

3.4.1

.1 if such Trustee is an Other Trustee, with or
without Cause (as hereinafter defined) by the vote or written consent of
either (A) seventy-five percent (75%) of the Trustees then in office and a
majority of the outstanding Common Shares of the Trust entitled to vote, or (B)
sixty-six and two-thirds percent (66-2/3%) of the outstanding Common Shares of
the Trust entitled to vote; provided, however, that the Trustee shall not be
removed if the number of votes cast against removal (or not consenting in
writing to such removal) would be sufficient to elect the Trustee if voted
cumulatively at an election at which the same total number of votes were cast
(or, if the action is taken by written consent, all Common Shares entitled to
vote were voted) and the entire number of Trustees to be elected by holders of
the Common Shares at the time of the Trustee's most recent election were then
being elected; and

.2 if such Trustee is a Preferred Designee, with
or without Cause by the vote or written consent of a majority of the
outstanding Preferred Shares, or

3.4.2 with Cause by the vote or written consent of all
remaining Trustees.

22
<PAGE> 16

For purposes of this Section 3.4, Cause shall mean having been declared of
unsound mind by an order of court or convicted of a felony.

Section 3.5 Resignation of Trustees

Any Trustee may resign his office by an instrument in writing signed
by him and delivered to the Board of Trustees, which resignation shall take
effect after such delivery and on the date indicated in such instrument;
provided, that such resignation shall not become effective until a copy of such
instrument shall have been duly filed for record by such resigning Trustee.

Section 3.6 Action by Trustees

A majority of the Trustees in office at any one time, but not less
than three Trustees, shall constitute a quorum at any meeting of the Board of
Trustees. Meetings of the Trustees shall be held from time to time upon the
call of the Chairman of the Board or any two Trustees; provided, however, that
prior to the annual meeting of Shareholders to be held during calendar year
1996, the Board shall meet no less frequently then once during each quarter of
each fiscal year of the Trust. Notice of any meeting shall be given at least 3
days before the meeting. The Trustees shall act pursuant to the vote or
written consent, with or without a meeting, of more than half their number in
office at any one time. No action of the Board shall be effective without a
meeting unless all Trustees then in office shall sign, before or after such
action is taken, a written consent to such action and waiver of meeting;
provided, however, that the lack of such consent and waiver shall not be raised
to defeat the rights of any third party who has in good faith relied upon such
action. In case of the death or resignation of one or more Trustees, or
vacancies occurring in the Board of Trustees for any reason, the vacancies so
created may be filled (i) with respect to an Other Trustee by the Other Trustee
or Other Trustees remaining in office at the time, and (ii) with respect to the
Preferred Designee, by the holders of a majority of the Preferred Shares, and
each new Trustee shall serve for the unexpired term of his predecessor and
until the election and qualification of his successor. No vacancy on the Board
of Trustees shall operate to diminish the powers of the Trustee or Trustees
remaining in office. The provisions of this Section 3.6 relating to call and
notice of meetings of the Trustees may be varied by By-Laws adopted by the
Trustees.

Section 3.7 By-Laws

The Trustees may adopt and from time to time amend or repeal By-Laws
for the conduct of their business, and in such By-Laws may define the duties of
their officers, agents, employees and representatives.

23
<PAGE> 17

Section 3.8 Delegation of Authority

The Trustees may appoint one or more committees from their number and
delegate to such committees any of the powers and authority of the Board of
Trustees in the management of the business, affairs and assets of the Trust,
except the power to declare dividends and initiate amendments to this
Declaration. The Trustees shall appoint, and from time to time fix the
compensation and duties of a Chairman of the Board of Trustees, who shall be a
Trustee, each of whom shall hold his office at the pleasure of the Board of
Trustees. The Trustees may appoint such other officers and employ or otherwise
contract with such other persons as the Trustees in the exercise of their
discretion may deem necessary or desirable to achieve the purposes of the
Trust. The Trustees may delegate to any Trustee(s), officer(s), employee(s) or
agent(s), the authority to act in behalf of the Trust, including without
limitation the authority to execute any contract, agreement, document,
conveyance, deed, deed of trust, mortgage, release, or other written
instruments.

Section 3.9 Compensation

The Trustees, the secretary, and every other person appointed,
employed or otherwise engaged to assist in the execution of the Trust, shall
receive such compensation from the assets of the Trust for their respective
services to the Trust as shall be fixed from time to time by the Board of
Trustees.

Section 3.10 Use and Effect of Trust Seal

The secretary or other officer designated by the Trustees shall have
custody of the seal of the Trust. As to any person relying thereon in good
faith, the impression of the seal of the Trust upon a document or writing
bearing the handwritten signature of the secretary, or of any assistant
secretary, shall conclusively evidence that such document or writing was duly
executed pursuant to authority granted by the Board of Trustees and this
Declaration.

Section 3.11 Powers of Trustees

The Trustees shall have full and absolute power, control and authority
over all Trust assets held by or for them hereunder, and over the business and
affairs of the Trust, to the same extent as if they were the sole owners of
such assets and such business in their own right, subject only to the
limitations herein expressly stated. Without limitation of the generality of
the foregoing, the Trustees shall have power:

3.11.1 To design and adopt a seal of the Trust, and to
change the same from time to time; to locate and relocate the principal office
of the Trust; and from time to time to change the name of the Trust, and under
such name to make and execute contracts and all kinds of instruments, conduct
business, acquire and convey real or personal property, and sue or be sued;

a prior offering thereof to existing Shareholders, Shares of the Trust in
addition to any then outstanding, issuing the same to such party or parties,

the Trustees deem best, and in so doing, to allow or eliminate fractional
shares, in their discretion;

3.11.4 To acquire and dispose of assets, and otherwise
conduct the business of the Trust, in any part of the United States of America
and any of the territories or possessions thereof and in Canada; and to cause

powers and discretion as they deem desirable for Trust purposes;

they deem expedient in the transaction of the business of the Trust;

3.11.9 To determine conclusively whether any monies,

be charged as between principal and income, or as between earnings, surplus and
capital, as the case may be;

3.11.10 To determine the fiscal year and the accounting
procedures of the Trust, and to change the same from time to time;

25

<PAGE> 19
3.11.11 To compromise or settle claims of or against the
Trust; and to take such action, legal or otherwise, as appears to them
necessary or desirable in the interests of the Trust and the shareholders, and
in so doing to pay the expenses thereby incurred in good faith, including
counsel fees, from the funds of the Trust;

3.11.12 To determine the proper interpretation of any
provision of this Declaration or By-Laws of the Trust; and

3.11.13 To do all acts and undertake all things which in
their judgment are necessary, convenient or appropriate to promote the purposes
of the Trust, although such acts or things are not specifically mentioned in
this Declaration.

INVESTMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF TRUST ASSETS

trust," as that term now is, or as it or substitute designations later may be,
defined by the Code. The Trustees shall endeavor to manage the Trust and to
invest its assets, and to make distributions to shareholders therefrom, in such
manner as to comply with all valid state and federal laws, rules, regulations
and orders pertaining to the Trust, and to take advantage of tax benefits,
whether federal, state or local, from time to time afforded to "real estate
investment trusts" or shareholders thereof provided, however, that
notwithstanding the preceding provisions, the Trustees shall at all times take
such action under the Trust as in their judgment will best serve the interests
of the Trust and of the Shareholders.

Section 4.2 Permissible Investments

Trust assets shall consist principally of ownership interests in
income-producing real property. Such real property may be located in any
state, territory or possession of the United States (including the District of
Columbia) and shall be comprised for the most part of office buildings,
apartment buildings, shopping centers, or other multiple-residential,
commercial or industrial properties. Secondary investments of Trust assets may
be of such nature and of such extent as the Trustees may determine, having in
mind the best interests of the Trust and of the shareholders. Other things
being equal, Trust investments shall be chosen for their best overall return on
investment, including both income production and appreciation potential, among
other factors; but this principle shall be understood to be intended only as a
general guide to assist the Trustees in the exercise of their discretion.
Funds may be accumulated or invested temporarily until such times as more
suitable investments are available. The Trust may also participate in joint
ventures and may purchase or merge with other

26

<PAGE> 20
real estate investment trusts and companies, provided the assets and
investments of said joint ventures, trusts and companies are permissible
hereunder. Undivided interests in property may be acquired for the Trust, and
encumbered property may be acquired subject to, or with assumption of, the
underlying indebtedness.

Section 4.3 Maintenance of Assets

The Trustees, on behalf of the Trust, shall themselves or through
agents or independent contractors, incur all expenses and make all expenditures
necessary or desirable for the protection, improvement, maintenance, repair,
alteration, efficient operation, or ready marketability of any asset of the
Trust.

Section 4.4 Disposition or Encumbrance of Assets

The Trustees shall have full discretion in retaining, selling,
exchanging or encumbering any asset of the Trust, or any interest in any such
asset.

Section 4.5 Use of Brokers and Appraisers

Subject to the provisions of Section 4.7 hereof, the Trustees may
employ at the expense of the Trust the services of any person, including any
real estate or securities broker, for the purpose of appraising, acquiring,
encumbering or disposing of assets of the Trust.

Section 4.6 Transactions with Related Parties

4.6.1 The Trust shall not engage in any Material
Transaction with a Related Party unless the Material Transaction has, after
disclosure of the interest of the Related Party, been approved or ratified by a
majority of the Trustees who are neither affiliates nor associates of the
Related Party. All such transactions shall be fair and reasonable to the Trust
and its Shareholders as a whole at the time of authorization, and be on terms
at least as favorable to the Trust as terms that would have been obtainable
from a person other than a Related Party. This section shall not apply to any
purchase or sale of securities issued by the Trust and registered with the
Securities and Exchange Commission except to the extent that a person who is a
Large Shareholder immediately before or after the transaction has a direct or
indirect interest in such purchase or sale of securities.

4.6.2 No Related Party shall directly or indirectly receive
any material remuneration in connection with any Material Transaction involving
the Trust unless the terms for the payment of such remuneration have been
approved or ratified by a majority of the Trustees who are neither affiliates
nor associates of any person receiving such remuneration. Payment of any such
remuneration shall be on terms which are fair and reasonable to the Trust and
its shareholders as a whole at the time of authorization; such

27

<PAGE> 21
terms may include, without limitation, deduction of such payments from the
remuneration otherwise payable to a Related Party.

4.6.3 The Trustees entitled to approve a transaction or
terms for the payment of remuneration under subsections 4.6.1 or 4.6.2 above
shall be entitled in their discretion to retain, at the Trust's expense,
independent appraisers, investment bankers, legal counsel, accountants and
other professional consultants or advisors to assist them in their
determination.

4.6.4 For purposes of this Section 4.6:

.1 The term "Related Party" shall mean any
present or former Trustee, officer, Large Shareholder, investment manager or
advisor of the Trust, or any affiliate or associate of such person.

.2 The term "Material Transaction" shall
include, without limitation, any purchase, sale, loan, lease, pledge, exchange
or other transfer of Trust assets or securities, and any merger, consolidation,
reorganization, joint venture, partnership or other entity involving the Trust.

.3 The term "Large Shareholder" means any person
who is the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the 1934
Act) of five percent (5%) or more of the outstanding Common Shares or Preferred
Shares of the Trust entitled to vote in the election of Trustees after
including among his shares those owned by an affiliate or associate.

.4 The terms "affiliate" and "associate" shall
have the meanings assigned to them in Rule 12b-2 under the 1934 Act; provided,
that a person shall not be deemed to be an affiliate or an associate of any
other person solely by reason of being a Trustee or officer of the Trust.

Section 4.7 Approval of Major Transactions

Subject to additional requirements and restrictions of this
Declaration and the voting rights of holders of Preferred Shares pursuant to
Section 5.2.4.2,

4.7.1 at any time when the Trust is qualified as a real
estate investment trust under the Code, no action shall be taken by the Trust
which would foreseeably cause the Trust to fail so to qualify as a real estate
investment trust under the Code, notwithstanding Section 4.1, and

4.7.2 the Trust shall not be incorporated, merged into
another entity, consolidated with one or more entities into a new entity,
reorganized as a new entity, liquidated or dissolved, notwithstanding Section
4.2; provided, however, that the Trust may merge or consolidate with CalREIT
without obtaining the approval otherwise required pursuant to this Section 4.7,
and

28

<PAGE> 22
4.7.3 all or substantially all of the assets, properties,
or businesses of the Trust shall not be sold, leased, transferred, conveyed,
exchanged or otherwise disposed of, notwithstanding Section 3.11,

except upon the affirmative vote or written consent of seventy-five percent
(75%) of the outstanding Common Shares of the Trust entitled to vote.

ARTICLE V.

SHARES AND SHAREHOLDERS

Section 5.1 Classes of Shares

The Trustees are authorized to issue two classes of Shares to be
designated "Common Shares" and "Preferred Shares" respectively. The total
number of Shares which the Trust is authorized to issue is Seventy-Five Million
(75,000,000), of which Fifty Million (50,000,000) Shares shall be Common Shares
and Twenty-Five Million (25,000,000) Shares shall be Preferred Shares. The
Trustees shall not be authorized to issue any Shares which do not have the
right to vote for election of Trustees.

Section 5.2 Preferred Shares

The designations, voting powers, preferences and relative,
participating, optional and other special rights of the shares of the Preferred
Shares and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof are as
follows:

5.2.1 Rank. The Preferred Shares shall, with respect to
dividend rights and rights on redemption and on liquidation, winding up and
dissolution, rank prior to any other equity securities of the Trust, including
Common Shares (all of such equity securities of the Trust to which the
Preferred Shares rank prior are collectively referred to in this Section 5.2 as
the "Junior Shares").

5.2.2 Dividends. The holders of Preferred Shares shall be
entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Trustees out of funds legally
available therefor, cumulative dividends payable in cash at a rate of 10% per
annum of the Stated Value (as hereinafter defined), provided that until and
including September 30, 1998, dividends may, at the option of the Trustees, be
paid in Preferred Shares issued by the Trustees, Preferred Shares issued as
payments of dividends shall be valued at the Stated Value. Such dividends
shall be payable quarterly on the last day of each March, June, September and
December commencing on the first of such dates to occur after the first
Preferred Shares are initially issued. Dividends shall accrue on each
Preferred Share from the date of issuance thereof and shall accrue from day to
day, whether or not earned or declared. Accrued but unpaid dividends shall
increase at a compounding rate equal to 10% per annum compounded quarterly.

29

<PAGE> 23

Dividends paid on the Preferred Shares in an amount less than the total amount
of such dividends at the time accrued and payable on such Preferred Shares
shall be allocated pro rata on a share-by-share basis among all such Preferred
Shares at the time outstanding. The Trustees may fix a record date for the
holders of Preferred Shares entitled to receive payment of a dividend or
distribution declared thereon, which record date shall not be more than 30 days
prior to the date fixed for payment thereof. During such time as any Preferred
Shares are outstanding, the Trustees shall not declare, pay or set apart for
payment any dividend on any Junior Shares or make any payment on account of, or
set apart money for a sinking or other similar fund or make any payment for,
the purchase, redemption or other retirement of, any Junior Shares or any
warrants, rights, calls or options exercisable for or convertible into any
Junior Shares, or make any distribution in respect thereof, either directly or
indirectly, and whether in cash, obligations or Shares of the Trust or other
property (other than distributions or dividends in Junior Shares to the holders
of Junior Shares), and shall not permit any corporation or other entity
directly or indirectly controlled by the Trustees to purchase or redeem any
Junior Shares or any warrants, rights, calls or options exercisable for or
convertible into any Junior Shares, unless prior to or concurrently with such
declaration, payment, setting apart for payment, purchase, redemption or
distribution, as the case may be, the full cumulative dividends on all
outstanding Preferred Shares shall have been paid in full or contemporaneously
are declared and paid through the most recent dividend payment date.

5.2.3 Liquidation Preference.

.1 In the event of any voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the Trust, the holders
of the Preferred Shares then outstanding shall be entitled to be first paid out
of the assets of the Trust available for distribution to its Shareholders an
amount in cash equal to Two Dollars ($2.00) per Preferred Share (the "Stated
Value"), plus an amount equal to all dividends (whether or not earned or
declared) on such Shares accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of final
distribution, before any payment shall be made or any assets distributed to the
holders of any Junior Shares. Except as provided in the preceding sentence,
holders of the Preferred Shares shall not be entitled to any distribution in
the event of liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the
Trust. If, upon any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs
of the Trust, the remaining assets of the Trust available for distribution to
its Shareholders shall be insufficient to pay the holders of the Preferred
Shares the full amount to which they shall be entitled, the holders of the
Preferred Shares shall share ratably in any distribution of the remaining
assets and funds of the Trust in proportion to the respective amounts which
would otherwise be payable in respect of the Shares held by them upon such
distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to such Preferred Shares
were paid in full.

30

<PAGE> 24

.2 For the purposes of this Section 5.2.3,
neither the voluntary sale, conveyance, exchange or transfer (for cash, shares
of stock, securities or other consideration) of all or substantially all the
property or assets of the Trust nor the consolidation or merger of the Trust
with one or more other entities shall be deemed a liquidation, dissolution or
winding up, voluntary or involuntary.

5.2.4 Voting Rights.

.1 Right to Vote. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, or by law, the holders of Preferred Shares shall have no
voting rights. In the event that the holders of Preferred Shares shall have
the right to vote, each person in whose name Preferred Shares shall be
registered on the record date for determining the holders of the Preferred
Shares entitled to vote at any meeting of Shareholders (or adjournment thereof)
or to consent to Shareholder action in writing without a meeting shall be
entitled to, at such meeting or with respect to such action, one vote for each
Common Share of the Trust into which each Preferred Share registered in the
name of such person on such record date could be converted (with any fractional
Share determined on an aggregate conversion basis being rounded to the nearest
whole Share).

.2 Significant Events. During such time as any
Preferred Shares are outstanding, the Trustees shall not, without the
affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least a majority of the issued
and outstanding Preferred Shares voting together as a separate class, (A)
create, authorize or issue (including on conversion or exchange of any
convertible or exchangeable securities or by reclassification) any class or
series of Shares ranking on a parity with or prior to the Preferred Shares,
either as to dividends or redemption or upon voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution or winding up; (B) increase the authorized Shares of,
or issue (including on conversion or exchange of any convertible or
exchangeable securities or by reclassification) any Preferred Shares, except to
pay dividends on the issued and outstanding Preferred Shares as provided in
Section 5.2.2 above; (C) amend, alter, waive the application of, or repeal
(whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise) any provision of the
Declaration, enter into any agreement or take any other action which in any
manner would alter, change or otherwise adversely affect the powers, rights or
preferences of the Preferred Shares; (D) effect the reorganization,
liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Trust, or the sale, lease,
conveyance or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets, property or
business of the Trust, or the merger or consolidation of the Trust with or into
any other entity other than CalREIT; (E) take any action which would cause a
dividend or other distribution to be deemed to be received by the holders of
the Preferred Shares for federal income tax purposes unless such dividend or
other distribution is actually received by such holders; (F) cause the
occurrence of a Change-in-Control Transaction (as hereinafter defined),
including through

31

<PAGE> 25
issuance of additional Securities; or (G) at any time after October 1, 1998,
when the Trust has not paid, when due, cash dividends specified in Section
5.2.2 for a period of three consecutive quarters, incur any indebtedness,
whether recourse or non-recourse, other than indebtedness described in Section
6.5 of the Note Agreement. As used in this Section 5.2.4.2, "Change-in-Control
Transaction" means any transaction or series of related transactions, involving
the Trust, holders of any class of Shares or both, resulting in any person or
group of persons acting in concert who were not theretofore the holder or
holders of voting securities enabling the holder or holders thereof to cast
more than a majority of the votes which may be cast for the election of Other
Trustees (as defined in Section 3.3.3) becoming the holder or holders of at
least such amount of voting securities (for such purpose, treating instruments
or securities issued in such transaction which are convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for voting securities as being so converted,
exchanged or exercised upon issuance, regardless of the terms thereof);
provided, however, that any transfer of voting securities of the Trust by
persons (including, without limitation, any affiliate, agent, or control person
of such persons) who are, or at any time have been, holders of Preferred
Shares, shall not constitute all or any part of a Change-In-Control
Transaction. A person shall not be considered as acting in concert with any
other person for this purpose unless such persons bear a relationship described
in either Section 267(b) or 707(b) of the Code.

.3 Election of Trustees. The right of holders
of Preferred Shares to elect the Preferred Designee as a Trustee is set forth
in Section 3.3.3.

5.2.5 Conversion.

.1 Optional Conversion. As long as Mandatory
Conversion has not occurred, the Trustees shall have the right, at their
option, to cause the conversion of all of the outstanding Preferred Shares into
Conversion Shares (as defined below) upon the issuance in a single offering or
transaction (the "New Issuance") by the Trust of Common Shares and/or any
equity securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common
Shares for an aggregate purchase price equal to or greater than an amount equal
to 150% of the sum of (A) the aggregate Stated Value of all Preferred Shares
then outstanding as of the date that the optional conversion occurs (the
"Conversion Date") and (B) the amount of unpaid dividends accrued on all
Preferred Shares then outstanding to the Conversion Date. The conversion right
granted by this Section 5.2.5.2 may be exercised by the Trust by giving written
notice of its election to exercise such conversion right by United States
certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, mailed not more than 30 days
thereafter to all holders of record of the then outstanding Preferred Shares at
such holders' addresses shown on the books of the Trust. Each such notice
shall state the proposed Conversion Date (which date shall not be fewer than 10
days more than 30 days after the date notice thereof is received), the number

32

<PAGE> 26

of Common Shares to be delivered per Preferred Share converted and the place or
places where certificates of Preferred Shares are to be surrendered for
conversion. From and after the Conversion, each certificate of Preferred
Shares shall be deemed to represent only the Common Shares into which such
Preferred Shares have been converted. The holder of such certificates shall
surrender such certificates for conversion upon and pursuant to the request of
the Trust. The number of whole Common Shares to be delivered to each holder of
Preferred Shares upon an Optional Conversion shall be computed by dividing (1)
the aggregate Stated Value of those Preferred Shares held by each such holder
by (2) an amount equal to 80% of the purchase price per Common Share included
in the New Issuance securities. (For such purpose, to the extent that the New
Issuance securities are equity securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for Common Shares, such New Issuance securities shall be treated as
having been converted, exchanged or exercised as of the date of the New
Issuance even if not by their terms then convertible, exchangeable or
exercisable.) At the time of an Optional Conversion of Preferred Shares, the
Trust shall pay in cash to the holder thereof an amount equal to all unpaid
dividends accrued thereon to the date of conversion. Each Preferred Share
certificate surrendered for conversion shall be endorsed by its holder.

.2 Mandatory Conversion. All of the outstanding
Preferred Shares shall, without any further action by the holders thereof,
convert into Conversion Shares (a "Mandatory Conversion") upon the occurrence
of any event specified in Section 5.2.6 and the failure by the Trust to redeem
all issued and outstanding Preferred Shares (and to pay in cash an amount equal
to all unpaid dividends accrued thereon to the date of redemption) within 10
days after the occurrence of any such event. The number of Common Shares to be
delivered to each holder of Preferred Shares upon a Mandatory Conversion
pursuant to this Section 5.2.5.2 shall be computed by dividing (1) the
aggregate Stated Value of such holder's Preferred Shares, plus an amount equal
to all accrued but unpaid dividends on such person's Preferred Shares by (2)
the then applicable Conversion Price (as defined in Section 5.2.5.3) for such
holder's Preferred Shares. In the event of a Mandatory Conversion pursuant to
this Section 5.2.5.3, the Trust shall forthwith transmit to each holder of
Preferred Shares notice thereof in reasonable detail, together with
certificates for the shares of Common Shares issued as a result thereof, dated
the date of such Mandatory Conversion against delivery of the certificates
representing the Preferred Shares to be converted, and such holders shall be
deemed for all purposes to be the holders of such Common Shares as of the date
and time of such Mandatory Conversion.

.3 Conversion Price. For the purposes of
conversion under Section 5.2.5.2, the Preferred Shares shall be converted into
Common Shares (the "Conversion Shares") at the price per Share of $2.00 per
Conversion Share ("Conversion Price"), subject to adjustment pursuant to the
provisions of Section 5.2.5.5.

33

<PAGE> 27
.4 Stock Fully Paid; Reservation of Shares. All
Common Shares which may be issued upon the conversion of Preferred Shares will,
upon issuance, be duly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all
liens and charges with respect to the issue thereof. At all times that any
Preferred Share is outstanding, the Trust shall have authorized, and shall have
reserved for the purpose of issuance upon such conversion, a sufficient number
of Common Shares to provide for the conversion into Common Shares of all
Preferred Shares then outstanding at the then effective conversion price.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if at any time the
conversion price is decreased, the number of Common Shares authorized and
reserved for issuance upon the conversion of the Preferred Shares shall be
appropriately increased.

.5 Adjustment of Conversion Price. The
Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time upon the
happening of certain events, as set forth in the following paragraphs;
provided, however that the issuance of Common Shares pursuant to any conversion
of Preferred Shares under this Declaration shall not result in any adjustment
of the Conversion Price pursuant to this Section 5.2.5.5; and provided further,
that the issuance of any Shares which results in an adjustment of the
Conversion Price pursuant to any subsection of this Section 5.2.5.5 shall not
result in any further adjustment of the Conversion Price under this Section
5.2.5.5:

.1 Reclassification, Consolidation or
Merger. In case of any reclassification or change of
outstanding Common Shares issuable upon conversion of
Preferred Shares (other than as a result of a
subdivision or combination), or in case of any
consolidation, merger or combination of the Trust
with or into another entity (other than a merger or
combination with another entity in which the Trust is
the surviving Trust and which does not result in any
reclassification or change -- other than as a result
of a subdivision or combination --of outstanding
Common Shares issuable upon such conversion, and
other than a consolidation or merger with CalREIT),
the rights of the holders of the outstanding
Preferred Shares shall be adjusted in the manner
described below:

.1 In the event that the Trust is
the surviving entity, the Preferred Shares
shall, without payment of additional
consideration therefor, be deemed modified so
as to provide that upon conversion thereof
the holder of the Preferred Shares being
converted shall procure, in lieu of each
Common Share theretofore issuable upon such
conversion, the kind and amount of shares,
other securities, money and property
receivable upon such

34

<PAGE> 28

reclassification, change, consolidation,
combination or merger by the holder of each
Common Share issuable upon such conversion
had conversion occurred immediately prior to
such reclassification, change, consolidation,
combination or merger. Such Preferred Shares
shall be deemed to provide for adjustments
which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be
practicable to the adjustments provided for
in this Section 5.2.5. The provisions of
this clause (1) shall similarly apply to
successive reclassifications, changes,
consolidations, combinations and
mergers.

.2 In the event that the Trust is
not the surviving entity, the surviving
entity shall, without payment of any
additional consideration therefor, issue new
Preferred Shares, providing that upon
conversion thereof, the holders thereof shall
procure in lieu of each Common Share
theretofore issuable upon conversion of the
Preferred Shares the kind and amount of
Shares, other securities, money and property
receivable upon such reclassification,
change, consolidation or merger by the holder
of each Common Share issuable upon conversion
of the Preferred Shares had such conversion
occurred immediately prior to such
reclassification, change, consolidation or
merger. Such new Preferred Shares shall
provide for adjustments which shall be as
nearly equivalent as may be practicable to
the adjustments provided for in this Section
5.2.5. The provisions of this clause (2)
shall similarly apply to successive
reclassification, changes, consolidations,
combinations and mergers.

.2 Subdivision or Combination of
Shares. If the Trust, at any time while any of the
Preferred Shares is outstanding, shall subdivide or
combine its Common Shares, the Conversion Price shall
be proportionately reduced, in case of subdivision of
Shares, as of the effective date of such subdivision,
or if the Trust shall take a record of holders of its
Common Shares for the purpose of a subdividing, as of
such record date, whichever is earlier; or shall be
proportionately increased, in the case of combination
of Shares, as of the effective date of such
combination or, if the Trust shall take a record of
holders of its Common Shares for the purpose of so
combining, as of such record date, whichever is
earlier.

35

<PAGE> 29

.3 Certain Dividends and Distributions.
If the Trust, at any time while any of the Preferred
Shares is outstanding, shall:

.1 Stock Dividends. Pay a
dividend payable in, effect a split-up of, or
make any other distribution of Common Shares,
the Conversion Price shall be adjusted, as
of the date the Trust shall take a record of
the holders of its Common Shares for the
purpose of receiving such dividend, stock
split or other distribution (or if no such
record is taken, as of the date of such
payment or other distribution), to that price
determined by multiplying the Conversion
Price by a fraction (1) the numerator of
which shall be the total number of Common
Shares outstanding immediately prior to such
dividend, split-up or distribution and (2)
the denominator of which shall be the total
number of Common Shares outstanding
immediately after such dividend, split-up or
distribution (plus in the event that the
Trust paid cash for fractional Shares, the
number of additional Shares which would have
been outstanding had the Trust issued
fractional shares in connection with said
dividend, split-up or distribution); or

.2 Liquidating Dividends, etc.
Make a distribution of its property to the
holders of its Common Shares as a dividend in
liquidation or partial liquidation or by way
of return of capital or other than as a
dividend payable out of funds legally
available for dividends under the laws of the
State of California if the Trust were a
general business corporation, the holders of
the Preferred Shares shall, upon conversion
thereof, be entitled to receive, in addition
to the number of Common Shares receivable
thereupon, and without payment of any
consideration therefor, a sum equal to the
amount of such property as would have been
payable to them as owners of that number of
Common Shares of the Trust receivable upon
such conversion, had they been the holders of
record of such Common Shares on the record
date for such distribution; and an
appropriate provision therefor shall be made
a part of any such distribution.

.4 Issuance of Common Shares at Less
Than Conversion Price. In the event that after the
date of issuance of the Preferred Shares the Trust

36

<PAGE> 30

issues Common Shares or Common Share Equivalents (as
hereinafter defined) at an issue price less than the
Conversion Price, the Conversion Price shall be
reduced to an amount equal to the weighted average of
the issue prices of all Common Shares and Common
Share Equivalents then outstanding. For this
purpose, the issue price of all Common Shares issued
on or before the effective date of this Declaration
shall be deemed to be equal to the Two Dollars
($2.00) per Share. A Common Share Equivalent shall
mean any security that is treated as a Common Share
for purposes of computing fully diluted earnings per
share under generally accepted accounting principles,
but shall not include the Preferred Shares.

.5 Notice of Adjustments. Whenever the
Conversion Price shall be adjusted pursuant to
Section 5.2.5.5 hereof, the Trust shall make a
certificate signed by the Chairman of the Board and
by its chief financial officer, treasurer, assistant
treasurer, secretary or assistant secretary, setting
forth, in reasonable detail, the event requiring the
adjustment, the amount of the adjustment, the method
by which such adjustment was calculated (including a
description of the basis on which the Trust made any
determination hereunder), and the Conversion Price
after giving effect to such adjustment, and shall
cause copies of such certificate to be mailed (by
first-class mail, postage prepaid) to each holder of
Preferred Shares at its address shown on the books of
the Trust. The Trust shall make such certificate and
mail it to each holder promptly after each
adjustment.

.6 No Reissuance of Preferred Stock. No
Preferred Shares which have been converted into Common Shares shall be reissued
by the Trust.

5.2.6 Redemption. Upon the earlier to occur of (A) any
event specified in clauses (A) through (G) of Section 5.2.4.2 for which the
affirmative vote or consent of holders or Preferred Shares required under
Section 5.2.4.2. has not been obtained, (B) any failure by the Trust on or
after October 1, 1998, to declare and pay any cash dividend on the Preferred
Shares on the payment due dates and in the amounts described in Section 5.2.2
hereof, if such failure shall continue in whole or in part for a period of 90
days from the payment due date, or (C) the sixth anniversary of the date that
any Preferred Shares are first issued, the Trust shall redeem all issued and
outstanding Preferred Shares not more than 10 days following the date of such
event for cash at a redemption price per share equal to the Stated Value plus
an amount equal to all unpaid dividends accrued thereon to the date of
redemption; provided, however, that the right of redemption under

37

<PAGE> 31
clause (A) of this Section 5.2.6 may be waived by affirmative vote or consent
of the holders of at least a majority of the issued and outstanding Preferred
Shares. If the Trust fails to redeem all issued and outstanding Preferred
Shares within 10 days after the occurrence of any of the events specified in
this Section 5.2.6, all Shares which have not been redeemed (at the option of
the Trust) shall be converted to Common Shares as provided in Section 5.2.5.3.

5.2.7 Optional Redemption. The Trust may, in its sole 
discretion, elect to redeem all or any portion of the outstanding Preferred 
Shares, at a price per share equal to the Stated Value, plus any accrued but 
unpaid dividends on the Preferred Share, so long as:

.1 The Trust has paid in cash the
entire principal amount of all Interest Deferral
Notes (as defined in the Note Agreement) as delivered
to Noteholders (as defined in the Note Agreement) and
all accrued interest thereon, and the period on which
the Trust may issue Interest Deferral Notes in lieu
of cash payments of interest has expired; and

.2 All amounts owing under the New
Credit Line (as defined in the Note Agreement) and
the Redding Hotel Improvement Loan (as defined in the
Note Agreement) have been paid in full.

Section 5.3 Shareholder's Interest in Trust

The interest in the Trust of each Shareholder consists of his right to
enforce the performance of the Trust, including the right to participate in all
distributions of Trust income or principal according to the proportion which
the number of Common Shares or Preferred Shares held by him bears to the total
number of Common Shares or Preferred Shares , respectively, then outstanding.
Such interest is personal property. During the continuance of the Trust, no
Shareholder or his legal representative or successor shall be entitled to a
partition of Trust property or, except as herein provided, to an accounting,
nor shall the Trust be in any manner affected by the death, incapacity,
dissolution, termination or bankruptcy of any Shareholder, or by the transfer
of any Share or Shares of the Trust.

Section 5.4 Agreement of Shareholders

Each of the Shareholders, severally but not jointly, by becoming a
Shareholder hereunder, hereby agrees with the Trustees and their successors in
office that he accepts and agrees to, and shall be bound and governed by, the
provisions, terms, and conditions of this Declaration in the same manner as if
he had personally executed the same.

38

<PAGE> 32

Section 5.5 Nonassessability of Shares

No assessment shall ever be made upon the Shares of the Trust.

Section 5.6 Issuance of Certificates

Every Shareholder shall be entitled to receive a share certificate in
such form as the Trustees shall from time to time approve. There shall be
stated on each share certificate the certificate number, the date of its
issuance, the number of Shares represented thereby, and the name of the
Shareholder. All certificates shall be for full Shares. No certificates for
fractional shares shall be issued.

Section 5.7 Authentication of Certificates

Each certificate shall bear the signatures of the chairman or a
vice-chairman of the Board of Trustees and the secretary or an assistant
secretary of the Trust, and if there shall be an independent transfer agent or
registrar, the countersignature of an officer thereof duly authorized for the
purpose. The signatures of the chairman or a vice-chairman of the Board, the
secretary or an assistant secretary of the Trust, and the designated officer of
any independent transfer agent or registrar, may be facsimile reproductions.
The validity of a share or certificate therefor shall not be affected by the
fact that at the time of issuance of the certificate one or more persons whose
signatures where duly authorized when placed thereon are no longer authorized
to sign the same.

Section 5.8 Replacement Certificates

Lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed certificates shall be replaced
subject to such conditions of proof and indemnity as the Trustees may determine
to impose.

Section 5.9 Only Registered Holder Recognized

A register shall be kept under the direction of the Trustees, which
shall contain the names and addresses of the Shareholders, the number of Shares
of each class of Shares held by them respectively, the numbers of the
certificates representing the same, and a record of all transfers thereof.
Only the Shareholder designated in such register as the holder of a share
certificate shall be recognized for purposes of the Trust as having any
interest in such certificate or the Shares represented thereby, and neither the
Trust nor any person connected therewith shall be bound by any notice to the
contrary, but in cases of dispute the Trustees may require that the certificate
in question be submitted for inspection and that the registered Shareholder's
title thereto be satisfactorily established. A holder may be registered as a
fiduciary, and customary words may be employed to identify the fiduciary
relationship.

Section 5.10 Shareholder's Transfer of Shares

Excepting transfers by operation of law, Shares shall be transferable
on the records of the Trust only by the record holder thereof or by his agent
duly authorized in writing, upon delivery to the Trustees or a transfer agent
of the Trust, if any, of the certificate or certificates therefor, properly
endorsed or accompanied by duly executed instrument or instruments of transfer,
together with such evidence of the genuineness of each such endorsement,
execution and authorization and of other matters as may reasonably be required.
Upon such delivery and proof, the transfer shall be recorded upon the register
of the Trust, and one or more new certificates shall be issued to those
entitled thereto by reason of such transfer. Until the transfer is so
recorded, the Shareholder designated by the register as the holder of such
Shares shall be deemed to be the holder thereof for all purposes of the Trust,
and neither the Trustees nor any transfer agent or registrar, nor any officer
or agent of the Trust, shall be affected by any notice of any proposed
transfer. The Trustees may establish particular procedures to govern the
assignment of Shares for security purposes. No Shareholder may demand that the
Trust or the Trustees redeem his Shares. No certificates for fractional Shares
shall be issued.

Section 5.11 Transfers by Operation of Law

Any person becoming entitled to any Share in consequence of the death,
dissolution or bankruptcy of any shareholder, or in any other way than in
Section 5.10 provided, may be entered upon the register as the holder thereof
and receive a new certificate therefor, upon delivery of the existing
certificate and such proofs as may be required to the Trustees or any transfer
agent of the Trust. The transfer shall have no effect until entered upon the
register, and notice given to any person prior to such entry shall likewise be
ineffective for any purpose. No certificates for fractional shares shall be
issued.

Section 5.12 Trust Agents as Shareholders

Any Trustee, officer, agent or employee of the Trust may, in his
individual capacity, acquire or dispose of Shares of the Trust.

Section 5.13 Right to Refuse to Transfer Shares; Acquisition
Restriction; Redemption Rights

5.13.1 Whenever it is deemed by them to be reasonably
necessary to protect the status of the Trust as a "real estate investment
trust" for federal income tax purposes, the Trustees may require a statement or
affidavit from each proposed transferee of Trust shares setting forth the
number of Shares already owned by him and any related person specified in the
form prescribed by the Trustees for that purpose. If, in the opinion of the
Trustees, the proposed transfer may jeopardize the qualification of the Trust
as a "real estate investment trust" under the Code, or result in a

40

<PAGE> 34

Change-in-Control Transaction, the Trustees shall have the right, but not a
duty, to refuse to transfer the Shares to the proposed transferee. All
contracts for the sale or other transfer of Shares of the Trust shall be
subject to this provision.

5.13.2 Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Declaration of Trust to the contrary, any purported acquisition of Shares of
the Trust which would result in the disqualification of the Trust as a real
estate investment trust under the Code shall be null and void.

5.13.3 All persons who own 5% or more of any class of the
Trust's outstanding Shares shall file with the Trust an affidavit setting forth
the number of Shares (i) owned directly (held of record by such person or by a
nominee or nominees of such person), (ii) owned indirectly (by reason of
Sections 542, 544 and 856 of the Code or for purposes of Rule 13(d) under the
1934 Act) by the person filing the affidavit, and (iii) owned by an person who
would be considered as acting in concert with such person as determined under
Section 5.2.4.2. The affidavit to be filed with the Trust shall set forth all
the information required to be reported (i) in returns of Shareholders under
Treasury Regulations Section 1.857-9 and (ii) in reports to be filed under
Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act. The affidavit or an amendment to a previously
filed affidavit shall be filed with the Trust annually within 60 days after the
close of the Trust's taxable year, and prior to any transfer or attempted
transfer of Shares by or to such person, so long as immediately prior to or
subsequent to the transfer or attempted transfer such person owns 5% or more of
the Trust's outstanding Shares.

5.13.4 The Trustees may redeem such Shares as they deem
necessary when, in good faith, the Trustees determine that failure to redeem
such Shares will result in the Trust's failure to qualify as a real estate
investment trust under the Code. All such Shares may be redeemed by the Trust,
in the discretion of the Trustees, by mailing a written notice of redemption to
the holder of such Shares not less than one week prior to the redemption date
as set by the Trustees and included in the notice. The redemption price to be
paid for such Shares shall be equal to (i) the average of the high and low
sales prices of the shares of such class or series on the last business day
prior to the redemption date on the principal national securities exchange on
which such shares are listed or admitted to trading, or (ii) if such shares are
not so listed or admitted to trading, the average of the highest bid and lowest
asked prices on such last business day as reported by the National Quotation
Bureau Incorporated or a similar organization selected from time to time by the
Trust for the purpose, or (iii) if not determinable as aforesaid, as determined
in good faith by the Trustees. From and after the date fixed for redemption by
the Trustees, the holder of any Shares of so called for redemption shall cease
to be entitled to any distributions and other benefits with respect to such
Shares, except only the right to payment of the redemption price fixed as
aforesaid.

41

<PAGE> 35

5.13.5 The provisions of this Section 5.13 relating to
transactions which could affect the Trust's qualification as a "real estate
investment trust" under the Code shall be applicable only during fiscal years
of the Trust for which the Trustees determine that the Trust can reasonably
expect to meet the requirements for election to be taxed as a "real estate
investment trust" under the Code and that it is in the best interests of the
Trust and the Shareholders that the Trust make such election.

Section 5.14 Cancellation of Old Shares

Prior to the effective date of this Declaration, the Trust had
outstanding a single class of beneficial interests designated as "shares" (the
"Old Shares"). Effective as of the date hereof, all issued and outstanding
certificates representing Old Shares are hereby canceled and terminated, and
all issued and outstanding Old Shares are hereby converted into Common Shares
and cash, without necessity for further action either by the Trust or the
holders of the Old Shares. The number of Common Shares issued to holders of
Old Shares is the number determined pursuant to Article IV.B.22 and .23 of the
Plan. The Trustees shall record on the books of the Trust the names of former
holders of the Old Shares and the number of Common Shares issued to such
holders pursuant to the conversion provided for in this Section 5.14 and the
Plan. Upon receipt of a request of a former holder of Old Shares, or when and
to the extent they deem practicable, the Trustees shall issue to the persons
entitled thereto certificates for Common Shares issued pursuant to the
conversion provided for in this Section 5.14 and the Plan.

ARTICLE VI.

DIVIDENDS

Section 6.1 Declaration and Payment

Subject to Section 5.2, relating to Preferred Shares, the Trustees
shall declare dividends, payable from the assets of the Trust, in money or
otherwise, at such times, in such amounts and from such sources, whether
income, surplus, capital, or any combination thereof, as they in their
discretion may determine, and cause the same to be distributed to the
shareholders in amounts proportionate to the number of shares held by each
Shareholder. The Trustees may fix a record date for the determination of
holders of Preferred Shares entitled to receive payment of a dividend or a
distribution declared thereon, which record date shall be not more than 30 days
prior to the date fixed for the payment thereof.

Section 6.2 Statement of Source

Any distributions to Shareholders shall be accompanied by a statement
in writing identifying the source or sources to which the distribution is
charged. In case of doubt as to source, the writing shall so state, and the
required statement as to source shall be forwarded to Shareholders not later
than 60 days after the

42

<PAGE> 36
close of the fiscal year in which the distribution of doubtful source is made.

ARTICLE VII.

ACCOUNTING

Section 7.1 Standard

The books and records of the Trust shall be kept in conformity with
generally accepted principles of accounting, consistently applied.

Section 7.2 Inspection of Records

The share register or a duplicate thereof, the books of account, and
minutes of proceedings of the Shareholders and the Board of Trustees and of
committees of the Trustees, shall be open to inspection at any reasonable time
upon the written demand of any Shareholder, made upon the secretary or any
assistant secretary of the Trust, for a purpose reasonably related to his
interests as a Shareholder, and shall be exhibited at any time when required by
the demand at any Shareholders' meeting of ten percent of the Shares
represented at the meeting. Inspection by a Shareholder may be made in person
or by agent or attorney. The right of such inspection shall include the right
to make extracts. Each Trustee shall have the right at all reasonable times
during his term of office to inspect the records and property of the Trust.

Section 7.3 Annual Audit

The Trustees shall cause to be prepared at least annually, at the
expense of the Trust, a report of Trust operations, containing a balance sheet
and a statement of income and surplus and an opinion of an independent
certified public accountant on the financial statement. Such opinion shall be
based on an examination of the books and records of the Trust which is not
materially limited in scope and is made in accordance with generally accepted
auditing procedures. Within one hundred fifty (150) days after the close of
the period covered by the report, a signed copy of such report and opinion
shall be filed with the Trustees, and a copy thereof shall be sent to each
Shareholder.

Section 7.4 Interim Reports

Interim reports, containing a current balance sheet which may be
unaudited, shall be prepared at least quarterly and shall be furnished within a
reasonable time after the close of the quarter to each Shareholder.

ARTICLE VIII.

MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS

Section 8.1 Annual Meeting

The annual meeting of the Shareholders shall be held on a business day
during the fifth or sixth calendar month of the Trust's fiscal year, between
9:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., at Sacramento, California, or at such other location
in the State of California as the Trustees shall elect, provided, however, that
no annual meeting shall be held during calendar year 1995. Notice of the date,
hour and place of the meeting as determined by resolution of the Trustees, and
the annual report of Trust operations required by Section 7.3, shall be mailed
to shareholders at least 14 days before the day of the meeting.

Section 8.2 Special Meetings

8.2.1 Special meetings of Shareholders may be called at any
time and place by a majority of the Trustees. The Trustees shall cause a
special meeting to be called upon receipt of the written request of the
holders of more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the outstanding Shares of
each class of Shares entitled to vote on any matter to be considered at such
meeting, which request shall specify the purpose or purposes for which such
meeting is to be called. Such special meeting shall be held not less than 35
nor more than 90 days following receipt by the Trustees of such written request
of Shareholders. If for any reason an annual meeting of Shareholders as herein
provided for shall be omitted, a special meeting of Shareholders may
subsequently be held in lieu thereof and the business of the annual meeting may
be transacted thereat.

8.2.2 Notwithstanding Section 8.2.1, upon the written
request of the holders of that number of then outstanding Preferred Shares
which equal at least 10% of the aggregate number of Preferred Shares then
outstanding addressed to the Trustees at the principal office, the Trust shall
give notice of a special meeting of the holders of Preferred Shares for the
election of a Preferred Designee to fill any vacancy caused by the failure of
the holders of Preferred Shares to elect a Preferred Designee or by the death,
resignation or other inability to serve of the Preferred Designee, to be held
not less than 35 nor more than 60 days following receipt by the Trustees of
such written request. The record date for any such special meeting shall be
the date of receipt by the Trustees of such written request. If a notice of a
special meeting requested as aforesaid shall not be transmitted by the Trustees
within 20 days after receipt of the request, then the holders of at least 10%
of the Preferred Shares may designate in writing one of their number to call
such meeting, and the person so designated may call such meeting at the place
designated in the Declaration or the By-Laws of the Trust for meetings of the
Shareholders and upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice and for
that purpose shall have access to the Share register of the Trust.

44

<PAGE> 38

Section 8.3 Action Without Meeting

Whenever holders of the Preferred Shares or Common Shares are required
or permitted to take any action by vote, such action may be taken without a
meeting by written consent, setting forth the action so taken and signed by the
holders of the outstanding Preferred Shares or Common Shares, as the case may
be, having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all such shares entitled to
vote thereon were present and voted.

Section 8.4 Notice

Notice of all meetings of Shareholders shall be given at the direction
of the Trustees by the secretary or any other officer authorized by the
Trustees, and shall be mailed not less than 14 days nor more than 60 days
before the day of the meeting to each Shareholder at his address as given in
the register, or lacking such address, to such Shareholder addressed to the
principal office of the Trust. No business shall be transacted at any special
meeting of Shareholders unless notice of such business has been given in the
call for the meeting. Any adjourned meeting may be held as adjourned, without
further notice.

Section 8.5 Effect of Action

Except as otherwise expressly provided by law or this Declaration, no
action taken by the Shareholders at any meeting shall in any way bind the
Trustees in their management of the Trust.

Section 8.6 Record Date

Except as provided in Section 6.1, relating to dividends on Preferred
Shares, the Trustees may, without closing the transfer books, fix a date not
more than 45 days prior to the date of any meeting of Shareholders or dividend
payment as a record date for the determination of Shareholders entitled to vote
at such meeting or any adjournment thereof, or to receive such dividend. Any
person who is a registered Shareholder at the time so fixed shall be entitled
to vote or receive such dividend even though he has since that date disposed of
his Shares, and no Shareholder becoming such after that date shall be so
entitled to vote at such meeting or any adjournment thereof or to receive such
dividend.

Section 8.7 Quorum

A majority of the outstanding Shares of each class entitled to vote on
any matter to be voted on at a meeting of Shareholders represented in person or
by proxy shall constitute a quorum at any such meeting. The Shareholders
present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may
continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal
of enough Shareholders to leave less than a quorum. In the absence of

45

<PAGE> 39

a quorum, any meeting of Shareholders may be adjourned from time to time, up to
and including the 45th day following the originally noticed meeting date by an
affirmative vote of a majority of the Common Shares entitled to vote and
represented in person or by proxy at the meeting. At any meeting of
Shareholders called for the purpose of election of Trustees, holders of at
least a majority of the outstanding Preferred Shares, present in person or by
proxy, shall be sufficient to constitute a quorum for the election of a
Preferred Designee.

Section 8.8 Voting of Shares

8.8.1 Subject to the terms of Preferred Shares, which may
at the time be outstanding, each Common Share shall be entitled to one vote;
provided, that only holders of record as of the record date for the meeting
shall be entitled to vote at any meeting of Shareholders. Whenever any action
is to be taken by the Shareholders, it shall, except as otherwise required by
this Declaration or the provisions of any series of Preferred Shares which may
at the time be outstanding or by law, be authorized either by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the votes cast at a meeting of Shareholders by holders of
Common Shares entitled to vote thereon, or by written consents setting forth
the action so taken and signed by the holders of a majority of all outstanding
Common Shares entitled to vote thereon.

8.8.2 Whenever the vote or written consent of Shareholders
is required or permitted under this Declaration, such vote or consent may be
given either in person or by proxy. The trustees may solicit such proxies from
the Shareholders or any of them in any matter requiring or permitting the
Shareholders' vote or written consent. No proxy for any meeting of
Shareholders shall be effective unless such proxy shall have been received in
the office of the Trust, or such other location designated by the Trustees and
indicated in the material soliciting the proxies, for verification prior to the
meeting.

8.8.3 When a Share entitled to vote is held jointly by
several persons, any one of them may vote at any meeting in person or by proxy
with respect to such Share, but if more than one of them shall be present at
such meeting in person or by proxy and such joint owners or their proxies so
present disagree as to any vote to be cast, no vote shall be received with
respect to such Share.

8.8.4 Every Shareholder entitled to vote at any election of
trustees may cumulate such Shareholder's votes and give one candidate a number
of votes equal to the number of Trustees to be elected multiplied by the number
of votes to which the Shareholder's Share are normally entitled, or distribute
the Shareholder's votes on the same principle among as many candidates as the
Shareholder thinks fit, provided however, that no Shareholder shall be entitled
to cumulate votes (i.e., cast for any candidate a number of votes greater than
the number of votes which

46

<PAGE> 40
such Shareholder normally is entitled to cast) unless such candidate or
candidates' names have been placed in nomination prior to the voting and the
Shareholder has given notice at the meeting prior to the voting of the
Shareholder's intention to cumulate the Shareholder's votes. If any one
Shareholder has given such notice, all Shareholders may cumulate their votes
for candidates in nomination.

Section 8.9 Annual Report

At each annual meeting of Shareholders, the Trustees shall present a
report upon the affairs of the Trust and upon its business and operations.

ARTICLE IX.

dividend or distribution; provided, however, that the record date for payment

nomination prior to the voting and at least one shareholder has given notice at
the meeting prior to the voting of the shareholder's intention to cumulate
votes. The candidate(s) receiving the highest number of votes, up to the
number of trusteeships to be filled in the election, shall be elected.
(c) If any share is held jointly by several persons, any
one of them may vote at any meeting in person or by proxy in respect of such
share, but if more than one of them shall be present at such meeting in person
or by proxy, and such joint owners or their proxies so present disagree as to
any vote to be cast, such vote shall not be received in respect of such share.

56

<PAGE> 5
(d) Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian,
conservator or custodian may be voted by such holder either in person or by
proxy, without a transfer of such shares into the holder's name; and shares
standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by the trustee, either in person
or by proxy, but no trustee shall be entitled to vote shares held by such
trustee without a transfer of such shares into the trustee's name.
(e) Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be
voted by such receiver; and shares held by or under the control of a receiver
may be voted by such receiver without the transfer thereof into the receiver's
name if authority to do so is contained in the order of the court by which such
receiver was appointed.
(f) Shares standing in the name of a minor may be voted
and the Trust may treat all rights incident thereto as exercisable by the
minor, in person or by proxy, whether or not the Trust has notice, actual or
constructive, of the nonage, unless a guardian of the minor's property has been
appointed and written notice of such appointment given to the Trust.
(g) Except where otherwise agreed in writing between the
parties, a shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such
shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and
thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.
(h) Shares standing in the name of a corporation,
domestic or foreign, may be voted by such officer, agent or power as the bylaws
of such corporation may prescribe, or in the absence of such provision, as the
board of directors of such corporation may determine or, in the absence

57

<PAGE> 6

of such determination, by the chairman of the board, president or any vice
president of such corporation, or by any other person authorized to do so by
the board, president or any vice president of such other corporation. Shares
which are purported to be voted or any proxy purported to be executed in the
name of a corporation (whether or not any title of the person signing is
indicated) shall be presumed to be voted or the proxy executed in accordance
with the provisions of this subdivision, unless the contrary is shown. 
(i) Any shares held by the Trust in a fiduciary capacity shall 
not be entitled to vote on any matter, except to the extent that the settlor or 
beneficial owner possesses and exercises a right to vote or gives the Trust 
binding instructions as to how to vote such shares.

SECTION 6. Quorum. A majority of the outstanding shares of each class
of shares entitled to vote, represented in person or by proxy, shall constitute
a quorum at any meeting of shareholders. The shareholders present at a duly
called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to do business
until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough shareholders to
leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is
approved by at least a majority of the shares required to constitute a quorum.

58

<PAGE> 7

SECTION 7. Adjourned Meeting and Notice Thereof. Any shareholders'
meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time
by the vote of a majority of the shares, the holders of which are either
present in person or represented by proxy thereat, but in the absence of a
quorum (except as provided in Section 6 of this Article II) no other business
may be transacted at such meeting. It shall not be necessary to give any
notice of the time and place of the adjourned meeting or of the business to be
transacted thereat, other than by announcement at the meeting at which such
adjournment is taken; provided, however, when any shareholders' meeting is
adjourned for more than 45 days or, if after adjournment a new record date is
fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given
as in the case of an original meeting.

SECTION 8. Consent of Absentees. The transactions of any meeting of
shareholders, however called and noticed, and wherever held, are as valid as
though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice, if a quorum is
present either in person or by proxy, and if, either before or after the
meeting, each of the persons entitled to vote, not present in person or by
Proxy, signs a written waiver of notice, or a consent to the holding of the
meeting or an approval of the minutes of the meeting.

SECTION 9. Action Without Meeting. Any action which may be taken at
any annual or special meeting of shareholders may be taken

59

<PAGE> 8

without a meeting and without prior notice if a consent in writing, setting
forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding shares
having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to
authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote
thereon were present and voted. Unless a record date for voting purpose be
fixed as provided in Section 4 of this Article II, the record date for
determining shareholders entitled to give consent pursuant to this Section 9,
when no prior action by the Trustees has been taken, shall be the day on which
the first written consent is given.

SECTION 10. Proxies. Every person entitled to vote shares has the
right to do so either in person or by one or more persons authorized by a
written proxy executed by such shareholder and filed with a Trustee or officer
of the Trust. Any proxy duly executed is not revoked and continues in full
force and effect until revoked by the person executing it prior to the vote
pursuant thereto by a writing delivered to the Trust stating that the proxy is
revoked or by a subsequent proxy executed by, or by attendance at the meeting
and voting in person by, the person executing the proxy; provided, however,
that no proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven (11) months from
the date of its execution unless otherwise provided in the proxy.

SECTION 11. Inspectors of Election. In advance of any meeting of
shareholders, the Trustees may appoint any persons other

60

<PAGE> 9
than nominees for office as inspectors of election to act at such
meeting and any adjournment thereof. If inspectors of election be not so
appointed, or if any persons so appointed fail to appear or refuse to act, the
chairman of any such meeting may, and on the request of any shareholder or
shareholder's proxy shall, make such appointment at the meeting. The number of
inspectors shall be either one or three. If appointed at a meeting on the
request of one or more shareholders or proxies, the majority of shares present
shall determine whether one or three inspectors are to be appointed. The
duties of such inspector(s) shall include, but not necessarily be limited to,
determining the number of shares outstanding and the voting power of each, the
shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the
authenticity, validity, and effect of proxies; receiving votes, ballots, or
consents; hearing and determining all challenges and questions in any way
arising in connection with the right to vote; counting and tabulating all votes
or consents; determining when the polls shall close; determining the result of
the election or vote; and doing such acts as may be proper to conduct the
election or vote with fairness to all shareholders. If there are three
inspectors of election, the decision, act, or certificate of a majority is
effective in all respects as the decision, act, or certificate of all.

ARTICLE III. TRUSTEES

SECTION 1. Number and Qualifications. Subject to Section 3.3.3 of the
Declaration, there shall be not less than five (5) nor more than thirteen (13)
Trustees, the exact number to be fixed by the Trustees from time to time. No
reduction of the authorized number of Trustees shall have the effect of
removing any Trustee prior to the expiration of the Trustee's term of office. 
No person shall qualify as a Trustee unless that person is at least twenty-one
(21) years of age, and until that person shall have either signed the
Declaration or agreed in writing to be bound by the Declaration.

SECTION 2. Election. The election of Trustees is provided for in
Section 3.3 of the Declaration.

SECTION 3. Vacancies. The filling of vacancies on the Board is
provided for in Section 3.6 of the Declaration. The election to fill such a
vacancy shall be evidenced by an instrument in writing signed by a majority of
the Trustees; but no such election shall become effective unless and until such
instrument bearing the acceptance of the person so appointed has been
acknowledged by one or more of the existing Trustees. Thereupon, the Trust
property shall vest in the new Trustee jointly with the continuing Trustee or
Trustees without any further act or conveyance. The Trustees named in the
Declaration and/or their successors as Trustees shall

62

<PAGE> 11

hold office during the existence of this Trust; provided, however, that
any one or more Trustees may be removed and one or more new Trustees elected to
take the place of each such Trustee so removed. Whenever a vacancy in the
number of Trustees shall occur, until such vacancy is filled, the continuing or
surviving Trustee or Trustees shall have all the powers granted to the Trustees
and shall discharge all duties imposed upon the Trustees by the Declaration. 
The term "majority of the Trustees", except where otherwise defined herein,
shall mean more than one-half ( 1/2) of the total number of Trustees then in
office.

SECTION 4. Removal. Removal of a Trustee is provided for in Section
3.4 of the Declaration.

SECTION 5. Resignation. Any Trustee may resign as Trustee by a signed
instrument in writing which is delivered or mailed to the Trustees, and such
resignation shall take effect immediately or at a later date, according to the
terms of the notice; provided, however, that such resignation shall not become
effective until a copy of such resignation is recorded with the County Recorder
for the county in which the principal office of business of the Trust is
located.

SECTION 6. Cessation of Right, Title or Interest. Upon the
resignation, removal, or death of a Trustee, that Trustee shall automatically
cease to have any right, title, or interest in any

63

<PAGE> 12

properties or interest in properties of the Trust, and the right, title
and interest of such Trustee shall automatically vest, upon that Trustee's
resignation, removal, or death, in the remaining Trustees, if any.

SECTION 7. Survival of Trust. The death, resignation, or removal of
any one or more of the Trustees shall not operate to annul the Trust or to
revoke any existing agency created pursuant to the terms of the Declaration,
except as to the Trustee or Trustees whose term has been so terminated.

SECTION 8. Meetings. Meetings of the Trustees shall be held from time
to time upon the call of the Chairman of the Board or any two of the Trustees;
provided, that prior to the annual meeting of shareholders of the Trust to be
held during calendar year 1996, the Board shall meet no less frequently than
once during each quarter of each fiscal year of the Trust. Regular or special
meetings of the Trustees shall be held at any place within or without the State
of California which has been designated from time to time by the Trustees. In
the absence of such designation regular meetings shall be held at the principal
executive office of the Trust.

SECTION 9. Notice. Notice of any meetings shall be given not less
than seventy-two (72) hours prior to the meeting, but may be waived by any
Trustee either before or after such meeting. Notice may be given personally or
by telephone, telegraph, telex,

64

<PAGE> 13
facsimile or other similar means of communication. Any such notice
shall be addressed or delivered to each Trustee at such Trustee's address as it
is shown upon the records of the Trust or as may have been given to the Trust
by the Trustee for purposes of notice or, if such address is not shown on such
records or is not readily ascertainable, at the place in which the meetings of
the Trustees are regularly held. Notice by mail shall be deemed to have been
given at the time a written notice is deposited in the United States mail,
postage prepaid. Any other written notice shall be deemed to have been given at
the time it is personally delivered to the recipient or is delivered to a
common carrier for transmission, or is actually transmitted by the person
giving the notice by electronic means.

SECTION 10. Voting. The concurrence of all the Trustees shall not be
necessary for the validity of any action taken by them, but a decision
expressed in a vote passed at a meeting by a majority of the Trustees present
or expressed in writing signed by a majority of the Trustees without a meeting
shall constitute the action of the Trustees and have the same effect as if
assented to by all. At any meeting a majority of the Trustees shall constitute
a quorum. Any deed, mortgage, lease, or other instrument or writing executed
by one or more of the Trustees shall be valid and binding upon the Trustees and
upon the Trust when authorized by a vote or writing passed or signed as above
provided.

65
<PAGE> 14

SECTION 11. Telephone Conference. Trustees may participate in a
meeting through use of conference telephone or similar communications
equipment, so long as all Trustees participating in such meeting can hear one
another.

SECTION 12. Consent of Absentees. The transactions of any meeting of
the Trustees, however called and noticed or wherever held, are as valid as
though had at a meeting duly held after regular call and notice if a quorum be
present and if, either before or after the meeting, each of the Trustees not
present signs a written waiver of notice, a consent to holding such meeting or
an approval of the minutes thereof. All such waivers, consents, or approvals
shall be filed with the Trust records or made a part of the minutes of the
meeting.

SECTION 13. Adjourned Meeting and Notice Thereof. A majority of the
Trustees present, whether or not a quorum is present, may adjourn any Trustees'
meeting to another time and place. Notice of the time and place of holding an
adjourned meeting need not be given to absent Trustees if the time and place be
fixed at the meeting adjourned. If the meeting is adjourned for more than 24
hours, notice of any adjournment to another time or place shall be given prior
to the time of the adjourned meeting to the Trustees who were not present at
the time of the adjournment.

66

<PAGE> 15

SECTION 14. Action Without Meeting. Any action required or permitted
to be taken by the Trustees may be taken without a meeting if all Trustees
shall individually or collectively consent in writing to such action. Such
consent or consents shall have the same effect as a unanimous vote of the
Trustees and shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the
Trustees.

SECTION 15. Inspection Rights. Every Trustee shall have the right at
any reasonable time to inspect and copy all books, records, and documents of
every kind and to inspect the physical properties of the Trust. Such
inspection by a Trustee may be made in person or by agent or attorney and
includes the right to copy and obtain extracts.

SECTION 16. Compensation. Each Trustee shall receive such
remuneration from the Trust for Trustee's services as a Trustee as shall be
fixed from time to time by the Trustees. There shall be no requirement that
each Trustee receive compensation in the same amount.

SECTION 17. Executive Committee. The Trustees shall have power to
appoint and remove from among their own number an Executive Committee of three
(3) or more persons to whom they may delegate such of the powers herein given
to the Trustees as they may deem expedient, except as otherwise provided
herein.

67

<PAGE> 16

SECTION 18. Advisory Board. The Trustees may appoint an Advisory
Board. Members of this Board shall not be Trustees or officers of the Trust
but may be shareholders or retired Trustees. They shall be entitled to such
remuneration for their services as the Trustees from time to time deem
appropriate. The Trustees may at any time remove any member of the Advisory
Board and may appoint new or additional members. Any member may resign by
giving notice in writing to the Trustees. The Advisory Board shall consult
with and advise the Trustees as to the investment of the Trust property and
other matters relating to the business and affairs of the Trust. The Advisory
Board shall have no power or authority to make any contract or incur any
liability whatever or to take any action binding upon the Trust, the Trustees,
or the shareholders. The provisions of the Declaration and these Bylaws
relative to the exemption from personal liability of the Trustees, officers,
and agents of the Trust shall apply in all respects to members of the Advisory
Board.

SECTION 19. Reliance on Documents. The Trustees may rely on and
shall be protected in acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order, or other paper or
document which they believe to be genuine and to have been signed or presented
by the proper party or parties.

68

<PAGE> 17
SECTION 20. No Security Required. Except as required by law or by
any rule or order issued by the Commissioner of Corporations of California
applicable to real estate investment trusts, no Trustee shall be required to
provide a bond, surety, or security to secure the performance of such Trustee's
duties or obligations hereunder.

SECTION 21. Execution of Instruments. All instruments, whether or
not under seal (including, but not limited to, deeds, mortgages, leases,
contracts, bonds, notes, and agreements), may be executed on behalf of the
Trust by any Trustee or agent as shall be authorized by the Trustees herein
provided. Except as otherwise provided for in the Declaration or these Bylaws,
all agreements, obligations, instruments, papers, and actions by, or in the
name of, or on behalf of the Trust shall be made, incurred, executed, signed,
or taken by, or in the name of the Trust, and shall in such cases and in such
manner as the Trustees deem advisable, expressly exempt the Trustees and the
shareholders from personal liability and expressly provide that the Trust
property shall be liable thereunder by reason thereof; provided, however, in
any contract made by the Trustees, or their duly authorized agents, a provision
shall be included eliminating any personal liability of the Trustees or
shareholders by reason of such contract, which provision shall be in
substantially the following form:

69

<PAGE> 18
"This contract is made by the undersigned, [name of
Trustee(s)], not individually, but as Trustee(s) under that
certain Restated Declaration of Trust of The Peregrine Real
Estate Trust, and hereby made a part hereof, and is
enforceable only against, and is payable out of, the Trust
property held thereunder, and any and all personal liability
of the Trustee(s), their duly authorized agents, and the
shareholders of said Trust is expressly waived."

SECTION 22. Interested Trustees. No contract or other transaction
between the Trust and any other person, firm, association, or corporation shall
be void or voidable because of the fact that one or more Trustees of the Trust
is a director, partner, or member of, or otherwise interested in or affiliated
with such other person, firm, association, or corporation, provided that such
contract or transaction shall be approved or ratified by the affirmative vote
of a majority of the Trustees who are not so interested at a meeting of the
Trustees, and that the fact of the interest of such interested Trustees shall
be disclosed or known to such approving majority of the Trustees. Any Trustee
so interested present at any meeting of the Trustees may be counted in
determining the existence of a quorum at such meeting, provided, however, that
it is the intent of the Trustees that any

70

<PAGE> 19

relationship of any of the Trustees with any independent contractor
dealing with the Trust shall meet the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and the
requirements set forth in any rule or order issued by the California
Corporations Commissioner relative to real estate investment trusts, in order
that the Trust be treated as a qualified real estate investment trust.

SECTION 23. Powers. Subject to any limitations of the Declaration
and these Bylaws, the business and affairs of the Trust shall be managed by the
Trustees. All Trust powers, including, but not limited to, those powers set
forth in the Declaration and these Bylaws, shall be exercised by or under the
direction of the Trustees. The Trustees may delegate the management of the
day-to- day operation of the business of the Trust to a management company, or,

shareholders shall not be personally liable upon any debt, claim, demand, suit,
judgment, note, or other obligation of the Trust or of the Trustees, in tort,
contract, or otherwise, in connection with Trust property or the affairs of the
Trust, and the Trustees shall have no power to bind the shareholders personally
in any manner whatsoever. The liability of the shareholders shall be limited
to their share of the capital of the Trust and shall not be increased in any
manner. Any amendment to the Declaration or these Bylaws increasing the
liability of the shareholders shall be void. All written contracts to which
the Trust is a party shall include a provision substantially in the form set
forth in Section 21 of Article III of these Bylaws.

SECTION 2. Trustees; Officers; Agents. No Trustee, officer, or agent
of the Trust shall be liable on account of any act or omission of any other

and defaults (including without limitation the failure to compel in any way
former or acting Trustee to redress any breach of Trust) to the Trust or to

77

<PAGE> 26

any shareholder, Trustee, officer, or agent thereof, except for such of
his own acts as shall constitute bad faith, willful misfeasance, gross
negligence, or reckless disregard of his duties.

SECTION 3. Indemnification. The Trust shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Trustee, officer, and agent from and against all claims and
liabilities to which such trustee, officer, or agent may become subject by
reason of his having been or being a Trustee, officer, or agent, or by reason
of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted by him as Trustee, officer,
or agent and shall reimburse such Trustee for all legal and other expenses
which such Trustee reasonably incurs in connection with any such claim or
liability; provided, however, that no Trustee shall be indemnified or
reimbursed under the foregoing provisions in relation to that Trustee's own act
as shall constitute bad faith, willful misfeasance, gross negligence, or
reckless disregard of that Trustee's duties. The rights accruing to a Trustee,
officer, or agent under these provisions shall not exclude any other right to
which such Trustee may lawfully be entitled, nor shall anything herein
contained restrict the right of the Trust to indemnify or reimburse such
Trustee, officer, or agent in any proper cause even though not specifically
provided for herein; provided, that no Trustee, officer or agent may satisfy
any right of indemnity or reimbursement granted herein or to which that Trustee
may be otherwise entitled except out of the property of the Trust, and no

78

<PAGE> 27

shareholder shall be personally liable with respect to any claim of a Trustee,
officer, or agent for indemnity or reimbursement.

SECTION 4. Insurance. The Trust shall have power to purchase and
maintain insurance on behalf of any agent, Trustee, shareholder, or independent
contractor of the Trust (the "Insured") against any obligation or liability

indemnify the Insured against such liability under the provisions of this
Article V.

provisions of these Bylaws may be amended or repealed with the vote or written

<PAGE> 28
ARTICLE VII. MISCELLANEOUS

SECTION 1. Choice of Law. This instrument is by the Trustees and
delivered in the State of California with reference to the laws thereof, and

hereof shall be subject to and construed according to the laws of said State.

SECTION 2. Headnotes and Titles. The headnotes and titles of articles

8.7 Form, Registration, Transfer and Exchange of Notes; Lost
Notes. The Notes are issuable as registered notes without coupons in
denominations of at least $1,000,000, except as may be necessary to reflect any
principal amount not evenly divisible by $1,000,000; provided that the Interest
Deferral Notes are issuable as registered notes without coupons in any
denomination. Company shall keep at its principal office a register in which
Company shall provide for the registration of Notes and of transfers of Notes.
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Note at the principal office
of Company, Company shall, at its expense, execute and deliver one or more new
Notes of like tenor and of a like aggregate principal amount, registered in the
name of such transferee or transferees. At the option of the holder of any
Note, such Note may be exchanged for other Notes of like tenor and of any
authorized denominations, of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender
of the Note to be exchanged at the principal office of Company. Whenever any
Notes are so surrendered for exchange, Company shall, at its expense, execute
and deliver the Notes which the holder making the exchange is entitled to
receive. Every Note surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall
be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer duly
executed, by the holder or such holder's attorney duly authorized in writing.
Any Note or Notes issued in exchange for any Note or upon transfer thereof
shall carry the rights to unpaid interest and interest to accrue which were
carried by the Note so exchanged or transferred, so that neither gain nor loss
of interest shall result from any such transfer or exchange. Upon receipt of
written notice from the holder of any Note of the loss, theft or destruction,
upon receipt of such holder's unsecured indemnity agreement, or in the case of
any such mutilation upon surrender and cancellation of such Note, Company will
make and deliver a new Note, of like tenor, in lieu of the lost, stolen,
destroyed or mutilated Note.

8.8 Persons Deemed Owners; Participations. Prior to due
presentment for registration of transfer, Company and Agent may treat the
person or entity in whose name any Note is registered as the owner and holder
of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and interest
on such Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Note
shall be overdue, and Company and Agent shall not be affected by notice to the
contrary. Subject to the preceding sentence, the holder of any Note may from
time to time grant participations in such Note to any person or entity on such
terms and conditions as may be determined by such holder in its sole and
absolute discretion.

8.9 Parties; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement and the
other Documents shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the
successors of Agent, the permitted successors of Company, and the assigns,
transferees and endorsees of Noteholders. No other person or entity shall be
deemed to be a third-party beneficiary of any of the provisions of the
Documents or otherwise have any rights by reason of any provision of the
Documents.

8.10 Disgorgement; Revival of Obligations. In the event that any
payments, collections or proceeds of Collateral paid or distributed to or
realized by Noteholders, or any other payment made to any Noteholder pursuant
to the terms hereof, is required to be disgorged, returned, repaid, turned
over, or refunded to Company or to any other person or entity, including,
without limitation any debtor in possession or bankruptcy trustee, the
Obligations shall be reinstated, revived, or restored by the amount that is
required to be disgorged, returned, repaid, turned over, or refunded, the same
as if such payment, distribution, or realization had never been made. The
Obligations, as reinstated, revived, or restored, shall continue to be secured
by Collateral Agent's security interest in the Collateral.

8.11 Conflict of Terms. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or any of the other Documents by specific reference to the applicable
provisions of this Agreement, if any provision contained in this Agreement is
in conflict with, or is inconsistent with, any provision in any of the other
Documents, the provision contained in this Agreement shall govern and control,
except that this Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement. If the provisions of one agreement give Noteholders
greater or broader rights than the provisions of any other agreement, those
provisions shall not be deemed to be inconsistent or in conflict, and
Noteholders shall have the full benefit of the greater or broader provisions.

8.12 Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction and Venue. Except as
otherwise expressly provided in any of the Documents, in all respects,
including all matters of construction, validity and performance, this
Agreement, the Notes and the other Documents, and the Obligations arising
hereunder and thereunder, shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in
accordance with, the laws of the State of California applicable to contracts
made and performed in such state, without regard to the

131
<PAGE> 50

principles thereof regarding conflict of laws, and any applicable laws of the
United States of America. COMPANY, AGENT AND EACH NOTEHOLDER CONSENTS TO
PERSONAL JURISDICTION, WAIVES ANY OBJECTION AS TO JURISDICTION OR VENUE, AND
AGREES NOT TO ASSERT ANY DEFENSE BASED ON LACK OF JURISDICTION OR VENUE, IN ANY
STATE AND FEDERAL COURT SITUATED IN CALIFORNIA. Service of process on Company,
Agent or any Noteholder in any action arising out of or relating to any of the
Documents shall be effective if mailed to such party at the address specified
in the Schedule of Notices. Nothing herein shall preclude Agent, any
Noteholder or Company from bringing suit or taking other legal action in any
other jurisdiction.

8.13 MUTUAL WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. BECAUSE DISPUTES ARISING IN
CONNECTION WITH COMPLEX FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS ARE MOST QUICKLY AND
ECONOMICALLY RESOLVED BY AN EXPERIENCED AND EXPERT PERSON AND THE PARTIES WISH
APPLICABLE STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS TO APPLY (RATHER THAN ARBITRATION RULES), THE
PARTIES DESIRE THAT THEIR DISPUTES BE RESOLVED BY A JUDGE APPLYING SUCH
APPLICABLE LAWS. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO SPECIFICALLY WAIVES SUCH PARTY'S
RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CAUSE OF ACTION, CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM,
COUNTERCLAIM, THIRD PARTY CLAIM OR ANY OTHER CLAIM (COLLECTIVELY, "CLAIMS")
ASSERTED BY COMPANY AGAINST AGENT AND/OR ANY ONE OR MORE NOTEHOLDERS, OR BY
AGENT AND/OR ANY ONE OR MORE NOTEHOLDERS AGAINST COMPANY. THIS WAIVER EXTENDS
TO ALL SUCH CLAIMS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CLAIMS WHICH INVOLVE PERSONS
OR ENTITIES OTHER THAN AGENT, NOTEHOLDERS AND COMPANY; CLAIMS WHICH ARISE OUT
OF OR ARE IN ANY WAY CONNECTED TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMPANY, AGENT AND
NOTEHOLDERS; AND ANY CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES, BREACH OF CONTRACT ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT, SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE, OR ANY EQUITABLE OR LEGAL RELIEF OF ANY KIND.

8.14 Notices. Except as otherwise provided herein, any notice or
other communication required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been validly served, given or delivered (a)

writing by the party entitled to receive such notice. Failure or delay in
delivering copies of any notice or other communication to the persons
designated herein or in the Schedule of Notices hereof to receive

132
<PAGE> 51

copies shall in no way adversely affect the effectiveness of such notice or
other communication.

8.15 Survival. The representations and warranties of Company in 
this Agreement shall survive the execution, delivery and acceptance hereof by 
the parties hereto and the closing of the transactions described herein or 
related hereto.

Declaration of Trust of Company, this contract is made by the undersigned
trustee, not individually, but as Trustee under a certain Declaration of Trust
creating Commonwealth Equity Trust, and hereby made a part hereof, and is
enforceable only against, and is payable out of, the Trust property held
thereunder, and any and all personal liability of the Trustees, their duly
authorized agents, and the shareholders of said Trust is expressly waived.

Deferral Note in the principal amount equal to the sum of the interest and
other monies then due and payable to Holder on such Payment Date.

Commencing on November 1, 1996 and at all times thereafter,
interest accruing hereunder from and after October 1, 1996, shall be paid

entirety that certain Secured Promissory Note (One Year Note) dated July 17,
1992, in the original principal amount of _____________________ 
($ ), made by Maker in favor of Holder.

Maker's failure to make timely payment of any installment of
principal or other sums due hereunder, or the occurrence of any Event of
Default under the Note Agreement, shall constitute a default under this Note.
Upon the occurrence of a default hereunder, regardless of the cause therefor,
Holder may immediately declare the entire balance of this Note to be
immediately due and payable and exercise any and all of the rights and remedies
available under the Note Agreement, the Security Agreement, the Deeds of Trust,
and applicable law. From and after the occurrence of a Default hereunder or
an Event of Default under the Note Agreement, the unpaid principal balance
hereunder shall, at Holder's option as provided in the Note Agreement, bear
interest at the Default Rate specified in the Note Agreement. Any installment
or principal or interest that is not paid when due hereunder shall be added to
the principal balance hereof and shall thereafter bear interest, at Holder's
option, at the Default Rate until paid.

In no contingency or event whatsoever shall the aggregate of
all amounts deemed interest hereunder and charged or collected by Holder or any
holder hereof exceed the highest rate

<PAGE> 71

permissible under any law which a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a
final determination, deem applicable hereto. In the event that such a court
determines that Holder has charged or received interest hereunder in excess of
the highest applicable rate, the rate in effect hereunder shall automatically
be reduced to the maximum rate permitted by applicable law and Holder shall
apply all interest paid in excess of the maximum lawful rate to the principal
balance of this Note. It is the intent of the parties hereto that Maker not
pay or contract to pay, and that Holder not receive or contract to receive,
directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever, interest in excess of that
which may be paid by Maker to Holder under applicable law.

This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of California, except to the extent Holder has
greater rights or remedies under federal law, in which case such choice of
California law shall not be deemed to deprive Holder of such rights and
remedies as may be available under federal law.

If any provision of this Note or the application hereof to any
person or circumstance shall, for any reason or to any extent, be invalid or
unenforceable, neither the remainder of this Note nor the application of such
provision to any other person or circumstance shall be affected thereby, but
rather the same shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law,
except that if such provision relates to the payment of any monetary sum, then
Holder may, at its option, declare the entire indebtedness evidenced hereby
immediately due and payable.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Maker has executed this

2.1 ADVANCES.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, Foothill agrees to make advances to Borrower (the "Loan") in
an aggregate amount outstanding at any one time equal to the Maximum Amount.
If, at any time or for any reason, the amount of Obligations owed by Borrower
to Foothill pursuant to this Section 2.1 is greater than the Maximum Amount, as
such amount may be reduced as a result of a Permitted Disposition or otherwise
(an "Overadvance"), Borrower immediately shall pay to Foothill, in cash, the
amount of such excess.

(b) Anything to the contrary in
subsection (a) above notwithstanding, Foothill may create reasonable reserves
against the Maximum Amount without declaring an Event of Default if it
determines, in its reasonable discretion, that there is a material impairment
of the prospect of repayment of all or any portion of the Obligations or a
material impairment of the value or priority of Foothill's security interests

reserve amount shall not be considered a disbursement bearing interest
hereunder, but rather simply shall be an amount that is not available for
borrowing by Borrower.

206
<PAGE> 21
(c) Foothill is authorized to make
advances under this Agreement based upon written instructions received from an
Authorized Officer of Borrower or, without instructions, if pursuant to Section
2.2(d). Provided Borrower satisfies all conditions precedent in Section 3.1 or

reasonably prompt basis. Borrower and Foothill agree that there shall be no
minimum amount required of any advance requested by Borrower pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, Borrower shall not
make more than one (1) request for an advance per day. Borrower agrees to
establish and maintain a single designated deposit account for the purpose of
receiving the proceeds of the advances requested by Borrower and made by
Foothill hereunder. Unless otherwise agreed by Foothill and Borrower, any
advance requested by Borrower and made by Foothill hereunder shall be made to
such designated deposit account. Amounts borrowed pursuant to this Section 2.1
may be repaid and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
reborrowed at any time during the term of this Agreement.

(d) Anything to the contrary in this
Agreement notwithstanding, in the event that, at any time and from time to
time, the NOI for the preceding twelve (12) months ("Comparison NOI") for all
of the parcels then composing the Real Property taken as a whole does not
exceed seventy percent (70%) of the Base NOI, then the then current Maximum
Amount automatically shall be reduced to the following percentage of the
Maximum Amount:

For purposes of the foregoing, upon the consummation of a Permitted
Disposition, the Base NOI and the Comparison NOI each shall be recalculated to
eliminate permanently the effects of the Real Property that was the subject of
such Permitted Disposition. If, at any time after a reduction of the Maximum
Amount as a result of the provisions of this Section 2.1(d), the Comparison NOI
again exceeds seventy percent (70%) of the Base NOI, in each case as they may
be adjusted, Foothill may elect, in its sole and unrestricted discretion, to
increase the Maximum Amount to an amount up to the amount which the Maximum
Amount would equal were it not for reductions made pursuant to this Section
2.1(d), but subject to the reductions in the Maximum Amount made pursuant to
Section 2.1(e).

(e) Immediately upon the consummation of each
Permitted Disposition, the then current Maximum Amount automatically shall be
reduced permanently by an amount equal to eighty percent (80%) of the Release
Amount applicable to the Real Property that is the subject of such Permitted
Disposition; provided, however, that in the case of a Permitted Disposition of
one of the Six Properties, if Borrower has given Foothill thirty (30) days
prior written notice thereof and if Foothill does not agree to reduce the
foregoing percentage to fifty-five percent (55%) of the Release Amount
applicable to the Real Property that is the subject of such Permitted
Disposition on or before the date of the consummation thereof, then, for a
period of one hundred and twenty (120) days following such consummation,
Borrower shall have the option to terminate this Agreement by paying to
Foothill, in cash, the Obligations, without any penalty or premium (including
the Early Termination Premium).

2.2 INTEREST: RATES, PAYMENTS, AND CALCULATIONS.

(a) Interest Rate. The Obligations
shall bear interest, on the average Daily Balance, at a rate of two and
one-quarter (2-1/4) percentage points above the Reference Rate.

(b) Default Rate. The Obligations shall
bear interest, from and after the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default at a rate equal to four and three-quarters (4-3/4) percentage
points above the Reference Rate.

(c) Minimum Interest. In no event shall
the rate of interest chargeable hereunder be less than eight and one-half
percent (8-1/2%) per annum, nor shall the annual interest charged be less than
One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000.00). To the extent that interest
accrued hereunder at the rate set forth herein (including the minimum interest
rate) would yield less than the foregoing minimum amount, the interest rate
chargeable hereunder for the period in question automatically shall be deemed
increased to that rate that would result in the minimum amount of interest
being accrued and payable hereunder.

209
<PAGE> 24
(d) Payments. Interest hereunder shall
be due and payable, in arrears, on the first day of each month during the term
hereof. Borrower hereby authorizes Foothill, at its option, without prior
notice to Borrower, to charge such interest, all Foothill Expenses (as and when
incurred), and all installments or other payments due under this Agreement or
any note or other Loan Document to Borrower's loan account, which amounts shall
thereafter accrue interest at the rate then applicable hereunder. Any interest
not paid when due shall be compounded by becoming a part of the Obligations,
and such interest shall thereafter accrue interest at the rate then applicable
hereunder.

(e) Computation. The Reference Rate as
of the date of this Agreement is seven and three quarters percent (7.75%) per
annum. In the event the Reference Rate is changed from time to time hereafter,
the applicable rate of interest hereunder automatically and immediately shall
be increased or decreased by an amount equal to such change in the Reference
Rate. All interest and fees chargeable under the Loan Documents shall be
computed on the basis of a three hundred sixty (360) day year for the actual
number of days elapsed.

(f) Intent to Limit Charges to Maximum
Lawful Rate. In no event shall the interest rate or rates payable under this
Agreement, plus any other amounts paid in connection herewith, exceed the
highest rate permissible under any law that a court of competent jurisdiction
shall, in a final determination, deem applicable. Borrower and Foothill, in
executing this Agreement, intend to legally agree upon the rate or rates of
interest and manner of payment stated within it; provided, however, that,
anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if said rate or
rates of interest or manner of payment exceeds the maximum allowable under
applicable law, then, ipso facto as of the date of this Agreement, Borrower is
and shall be liable only for the payment of such maximum as allowed by law, and
payment received from Borrower in excess of such legal maximum, whenever
received, shall be applied to reduce the principal balance of the Obligations
to the extent of such excess.

2.3 CREDITING PAYMENTS. The receipt of any wire transfer
of funds, check, or other item of payment by Foothill (whether from transfers
to Foothill by Borrower, from the Lockbox Bank pursuant to the Lockbox
Agreement, or otherwise) immediately shall be applied to provisionally reduce
the Obligations, but shall not be considered a payment on account unless such
wire transfer is of immediately available federal funds and is made to the
appropriate deposit account of Foothill or unless and until such check or other
item of payment is honored when presented for payment. Anything to the
contrary contained herein notwithstanding, any wire transfer, check, or other
item of payment shall be deemed received by Foothill only if it is received
into Foothill's operating account (as such account is identified by Foothill to
Borrower) on or before 11:00 a.m. Los Angeles time. If any wire transfer,
check, or other item of payment is received into Foothill's operating account
(as such account is identified by Foothill to Borrower) after 11:00 a.m. Los
Angeles time it shall be deemed to have been received by Foothill as

210
<PAGE> 25
of the opening of business on the immediately following Business Day. Any
advance requested by Borrower and made by Foothill hereunder shall not begin to
accrue interest unless and until the date on which Foothill has transferred
immediately available funds to the designated deposit account of Borrower.

2.4 STATEMENTS OF OBLIGATIONS. Foothill shall
render statements to Borrower of the Obligations, including principal,
interest, fees, and including an itemization of all charges and expenses

3.2 CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO ALL ADVANCES. The
following shall be conditions precedent to all advances under the Loan:

(a) the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be true and
correct in all material respects on and as of the date of such advance as
though made on and as of such date (except to the extent that such
representations and warranties relate solely to an earlier date);

(b) no Event of Default or event which,
with the giving of notice or passage of time and nothing else, would constitute

(c) no injunction, writ, restraining
order, or other order of any nature prohibiting, directly or indirectly, the
making of such advance shall have been issued and remain in force by any
governmental authority against Borrower, Foothill, or any of their Affiliates.

3.3 TERM. This Agreement shall become effective
upon the execution and delivery hereof by Borrower and Foothill and shall
continue in full force and effect for a term, unless earlier terminated
pursuant to the terms hereof, ending on the date that is three (3) years from
the Effective Date of Plan, at which such time all Obligations should be due
and payable.

3.4 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. On the date of
termination, all Obligations immediately shall become due and payable without
notice or demand. No termination of this Agreement, however, shall relieve or
discharge Borrower of Borrower's duties, Obligations, or covenants hereunder,
and Foothill's continuing security interests in the Collateral shall remain in
effect until all Obligations have been fully and finally discharged and
Foothill's obligation to provide advances hereunder is terminated.

3.5 EARLY TERMINATION BY BORROWER. Borrower has
the option, at any time upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to Foothill,
to terminate this

213
<PAGE> 28
Agreement by paying to Foothill, in cash, the Obligations. If Borrower elects
to terminate this Agreement prior to its scheduled maturity date, Borrower
shall pay Foothill, in cash, in addition to the Obligations a premium ("Early
Termination Premium") in an amount equal to the greater of: (a) the total
amount of interest paid by Borrower to Foothill hereunder during the prior six
(6) months (including a prorated portion of the minimum annual interest
charge), and (b) Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000). The provisions
of this Section 3.5 to the contrary notwithstanding, (a) in the event that
Foothill creates a reserve against the Maximum Amount pursuant to Section
2.1(b), then for a period of ninety (90) days after such reserve is first
imposed or until the removal thereof by Foothill, whichever first occurs,
Borrower shall be entitled to prepay the Obligations in cash and terminate this
Agreement, in which event the Early Termination Premium shall not be payable,
and (b) in the event that Borrower seeks and obtains a commitment from another
financial institution to refinance the Obligations hereunder, and if Foothill
participates as a lender in such financing, the Early Termination Premium shall
not be payable.

3.6 TERMINATION UPON EVENT OF DEFAULT. If
Foothill terminates this Agreement upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
in view of the impracticability and extreme difficulty of ascertaining actual
damages and by mutual agreement of the parties as to a reasonable calculation
of Foothill's lost profits as a result thereof, Borrower shall pay to Foothill
upon the effective date of such termination, a premium in an amount equal to
the Early Termination Premium. The Early Termination Premium shall be presumed
to be the amount of damages sustained by Foothill as the result of the early
termination and Borrower agrees that it is reasonable under the circumstances
currently existing. The Early Termination Premium shall be deemed included in
the Obligations.

4. CREATION OF SECURITY INTEREST.

4.1 GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST. Borrower hereby
grants to Foothill a continuing security interest in all currently existing and
hereafter acquired or arising Personal Property Collateral in order to secure
prompt repayment of any and all Obligations and in order to secure prompt
performance by Borrower of each of its covenants and duties under the Loan
Documents. Foothill's security interests in the Personal Property Collateral
shall attach to all Collateral without further act on the part of Foothill or
Borrower.

4.2 NEGOTIABLE COLLATERAL. In the event that any
Collateral, including proceeds, is evidenced by or consists of an instrument or
other negotiable collateral, Borrower shall, immediately upon the request of
Foothill, endorse and assign such negotiable collateral to Foothill and deliver
physical possession of such negotiable Collateral to Foothill.

214
<PAGE> 29
4.3 COLLECTION OF RENTS, ISSUES, PROFITS,
ACCOUNTS, GENERAL INTANGIBLES, AND NEGOTIABLE COLLATERAL. On and after the
occurrence of, and during the continuation of, an Event of Default, Foothill,
Borrower, and the Lockbox Bank shall, at Foothill's election, which election
must be made during the continuation of an Event of Default and in a writing
sent by Foothill to Borrower, enter into the Lockbox Agreement, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Foothill, pursuant to which all of
Borrower's cash receipts, checks, and other items of payment relating to the
Collateral (including, insurance proceeds, proceeds of cash sales, rental
proceeds, and tax refunds) will be forwarded to Foothill on a daily basis. On
and after such an election by Foothill, Borrower agrees that it will hold in
trust for Foothill, as Foothill's trustee, any cash receipts, checks, and other
items of payment (including, insurance proceeds, proceeds of cash sales, rental
proceeds, and tax refunds) that it receives and immediately will deliver said
cash receipts, checks, and other items of payment to the Lockbox Bank for
deposit to the Lockbox Account in their original form as received by Borrower.

4.4 RELEASE OF PORTIONS OF THE REAL PROPERTY. So
long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, so long as no Event
of Default would occur as a result thereof, and subject to the satisfaction of
each of the following conditions, Foothill shall, from time to time, upon
twenty (20) Business Days prior written request therefor, deliver to an escrow
or title company, a partial reconveyance or release of its lien upon a parcel
composing the Real Property:

(i) Foothill shall have received or
shall receive, concurrent with the delivery of such release or
reconveyance, the Release Amount for the subject parcel of the Real
Property;

(ii) the proposed release or reconveyance
is of one of the fourteen (14) legal parcels set forth on Schedule R-1
attached hereto and not a subdivision thereof;

(iii) prior to the transfer date, Borrower
shall have delivered an irrevocable instruction to the escrow or title
company directing that they are only authorized to record the release
or the reconveyance upon payment of the applicable Release Amount to
Foothill; and

(iv) prior to or on the transfer date,
Beneficiary shall reimburse Foothill for the reasonable cost of
preparing, reviewing, and delivering the releases or reconveyances.

Neither the acceptance of any payment nor the issuance of any
partial reconveyance by Foothill shall affect Borrower's liability to pay all
amounts owing under this Agreement or the lien of any Mortgage on the remainder
of the Real Property not reconveyed. Upon written request of Foothill and
surrender of any Mortgage to the

215
<PAGE> 30
applicable trustee for cancellation or endorsement, and upon payment of its
fees and charges, said trustee shall reconvey, without warranty, all or any
part of the Real Property then subject to the applicable Mortgage. Any
reconveyance, whether full or partial, may be made in terms to "the person or
persons legally entitled thereto," and the recitals in such reconveyance of any
matters or facts shall be conclusive proof of the truthfulness thereof.

4.5 DELIVERY OF ADDITIONAL DOCUMENTATION
REQUIRED. At any time upon the request of Foothill, Borrower shall execute and
deliver to Foothill all financing statements, continuation financing
statements, fixture filings, security agreements, chattel mortgages, mortgages,
deeds of trust, pledges, assignments, endorsements, affidavits, reports,
notices, letters of authority, and all other documents that Foothill may
reasonably request, in form satisfactory to Foothill, to perfect and continue
perfected Foothill's security interests in the Collateral and in order to fully
consummate all of the transactions contemplated hereby and under the other the
Loan Documents.

4.6 POWER OF ATTORNEY. Borrower hereby
irrevocably makes, constitutes, and appoints Foothill (and any of Foothill's
officers, employees, or agents designated by Foothill) as Borrower's true and
lawful attorney, with power to: (a) if Borrower refuses to, or fails timely to
execute and deliver any of the documents described in Section 4.5, sign the
name of Borrower on any of the documents described in Section 4.5; (b) at any
time that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, sign Borrower's
name on any invoice or bill relating to any Related Account or Related Rents,
drafts against account debtors with respect to Related Accounts or Related
Rents, schedules and assignments of Related Accounts or Related Rents,
verifications of Related Accounts or Related Rents, and notices to account
debtors with respect to Related Accounts or Related Rents; (c) send requests
for verification of Related Accounts or Related Rents; (d) at any time that an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or that the Lockbox Agreement
is in effect, endorse Borrower's name on any checks, notices, acceptances,
money orders, drafts, or other item of payment or security that may come into
Foothill's possession; (e) at any time that an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, make, settle, and adjust all claims under Borrower's
policies of insurance respecting the Collateral and make all determinations and
decisions with respect to such policies of insurance; and (f) at any time that
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, settle and adjust disputes
and claims respecting the Related Accounts directly with the account debtors
thereof, for amounts and upon terms which Foothill determines to be reasonable,
and Foothill may cause to be executed and delivered any documents and releases
which Foothill determines to be necessary. The appointment of Foothill as
Borrower's attorney, and each and every one of Foothill's rights and powers,
being coupled with an interest, is irrevocable until all of the Obligations
have been fully and finally repaid and performed and Foothill's obligation to
extend credit hereunder is terminated.

4.7 RIGHT TO INSPECT. Foothill (through any of
its officers, employees, or agents) shall have the right, from time to time
hereafter to inspect

216
<PAGE> 31
Borrower's Books and to check, test, and appraise the Collateral in order to
verify Borrower's financial condition or the amount, quality, value, condition
of, or any other matter relating to, the Collateral; provided, however, that
Foothill (i) may conduct no more than one financial examination per quarter and
one Collateral appraisal per annum, unless either (a) an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, or (b) the NOI for the preceding twelve (12) months
with respect to a parcel of the Real Property is less than seventy percent
(70%) of the Base NOI applicable to such parcel of Real Property, in which case
Foothill may conduct as many financial examinations or Collateral appraisals as
it reasonably deems necessary; and (ii) exercises its rights to perform or
cause to be performed such inspections, checks, tests and appraisals in a
manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with Borrower's operations conducted
on the Real Property.

5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

In order to induce Foothill to enter into this
Agreement, Borrower makes the following representations and warranties, which
shall be true, correct, and complete in all material respects as of the Closing
Date and at and as of the date of each advance under the Loan, as though made
on and as of the date of such advance under the Loan (except to the extent that
such representations and warranties expressly relate solely to an earlier
date), such representations and warranties to survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement:

5.1 STATUS. Borrower (a) is duly organized and
validly formed as a real estate investment trust under California law, formed
pursuant to the Declaration of Trust, and has not been dissolved, revoked, or
terminated, and no action has been taken to dissolve, revoke, or terminate
Borrower, (b) has all requisite power and authority and all necessary licenses
and permits to own and operate its properties and to carry on its business as
now conducted and as currently proposed to be conducted, where failure to have
such power, authority, licenses, and permits might have a Material Adverse
Effect, and (c) has been duly qualified and is authorized to do business in
each jurisdiction, if any, where failure to qualify might have a Material
Adverse Effect.

5.2 NO PRIOR ENCUMBRANCES. Borrower has good and
indefeasible title to the Collateral, free and clear of liens, claims, security
interests, or encumbrances, except for Permitted Liens.

5.3 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. To the best of
Borrower's knowledge, after due inquiry, all state and federal laws have been
complied with in conjunction with Borrower's ownership or operation of the
Collateral, the non-compliance with which would have a material adverse effect
upon the value of the Collateral.

217
<PAGE> 32
5.4 AUTHORITY TO ASSIGN. Borrower has such title
to the Real Property as it acquired and full right and authority to pledge,
assign, and encumber the same.

5.5 LOCATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICE; FEIN.
The chief executive offices of Borrower is located at the address indicated in
the preamble to this Agreement and its FEIN number is 94-2255677.

5.6 DUE AUTHORIZATION; NO CONFLICT. The
execution, delivery, and performance of the Loan Documents are within
Borrower's trust powers, have been duly authorized, and are not in conflict
with nor constitute a breach of any provision contained in Borrower's
Declaration of Trust, nor will they constitute an event of default under any
material agreement to which Borrower is a party or by which its properties or
assets may be bound.

5.7 LITIGATION. There are no actions or
proceedings pending by or against Borrower before any court or administrative
agency and Borrower does not have knowledge or belief of any pending,
threatened, or imminent litigation, governmental investigations, or claims,
complaints, actions, or prosecutions involving Borrower or any guarantor of the
Obligations, except for ongoing collection matters in which Borrower is the
plaintiff and matters arising after the date hereof that, if decided adversely
to Borrower, would not materially impair the prospect of repayment of the
Obligations or materially impair the value or priority of Foothill's security
interests in the Collateral.

5.8 NO MATERIAL ADVERSE CHANGE IN FINANCIAL
CONDITION. All financial statements relating to Borrower or any guarantor of
the Obligations that have been delivered by Borrower to Foothill have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP and fairly present Borrower's financial
condition as of the date thereof and Borrower's results of operations for the
period then ended. There has not been a material adverse change in the
financial condition of Borrower since the date of the latest financial
statements submitted to Foothill on or before the Closing Date.

5.9 SOLVENCY. Borrower is Solvent. No transfer
of property is being made by Borrower and no obligation is being incurred by
Borrower in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the other Loan Documents with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud either
present or future creditors of Borrower.

5.10 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. Each Benefit Plan is in
compliance in all material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and
the IRC. Each Qualified Plan and Multiemployer Plan has been determined by the
Internal Revenue Service to qualify under Section 401 of the IRC, and the
trusts created thereunder have been determined to be exempt from tax under
Section 501 of the IRC, and, to the best knowledge of Borrower, nothing has
occurred that would cause the loss of such

218
<PAGE> 33
qualification or tax-exempt status. There are no outstanding liabilities under
Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Benefit Plan maintained or sponsored by
Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate, nor with respect to any Benefit Plan to which
Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate contributes or is obligated to contribute which
could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition of Borrower. No Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA has any
Unfunded Benefit Liability which could reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition of Borrower. Neither
Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has transferred any Unfunded Benefit Liability
to a person other than Borrower or an ERISA Affiliate or has otherwise engaged
in a transaction that could be subject to Sections 4069 or 4212(c) of ERISA
which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition of Borrower. Neither Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has
incurred nor reasonably expects to incur (x) any liability (and no event has
occurred which, with the giving of notice under Section 4219 of ERISA, would
result in such liability) under Sections 4201 or 4243 of ERISA with respect to
a Multiemployer Plan, or (y) any liability under Title IV of ERISA (other than
premiums due but not delinquent under Section 4007 of ERISA) with respect to a
Benefit Plan, which could, in either event, reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition of Borrower. No application
for a funding waiver or an extension of any amortization period pursuant to
Section 412 of the IRC has been made with respect to any Benefit Plan. No
ERISA Event has occurred or is reasonably expected to occur with respect to any
Benefit Plan which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition of Borrower. Borrower and each ERISA
Affiliate have complied in all material respects with the notice and
continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the IRC.

5.11 ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION.

(a) Borrower has not used Hazardous
Materials at or affecting the Real Property in any manner which violates any
Environmental Law governing the use, storage, treatment, transportation,
manufacturing, refinement, handling, production, or disposal of Hazardous
Materials.

(b) To the actual knowledge of Borrower,
no prior or current owner, occupant, or operator of the Real Property has used
Hazardous Materials at or affecting the Real Property in any manner which
violates any Environmental Law governing the use, storage, treatment,
transportation, manufacturing, refinement, handling, production, or disposal of
Hazardous Materials.

5.12 RELIANCE BY FOOTHILL; CUMULATIVE. Each
warranty and representation contained in this Agreement shall be conclusively
presumed to have been relied on by Foothill regardless of any investigation
made or information possessed by Foothill. The warranties and representations
set forth herein shall be cumulative and in

219
<PAGE> 34
addition to any and all other warranties and representations that Borrower now
or hereafter shall give, or cause to be given, to Foothill.

6. AFFIRMATIVE COVENANTS.

Borrower covenants and agrees that, so long as any
credit hereunder shall be available and until full and final payment of the
Obligations, and unless Foothill shall otherwise consent in writing, Borrower
shall do all of the following:

6.1 ACCOUNTING SYSTEM. Borrower shall maintain a
standard and modern system of accounting in accordance with GAAP with ledger
and account cards or computer tapes, discs, printouts, and records pertaining
to the Collateral which contain information as from time to time reasonably may
be requested by Foothill.

6.2 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, REPORTS, CERTIFICATES.
Borrower agrees to deliver to Foothill: (a) as soon as available, but in any
event within thirty-five (35) days after the end of each month during each of
Borrower's fiscal years, a company prepared unconsolidated balance sheet,
income statement, and cash flow statement covering Borrower's operations during
such period; and (b) as soon as available, but in any event within ninety (90)
days after the end of each of Borrower's fiscal years, financial statements of
Borrower for each such fiscal year, audited by independent certified public
accountants reasonably acceptable to Foothill and certified, without any
qualifications, by such accountants to have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP, together with a certificate of such accountants addressed to Foothill
stating that such accountants do not have knowledge of the existence of any
event or condition constituting an Event of Default, or that would, with the
passage of time or the giving of notice, constitute an Event of Default,
provided that such accountants shall not be liable for the failure to disclose
such event or condition to the extent that it would not reasonably be
discovered during the course of an audit conducted in accordance with GAAP.
Such audited financial statements shall include a balance sheet, profit and
loss statement, and cash flow statement, and, if and when prepared, such
accountants' letter to management. Borrower shall have issued written
instructions to its independent certified public accountants authorizing them
to communicate with Foothill and to release to Foothill whatever financial
information concerning Borrower that Foothill reasonably may request.

Each month, together with the financial
statements provided for above, Borrower shall deliver to Foothill a certificate
signed by its chief financial officer to the effect that: (i) all reports,
statements, or computer prepared information of any kind or nature delivered or
caused to be delivered to Foothill hereunder have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP and fairly present the financial condition of Borrower; (ii) Borrower
is in timely compliance with all of its covenants and agreements hereunder;
(iii) the representations and warranties of Borrower contained in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents are true and correct in all material
respects on and as of the date of such

220
<PAGE> 35
certificate, as though made on and as of such date (except to the extent that
such representations and warranties relate solely to an earlier date); and (iv)
on the date of delivery of such certificate to Foothill there does not exist
any condition or event that constitutes an Event of Default (or, in each case,
to the extent of any non-compliance, describing such non-compliance as to which
he or she may have knowledge and what action Borrower has taken, is taking, or
proposes to take with respect thereto).

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
Borrower shall issue written instructions to its independent certified public
accountants authorizing them to communicate with Foothill and to release to
Foothill whatever financial information concerning Borrower that Foothill may
require. Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes and directs all auditors,
accountants, or other third parties to deliver to Foothill, at Borrower's
expense, copies of Borrower's financial statements, papers related thereto, and
other accounting records of any nature in their possession, and to disclose to
Foothill any information they may have regarding Borrower's business affairs
and financial conditions.

6.3 TAX RETURNS. Borrower agrees to deliver to
Foothill copies of each of Borrower's future federal income tax returns, and
any amendments thereto, within thirty (30) days of the filing thereof with the
Internal Revenue Service.

6.4 COLLATERAL REPORTS. Borrower shall deliver
to Foothill from time to time hereafter, but not less frequently than monthly,
(a) a rental delinquency report, prepared on a per property basis with respect
to the Real Property, (b) a report that details the amount of real property
taxes that are currently delinquent, those that are currently due and payable,
and those that are to become due and payable within twelve months of the date
of the report, such report to be prepared on a per property basis with respect
to the Real Property, (c) a report that details those parcels of the Real
Property that have been sold by Borrower within the last three months, the net
cash proceeds received therefrom, the application of such net cash proceeds,
those parcels of Real Property that currently are held for sale, the listing
price, and the length of time that such property has been held for sale, (d) a
report that details the NOI of each of the parcels of Real Property, and (e) a
report that details the vacancy rate of each of the parcels of Real Property.
In addition, from time to time hereafter, Borrower shall deliver to Foothill
such other and additional information or documentation as Foothill reasonably
may request.

6.5 TAXES. Except as otherwise provided by the
Plan, all assessments and taxes, whether real, personal, or otherwise, due or
payable by, or imposed, levied, or assessed against Borrower or any of its
property shall be paid in full, before delinquency or before the expiration of
any extension period. From and after the Closing Date, Borrower shall make due
and timely payment or deposit of all federal, state, and local taxes,
assessments, or contributions required of it by law (including giving effect to
the terms and conditions of the Plan), and will execute and deliver to
Foothill, on demand, appropriate certificates attesting to the payment thereof
or deposit with respect

221
<PAGE> 36
thereto. From and after the Closing Date, Borrower will make timely payment or
deposit of all tax payments and withholding taxes required of it by applicable
laws, including those laws concerning F.I.C.A., F.U.T.A., state disability, and
local, state, and federal income taxes, and will, upon request, furnish
Foothill with proof satisfactory to Foothill indicating that Borrower has made
such payments or deposits.

6.6 INSURANCE.

(a) Borrower, at its expense, shall keep
the Collateral (exclusive of the Real Property) insured against loss or damage
by fire, theft, explosion, sprinklers, and all other hazards and risks, and in
such amounts, as are ordinarily insured against by other owners in similar
businesses. Borrower also shall maintain, in appropriate amounts, business
interruption, public liability, product liability, and property damage
insurance, as well as insurance against larceny, embezzlement, and criminal
misappropriation.

(b) Borrower will obtain and maintain
(i) insurance of the type necessary to insure the Improvements and Chattels (as
such terms are defined in the Mortgages), for the full replacement cost
thereof, against any loss by fire, lighting, windstorm, hail, explosion,
aircraft, smoke damage, vehicle damage, elevator collision, and other risks
from time to time included under "extended coverage" policies, (ii) combined
single limit bodily injury and property damages insurance against any loss,
liability, or damages on, about or relating to each parcel of Real Property, in
an amount of not less than Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000); and (iii) such
other risks (other than earthquake and flood as to any property not located in
a flood plane) as Foothill reasonably may require. Replacement costs, at
Foothill's option, may be redetermined by an insurance appraiser, satisfactory
to Foothill, not more frequently than once every twelve months at Borrower's
cost.

(c) All insurance required herein shall
be written by companies of recognized financial standing, reasonably
satisfactory to Foothill, which are authorized to do insurance business in the
State of California. Such insurance shall be in form satisfactory to Foothill,
shall with respect to hazard insurance and such other insurance as Foothill
shall specify, name Foothill as the loss payee thereunder, and shall contain a
California Form 438BFU (NS) mortgagee endorsement, or its local equivalent.
Every policy of insurance referred to in this Section shall contain an
agreement by the insurer that it will not cancel such policy except after
thirty (30) days prior written notice to Foothill and that any loss payable
thereunder shall be payable notwithstanding any act or negligence of Borrower
or Foothill that might, absent such agreement, result in a forfeiture of all or
a part of such insurance payment and notwithstanding (i) occupancy or use of
the Real Property for purposes more hazardous than permitted by the terms of
such policy, (ii) any foreclosure or other action or proceeding taken by
Foothill pursuant to the

222
<PAGE> 37
Mortgages upon the happening of an Event of Default, or (iii) any change in
title or ownership of the Real Property.

(d) Original policies or certificates
thereof satisfactory to Foothill evidencing such insurance shall be delivered
to Foothill at least thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the existing
or preceding policies. Borrower shall give Foothill prompt notice of any loss
covered by such insurance and Foothill shall have the right to adjust any loss.
Foothill shall have the right to participate in the adjustment of all loss
payable under any such insurance policies without any liability to Borrower
whatsoever in respect of such adjustments. Any monies received as payment for
any loss under any Insurance Policy including, but not limited to, the
insurance policies mentioned above, shall be paid over to Foothill to be
applied at the option of Borrower either to the prepayment of the Obligations
without premium, in such order and with such effect as Foothill may elect, or
shall be disbursed to Borrower under staged payment terms satisfactory to
Foothill for application to the cost of repairs, replacements, or restorations
in accordance with Section 6.6(f). All restorations shall be effected with
reasonable promptness and shall be of a value at least equal to the value of
the items or property to destroyed prior to such damage or destruction. Upon
the occurrence of an Event of Default, all prepaid premiums shall be the sole
and absolute property of Foothill to be applied by Foothill to the payment of
the Obligations in such order or form as Foothill shall determine.

(e) Borrower shall not take out separate
insurance concurrent in form or contributing in the event of loss with that
required to be maintained under this Section 6.6, unless Foothill is included
thereon as named insured with the loss payable to Foothill under a standard
California Form 438BFU (NS) mortgagee endorsement, or its local equivalent.
Borrower shall immediately notify Foothill whenever such separate insurance is
taken out, specifying the insurer thereunder and full particulars as to the
policies evidencing the same, and originals of such policies shall immediately
thereafter be provided to Foothill.

(f) If Borrower elects to cause Foothill
to disburse any monies received as payment for any loss under any insurance
policy pursuant to Section 6.6(d), Foothill only be obligated to disburse such
money for the repair, replacement or restoration of the Real Property which has
been damaged, if all of the following conditions are satisfied: (i) no event or
condition then exists constituting an Event of Default then exists, or that
with the passage of time or the giving of notice (but nothing else) would

to ensure compliance by all owners, operators, and occupants, if any, of the
Real Property with all applicable Environmental Laws and will use diligent
efforts to ensure that all such owners, operators, and occupants obtain and
comply with any and all required approvals, registrations, or permits.

(c) Upon the reasonable request of
Foothill, Borrower shall conduct and complete such investigations, studies,
samplings, and testings relative to Hazardous Materials at or affecting the
Real Property as are requested. Upon the reasonable request of Foothill from
time to time, Borrower shall provide to Foothill, at Borrower's sole cost and

Borrower's sole cost and expense, Borrower shall promptly take all actions to
Remediate the Real Property that are required by federal, state, or local

<PAGE> 40
of the Real Property. All such work shall be performed by one or more
contractors selected by Borrower and reasonably approved in advance and in
writing by Foothill. Borrower shall proceed continuously and diligently with
such investigatory and remedial actions, provided that in all cases, such
actions shall be in accordance with all applicable requirements of all
Environmental Laws. Any such actions shall be performed in a good, safe, and
workman like manner and shall minimize any impact on the business or occupation
at or near the Real Property. Borrower shall pay all costs in connection with
such investigatory and remedial activities, including but not limited to all
power and utility costs and any and all taxes or fees that may be applicable to
such activities. Borrower shall promptly provide to Foothill copies of testing
results and reports that are generated in compliance with the above activities.
Promptly upon completion of such investigation and Remediation, Borrower shall

standards and compliance with all Environmental Laws, remove all associated
equipment, and restore the Real Property to the condition existing prior to the
commencement of Remediation, which shall include the repair of any surface
damage, including paving caused by such investigation or Remediation hereunder.
If the estimated cost of any performance under this section exceeds $250,000 in
the aggregate, then within ten (10) days of demand therefor, Borrower shall
provide Foothill with a bond, letter of credit, or similar financial assurance
evidencing that the necessary funds are available for the obligations
established by this subparagraph or shall instruct Foothill to reserve such
amounts against the amount of the Loan available under Section 2.1.

(d) The obligations of Borrower and the
rights of Foothill with respect to Hazardous Materials are in addition to and
not in substitution of the obligations of Borrower and the rights of Foothill
under all applicable, federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances
relating to health and safety, and protection of the environment. The
obligations of Borrower and the rights of Foothill, notwithstanding anything
contained herein or in any other document or agreement which may be construed
to the contrary, (i) shall not be subject to any antideficiency laws or
protections, if any, (ii) shall survive (a) a non- judicial sale, judicial sale
or deed or other transaction in lieu of such sale hereunder, and (b) the
repayment of the Obligations. In the event Borrower does not timely perform
any of its obligations with respect to Hazardous Materials, Foothill may, but
is not required to, after first giving Borrower (a) concurrent written notice,
in the case of an emergency or continuing release, or (b) ten (10) days prior
written notice, in all other cases, and, in the latter circumstance, only if
Borrower fails to commence and thereafter diligently pursue the required
performance, perform such obligations, but is not obligated to, at the expense
of Borrower and such expense shall be added to the Obligations and shall not
cure Borrower's breach under this Agreement.

226

material respects with all of its obligations under all leases existing on the

Property. Borrower shall provide Foothill with a copy of each notice of
default or termination received by Borrower from any tenant under any Material
Lease within five (5) Business Days after receiving any such notice, and
deliver to Foothill a copy of each notice of default or termination sent by
Borrower to the tenant under any lease simultaneously with its delivery of such
notice under such lease, and shall notify Foothill, not later than thirty (30)
days prior to the date of the expiration of the term of any lease, and, if
Borrower shall intend to renew such lease, the terms and conditions of renewal
of any such lease. Upon Foothill's request, Borrower shall use its best
efforts to obtain and deliver to Foothill, an estoppel certificate, in form and
substance satisfactory to Foothill, executed by such tenants as Foothill may
specify, certifying, among other things, that Borrower is not in default under
such lease, the amount of rent payable under such lease, the term of such

to Interest Expense for the immediately preceding period meets or exceeds two
to one (2.0:1.0);

(h) purchase money Indebtedness secured by a
purchase money security interest or lien, so long as such security interest or

subordinated in right of payment to the Obligations, then the subordination
terms and conditions of the refinancing Indebtedness must be at least as
favorable to Foothill as those applicable to the refinanced Indebtedness.

7.2 LIENS. Create, incur, assume, or permit to exist,
directly or indirectly, any lien on or with respect to any of the Collateral,

has the contractual right to make such payment by the issuance of additional

consent will not be unreasonably withheld, cause, permit, or suffer, directly
or indirectly, any Change of Control.

Obligations (whether of principal, interest (including any interest which, but
for the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, would have accrued on such amounts),
fees and charges due Foothill, reimbursement of Foothill Expenses, or other

impairment of the value of, or priority of Foothill's security interests in,
the Collateral. In this regard, the parties hereby agree that the termination

the Chico, Sacramento, or Walnut Creek, California hotels would, ipso facto,
constitute a material impairment of the value of the Collateral unless such

Agreement has been cured or waived and any acceleration of the Indebtedness
thereunder rescinded, and written notice of such cure, waiver, or rescission,
as the case may be, shall have been given to Foothill and no other Event of
Default has occurred that has not been cured or waived during such period. No
rescission or annulment referred to above shall affect any subsequent Event of
Default or any right, power, or remedy arising out of such subsequent Event of
Default.

<PAGE> 49

(a) Declare all Obligations, whether
evidenced by this Agreement, by any of the other Loan Documents, or otherwise,

security interests and to pay all expenses incurred in connection therewith.
The foregoing shall include the right to discharge any Allowed Mechanic's Lien
Claim or Allowed Secured Real Property Tax Claim;

(e) Without notice to Borrower (such
notice being expressly waived), and without constituting a retention of any
collateral in satisfaction of an obligation (within the meaning of Section 9505
of the Code), set off and apply to the Obligations any and all (i) balances and
deposits of Borrower held by Foothill, or (ii) indebtedness at any time owing
to or for the credit or the account of Borrower held by Foothill;

(f) Hold, as cash collateral, any and
all balances and deposits of Borrower held by Foothill, to secure the full and
final repayment of all of the Obligations;

(g) Prepare for sale, advertise for
sale, and sell (in the manner provided for herein or in the Mortgages) the
Collateral. Foothill is hereby granted a license or other right to use,
without charge, Borrower's labels, patents, copyrights, rights of use of any
name, trade secrets, trade names, trademarks, service marks, and advertising
matter, or any property of a similar nature, as it pertains to the Collateral,
in advertising for sale, and selling any Collateral and Borrower's rights under
all licenses and all franchise agreements shall inure to Foothill's benefit;

(h) Sell the Personal Property
Collateral at either a public or private sale, or both, by way of one or more
contracts or transactions, for cash or on terms, in such manner and at such
places (including Borrower's premises) as Foothill

235
<PAGE> 50
determines is commercially reasonable. It is not necessary that the Collateral
be present at any such sale;

(i) Foothill shall give notice of the
disposition of the Personal Property Collateral as follows:

(1) Foothill shall give Borrower
and each holder of a security interest in the Personal Property Collateral who
has filed with Foothill a written request for notice, a notice in writing of
the time and place of public sale, or, if the sale is a private sale or some
other disposition other than a public sale is to be made of the Personal
Property Collateral, then the time on or after which the private sale or other
disposition is to be made;

(2) The notice shall be personally
delivered or mailed, postage prepaid, to Borrower as provided in Section 12, at
least five (5) days before the date fixed for the sale, or at least five (5)
days before the date on or after which the private sale or other disposition is
to be made; no notice needs to be given prior to the disposition of any portion
of the Personal Property Collateral that is perishable or threatens to decline
speedily in value or that is of a type customarily sold on a recognized market.
Notice to Persons other than Borrower claiming an interest in the Personal
Property Collateral shall be sent to such addresses as they have furnished to
Foothill;

(3) If the sale is to be a public
sale, Foothill also shall give notice of the time and place by publishing a
notice one time at least five (5) days before the date of the sale in a
newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the sale is to be held;

(j) Foothill may credit bid and purchase
at any public sale; and

(k) Any deficiency that exists after
disposition of the Personal Property Collateral as provided above will be paid
immediately by Borrower. Any excess will be returned, without interest and
subject to the rights of third Persons, by Foothill to Borrower.

9.2 REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. Foothill's rights and
remedies under this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, all other agreements
shall be cumulative. Foothill shall have all other rights and remedies not
inconsistent herewith as provided under the Code, by law, or in equity. No
exercise by Foothill of one right or remedy shall be deemed an election, and no
waiver by Foothill of any Event of Default shall be deemed a continuing waiver.
No delay by Foothill shall constitute a waiver, election, or acquiescence by
it.

236
<PAGE> 51
9.3 FORECLOSURE NOT A DISCHARGE. Foreclosure
shall not operate as a discharge to Borrower's obligations to Foothill as to
Hazardous Materials and the indemnity provisions in Section 11 hereof; and in
the event Borrower tenders a deed in lieu of foreclosure for all or part of the
Real Property, Borrower shall deliver such property to Foothill (or its
designee) free of any and all Hazardous Materials that were not permitted,
under the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to be on or under such
property. The indemnity provisions in Section 11 hereof shall not be
discharged or affected in any way by foreclosure or by Foothill's acceptance of
a deed in lieu thereof, and the same shall continue for a period equal to the
longest living child born in Los Angeles County on October 1, 1994, plus
twenty-one (21) years.

10. TAXES AND EXPENSES REGARDING THE COLLATERAL.

10.1 FAILURE TO PAY. If Borrower fails to pay, or
cause the payment of, any monies (whether taxes, rents, assessments, insurance
premiums, or otherwise) due to third Persons, or fails to make any deposits or
furnish any required proof of payment or deposit, all as required under the
terms of this Agreement or the Mortgages, after having been given notice and
the opportunity to make any such payment within the applicable cure period,
then, to the extent that Foothill reasonably determines that such failure by
Borrower could have a material adverse effect on Foothill's interests in the
Collateral, in its reasonable discretion and without further notice to
Borrower, Foothill may do any or all of the following: (a) make payment of the
same or any part thereof; (b) set up such reserves in Borrower's loan account
as Foothill deems necessary to protect Foothill from the exposure created by
such failure; or (c) obtain and maintain insurance policies of the type
described in Section 6.6, and take any action with respect to such policies as
Foothill deems prudent. Any such amounts paid by Foothill shall constitute
Foothill Expenses. Any such payments made by Foothill shall not constitute an
agreement by Foothill to make similar payments in the future or a waiver by
Foothill of any Event of Default under this Agreement. Foothill need not
inquire as to, or contest the validity of, any such expense, tax, security
interest, encumbrance, or lien and the receipt of the usual official notice for
the payment thereof shall be conclusive evidence that the same was validly due
and owing.

10.2 RIGHT TO CONTEST. Notwithstanding the
provisions set forth in Sections 6.5 and 10.1 regarding Borrower's obligation
to pay taxes, Borrower shall not be required to pay or discharge any taxes
levied against any parcel of Real Property so long as Borrower shall in good
faith and at its own expense contest the same or the validity thereof by
appropriate legal proceedings which shall operate to prevent the collection
thereof or other realization thereon or the sale, forfeiture or loss of the
Real Property or any part thereof to satisfy the same; provided that (i) during
such contest Borrower shall, at the option of Foothill, provide security in
forms and amounts satisfactory to Foothill assuring the discharge of Borrower's
obligation to pay such taxes and of any additional charge, penalty or expense
arising from or incurred as a result of such contest, (ii) any such contest
shall not subject Foothill to any civil or criminal liability whatsoever, and
(iii)

237
<PAGE> 52
Borrower diligently and rapidly prosecutes such contest to completion.
However, if at any time payment of any taxes levied against any parcel of Real
Property shall become necessary to prevent foreclosure on the Real Property or
any portion thereof because of non-payment, or if Foothill or Borrower shall
incur any civil or criminal liability as a result of such non-payment, Foothill
may, without any liability to Borrower whatsoever, apply such security to the
payment of the same, or otherwise pay the same pursuant to the provisions of
Section 10.1 in sufficient time to prevent the delivery of such tax deed or the
incurrence of such civil or criminal liability, as the case may be.

11. WAIVERS; INDEMNIFICATION.

11.1 DEMAND; PROTEST; ETC. Except as expressly
provided for herein, Borrower waives demand, protest, notice of protest, notice
of default or dishonor, notice of payment and nonpayment, notice of any
default, nonpayment at maturity, release, compromise, settlement, extension, or
renewal of accounts, documents, instruments, chattel paper, and guarantees at
any time held by Foothill on which Borrower may in any way be liable.

11.2 FOOTHILL'S LIABILITY FOR COLLATERAL. So long
as Foothill complies with its obligations, if any, under Section 9207 of the
Code, Foothill shall not in any way or manner be liable or responsible for: (a)
the safekeeping of the Collateral; (b) any loss or damage thereto occurring or
arising in any manner or fashion from any cause; (c) any diminution in the
value thereof; or (d) any act or default of any other Person. All risk of
loss, damage, or destruction of the Collateral shall be borne by Borrower.

11.3 INDEMNIFICATION. Borrower agrees to defend,
indemnify, save, and hold all Indemnified Persons harmless against: (a) all
obligations, demands, claims, and liabilities claimed or asserted by any other
Person arising out of or relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any other Loan Document including those claimed by any broker or
finder, except to the extent that such indemnified liability arises proximately
from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Indemnified Person
asserting its rights under this indemnity, (b) all Losses, and (c) all losses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) suffered or incurred by any Indemnified
Person, regardless of negligence (except to the extent that such indemnified
liability arises proximately from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of
the Indemnified Person asserting its rights under this indemnity), whether as a
holder of security interests in Real Property, as mortgagee in possession, or
as successor in interest to Borrower as owner of the Real Property by virtue of
foreclosure or acceptance of a deed or other transaction in lieu of
foreclosure, or after partial or total reconveyance of the mortgage, arising
from, in respect of, as a consequence of (whether foreseeable or unforeseeable)
or in connection with the use, storage, disposal, generation, transportation,
spill or treatment of any Hazardous Materials at or related to the Real
Property whether or not originating or emanating from the Real Property. The
foregoing indemnity shall not apply, however, to any losses suffered or

238
<PAGE> 53
incurred by any Person as the result of any act or omission with respect to the
Real Property that occurs or fails to occur on or after the date on which any
Indemnified Person has foreclosed thereon or taken title thereto. This section
shall survive the termination of this Agreement. Borrower and Foothill
understand and acknowledge that Borrower's covenant regarding Remediation of
Hazardous Materials is contained in Section 6.10 and nothing in this section is
intended to modify or expand Borrower's obligations to Foothill under Section
6.10 hereof.

12. NOTICES.

notices or demands by any party relating to this Agreement or any other Loan

15. GENERAL PROVISIONS.

15.1 EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement shall be
binding and deemed effective when executed and delivered by Borrower and
Foothill.

15.2 SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This Agreement shall
bind and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns of each
of the parties; provided, however, that Borrower may not assign this Agreement
or any rights or duties hereunder without Foothill's prior written consent and
any prohibited assignment shall be absolutely void. No consent to an
assignment by Foothill shall release Borrower from its Obligations. Foothill
may assign this Agreement and its rights and duties hereunder and no consent or
approval by Borrower is required in connection with any such assignment.
Foothill reserves the right to sell, assign, transfer, negotiate, or grant

Foothill shall thereafter be released from such assigned obligations to

Section 15.2 shall not expand the eligible classes of Persons included within

parties on separate counterparts, each of which, when executed and delivered,
shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which, when taken together, shall

relating to fraudulent conveyances, preferences, and other voidable or
recoverable payments of money or transfers of property (collectively, a

discharged promptly, when due and payable, all taxes, assessments and
governmental charges or levies imposed upon it or upon its income or upon any

<PAGE> 18
therereof, any of which give rise to liens, charges or encumbrances
attaching to any material property of Peregrine or any of its Subsidiaries, as
well as all claims of any kind (including claims for labor, materials and
supplies) which, if unpaid, might by law become a lien, charge or encumbrance
upon its Assets; provided, however, that Peregrine shall not be required to
pay, or to cause any Subsidiary to pay, any tax, assessment, charge, levy or
claim if the amount, applicability or validity thereof shall currently be
contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and if Peregrine or such
Subsidiary shall have set aside on its books reserves (segregated to the extent
required by generally accepted accounting principles) deemed by Peregrine

rights, franchises, licenses and permits; provided, however, that nothing in
this Subsection (b) shall (i) prevent the abandonment or termination of
Peregrine's or any Subsidiary's authorization to do business in any foreign
state or jurisdiction, if, in the opinion of Peregrine or its Board of Trustees
(in the latter case evidenced by a duly adopted resolution), such abandonment
or termination is in the best interest of Peregrine or such Subsidiary and not
disadvantageous to the holders of the Securities or the shares of Common Stock
issued upon conversion of the Preferred Shares, or (ii) require compliance with
any law so long as the validity or applicability thereof shall be disputed or
contested in good faith; and

proper so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly
and advantageously conducted at all times; provided, however, that nothing in

Peregrine's management such Assets are obsolete, worn out, without economic
value, or unnecessary for the conduct of the business of Peregrine or such
Subsidiary.

8.6 Insurance. Peregrine will, and, except as otherwise
provided herein, will cause each Subsidiary to keep or cause to be kept
insured, with companies that Peregrine believes to be financially sound and

unless such Indebtedness shall be renewed or extended, in which case, such
payments shall be made in accordance with the terms of such renewal or
extension;

(b) faithfully observe, perform and discharge in all
material respects all the covenants, conditions and obligations which are
imposed on it by any and all indentures, agreements, or other instruments
securing or evidencing Indebtedness or pursuant to which Indebtedness is issued
when failure to do so is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, and not
permit the occurrence or continuance of any act or omission which is or under
the provisions thereof may be declared to be a default thereunder and where
such default is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, unless such default
(other than default in payment of principal or interest) or the right to
declare a default on account of such act or omission is waived pursuant to the
provisions thereof; neither Peregrine nor any Subsidiary shall be required to
make any payment or to take any other action by reason of Subsection (a) or (b)
at any time while it shall be currently contesting in good faith by appropriate
proceedings its obligations to make such payment or to take such action, if
Peregrine shall have set aside on its books reserves (segregated or classified
to the extent required by generally accepted accounting principles) deemed by
it adequate with respect thereto; and

(c) not violate any provision of its Declaration of
Trust, as amended, or any material provision of any judgment, writ, decree,
order, statute, rule or governmental regulation or approval applicable to
Peregrine or any material provision of any contract, agreement, indenture,

domestic securities exchange on which any of its securities are listed, and
copies of all press releases and other statements made available to the public
concerning material developments in the business of Peregrine and its
Subsidiaries;

(e) promptly upon receipt thereof, a copy of each other
report submitted to Peregrine or any Subsidiary by independent accountants in
connection with any annual, interim or

264
<PAGE> 21

special audit made by them of the books and records of Peregrine or any 
Subsidiary; and

(f) prompt notice of:

(i) any investigation by the SEC, the Internal
Revenue Service, or the United States Department of Justice in
connection with which Peregrine or any Subsidiary is identified as an
object of such investigation;

(ii) any complaint or proceeding instituted against
Peregrine or any Subsidiary by the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service,
or the United States Department of Justice;

(iii) any investigation of, or complaint or
proceeding against, Peregrine or any Subsidiary instituted by any
other federal agency or by any state or local regulatory agency,
which, if concluded adversely to Peregrine or such Subsidiary, could
have a Material Adverse Effect on the business or Property of
Peregrine or of such Subsidiary; and

(iv) any other action at law or suit in equity in
any court or any proceeding before any regulatory or administrative
body, involving a claim or claims against Peregrine or any Subsidiary
which, if concluded adversely to Peregrine or any Subsidiary, could
give rise to damages in excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate or could
otherwise have a Material Adverse Effect on the business or property
of Peregrine or such Subsidiary.

(g) with reasonable promptness, such other financial
and/or operating data as such Significant Holder may reasonably request.

8.9 Discussion with Officers and Executives. Peregrine
will permit any Significant Holder and any Person designated from time to time
by such Significant Holder in writing, at the expense of such Significant
Holder, upon notice to Peregrine to visit and inspect any of the properties
owned by Peregrine and its Subsidiaries, to examine the books and financial
records of Peregrine and make copies thereof or extracts therefrom and to
discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of Peregrine with the principal
officers and trustees of Peregrine and its independent public accountants, all
at such reasonable times and as often as such Significant Holder may reasonably
request.

8.10 Blue Sky. From and after the Closing Date, so long as
any Preferred Shares are outstanding, if at any time a holder of Preferred
Shares converts any Preferred Shares, in whole or in part, the issuance of
Common Stock upon such conversion or exercise may not be lawfully made without
the

265
<PAGE> 22

registration or qualification of such Common Stock under the securities or
blue sky laws of any jurisdiction, Peregrine shall promptly use its best
efforts to effect such registration or qualification and such action shall not
count as a registration under Section 2 of the Registration Rights Agreement.

8.11 Tax Treatment of Dividends.

(a) Peregrine will not take any action which could
reasonably be expected by it (i) to cause the Preferred Shares to be treated as
indebtedness for purposes of the Code pursuant to Section 385 of the Code or
any successor provision of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder,
or (ii) to cause the Dividends Received Deduction to cease to be available, in
whole or in part, with respect to dividends on the Preferred Shares received by
any corporate holder thereof.

(b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Peregrine covenants and agrees that (i) it will not claim a deduction for
dividends paid on the Preferred Shares whether as interest or otherwise, in any
federal income tax return, claim for refund of federal income tax or other
submission to the Internal Revenue Service, and (ii) unless required to do so
by GAAP, it will not treat the Preferred Shares other than as equity capital or
the dividends paid thereon other than as dividends paid on capital in any
report to stockholders or any governmental body having jurisdiction over
Peregrine or otherwise.

(c) Peregrine will cooperate with and support any
corporate holder of any Preferred Shares in any litigation, appeal or other
proceeding challenging or contesting any ruling, technical advice, finding or
determination of the Internal Revenue Service that the Preferred Shares are to
be treated as indebtedness for purposes of the Code or that dividends paid on
the Preferred Shares are not eligible for the Dividends Received Deduction.
The cooperation and support required of Peregrine by the preceding sentence
shall be at the expense of such corporate holder, except that Peregrine will
pay all fees and expenses (whether incurred by it or a corporate holder) in
connection with any such submission, litigation, appeal or other proceeding
necessitated or caused by a breach by Peregrine of its covenants contained in
this Section 7.11.

8.12 Transactions with Affiliates. Peregrine and its
Subsidiaries will not enter into any transactions with any Affiliate on terms
that are less favorable to Peregrine or such Subsidiary than those that would
be obtainable at the time in an ordinary course transaction with an
unaffiliated entity or person.

8.13 Specific Performance as Remedy. If Peregrine, or any
Subsidiary or Affiliate, fails to perform any act or take any action required
pursuant to this Article VIII, Buyers hereby 

266
<PAGE> 23

waive any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to them, at law 
or in equity, other than (a) damage claims arising under Section 8.11 and (b) 
specific performance, which shall generally be available under this Article 
VIII.

ARTICLE IX

INDEMNIFICATION

9.1 Survival of Representations, Etc. All statements
contained herein or in any certificate or instrument of conveyance delivered by
or on behalf of any party pursuant to this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be representations and
warranties by such party hereunder. The representations and warranties of
Peregrine contained herein shall survive the Closing Date.

9.2 Indemnification. Peregrine shall indemnify and hold
harmless each Buyer and its Affiliates, directors, officers, advisors, agents
and employees (the "Indemnified Parties") to the fullest extent lawful, from
and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, actions and
expenses (including without limitation, costs of investigating, preparing or
defending any such claim or action and reasonable legal fees and expenses)
(collectively "Losses") arising out of or in connection with the breach of any
warranty, representation, covenant or agreement of Peregrine contained in this
Agreement, and including without limitation, any such Losses arising out of
transactions entered into or events occurring prior to the Closing; provided,
however, that no Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification by
Peregrine hereunder with respect to any Losses arising solely from the bad
faith or gross negligence (as finally determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction) of such Indemnified Party or any affiliate director, officer,
agent, or employee of such Indemnified Party. The term "Losses" as used in
this Section 8.2 is not limited to matters asserted by third parties against an
Indemnified Party, but includes Losses incurred or sustained by an Indemnified
Party in the absence of third party claims.

9.3 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) If any action or proceeding shall be brought or
asserted against any Indemnified Party in respect of which indemnity may be
sought from Peregrine, such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify Peregrine
in writing and Peregrine shall assume the defense thereof, including the
employment of counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of
expenses as provided in Section 8.2. The Indemnified Party shall have the
right to employ separate counsel in any such action and to participate in the
defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of 

267
<PAGE> 24
such counsel shall be borne by such Indemnified Party, unless (i) Peregrine 
has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses, (ii) Peregrine
shall have failed promptly to assume the defense of such action or proceeding
or shall have failed to employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
Indemnified Party in any such action or proceeding, or (iii) such Indemnified
Party shall have reasonably concluded that there are defenses available to it
which are different from or additional to those available to Peregrine which,
if Peregrine and the Indemnified Party were to be represented by the same
counsel, would constitute a conflict of interest for such counsel or materially
prejudice the prosecution of the defenses available to such Indemnified Party
(in which case if such Indemnified Party notifies Peregrine in writing that it
elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of Peregrine, Peregrine shall
not have the right to assume the defense of such action or proceeding on behalf
of such Indemnified Party, it being agreed to and understood that Peregrine
shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or separate but
substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the same
jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be
liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys
(together, if appropriate, with one firm of local counsel per jurisdiction) at
any time for such Indemnified Party, which counsel or firm shall be designated
in writing by such Indemnified Party or by Buyer if there is more than one
Indemnified Party, provided that in the case of (iii) above, Peregrine shall
only be liable for the fees and expenses of separate counsel with respect to
such different or additional defenses and such Indemnified Party shall instruct
such separate counsel to cooperate with Peregrine's counsel in order to reduce
the fees and expenses for which Peregrine is liable). Peregrine shall not be
liable for any settlement of such action or proceeding, effected without its
prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, but if
settled with its written consent, or if there be a final judgment for the
plaintiff in any such action or proceeding, Peregrine will indemnify and hold
harmless any such Indemnified Party from and against any Losses (to the extent
provided for in this Article VIII) by reason of such settlement or judgment.

ARTICLE X

TRANSFER OF SECURITIES

The Preferred Shares and the Conversion Stock shall not be
transferable except upon the conditions specified in this Article X, which
conditions are intended to insure compliance with the provisions of the
Securities Act and state securities laws in respect of the transfer of any such
securities.

268
<PAGE> 25

10.1 Restrictive Legends.

(a) Unless and until otherwise permitted by this Article,
each certificate for Preferred Shares or Conversion Stock issued to a Buyer or
its nominee, or to any subsequent transferee of such certificate, shall be
stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend in substantially the following
form:

"The shares represented by this certificate have not been
registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
thus may not be offered for sale, sold, transferred or
otherwise disposed of unless registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, or unless an exemption from such
registration is available. Further, such transfer is subject
to the conditions specified in that certain Preferred
Stock Purchase Agreement by and among the Peregrine Real 
Estate Trust and the Buyers named therein, pursuant to which 
such shares were issued and sold or otherwise transferred by 
The Peregrine Real Estate Trust f/k/a Commonwealth Equity 
Trust ("Peregrine"), a copy of which Agreement is on file and 
may be inspected at the principal office of Peregrine. A copy 
of such Agreement will be furnished by Peregrine to the holder 
hereof upon request and without charge. Under certain 
circumstances specified in such Agreement, Peregrine has 
agreed to deliver to the holder hereof a new certificate, not 
bearing this legend, for all or part of the number of shares 
evidenced hereby, as the case may be, registered in the name 
of such holder or designated nominee."

(b) Each certificate for Preferred Shares shall be
stamped or otherwise imprinted with a legend in substantially the following
form:

"A statement of the relative rights and preferences of
Peregrine's Common Shares and its Preferred Shares
will be furnished by Peregrine to the holder hereof upon
request and without charge."

(c) Peregrine may order its transfer agents for Preferred
Shares and Conversion Stock to stop the transfer of any shares of Preferred
Stock or Conversion Stock bearing the legend set forth in Subsection (a) of
this Section 10.1 until the conditions of this Article X with respect to the
transfer of such shares have been satisfied.

269
<PAGE> 26

10.2 Notice of Proposed Transfer. If, prior to any transfer
or sale of any Preferred Shares or Conversion Stock, the holder desiring to
effect such transfer or sale shall deliver a written notice to Peregrine
describing briefly the manner of such transfer or sale and a written opinion of
counsel for such holder (provided that such counsel, and the form and substance
of such opinion, are reasonably satisfactory to Peregrine) to the effect that
such transfer or sale may be effected without the registration of such
securities under the Securities Act, Peregrine shall thereupon permit or cause
its transfer agent (if any) to permit such transfer or sale to be effected;
provided, however, that if in such written notice the transferring holder
represents and warrants to Peregrine that the transfer or sale is to a
purchaser or transferee whom the transferring holder knows or reasonably
believes to be a "qualified institutional buyer," as that term is defined in
Rule 144A promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act ("Rule 144A"), no
opinion shall be required.

10.3 Termination of Restrictions.

(a) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article 
IX, the restrictions imposed by this Article IX upon the transferability of 
Preferred Shares and Conversion Stock shall terminate as to any particular 
share of Preferred Stock or Conversion Stock, when (1) such security shall 
have been effectively registered under the Securities Act and sold by the 
holder thereof in accordance with such registration, or (2) a written opinion 
to the effect that such restrictions are no longer required or necessary under 
any federal or state securities law or regulation have been received from 
counsel for the holder thereof (who may be inside counsel in the case of any 
institutional holder) or counsel for Peregrine, or (3) such security shall 
have been sold without registration under the Securities Act in compliance with 
Rule 144 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act ("Rule 144") or Rule 
144A, or (4) Peregrine is reasonably satisfied that the holder of such security 
shall, in accordance with the terms of Subsection (k) of Rule 144, be entitled 
to sell such security pursuant to such Subsection, or (5) a letter or an order 
shall have been issued to the holder thereof by the staff of the SEC or the SEC 
stating that no enforcement action shall be recommended by such staff or taken 
by such commission, as the case may be, if such security is transferred without 
registration under the Securities Act in accordance with the conditions set 
forth in such letter or order and such letter or order specifies that no 
subsequent restrictions on transfer are required.

(b) Whenever the restrictions imposed by this Article IX
shall terminate, as hereinabove provided, the holder of any particular share of
Preferred Stock or Conversion Stock then outstanding as to which such
restrictions shall have terminated shall be entitled to receive from Peregrine,
without expense to such holder, one or more new certificates for

270
<PAGE> 27
Preferred Stock or Conversion Stock not bearing the restrictive legend set 
forth in Section 10.1(a) hereof.

10.4 Compliance with Rule 144 and Rule 144A. At the written
request of any holder of Preferred Shares or Conversion Stock who proposes to
sell Preferred Shares or Conversion Stock in compliance with Rule 144,
Peregrine shall furnish to such holder, within ten days after receipt of such
request, a written statement as to whether or not Peregrine is in compliance
with the filing requirements of the SEC as set forth in such Rule. For
purposes of effecting compliance with Rule 144A, in connection with any resales
of any shares of Preferred Stock or Conversion Stock that hereafter may be
effected pursuant to the provisions of Rule 144A, any holder of Preferred
Shares or Conversion Stock desiring to effect such resale and each prospective
institutional purchaser of such shares designated by such holder shall have the
right, at any time Peregrine is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act, to obtain from Peregrine, upon the written request of such holder
and at Peregrine's expense, the documents specified in Section (d)(4)(i) of
Rule 144A, as such rule may be amended from time to time.

10.5 Non-Applicability of Restrictions on Transfer. 
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 10.2 hereof, any record owner of
Preferred Shares or Conversion Stock may from time to time transfer all or part
of such record owner's Preferred Shares or Conversion Stock (i) to a nominee
identified in writing to Peregrine as being the nominee of or for such record
owner, and any nominee of or for a beneficial owner of Preferred Shares or
Conversion Stock identified in writing to Peregrine as being the nominee of or
for such beneficial owner may from time to time transfer all or part of the
Preferred Shares or Conversion Stock registered in the name of such nominee but
held as nominee on behalf of such beneficial owner, to such beneficial owner,
(ii) to an Affiliate, or (iii) if such record owner is a partnership or the
nominee of a partnership, to a partner, retired partner, or estate of a partner
or retired partner, of such partnership, so long as such transfer is in
accordance with the transferee's interest in such partnership and is without
consideration; provided, however, that each such transferee shall remain
subject to all restrictions on the transfer of securities herein contained.

ARTICLE XI

subject of this Agreement, and as to those matters the law of the jurisdiction
under which the respective entity derives its powers shall govern.

11.3 Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. This
Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties pertaining to the
subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings,
negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the parties. Prior
to the completion of the Closing, no amendment, supplement, modification or
waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in a written
instrument by the party to be bound thereby; thereafter any such amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver shall require execution of a written
instrument by the beneficial holders of no less than a majority of the
Preferred Shares then outstanding and, if it is bound thereby, by Peregrine.

prevailing party in such action shall be entitled to an award of reasonable
costs of litigation, including attorneys' fees and related costs, to be paid by
the losing party in such action as may be determined by the court having
jurisdiction in such action. In addition to costs of litigation, if Buyers
incur costs in connection with any effort or action (whether or not litigation
is involved) to defend or enforce rights and remedies under this Agreement in
connection with a case commenced by or against Peregrine under the federal
bankruptcy or reorganization laws or similar laws under applicable state law,
Buyers shall be entitled to an award of reasonable costs and expenses,
including attorneys' fees, incurred in connection with such efforts or actions.

party hereto and their transferees, successors and assigns, and nothing in this

effect the registration of Registrable Stock under the Securities Act and the
registration or qualification thereof under all applicable state securities or
blue sky laws, but only to the extent provided for in the following provisions
of this Agreement. A request pursuant to this Section 2(A) shall state the
intended method of disposition of the Registrable Stock sought to be
registered. Whenever Peregrine shall, pursuant to this Section 2(A), be
requested to effect the registration of any Registrable Stock under the
Securities Act, Peregrine shall promptly give written notice of such proposed
registration to all Holders of Registrable Stock, stating that such Holders
have the right to request that any or all of the Registrable Stock owned by

described in Section 9. below, Peregrine shall include in such registration
all Registrable Stock with respect to which Peregrine receives written requests
from the Holders thereof for inclusion therein (stating the intended method of
disposition of such Stock); and thereupon Peregrine

283
<PAGE> 6
will, as expeditiously as possible, use its best efforts to effect the
registration, under the Securities Act, of such Registrable Stock which
Peregrine has been requested to register for disposition by such Holders in
accordance with the intended method of disposition described in the requests of
such Holders, all to the extent requisite to permit such sale or other
disposition by such Holders of the Conversion Stock so registered.

respecting the Plan Common and two Registration Statements respecting the
Conversion Stock shall have been filed by Peregrine with and made effective by
the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act pursuant to
requests made pursuant to Section 2(A) and the offerings pursuant to each such
Registration Statement shall have been completed. The Holders of at least a
majority of the Registrable Stock included in a Registration Statement filed
pursuant to this Section 2 shall have the right to select the investment banker
or bankers who shall serve as the manager and/or co-managers for the offering
of Securities covered by such Registration Statement if the offering requested
is to be an underwritten offering.

eligible to use Form S-3 to register Common for sale by the Holders thereof
under the Securities Act, the Holder or Holders of Registrable Stock in
existence at such time having a fair market value of at least $1,000,000 (fair
market value per share to be equal to the reported closing bid price of the
Common on the date for which such price is reported last preceding the date of
the request) shall be entitled to require Peregrine to register Registrable
Stock pursuant to the provisions of Section 2(A) hereof for an unlimited number
of times, and Peregrine shall comply with each such request in accordance with
the terms of Section 2(A) hereof.

3. Incidental Registration.

If Peregrine at any time during the ten year period commencing on the
Effective Date proposes or is required to register any of its Securities under
the Securities Act or any applicable state securities or blue sky laws on a
form which permits inclusion of the Registrable Stock, it will each such time
give written notice to all Holders of then existing Registrable Stock of its
intention so to do. Upon the written request of any such Holder given within
30 days after receipt of any such notice, Peregrine will use its best efforts
to cause all Registrable Stock which such Holders shall have requested be
registered to be registered under the Securities Act and any applicable state
securities or blue sky laws all to the extent requisite to permit the sale or
other disposition by such Holders of the Registrable Stock so registered. No
registrations of

284
<PAGE> 7
Registrable Stock under this Section 3 shall relieve Peregrine of its
obligation to effect registrations under Section 2 hereof, or shall constitute
a registration request by any Holder of Registrable Stock under Section 2.
Peregrine shall have the right to select the investment banker or bankers who
shall serve as the manager and/or co-managers for all registrations of
offerings of Securities under this Section 3.

4. Registration Procedures.

Whenever Peregrine is required by the provisions of this Agreement to
use its best efforts to effect the registration of any Registrable Stock under
the Securities Act, Peregrine will:

(A) As expeditiously as possible and in any event not more than 90
days after the end of the period within which requests for registration may be
given to the Company, prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission a Registration Statement with respect to such Registrable Stock and
use its best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become and remain
effective for a period of not less than nine months, provided that before

thereto, Peregrine will furnish to counsel for the Holders of Registrable Stock
included in such Registration Statement copies of all such documents proposed
to be filed, which documents will be subject to the review of such counsel;

(B) As expeditiously as possible, prepare and file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission such amendments and supplements to such

Registration Statement during such period in accordance with the intended
method or methods of disposition by the Sellers thereof set forth in such
Registration Statement;

(C) furnish to each Seller such number of copies of such

Seller;

(D) use every reasonable effort to register or qualify all the
Securities covered by such Registration Statement under such other securities

or other disposition in such jurisdiction of the Securities owned by

285
<PAGE> 8
such Seller covered by such Registration Statement; provided, however, that
Peregrine shall not be required to (i) qualify to do business as a foreign

qualify but for this subparagraph, (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such
jurisdiction, or (iii) consent to general service of process in any such

counterpart, addressed to such Seller (and the underwriters, if any) of

(x) an opinion of counsel for Peregrine, dated the effective
date of such Registration Statement (and, if such registration
includes an underwritten public offering, dated the date of
the closing under the underwriting agreement), reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to such Seller covering
substantially the same matters with respect to such
Registration Statement and the Prospectus included therein as
are customarily covered in opinions of issuer's counsel
delivered to the underwriters in underwritten public offerings
of securities and such other legal matters as such Seller or
Sellers may reasonably request, and

(y) the cold comfort letter referred to in Section 4(M) hereof;

(G) notify each Seller at any time when a Prospectus relating to
the Securities of such Seller covered by such Registration Statement is
required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the happening of any
event as a result of which the Prospectus included in such Registration
Statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits any fact
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and at the request of
any such Seller, prepare a supplement or amendment to such Prospectus so that,
as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Securities covered by such
Registration Statement, such Prospectus will not contain an untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any fact necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading;

(H) otherwise use its best efforts to comply with all applicable
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and make
available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, an
earnings statement covering the period of at least twelve months, but not more
than eighteen

286
<PAGE> 9
months, beginning with the first full calendar month after the effective date
of such registration statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the
provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act, and furnish to each Seller
at least five business days prior to the filing thereof a copy of such
Registration Statement or any Prospectus and any amendment or supplement to
such Registration Statement or Prospectus, and not file any thereof to which
any Seller shall have reasonably objected on the grounds that such document
does not comply in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act or of the rules or regulations thereunder;

(I) cause all such Securities covered by such Registration
Statement to be listed on each securities exchange on which Securities of the

(J) provide a transfer agent and registrar for Common not later
than the effective date of such Registration Statement;

(K) enter into such customary agreements (including an
underwriting agreement in customary form) and take all such other actions as
the Holders of at least a majority of the Registrable Stock included in such
Registration Statement or underwriters, if any, reasonably request in order to
expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Securities (including, without
limitation, effecting a stock split or a combination of shares);

(L) make available for inspection by any Seller, any underwriter
participating in any disposition pursuant to such Registration Statement, and
any attorney, accountant or other agent retained by any such Seller or
underwriter, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and
properties of Peregrine, and cause Peregrine's officers, directors and
employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such Seller,
underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with such Registration
Statement; and

(M) obtain a cold comfort letter from Peregrine's independent
public accountants in customary form and covering such matters of the type
customarily covered by cold comfort letters as the Holders of at least a
majority of the Registrable Stock included in such Registration Statement or
the managing underwriter of the offering covered by such Registration Statement
shall reasonably request.

5. Expenses.

To the fullest extent allowable under applicable state securities and
blue sky laws, all expenses incurred in effecting the registrations provided
for in Sections 2(A), 2(C) and 3 hereof, including, without limitation, all
registration and filing fees, printing expenses, fees and disbursements of
counsel for Peregrine, fees and disbursements of a single counsel for all of
the Sellers, underwriting expenses other than underwriting

287
<PAGE> 10
discounts and commissions, expenses of any audits incident to or required by
any such registration and expenses of complying with the securities or blue sky
laws of any jurisdictions pursuant to Subsection (D) of Section 4 hereof, shall
be borne and paid by Peregrine.

6. Preparation; Reasonable Investigation.

In connection with the preparation and filing of each Registration
Statement under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, Peregrine will
give the Holders of Registrable Stock registered under such Registration
Statement, their underwriters, if any, and their respective counsel and
accountants, the opportunity to participate in the preparation of such
Registration Statement, each Prospectus included therein or filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and each amendment thereof or supplement
thereto, and will give each of them such access to its books and records and
such opportunities to discuss the business of Peregrine with its officers and
the independent public accountants who have certified its financial statements
as shall be necessary, in the opinion of such Holders' and such underwriters'
respective counsel, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of
the Securities Act. In addition, if such Registration Statement refers to any
Holder including Registrable Stock therein by name or otherwise as the holder
of any securities of Peregrine, then such Holder shall have the right to
require (x) the insertion therein of language, in form and substance
satisfactory to such Holder, to the effect that the holding by such Holder of
such securities does not necessarily make such Holder a "controlling person" of
Peregrine within the meaning of the Securities Act and is not to be construed
as a recommendation by such Holder of the investment quality of Peregrine's
debt or equity securities covered thereby and that such holding does not imply
that such Holder will assist in meeting any future financial requirements of
Peregrine, or (y) in the event that such reference to such Holder by name or
otherwise is not required by the Securities Act or any rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the deletion of the reference to such Holder.

7. Indemnification.

(A) In the event of any registration of any of its Securities
under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, Peregrine, to the extent
permitted by law, shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller of such
Securities, each underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act), each other
Person who participates in the offering of such Securities, and each other
Person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act) such
Seller, underwriter or participating Person, against any losses, claims,
damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such Seller, underwriter,
participating Person or controlling Person may become subject under the
Securities Act or any other statute or at common law, in so far as such losses,

288
<PAGE> 11
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or
are based upon (1) any alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained,
on the effective date thereof, in any Registration Statement under which such
Securities were registered under the Securities Act, any preliminary Prospectus
or final Prospectus contained therein, or any summary Prospectus issued in
connection with any Securities being registered, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, or (2) any alleged omission to state in any such document a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, and shall reimburse each such Seller, or any such underwriter,
participating Person or controlling Person for any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such Seller, underwriter, participating Person or
controlling Person in connection with investigating or defending any such loss,
damage, liability or action; provided, however, that Peregrine shall not be
liable to any Seller, or any such underwriter, participating Person, or
controlling Person in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim,
damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any alleged untrue statement
or alleged omission made in such Registration Statement, preliminary
Prospectus, summary Prospectus, Prospectus, or amendment or supplement thereto
in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to
Peregrine by such Seller, specifically for use therein.

(B) Each Holder of Registrable Stock, by acceptance thereof,
severally and not jointly, indemnifies and holds harmless each other Holder of
Registrable Stock, Peregrine, its directors and officers, each underwriter (as
defined in the Securities Act), and each other Person, if any, who controls
(within the meaning of the Securities Act) Peregrine, any underwriter or any
Holder, against any losses, claims, damages, or liabilities, joint or several,
to which any such other Holder, Peregrine, any such director or officer, any
such underwriter, or any such Person may become subject under the Securities
Act or any other statute or at common law, in so far as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are
based upon (1) any alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained, on
the effective date thereof, in any Registration Statement under which
Registrable Stock is registered under the Securities Act at the request of such
Holder, any preliminary Prospectus or final Prospectus contained therein, or
any summary Prospectus issued in connection with any such Securities being
registered, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or (2) any alleged omission
to state in any such document a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in either case to the
extent, and only to the extent, that such alleged untrue statement or alleged
omission was made in such Registration Statement, preliminary Prospectus,
summary Prospectus, Prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to Peregrine by such Holder
specifically for use therein, and then only to the

289
<PAGE> 12
extent that such alleged untrue statements or alleged omissions by such Holder
were not based on the authority of an expert as to which such Holder had no
reasonable ground to believe, and did not believe, that the statements made on
the authority of such expert were untrue or that there was an omission to state
a material fact. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Subsection
(B), no Holder shall be required to pay under such provisions an amount in
excess of the proceeds received by such Holder in payment for the Securities
sold by such Holder pursuant to the Registration Statement.

(C) Indemnification similar to that specified in Subsections (A)
and (B) of this Section 7 shall be given by Peregrine and each Seller (with
such modifications as shall be appropriate) covered by any registration or
other qualification of Securities under any federal or state securities law or
regulation other than the Securities Act with respect to any such registration
or other qualification effected pursuant to this Agreement.

(D) Any Person which proposes to assert the right to be
indemnified under Subsections (A), (B) or (C) of this Section 7 shall, promptly
after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit or proceeding
against such Person in respect of which a claim is to be made against an
indemnifying Person under such Subsections (A), (B) or (C), notify each such
indemnifying Person of the commencement of such action, suit or proceeding,
enclosing a copy of all papers served. The indemnifying Person shall have the
right to investigate and defend any such loss, claim, damage, liability or
action and to employ separate counsel in any such action and to control the
defense thereof. The Person claiming indemnification shall have the right to
employ separate counsel in any such action and to control the defense thereof,
but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall not be at the expense of the
Person against whom indemnification is sought; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, in any case when indemnification is sought
against Peregrine and (i) the Person seeking indemnification has been advised
by counsel that its defenses may be different from those of Peregrine, or (ii)
Peregrine has not proceeded in a timely manner to effect such defense, then the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for such Person shall be paid by
Peregrine and the indemnified Person shall have the right to control the
defense of such action, suit or proceeding. In no event shall a Person against
whom indemnification is sought be obligated to indemnify any Person for any
settlement of any claim or action effected without the indemnifying Person's
consent.

(E) The indemnification provided for under this Section 7 will
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling Person
of such indemnified party and will survive the transfer of Securities.

290
<PAGE> 13
8. Participation in Underwritten Registrations.

unless such Person (i) agrees to sell such Person's Securities on the basis
provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons entitled
hereunder to approve such arrangements and (ii) completes and executes all
questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and
other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.
The Holders of Registrable Stock to be sold in an underwritten offering

representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part of,
Peregrine to and for the benefit of the underwriters in or pursuant to the
underwriting agreement pertaining to such offering shall also be made to and
for the benefit of such Holders of Registrable Stock and that any or all of the
conditions precedent to the obligations of such underwriters under such
underwriting agreement be conditions precedent to the obligations of such
Holders of Registrable Stock. Any such Holder of Registrable Stock shall not
be required to make any representations or warranties to or agreements with
Peregrine or the underwriters other than representations, warranties or
agreements regarding such Holder, such Holder's Registrable Stock and such
Holder's intended method of distribution and any other representation required
by law.

Securities and without otherwise materially and adversely affecting
such offering,

then the relative rights to participate in such offering of the Holders of

291
<PAGE> 14
having the right to include such Securities in such registration, and Peregrine
shall be in the following order of priority:

First: The Holders of Registrable Stock shall be entitled to
participate in accordance with the number of shares of Registrable
Stock which each such Holder shall request to be registered, such
participation to be pro rata in accordance with the number of shares
which each such Holder shall request be registered if, pursuant to
clause 4 of this Subsection (A), the total amount of Securities to be
included in the offering will be less than the number of shares of
Registrable Stock that all of such Holders shall request be
registered; and then

Second: Peregrine shall be entitled to participate; and then

Third: All Holders of other Securities having the right to
include such Securities in such registration shall be entitled to
participate in accordance with the relative priorities, if any, as
shall exist among them;

and no Securities (issued or unissued) other than those registered and included
in the underwritten offering shall be offered for sale or other disposition by
Peregrine or any Holder of Registrable Stock in a transaction which would

Section 2 hereof, or such earlier time consented to by the managing
underwriters.

(B) If

included in such offering would exceed the maximum amount of
Securities (as specified in such opinion) which can be marketed at a
price reasonably related to the then current market value of such
Securities and without materially and adversely affecting such
offering,

then the relative rights to participate in such offering of the Holders of
Registrable Stock, the Holders of other Securities having the right to include
such Securities in such registration, and Peregrine shall be in the following
order of priority:

292
<PAGE> 15
First: If such offering shall have been initiated by
Peregrine, and shall equal or exceed the amount necessary to allow
Peregrine to cause an optional conversion to occur pursuant to Section
5.2.5.1. of the Declaration of Trust, and Peregrine makes such an
election to effect an Optional Conversion, then Peregrine shall be
entitled to include in such Registration Statement all Securities that
it shall elect to so include.

Second: If such registration shall have been requested by a
Person or Persons other than Peregrine, the Person or Persons
requesting such registration shall be entitled to participate in
accordance with the relative priorities, if any, as shall exist among
them; and then

Third: The Holders of Registrable Stock and all other Holders
of Securities having the right to include such Securities in such
registration shall be entitled to participate pro rata among

after the effective date of the Registration Statement in which Registrable
Stock was included pursuant to Section 3 hereof, or such earlier time consented
to by the managing underwriters.

10. Market Stand-Off.

Each Investor (and any subsequent holder of Securities owned by one or
more of the Investors) agrees not to make a demand for registration under
Section 2. of this Agreement during the one hundred and eighty (180) day period
following the effective date of a registration statement of Peregrine filed
under the

293
<PAGE> 16
Securities Act in connection with a Public Offering of Peregrine's Common
Stock, if so requested by Peregrine. Peregrine may impose stop-transfer
restrictions with respect to such Securities, subject to the foregoing
restrictions to the end of such period.

In addition to the restrictions in the preceding paragraph, from and
after such time as the Investors have sold or otherwise disposed of fifty-one
percent (51%) of the aggregate shares of Plan Common held by them as of the
Effective Date, in the event of an underwritten public offering of shares of
Common and/or equity securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable
for shares of Common by Peregrine (which offering requires registration of such
Securities under the Securities Act) in which Peregrine causes the optional
conversion of shares of Preferred into shares of Common pursuant to Section
5.2.5.1 of the Company's Declaration of Trust, no Securities (issued or
unissued) other than those registered and included in such offering shall be
publicly sold or transferred, or offered for public sale or other public
disposition by current or prior Holders of Registrable Stock, or by the
transferees of any Securities from such Holders.

11. Assignability of Registration Rights.

The registration rights set forth in this Agreement shall accrue to
each subsequent Holder of Registrable Stock who consents in writing to be bound
by the terms and conditions of this Agreement; provided, however, that if a
Holder transfers any fewer than 150,000 shares (or all of the shares held by
such Holder, whichever is less) to any other Holder, those shares so
transferred shall no longer be deemed Registrable Stock and the transferee and
the shares so transferred shall be entitled to no registration rights, or other
rights under this Agreement.

12. Grant of Subsequent Registration Rights.

Peregrine may not grant registration rights to investors in Peregrine
other than the Holders of Registrable Stock unless such rights are subordinate
to the rights of the Holders of Registrable Stock or the grant of such rights
is consented to by the Holders of not less than a majority of the Registrable
Stock.

13. Severability.

Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement will be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid
under applicable law, such provision will be ineffective only to the extent of
such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of this
Agreement.

EXHIBIT 10
SERVICES AND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

1. IDENTIFICATION.

This Services and Confidentiality Agreement (the "Agreement") is made
as of October 1, 1994, between Commonwealth Equity Trust, a California Real
Estate Investment Trust ("CET"), and Fama Management, Inc., a California
corporation ("Fama").

2. RECITALS.

2.1. CET is presently a debtor in possession operating under
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, and in connection with the
bankruptcy proceeding has filed a plan of reorganization (the "Plan of
Reorganization") with the bankruptcy court for confirmation. CET desires to
engage a Chief Executive Officer to provide services to CET commencing October
1, 1994, which services shall continue following confirmation of the Plan of
Reorganization in CET's bankruptcy proceeding, and following the effective date
of the Plan of Reorganization (the "Effective Date"), to the extent
confirmation of the Plan of Reorganization and the Effective Date occur prior
to the expiration or termination of the "Term," as set forth in Article 3
below.

2.2. CET wishes to engage Fama to provide the services of Frank
A. Morrow ("Morrow") who will act as CET's Chief Executive Officer as of
October 1, 1994 pursuant to the terms hereof. Fama desires to provide Morrow's
services to CET, as more particularly described below.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants
contained herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:

3. TERM.

This Agreement shall commence on October 1, 1994 and shall continue
for a period of one (1) year thereafter (the "Original Term"), unless earlier
terminated by CET's Board of Trustees on written notice to Fama, with or
without cause, in CET's sole discretion, subject to CET's payment of certain
severance compensation to Fama as more particularly set forth in Section 5.2
below. The Original Term may be extended mutually by CET and Fama for an
additional one (1) year period (the "Extension Period") on the same terms set
forth herein which apply during the Original Term; notwithstanding the
foregoing, if CET terminates this Agreement and Morrow's services as provided
by Fama during the Extension Period, the amount of severance compensation which
shall

299

<PAGE> 2

become payable to Fama on such termination shall be limited in the manner
described in Section 5.2 below. The Original Term and any extension thereof
shall be collectively referred to herein as the "Term."

4. DUTIES.

4.1. During the Term, Morrow shall report solely and directly to,
and be under the immediate supervision of, CET's Board of Trustees.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, CET's Board of Trustees shall not unduly
interfere with the performance of Morrow's duties hereunder or Morrow's
decision making with respect to CET's day-to-day operations. Morrow shall
serve as CET's Chief Executive Officer, with the powers and duties consistent
with such position. The responsibilities to be performed by Morrow shall be
such as inhere in the position of Chief Executive Officer, and such other
powers, duties and responsibilities as may be delegated or assigned to Morrow
by CET's Board of Trustees, so long as Morrow maintains the duties of CET's
Chief Executive Officer, i.e. Morrow shall maintain direct responsibility for
the operations and administration of CET. Morrow's duties shall include, but
are not limited to, responsibility for the planning, supervision, management
and coordination of CET's asset and property portfolio, and, specifically, the
management and leasing of CET's commercial and retail properties, management
and operation of CET's hotels, management of CET's notes receivable portfolio,
management of CET's joint venture interests, supervising the administration of
CET's financial affairs, coordination of CET's advisors and supervision and
administration of CET's employees, including the terms and conditions of
employment of CET's employees in consultation with CET's Board of Trustees.
Morrow is presently serving and shall continue to serve as Chairman of the
Board of Trustees and Chief Executive Officer of California Real Investment
Trust ("CalReit"). Morrow's services on behalf of CalReit shall be performed
without additional compensation other than as set forth in Article 5 below.

4.2. Fama shall cause Morrow to do and perform all services, acts
and obligations necessary and advisable to carry out Morrow's duties hereunder
in a competent and diligent manner, subject to and in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, CET's policies, rules and regulations and the direction of
CET's Board of Trustees.

4.3. Fama shall provide Morrow's services on a full time basis
and Morrow shall not engage in any other business or employment during the
Term. Fama shall cause Morrow to devote his full productive time, energy,
effort, attention and ability solely to the performance of his duties as set
forth herein, and to the proper and efficient management and development of the
business and operations of CET. Notwithstanding the foregoing, CET
acknowledges that Morrow currently holds the position of Director on the Board

300

<PAGE> 3

of Trustees of the Lansing Pacific Fund, and performs consulting services for
McCown DeLeeuw, and further, acknowledges that such activities are not in
violation of the provisions of this Section 4.3, conditional that such
obligations do not interfere with the performance of Morrow's responsibilities
at CET.

5. COMPENSATION.

5.1. During the Term, and conditioned upon Morrow's full and
faithful performance of his duties hereunder, CET shall pay to Fama, as full
and complete compensation for all of the services to be rendered by Fama and/or
Morrow hereunder, a salary equal to Twenty-Five Thousand Dollars ($25,000) per
month. CET shall pay Fama one-half of the monthly salary on the tenth (10th)
and the twenty-fifth (25th) day of each month during the Term.

5.2. If CET terminates this Agreement and Morrow's services as
provided by Fama during the Original Term, or if CET does not offer to extend
the Original Term for an additional one (1) year period on the expiration of
the Original Term as set forth in Section 3.1 above, CET shall pay to Fama upon
such termination, or upon the expiration of the Original Term, as applicable,
severance compensation in the amount of Three Hundred Thousand Dollars
($300,000) (the "Severance Compensation"). If CET terminates this Agreement
and Morrow's services during the Extension Period, CET shall pay Fama the
Severance Compensation reduced by the amount of any compensation paid to Fama
as consideration for Morrow's services during the Extension Period. Neither
Fama nor Morrow shall have any duty or obligation to mitigate any damages
arising from CET's termination of this Agreement and Morrow's services, nor
shall the amount of the Severance Compensation be reduced based on any
mitigating circumstances. The Severance Compensation shall constitute full and
complete payment to Fama of any and all amounts which may be or become owing
from CET to Fama arising from this Agreement or Morrow's services as set forth
herein, or the termination of this Agreement and such services, and neither
Fama nor Morrow shall have any additional claim for compensation or damages on
CET's termination of this Agreement and Morrow's services other than as set
forth in this Section 5.2 and in Article 6 below.

5.3. Fama shall be eligible to participate in any stock option
plan adopted by CET, on terms to be determined by CET's Board of Trustees.

5.4. Fama acknowledges that neither Fama nor Morrow shall be an
employee of CET for federal tax purposes, and Fama shall be responsible for
paying all of its and Morrow's estimated income and self-employment taxes. CET
shall have no obligation to make any withholdings from compensation payable
hereunder for state or federal taxes and shall have no other obligations of an
employer

301

<PAGE> 4

with respect to Fama and/or Morrow. Fama shall indemnify and hold CET harmless
from and against any and all costs, liabilities, expenses, damages or fees
(including, but not limited to, attorneys' fees and costs) resulting from a
failure by Fama and/or Morrow to pay its or his own estimated income and
self-employment taxes.

5.5. All compensation payable for Morrow's services shall be
payable to Fama directly, and not to Morrow. Morrow shall look solely to Fama
to perform and discharge, and Fama shall fully perform and discharge, and CET
shall have no responsibility or liability on account of, any obligation of an
employer, including, without limitation, the payment and/or withholding of all
sums required to be paid and/or withheld by such employer, pension, health and
welfare benefits, social security, unemployment, workers' compensation and
state disability insurance required in connection with, based on, resulting
from or relating to the services to be rendered hereunder and/or the rights to
be granted by Morrow under this Agreement and/or the compensation to be paid to
Fama therefore. Fama and Morrow agree to indemnify and hold CET harmless from
and against any and all liability (including, without limitation, judgments,
penalties, interests, damages, costs, expenses and attorneys' fees) which CET
may incur by reason of Fama's failure to assume and discharge all obligations
imposed on employers (including, without limitation, with respect to income tax
withholding as discussed in Section 5.4 above).

6. EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENTS.

6.1. CET shall reimburse Fama for Morrow's actual and reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the performance of Morrow's duties
hereunder. Reimbursable expenses shall include Morrow's commuting costs from
San Francisco to Sacramento, which shall include gasoline, tolls, parking,
hotels and meals. In addition, CET shall reimburse Fama for Morrow's business
expenses related to travel from Sacramento to Los Angeles, or other locations
requiring his presence for CET business.

6.2. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.1 above, in no
event shall the aggregate reimbursement of expenses from CET to Fama exceed Two
Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500) in any month during the Term.

6.3. CET's reimbursement of Morrow's expenses, as described in
Sections 6.1 and 6.2 above, is expressly conditioned upon the following in each
instance:

(a) Each such expense must be of a nature qualifying it
as a proper deduction on CET's federal and state income tax returns as a
business expense, and not as deductible compensation to Fama;

302
<PAGE> 5

(b) Fama and/or Morrow furnishes CET with adequate
records and other documentary evidence required by either federal or state
statutes or regulations issued by appropriate taxing authorities for the
substantiation of such expenses as deductible business expenses of CET and not
as deductible compensation to Fama; and

(c) Reimbursement shall be paid and payable by CET in
accordance with its policies and procedures for making such reimbursements in
the normal course of its business.

7. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

7.1. "Confidential Information" means any information relating to
CET's business or operations which is not generally known outside of CET or
information entrusted to CET by third parties, and includes information known
as confidential or secret or which reasonably should be known as confidential
or secret. Confidential Information may relate, for example, to financial or
other investment information, shareholder information, CET's strategic
planning, trade secrets, technology, ideas, processes, computer hardware,
computer software, business or marketing plans, the names and locations of

legal documents, correspondence, data, reports, programs, contracts between CET
and third parties, or computer programs, or may be in the nature of, or consist

know-how. Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Confidential Information" does not
include information (i) which is or becomes generally available to the public
other than as a result of a disclosure by Fama, Morrow or its or his agents,
(ii) which was available to Fama and/or Morrow on a non-confidential basis
prior to disclosure of the information to Fama and/or Morrow by CET, or (iii)
which becomes available to Fama and/or Morrow on a non-confidential basis from
a person or entity other than CET, who is not otherwise bound by a written
confidentiality agreement prohibiting that person or entity from disclosing the
information. For purposes hereof, information made public only in connection
with CET's Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding shall not be deemed information
generally available to the public.

7.2. Fama acknowledges that a confidential and fiduciary
relationship exists between Fama and Morrow, on the one hand, and CET, on the
other hand, in connection with CET's Confidential Information.

7.3. Other than as required in order for Morrow to perform the
services contemplated herein, and other than in compliance with

303

disclose, disseminate or otherwise communicate, directly or indirectly, in
whole or in part, at any time or in any manner, whether during the Term or for
a period of sixty (60) months thereafter, or twelve (12) months in connection
with Confidential Information specific to any property owned by CET, any
Confidential Information, without CET's prior written consent in each instance,
and Fama shall use its best efforts to prohibit its representatives, or any
third person acting for or on Fama's or Morrow's behalf to do any of the
foregoing. If at any time Fama and/or Morrow becomes aware of any such
unauthorized use, disclosure, dissemination or communication, or any threat
thereof, Fama shall immediately notify CET, which notice shall specify the
person(s) and circumstances relating to such unauthorized use, disclosure,
dissemination, communication or threat.

7.4. All Confidential Information relating to CET's business that
comes into Fama's and/or Morrow's knowledge or possession, as between CET on
the one hand, and Fama and Morrow on the other, is CET's exclusive property,
and except as necessary in order for Morrow to perform the services
contemplated herein, may not be reproduced, copied, summarized or removed from
CET's premises without CET's prior written consent in each instance. Any such
Confidential Information removed from CET's premises shall be immediately
returned to CET when it is no longer required in order for Morrow to perform
his duties hereunder or upon CET's demand at any time or times.

7.5. Fama acknowledges that all Confidential Information created
by Fama and/or Morrow shall be CET's exclusive property, free of any claim or
interest of any third party, and Fama, for itself and on behalf of Morrow,
hereby irrevocably and perpetually assigns to CET all rights of every kind or
nature which arise from Morrow's and/or Fama's creation of any Confidential
Information, to the extent that CET does not already own such rights.

7.6. In CET's sole discretion, CET may elect to apply for,
obtain, register or take any action to protect or prevent the infringement,
dissemination or release of any Confidential Information. If CET chooses to
take any such action, either during or after the Term, Fama shall:

(a) take any reasonable action CET determines to be
necessary or desirable in connection with the exercise and/or protection of
these rights; and

(b) execute and acknowledge before a notary and deliver to
CET, in a form suitable to CET, any document reasonably necessary or required
to obtain, exercise or protect such rights.

304

<PAGE> 7

7.7. Fama hereby irrevocably appoints any of CET's authorized
corporate officers to act as its and Morrow's agent and attorney-in-fact, which
appointment is coupled with an interest, to perform all acts described in
Section 7.6 above.

7.8. Fama's covenants and agreements contained in this Article 7
shall be deemed to be effective as of the date Fama and/or Morrow first
acquired knowledge of any Confidential Information.
