ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

On August 18, 1994, in the action Howell v. Blockbuster Entertainment
Corporation et al. (Cause No. 91-10193-M), the District Court in and for Dallas
County, Texas entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. The Court entered
judgment against all defendants, jointly and severally, in the amount of
$10,884,003 as compensatory damages, together with an additional sum of
$3,791,172 as pre-judgment interest on such amount. In addition, the Court
entered separate judgments in the nature of exemplary damages in the amount of
$36,280,010 against several defendants, including each of the Registrant and
Video Superstore Master Limited Partnership, a dissolved limited partnership
that was indirectly wholly-owned by the Registrant at the time of its
dissolution. The Court also awarded plaintiffs counsel fees in the amount of
$175,000. Finally, the Court directed that the plaintiffs recover from the
defendants, jointly and severally, post-judgment interest at the rate of 10%
per annum on all amounts awarded from the date of judgment until paid. The
Registrant and the other defendants intend to appeal the judgment in such
action. Based upon the record and existing authority, the Registrant believes
that a Texas appellate court should vacate the judgment entered by the lower
court.
