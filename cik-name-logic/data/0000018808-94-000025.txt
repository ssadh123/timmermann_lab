EXHIBIT 13

November 9, 1994

To our shareholders:

This letter and the accompanying financial statements serve
as the third quarter 1994 quarterly report. Yesterday, your
board of directors took bold action for the long-term benefit of
you, our shareholders. I wanted to inform you promptly of their
actions so this letter, instead of the normal printed report, is
being sent with your dividend check a few days earlier than
usual. If you are a participant in the Dividend Reinvestment and
Common Stock Purchase Plan, your statement will be mailed
separately by the end of the month.
As you are all well aware, the value of your investment in
Central Vermont has dropped considerably in the past year, as
have values in the rest of the industry. I am as concerned as
you over this situation, and I want to share the plan CV has to
revitalize our stock price as well as to position the company for
success into the next century.
In previous reports, we've discussed the reasons for the
recent decline in stock prices throughout our industry. The
uncertainties associated with increasing competition and the
market's realization of the changes it brings about, the
slow-growth economy, and the continuing restraints of operating
as a regulated industry in an increasingly competitive world have
all contributed to the current situation. You may also have
already heard or read of the decisions our board of directors
made that will help CV meet the challenges we now face. To help
you better understand the decisions, I want to share some
background and our thinking on the issues.
We've already taken many steps toward streamlining our
operations to be more competitive: we expect to fully realize the
targeted $20 million cuts from our operating budget by the end of
1995. This includes eliminating 105 employee positions,
negotiating changes to our purchased power contracts and trimming
our spending for demand-side management programs.

Board of Directors Announces New Corporate Strategy
The electric utility industry is in a process of change
which dictates a need for financial flexibility in the face of
the developing competitive marketplace. To meet the dictates of
change, our board of directors has announced a new corporate
strategy. This strategy includes:
* A dividend targeted at approximately 60 percent of
sustainable earnings. In light of the new policy, it is
anticipated that the current annual dividend of $1.42 will be
reduced 44 percent to $.80 effective with the first quarter
dividend declaration in 1995. The dividend payment level will be
reviewed regularly in light of capital needs, projected earnings
levels and other relevant factors.
* A common stock repurchase program. The company's directors
have authorized the purchase of up to 2 million shares of its
outstanding common stock in open market transactions.
* A new strategic plan to provide earnings growth and cost
stability.
* A further reduction in corporate spending to ensure that
only projects and activities critical to reliable, cost-effective
operations are funded.

These actions are part of a plan to both control costs and rates,
and assure the company's growth and profitability into the next
century in a more competitive, price sensitive environment. 
These moves will allow us to retain more capital in the business,
provide increased financial flexibility and assure our ability to
take advantage of opportunities for growth.

Actions Critical to Future of CV
We are keenly aware of the impact of these actions on
shareholders who rely on the dividend for part of their income.
However, taking these actions is critical to the future of the
company. The realities of the evolving energy environment will
mean that our earnings do not have the same degree of stability
and predictability they had in the past. In the future, more of
the company's total return to shareholders will come from
increases in the dividend and stock price and less from the
dividend yield. These actions, driven by the need to be more
competitive, will result in a yield that is more reflective of a
growth stock, rather than the traditional high yield utility.
We look to successfully implementing our new strategic plan
to provide the earnings growth necessary to support dividend
increases over the coming years. The plan focuses on protecting
and expanding the core business through marketing new
environmentally sensitive, electric technologies; promoting
customer growth through economic development; and expanding the
existing unregulated businesses: Catamount Energy Corp., which
concentrates in the independent power industry and SmartEnergy
Services Inc., which markets energy-efficient products and
services. Both companies operate throughout the U.S. and Canada.
CV is also actively looking for new business opportunities that
complement our existing business mix.

New Dividend Level Appropriate to Competitive Era
In 1993 CV paid shareholders dividends equal to 87 percent
of earnings, a level fairly typical across the industry. 
However, we believe the new dividend payout target of 60 percent
is an appropriate response to the new industry environment. It
will allow us to conserve cash to meet unexpected contingencies
and to finance new opportunities while relying less on outside
financing. We expect the dividend to grow over time as earnings
grow. Fewer shares outstanding means that the same level of
earnings provides higher earnings per share and that less cash is
required for common stock dividends.
We expect to purchase up to 2 million shares of common
stock. Financing for these purchases will be primarily from
internally generated funds. This option will also provide the
company with an additional tool for managing its capital
structure.

Seek Headquarters Project Delay
We want to ensure that only projects critical to our
operations are funded. In light of this, we are deferring some
planned expenditures. Working with our partners, we are
presently seeking a delay in building the proposed new
headquarters building to allow a thorough reevaluation of the
project. This move to conserve capital and resources, in
combination with our other actions, will help give Central
Vermont a more flexible financial position in the future.
Achieving that, we'll be able to put more money back into the
business and be capable of investing in new business
opportunities which will create earnings growth.

Disappointing Rate Decision Still Gives Reason for Optimism
In October, we received the decision of the Vermont Public
Service Board on our request for a general rate increase. They
granted us a 4.27 percent increase in our base retail rates
rather than the 8,9 percent we requested and dropped our allowed
return on common equity to 10 percent. This return is after
deducting a .75 percent penalty for "mismanagement of power
supply options" and "failed efforts to acquire all cost-effective
energy-efficiency resources."
Although we were very disappointed in the rate decision and
disagree with the regulators on the statements quoted above, we
were pleased that the order recognized that we are in a period of
change requiring the company to operate as a more competitive
energy services provider. Citing these changes, the Public
Service Board in the rate order proposed a cooperative effort to
address restructuring and regulatory reform. We welcome this
offer of joint problem solving with our regulators and are
anxious to begin discussions.

Confidence in Future
Although the reduction of the dividend is not pleasant news
to bring to you, I am confident that our strategic plan heads us
in the direction that will enhance the value of our common stock
in the long run and enable your company to grow profitably into
the next century. Our employees -- most of whom are shareholders
- -- are working together to make it happen.

Sincerely,

Thomas C. Webb
President and CEO

EARNINGS AND OPERATING RESULTS

For the quarter ended September 30, 1994, Central Vermont
experienced a loss of 11 cents per share of common stock
compared to a 9 cent loss in the same quarter in 1993. Due to
the company's winter sales peak and higher winter rates, the
company normally experiences losses in the second and third
quarters when sales are lower and rates are reduced. For the
nine and twelve month periods ended September 30, 1994, earnings
were $.70 and $1.31, respectively, compared to $1.02 and $1.52
in the same periods in 1993.
Operating revenues were nearly $2 million lower than in the
third quarter 1993, reflecting the fact that in 1993 the company
recorded approximately $1.3 million of revenues deferred from
1991. Purchased power costs decreased by $2.4 million, however,
other expense increases partially offset these decreases. The
result was a decline in earnings for common for the quarter of
$300,000.
Although the rate decision will have a positive impact on
revenues in the fourth quarter 1994, the company anticipates
other aspects of the order will result in a $2 million after-tax
write-off for the period. Though showing some improvement during
the past two quarters, retail sales have increased slightly less
than 1 percent on a year-to-date basis.

DIVIDEND DECLARED

On October 3, 1994, the board of directors declared a
dividend of thirty- five and one-half cents ($.355) per share of
common stock. The dividend is payable November 15, 1994 to
shareholders of record at the close of business October 31,
1994. Your quarterly dividend check is enclosed unless you are a
participant in the Dividend Reinvestment and Common Stock
Purchase Plan, in which case your statement is enclosed. If you
are a preferred stockholder, your dividend is payable January 1,
April 1, July 1 and October 1 and your check will be sent at
that time.

FOR RELEASE: IMMEDIATE

CENTRAL VERMONT ANNOUNCES NEW CORPORATE STRATEGY
TO POSITION ITSELF FOR FUTURE GROWTH
IN COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE

RUTLAND Nov. 9, 1994 -- Recognizing the need for financial flexibility 
in the face of an increasingly competitive marketplace, the Board of 
Directors of Central Vermont Public Service (NYSE: CV) yesterday approved 
a series of steps to control costs and rates and assure the company's 
success into the next century. This new corporate strategy involves:
* A dividend targeted at approximately 60 percent of 
sustainable earnings. In light of the new policy, it is
anticipated that the current annual dividend of $1.42 
will be reduced 44 percent to $.80 effective with the 
first quarter dividend declaration in 1995. The 
dividend payment level will be reviewed regularly in 
light of capital needs, projected earnings levels and 
other relevant factors.
* A common stock repurchase program. The company's 
directors have authorized the purchase of up to 
2 million shares of its outstanding common stock in open 
market transactions.
* A new strategic plan to provide earnings growth and 
cost stability.
* A further reduction in corporate spending to ensure 
that only projects and activities critical to reliable, 
cost-effective operations are funded.

"These actions are part of a plan to both control costs and rates, 
and assure the company's growth and profitability into the next century. 
They will allow us to retain more capital in the business, provide 
increased financial flexibility and assure our ability to take advantage 
of opportunities for growth," said CV President Thomas C. Webb.

Webb continued, "The company has to shift from operating in a fully 
regulated environment to operating successfully in what is becoming a more 
competitive, price sensitive environment. In the future, more of the 
company's total return to shareholders will come from increases in the 
dividend and stock price and less from the dividend yield. CV's actions 
today, driven by the need to be more competitive, will result in a yield 
that is more reflective of a growth stock, rather than the traditional high 
yield utility."

Recognizing the Public Service Board's proposal, made in the recent rate 
order, to join in a cooperative effort to address restructuring and 
regulatory reform of the industry, Webb said "This offer of joint problem 
solving with our regulators is very welcome and we are anxious to begin 
discussions."

Webb went on to describe CV's new strategic plan which has to provide the 
earnings growth necessary to support dividend increases over the coming 
years. The plan, he said, "focuses on protecting and expanding the core 
business through marketing new environmentally sensitive, electric 
technologies; promoting customer growth through economic development; and 
expanding the existing unregulated businesses, one of which concentrates 
in the independent power industry and the other which markets energy- 
efficient products and services." Both companies operate throughout the U.S.
and Canada. CV is alos actively looking for new business opportunities that
complement our existing business mix.

Webb continued, "The endeavor we began last year to identify and 
eliminate $20 million from our operating costs was only a beginning. We've 
nearly achieved those savings but our new strategy includes an active, 
ongoing program to stabilize rates by controlling costs. At the same time, 
we will continue cost- effective demand-side management programs, 
particularly focusing on savings opportunities that would otherwise be 
lost."

Regulatory uncertainties, slow economic growth, the availability of new 
technologies and the participation of new power suppliers have left 
electric utilities without the same degree of stability and predictability 
of earnings they had in the past.

Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Robert H. Young 
commented, "Our new strategic objectives and the less predictable nature of 
earnings mean it's necessary that we pay a lower ratio of dividends to 
earnings. In 1993 CV paid shareholders dividends equal to 87 percent of 
earnings, a level fairly typical across the industry. However, we believe 
the new payout target of 60 percent of sustainable earnings is an 
appropriate response to the new industry environment. It will allow us to 
conserve cash to meet unexpected contingencies and to finace new 
opportunities while relying less on outside financing.

"Fewer shares outstanding means that the same level of earnings provides 
higher earnings per share and that less cash is required for common stock 
dividends. In addition, the dividend payout ratio will now be low enough 
to allow the dividend to grow as earnings grow," continued Young. "As this 
happens, there will be a real opportunity to enhance shareholder value."

Speaking of the stock buy-back, Young explained, "We expect to purchase 
up to 2 million shares of common stock. Financing for these purchases will 
be primarily from internally generated funds. This option will also 
provide CV with an additional tool for managing our capital structure."

Talking about the further reduction in corporate spending, Young 
commented, "We want to ensure that only projects critical to our 
operations are funded. In light of this, we are deferring some planned 
expenditures. Working with our partners, we are presently seeking a 
delay in building the proposed new headquarters building to allow a 
thorough reevaluation of the project. This move to conserve capital and 
resources, in combination with our other actions, will help give Central 
Vermont a more flexible financial position in the future. Achieving that,
we'll be able to put more money back into the business and be capable of
investing in new business opportunities which will create earnings growth."

CV Chairman of the Board, F. Ray Keyser Jr., emphasized the board of 
directors' support for the new corporate direction noting, "Electric 
utilities across the nation are revisiting their direction and financial 
policies in light of the evolving competition. I am confident that our 
program is well thought out and positions CV for success in a competitive 
deregulated environment."
