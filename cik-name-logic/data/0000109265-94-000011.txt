Item 5. Other Events.

The following statement was included in the Company's recently filed 
Form S-3 Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933:

"INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS

"The following factors should be carefully considered in evaluating 
an investment in any shares of Common Stock offered hereby:

"Losses From Continuing Operations. The Company has reported substantial 
losses from its continuing operations for the last eight years. The color 
television market in the United States has been under intense pricing 
pressure for many years and color television prices have dropped sharply, 
resulting in substantially reduced profit margins. Although the Company has 
benefitted from major cost-reduction programs, lower sales and inflationary 
cost increases have more than offset such cost reduction benefits. In 
recent years, operating results have also been adversely affected by 
significant restructuring charges, start-up costs for new programs and 
costs related to downsizing certain non-consumer businesses. The Company 
expects a loss in the fourth quarter and the full year 1993 despite record 
industry unit volume. The Company also plans to take a special charge 
of about $30 million in the fourth quarter of 1993. See "Recent 
Developments." There can be no assurance that the Company's net operating 
losses will not continue for the foreseeable future.

"Liquidity. Cash decreased from $176 million at December 31, 1989 to 
zero at October 2, 1993. (Due to the seasonal nature of the Company's 
business, cash available peaks after year ends). Of the total cash 
decrease, $67 million was related to the disposition of the discontinued 
computer products business and took place in 1990, while the remaining 
$109 million related to ongoing operations, including cash used for 
operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. The 
Company's borrowings during this period have increased, and the Company 
entered into the Credit Agreement in May, 1993. The maximum commitment 
of funds available for borrowing under the Credit Agreement is $90 million, 
based upon a borrowing base formula related to eligible accounts and 
eligible inventory (each as defined in the Credit Agreement). As of 
February 3, 1994, the Company had outstanding borrowings under the 
Credit Agreement of $25 million. The Credit Agreement is scheduled to 
expire in December 1994. See "Credit Agreement." Although the Company 
believes that its Credit Agreement, together with extended-term payables 
available from a foreign supplier and its continuing efforts to obtain 
other financing sources, will be adequate to meet its seasonal working 
capital needs, there can be no assurance that the Company may not 
experience liquidity problems in the future because of adverse market 
conditions or other unfavorable events.

"Business Strategy. The Company's business strategy involves improving the 
profitability of core businesses and the introduction of new products, such 
as high-definition television, home theater TVs and new digital cable 
products, as well as the restructuring of certain business operations. 
These efforts to improve profitability, develop and introduce new products 
and restructure operations are expected to continue to involve significant 
expenditures by the Company in 1994 and beyond. There can be no assurance 
that the Company will achieve the improvement in financial results 
expected from this business strategy.

<PAGE>

"Competition. The Company's major product areas, including the color 
television market, are highly competitive. The Company's major competitors 
are foreign-owned global giants, generally with greater financial, marketing, 
manufacturing and technical resources. In efforts to increase market share 
or achieve higher production volumes, the Company's competitors have 
aggressively lowered their selling prices. Some of the Company's foreign 
competitors have been capable of offsetting the effects of U.S. price 
reductions through sales at higher margins in their home markets and 
through direct governmental supports. There can be no assurance that 
such competition will not continue to adversely affect the Company's 
performance or that the Company will be able to maintain its market share 
in the face of such competition."
