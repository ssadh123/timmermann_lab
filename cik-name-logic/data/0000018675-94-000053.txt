Item 1 through Item 4. Not applicable.

Item 5. Other Events.

As previously reported, the Company filed a stipulation with
the Maine Public Utilities Commission ( MPUC ) on October 14,
1994, that set forth the terms of a proposed five-year
Alternative Rate Plan ( ARP ). The proposed ARP contained an
inflation-indexed price cap, an offset to reflect productivity
gains, provisions for pricing flexibility for the Company within
the price cap to assist in meeting competition for segments of
its customer base, mechanisms for sharing risks and savings
between ratepayers and the Company, and other terms that had been
negotiated by the parties to the pending MPUC ARP proceeding.
The stipulated ARP also required the Company to take certain
charges to 1994 earnings that could total approximately $100
million on a pre-tax basis, upon approval of the ARP by the MPUC.

On December 20, 1994, the MPUC voted unanimously to adopt the
ARP, effective January 1, 1995. Adoption of the ARP had also
been one of the conditions to the effectiveness of agreements
offered by the Company to its largest customers, as also
previously reported, that would provide, in conjunction with
tariff reductions filed contemporaneously with the MPUC, rate
reductions for those customers. Under those agreements, when
finalized, executed and delivered, the Company would serve the
existing electrical load of those customers for five years,
subject to certain conditions. Although the ARP was broadly
supported in the MPUC proceeding, an appeal is possible.

The Company believes that adoption of the ARP provides the
Company new opportunities to act more quickly and competitively
in certain sectors of its business that are opening to
competition, while continuing MPUC oversight of the Company s
traditional responsibilities to customers.
