THE BEAR STEARNS COMPANIES INC.
REPORTS RECORD SECOND QUARTER RESULTS;
NET INCOME INCREASES 110%

New York, New York -- January 13, 1994 -- The Bear Stearns Companies Inc.
(NYSE:BSC) today announced record earnings for the company's second fiscal
quarter ended December 31, 1993.

Net income for the second quarter of fiscal 1994 was $134.8 million, or
$1.05 per share, a 110% increase in net income from $64.3 million, or 52 cents
per share for the comparable quarter last year. Net income for the first six
months of fiscal 1994 was $239.1 million, or $1.86 per share, an 88% increase in
net income from $127.3 million, or $1.07 per share for the comparable period a
year ago.

Revenues, net of interest expense, for the quarter ended December 31, 1993
were $752.1 million, a 65% increase from $454.7 million for the comparable
quarter last year. For the six months ended December 31, 1993, revenues, net of
interest expense, were $1.3 billion, a 50% increase from $894.4 million a year
ago.

Chief Executive Officer and President, James E. Cayne, stated "Our pre-tax
return on equity has averaged 50% for the last two calendar years and for the
first six months of fiscal 1994 was 62% on an annualized basis. The record
results reflect the efforts of all of our associates who have worked hard to
achieve this level of performance."

The company said that the results for the current quarter reflect increased
revenues in most of its major business areas. Investment banking revenues rose
180% due to the high level of debt and equity underwriting activity and to
increased merger and acquisition business during the quarter. A 58% rise in
principal transaction revenues was attributable to favorable market conditions
and strong performances in fixed income and equity trading areas. The
Correspondent Clearing, Institutional Sales and Private Client Services
Departments all contributed to a 23% increase in commission revenues.

During the last six months of 1993, the company said it repurchased 1.4
million shares of its common stock in the open market for approximately $30
million in conjunction with the Capital Accumulation Plan and the Performance
Unit Plan, deferred compensation plans for senior managing directors.

Separately, the company announced that it has recently opened a
representative office in Beijing, the company's second office in the People's
Republic of China. Bear Stearns' presence in China is central to the firm's
overall international effort and affirms its long-term commitment to the
Asia/Pacific region.
