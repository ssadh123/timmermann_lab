FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

DELAWARE CHANCERY COURT DECISION RESULTS IN
$12 MILLION FIRST QUARTER CHARGE

EL PASO, TEXAS, March 30, 1994 -- El Paso Natural Gas Company (NYSE:EPG)
announced today that it will take a first quarter charge of approximately
$12 million after-tax, or $0.33 per share, to cover the Company's potential
exposure pursuant to a legal decision rendered late yesterday in favor of
Amoco Production Company in the Delaware Chancery Court.

The Court's decision supports Amoco's claim to lower gathering rates for
certain of its production for the period dating back to November 1988.
Additional briefs have been requested to determine the amount of refunds to
which Amoco may be entitled. Management does not expect the outcome of this
matter to have a materially adverse effect on the Company's financial
condition or future results of operations.

EPG intends to appeal.
