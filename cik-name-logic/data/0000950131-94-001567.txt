Attachment A

CHICAGO, October 17, 1994 -- First Chicago Corporation today reported third 
quarter net income of $154 million, or $1.51 per share on a fully diluted basis.
Return on common stockholders' equity was 15 percent.

In the year-ago third quarter, earnings were a record $284 million, or $2.97
per share, substantially enhanced by near-record trading profits and $1.40 per 
share from venture capital activities and other securities gains. Earnings for 
the 1994 second quarter of $169 million, or $1.67 per share, were augmented by 
$0.22 per share related to the Brazilian debt restructuring.

THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS
. The credit card business continued to be a substantial contributor to 
earnings. Total managed credit card receivables grew to $11.4 billion at 
September 30, up 18 percent from a year ago
<PAGE>

and 4 percent from June 30, when receivables were $11 billion. During the
third quarter, $1 billion of receivables were sold in a securitization
transaction, bringing the total securitized portfolio to $6.4 billion at
quarter-end.

. The provision for credit losses was $55 million, principally for credit card 
receivables, compared to $65 million a year earlier.

. Credit quality remains excellent. Nonperforming assets were $177 million at 
September 30, resulting in a nonperforming asset ratio of 0.7 percent, one of 
the lowest among major U.S. banks. The allowance as a percentage of 
nonperforming loans was 444 percent at quarter-end.

. Capital ratios continued to exceed the regulatory guidelines for "well-
capitalized" status by a wide margin. At September 30, the estimated Tier 1
risk-adjusted capital ratio was 9.2 percent, and the total risk-adjusted ratio
was approximately 14.0 percent.

. For the first nine months of 1994, net income was $516 million, or $5.17 per 
share, compared to net income of $632 million, or $6.63 per share a year 
earlier.

. Third quarter results reflect the acquisition of Lake Shore Bancorp, Inc.,
completed on July 8. This transaction was accounted for as a pooling-of-
interests; however, prior-period results were not restated. Approximately 6.2
million shares of First Chicago common stock were issued for the acquisition.
<PAGE>

. The Corporation repurchased 1.2 million shares of common stock during the
third quarter. The stock buyback program authorizes the repurchase of up to 7
million shares, and as of September 30, one-quarter of the program (1.7
million shares) had been completed.

NET INTEREST INCOME

Net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis was $341 million. Net 
interest margin was 2.49 percent for the quarter, and average earning assets 
were $54.2 billion.

Adjusted for the effects of credit card securitization and the activities 
of First Chicago Capital Markets, Inc., net interest margin was 3.85 percent. 
This compares to 3.62 percent in the year-ago quarter (excluding the impact of 
$42 million of gains on Brazilian bonds and special tax items) and 3.81 percent 
in the second quarter of 1994 (excluding $14 million of interest income from the
Brazilian debt restructuring).

NONINTEREST INCOME

Total noninterest income was $455 million for the third quarter.

Credit card fee revenues were $221 million for the quarter. When adjusted 
for the impact of securitization, these revenues climbed 15 percent from a year 
ago.

Combined trading activities generated profits of $42 million, compared to 
$37 million in the second quarter and a near-record $77 million a year ago.

<PAGE>

Equity securities gains were $20 million, including $17 million in the 
venture capital portfolio, down substantially from total gains of $228 million a
year ago. Net income attributable to the venture capital business -- revenues 
less the portfolio's cost-to-carry and other expenses -- was $3 million, or 
$0.02 per share, compared with net income of $1.26 per share in the year-ago 
quarter and a loss of $0.06 per share in the second quarter of 1994.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE

Noninterest expense was $491 million for the quarter, including the 
previously announced charge of $7 million to cover the elimination of 600 
positions in the Community Banking Group. Excluding this charge as well as 
venture capital activities, the ratio of expenses to total revenues was 61 
percent.

CREDIT QUALITY

The provision for credit losses was $55 million in the third quarter. This 
included $50 million for the consumer portfolios and $5 million for commercial 
credits. The provision was $43 million in the second quarter of 1994, reflecting
a negative $14 million commercial provision, principally due to the Brazilian 
debt restructuring.

The allowance for credit losses was $683 million at September 30, 
representing 444 percent of nonperforming loans at quarter-end. Of the total 
allowance, $520 million was related to commercial exposure and $163 million to 
the consumer portfolios.

<PAGE>

Net charge-offs in the third quarter were $38 million. Net charge-offs in the 
commercial portfolio were $3 million. Consumer net charge-offs, mainly in the 
credit card portfolio, were $35 million. The net charge-off rate for credit card
receivables, including the securitized portfolio, was 3.5 percent, compared to 
3.5 percent a year earlier and 3.8 percent in the second quarter.

OTHER DEVELOPMENTS

. First Chicago was recently designated as a financial agent by the U.S.
Treasury Department for the development and operation of the Electronic
Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). This nationwide system, to be operational
before year-end 1995, will allow the payment of various corporate and
individual federal taxes by electronic means -- including personal computers,
telephones, mainframe computers and point-of-sale terminals. This new business
will generate over $400 million of revenues over the seven-year life of the
award, based upon volume estimates by the Treasury Department, and will be
operated through an alliance with Mercantile Bank of St. Louis.
