On January 18, 1994, Bowater Incorporated (the Company) issued a press
release that announced its 1993 fourth quarter and year-end results and included
the following:
Bowater Incorporated (NYSE-BOW) today reported net income for the
fourth quarter of 1993 of $4.9 million, or $.12 per share, on sales of
$340.4 million. Included in the quarter's results were a pre-tax gain of
$48.9 million ($30.6 million, or $.84 per share, after tax) on the sale of
approximately 68,000 acres of non-strategic land holdings and a charge of
$10.0 million before tax ($6.3 million, or $.17 per share, after tax) for
costs related to companywide personnel reductions.
The net loss for the same quarter last year was $20.9 million, or $.59
per share on sales of $363.2 million.
For the twelve months of 1993, Bowater incurred a net loss of $64.5
million, or $1.84 per share, on sales of $1.35 billion. This compares to a
