SPI HOLDING REPORTS OPERATING INCOME GAIN
AND DECREASING NET LOSS FOR FISCAL 1993

DALLAS, MARCH 9, 1994 -- SPI HOLDING, INC. (AMEX: SPH B), doing business 
as SpectraVision, the nation's largest provider of pay- per-view entertainment
to the hotel industry, today reported higher operating income on a small
decline in revenues and a net loss for fiscal 1993.

The company reported revenues of $163 million for the year ended Dec. 31,
1993, vs. $169 million for the previous year. Revenues were affected by a
decline in the overall number of hotel rooms served during the period, but that
was substantially offset by improved hotel occupancy rates and increased
revenue per equipped room per day. Incentives provided to customers in the
third quarter for extending contracts for up to an additional seven years had a
continuing impact on revenues.

Operating income, excluding non-recurring items, increased to $10.9
million for 1993, compared to $9.9 million for the previous year. Operating
income reported for 1993 was $3.2 million, compared to an operating loss of
$209 million for 1992, which included the write off of the net book value of
$218.5 million of goodwill. The 1993 operating income was affected by a charge
of approximately $7 million which reflects the estimated costs due to changes
in technology and field service operations connected with the company's
strategic alliance with Electronic Data Systems (EDS). The 1993 operating
income number also includes a loss of approximately $700,000 related to the
company's outsourcing of manufacturing of its pay-per-view equipment to the
Cerplex Group.

The net loss applicable to common stockholders for 1993 was $46 million,
or $2.52 per share, on a significantly larger number of shares outstanding,
compared to

a net loss applicable to shareholders of $297.2 million, or $169.22 per share,
for 1992. The 1993 net loss included an extraordinary loss of approximately
$2.7 million due to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs as a
result of debt extinguishment, The 1992 net loss included an extraordinary gain
of $23.4 million resulting from a debt restructuring in November of that year,
and a charge of $28.5 million resulting from the adoption of FASB Statement No.
109 (Accounting for Income Taxes).

The net loss per share figure for 1993 was calculated on 18.2 million
average common shares outstanding while the 1992 net loss per share involved
only 1.7 million average common shares outstanding. The company's number of
average Class A and B common shares outstanding rose to approximately 16
million after consummation of a Reorganization Plan in November, 1992. In
October, 1993, the company completed a stock offering of an additional 7.6
million Class B common shares as part of a recapitalization program.

Fourth quarter revenues for 1993 were $38.7 million compared to $41.3
million in the year ago quarter. Quarterly revenues were also impacted by a
decline in number of hotel rooms served, offset by increased hotel occupancy
and improved revenues, per room, per day, attributed to strong movie products.
The earlier stated impact of customer incentives granted for contract renewals
in the third quarter had a continuing effect on fourth quarter revenues.

The operating loss for the fourth quarter 1993 was reported as $1.4
million, compared to operating income of $3.7 million for the same period a
year ago. The operating loss for the quarter was also affected by the earlier
stated loss of $700,000 associated with the company's outsourcing of
manufacturing to the Cerplex Group.

Net loss for the fourth quarter was $16.3 million, or 69 cents per share,
compared to a net income of $12.7 million, or $1.95 per share, in the year ago
quarter. The 1993 quarter includes the affects of the earlier stated $2.7
million extraordinary loss due to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance
costs. The 1992 quarter includes a $23.4 million extraordinary gain resulting
from the restructuring of company debt in November of that year,

The average common shares outstanding during the fourth quarter of 1993
was 23.6 million, while the average common shares outstanding for the year ago
quarter was only 6.5 million.

According to Al Jerome, president and chief executive officer, "The
Company continues on its course of using strong strategic alliances to operate
more efficiently and effectively, to address the marketplace more aggressively,
and to build growth into our business. In 1993, we announced a strategic
alliance with EDS which enables SpectraVision to be the first and only company
to deliver the information

superhighway to the lodging industry. Then, at year end we outsourced our
manufacturing operation to The Cerplex Group which streamlined the Company,
allowed us to avoid substantial capital expenditures necessary to upgrade the
manufacturing facility and now, our business promises to be more productive.
These, combined with other alliances, US West, Travelhost, Strategic Telecom
and Cable Healthcare Company provide us with the breadth and resources of a
much larger company and enable us to offer more services to our customers and
expand into other markets."

The company also announced that its annual meeting will be held on May 25,
1994. Complete details will be contained in the company's April, 1994, proxy
materials.

SpectraVision continues to be the largest supplier of in-room,
pay-per-view entertainment and information services to the worldwide lodging
industry since its incorporation in 1971 with a customer base of nearly 700,000
guest rooms. SpectraVision's video-on-demand product, Guest Choice(R), made
its debut in 1990 and also maintains the dominant presence with installations
exceeding 180,000 rooms. Through its STARPATH(TM) technology, it is the only
company in the lodging industry delivering compressed digital video via the
information superhighway to the SpectraVision served sites in North America.
SpectraVision markets its products and services in the U.S., Canada, Mexico,
the Caribbean, Australia and the Pacific Rim.
