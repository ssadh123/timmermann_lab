ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

PECO Energy reported today that approximately 2,500 of its 9,300 employees
have elected to take advantage of the Company's voluntary
retirement/separation programs.

The precise number of employees accepting the programs and the resultant
charge against 1994 Company earnings for the cost of the programs and ongoing
savings from reduced employee levels will be announced next week after the
expiration of the seven day period that some employees still have to revoke
their decisions.

The Company also reported that due to the extent of acceptance by its
employees, it may be necessary to hire some replacements in some areas of the
Company's operations.

The Company announced both programs in April as part of PECO Energy's
continuing cost reduction efforts.

Employees were able to make decisions for the voluntary retirement/separation
programs between July 5 and September 16, 1994.<PAGE>
