Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.

On October 6, 1994, the Registrant dismissed Ernst & Young
as Registrant's principal accountant to audit Registrant's
financial statements, and effective the same date engaged
KPMG Peat Marwick in place of Ernst & Young. Both the dismissal
of Ernst & Young and the engagement of KPMG Peat Marwick were
approved by the Registrant's board of directors. The Registrant
believes that there were disagreements revolving around issues
relating to the accounting for the repurchase of its common stock
and the manner in which such issues were dealt with. Such issues
were resolved to the satisfaction of Ernst & Young. Ernst &
Young's report on the Registrant's consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 1993 (the only fiscal
year for which Ernst & Young served as the Registrant's principal
accountants) did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer
of opinion, or modification or qualification as to uncertainty,
audit scope or accounting principles.<PAGE>
