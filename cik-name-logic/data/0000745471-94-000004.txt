Percentage Rent (after deducting therefrom Seller's share of the cost of
collection thereof, if any) if, as and when received by Buyer. 

In the event Seller has collected from any tenant under

(i) all Pass-Throughs collected by Seller on an estimated basis shall be
appropriately adjusted with the appropriate tenant or tenants at the end of
the applicable period as provided in any applicable tenant lease; and
(ii) proration of all Pass-Throughs collected by Seller on an estimated

reprorated at the end of the applicable period or periods under the terms

<PAGE>

of each applicable lease. If any Pass-Throughs collected by Buyer after
the Closing Date include any Pass-Throughs for any period prior to the
Closing Date, Buyer shall turn over to Seller its pro rata share of such

provides written notice thereof to Seller no later than the Termination
Date, the Initial Deposit paid by Buyer under the terms hereof, together
with all interest earned thereon, shall be returned to Buyer and thereupon
all rights and liabilities arising hereunder shall terminate.

During the Due Diligence Period the Initial Deposit received

refundable to Buyer if Buyer (i) determines in its sole discretion not to
purchase the Property, and (ii) notifies Seller in writing no later than
the Termination Date that Buyer has determined not to purchase the
Property; however, if (1) Buyer determines within the Due Diligence Period
that the Feasibility Study for the Property is satisfactory to Buyer, or
(2) Buyer is deemed to have found said Feasibility Study satisfactory as
provided by the terms and provisions of this Contract, the Initial Deposit
and all interest earned thereon shall be (a) non-refundable except as
herein provided, and provided the Seller is not in default under any of the
terms and provisions of this Contract, and (b) Buyer shall deposit the
Additional Deposit with Escrow Agent on or before the Termination Date, and
(c) the Deposit shall be credited on the Purchase Price for the Property at
closing.

condition in which it was found before the Inspections, Examinations and
Review were conducted; (f) not permit any liens to attach to the Property
by reason of Buyer's exercise of its rights under this Paragraph "19"; (g)
comply with all federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances,
and with prudent practices; and (h) not disclose the results of the
Inspections, the Examinations or the Review to any party other than Buyer's
Representatives or Buyer's attorneys, or to Seller or Seller's attorneys,
except to the extent required by subpoena or other legal process. Seller

present during the Inspections, the Examinations and the Review of the
Property. Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold Seller and the Property free
and harmless of and from any claim, liability and expenses either involving

Period, provided (i) Buyer has not terminated this Contract under the terms
of Paragraph "19" hereof, and (ii) Buyer has deposited with Escrow Agent
the Additional Deposit as provided in Paragraph "1" hereof, Seller shall
not enter into a lease with any tenant for rental space in the Improvements
on the Real Property without Buyer's prior approval of any such lease,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided,
however, if the terms and provisions of any such lease comply with the
terms and provisions of Paragraph "23" hereof, such lease shall be deemed
approved by Buyer.

21. Conditions to Closing. If, as of the date of closing
(i) any tenant or tenants occupying more than ten thousand (10,000) square
feet of leasable area in the aggregate are in material default or vacate
the premises or cancel their leases, or (ii) any other material adverse
change in the Property occurs, Buyer may, by written notice to Seller no
later than the date of closing, terminate this Contract; and upon such
termination the Deposit shall be returned to Buyer and thereupon all rights
and liabilities arising hereunder shall terminate.

22. Consent and Approval of Equitable. Reference is made to the
Mortgage Loan evidenced and secured by the Loan Documents owned and held by
Equitable as set forth in Subparagraph "2(A)" hereof. Seller and Buyer
acknowledge and agree that:

(a) the Mortgage Loan (i) matured under the terms of the
Loan Documents, and (ii) is not in good standing;

(b) the Mortgage Loan has not been reinstated, and Seller
has and shall have no obligation to take any action to reinstate
the Mortgage Loan; and

(c) Buyer desires to (i) purchase the Property subject to
the Mortgage Loan, and (ii) assume the Mortgage Loan as provided
in Paragraph "2" hereof.

Therefore, this Contract is specifically conditioned upon
Buyer obtaining from Equitable and furnishing to Seller no later than
thirty (30) days after the Due Diligence Period as provided in Paragraph
"19" hereof the written commitment of Equitable acceptable to and accepted
by Buyer, containing terms and provisions wherein and whereby (i) the
Mortgage Loan shall be reinstated, (ii) the Loan Documents shall be
modified to change the terms and provisions thereof to permit Buyer to
assume the Mortgage Loan and to change the terms and provisions thereof in
a manner satisfactory to Buyer in its sole and absolute discretion (herein
"Equitable's Consent and Approval"). Buyer shall pay all charges incident
to the reinstatement and assumption of the Mortgage Loan and the
modification of the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, any and
all service fees and other fees payable to Equitable, and any and all costs
in connection with the closing thereof.

<PAGE>

In the event Buyer is unable to obtain and furnish to Seller
Equitable's said Consent and Approval satisfactory to Buyer in its sole and
absolute discretion within thirty (30) days after the Due Diligence Period,
Buyer or Seller may terminate this Contract by written notice to the other;
and upon such termination the Initial Deposit paid by Buyer shall be
returned to Buyer and thereupon all rights and liabilities arising
hereunder shall terminate.

Further, in the event (i) Buyer obtains and furnishes to
Seller the Consent and Approval of Equitable as herein provided, (ii) Buyer
pays to Escrow Agent the Additional Deposit as provided in this Contract,
and (iii) Equitable fails or refuses to close the Mortgage Loan
Modification and Assumption contemporaneously with the closing of the sale
and purchase of the Property under the terms of this Contract, Seller or
Buyer may by written notice to the other terminate this Contract, and upon
such termination the Deposit paid by Buyer under the terms hereof shall be
returned to Buyer and thereupon all rights and liabilities arising
hereunder shall terminate.

23. Leasing Earnout. Seller has advised Buyer and Buyer
acknowledges that Seller is currently negotiating the terms and provisions

Tenants") as will be shown on the Rent Roll to be furnished to Buyer by
Seller under the terms of Subparagraph "15(a)" hereof.

of the Property by Buyer under the terms of this Contract prior

be seventy-five percent (75%) of the valuation increase for the
first increment, then fifty percent (50%) and twenty-five percent
(25%) respectively for the second and third increments; and the

<PAGE>

valuation shall be based on a thirteen percent (13%)
capitalization rate computed only on the Base Rent ["Base Rent"
is defined as the average rent payable by Fawcett under all
leases based on the average rent payable on each lease for the
first five (5) years of the term of each lease], provided the New
Leases are for a minimum lease term of five (5) years.

D. Any New Lease must be a true triple-net lease providing
a net rental income to the Buyer of not less than Six Dollars
($6.00) per square foot. The total cumulative amount of all
tenant allowances for all New Leases shall not exceed the sum of
Two Hundred Thousand Dollars ($200,000.00); and each New Lease
shall be in form and content acceptable to Buyer in its
reasonable discretion.

E. Any Leasing Earnout payable to Seller under the terms
hereof shall be reduced by (i) the loss of income due to the
relocation of any Existing Tenant, (ii) the amount of Buyer's
actual cost associated with tenant improvements and other
relocation expenses after closing, (iii) the amount of the actual

Lease, and (iv) leasing commissions [Seller shall be responsible

F. Any Leasing Earnout payable to Seller by Buyer under
the terms hereof shall be due and payable upon the acceptance of
and the execution of any such New Lease by Fawcett, provided,
however, any Leasing Earnout due and payable to Seller under the
terms hereof prior to closing shall be paid by Buyer to Seller at
closing.

G. Any New Lease shall not violate any exclusive use
clause existing in any one of the Existing Leases.

H. All New Leases must be executed no later than
December 31, 1995.

I. All of the terms and provisions of this Paragraph "23"
shall survive the closing of the sale and purchase of the
Property under the terms of this Contract.
