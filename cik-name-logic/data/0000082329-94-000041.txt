April 21, 1994, Houston, Texas ........ Reading & Bates

Corporation (RB-NYSE) reported a net loss of $1.5 million ($.05

per share after preferred stock dividends of $1.2 million) for

the quarter ended March 31, 1994 compared to a net loss of $2.2

million ($.04 per share) for the quarter ended March 31, 1993.

Operating income was $2.4 million on revenues of $42.4 million

for the first quarter of 1994 compared to operating income of $.6

million on revenues of $35.9 million for the first quarter of

1993. The increase in operating income was primarily due to

higher utilization of the semisubmersible fleet, 66% in the first

quarter of 1994 compared to 54% in the first quarter of 1993.

Overall fleet utilization was 77% in the first quarter of 1994

compared to 71% in the first quarter of 1993.

The Company's Chairman, President and Chief Executive

Officer, Paul B. Loyd, Jr. characterized the current environment

for the company's services as somewhat mixed, with strength in

some of the markets that the company participates in, such as the

overall tender market and the far east semisubmersible market,

and weakness in others, such as the jackup market in West Africa.

However, Mr. Loyd indicated that he believes the long term

outlook for the company remains favorable and that the company's

quality fleet along with its reputation for safety and quality

operations leaves it poised to benefit substantially when the

drilling market comes into better overall balance. Mr. Loyd also

emphasized that the company is currently working on several new

business projects related to floating production that have the

potential to improve our longer term financial results,

independent of the company's drilling fleet's results. 

Reading & Bates is a New York Stock Exchange listed company,

engaging in offshore drilling throughout the world. Its wholly 

owned subsidiary, Reading & Bates Development Co., provides

technical, construction and project management services to the

upstream offshore oil and gas industry worldwide.
