establish and provide for the issuance by the Company of Series B Notes pursuant
to the Indenture in the aggregate principal amount of $22,615,000 in exchange

WHEREAS, Section 8.01 of the Indenture provides that a supplemental

of any holder of any Note provided certain conditions are met; and

WHEREAS, the conditions set forth in the Indenture for the execution

covenants herein, the Company agrees with the Trustee that the Indenture is
supplemented and amended, solely to the extent and for the purposes expressed
herein, as follows:

Section 1. Private Exchange Offer; Scope. In the event that the
----------------------------- 
Company delivers to the Trustee a copy of an Officer's Certificate certifying
that the Company has privately offered Series B Notes to holders of Series A
Notes ("Private Holders") in accordance with an exchange offer by the Company
(the "Private Exchange Offer"), the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver

Notes as provided in Section 2.15 of the Indenture ("Private Series B Notes").

the Securities Act (a "Series B Registration Statement"); (ii) the issuance by
the SEC or any state securities authority of any stop order suspending the
effectiveness of a Series B Registration Statement or the initiation of any
proceedings for that purpose; (iii) the happening of any event during the period
that a Series B Registration Statement is effective which makes any statement in
such Series B Registration Statement (or the prospectus included therein) untrue
in any material respect or which requires the making of any changes in such
Series B Registration Statement (or such prospectus) so that, as of such date,
the statements therein are not misleading and do not omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading; and (iv) that all Private Series B Notes have been sold pursuant

Series B Registration Statement. Any Private Series B Note as to which such
restrictions shall have terminated or expired or any Private Series B Note
freely tradeable pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act may, upon
surrender of such Private Series B Note for exchange to the Trustee, be
exchanged for a new Series B Note of like tenor and aggregate principal amount
which shall not bear the Series B Private Placement Legend; provided, however,
that no transfer of a Series B Note pursuant to a Series B Registration
Statement shall be permitted if such transfer pursuant to a Series B
Registration Statement is attempted to be made at any time after the Company has
notified the Trustee of the occurrence of an event described in Section 2(a)(ii)
or (iii), unless the Company has subsequently notified the Trustee of the
occurrence of an event described in Section 2(a)(i) or (iv). In the event of an
exchange pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver a Series B Note of like tenor and aggregate principal
amount as the Private Series B Note exchanged therefor, which Series B Note
shall not be a Private Series B Note.
