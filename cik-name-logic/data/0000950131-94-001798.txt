ATTACHMENT A

CHICAGO, November 17, 1994 -- First Chicago Corporation said today it
has incurred a loss of $7.2 million resulting from its purchase of $158
million of notes from one mutual fund and one cash portfolio for which The
First National Bank of Chicago serves as investment advisor, and commingled
trust funds for which the Bank serves as trustee. Approximately half of this
loss was recorded in the third quarter.

As a result of these purchases, no losses were suffered by the commingled
trust funds, the mutual fund or the cash portfolio.

In October, First Chicago initiated and completed a review of structured
note holdings in all funds and portfolios. The notes were purchased from the
First Prairie Money Market Fund, Government Series, and one cash portfolio,
both of which The First National Bank of Chicago serves as investment advisor,
and three commingled trust funds for which The First National Bank of Chicago
is trustee. Originally, $60 million of the structured notes had been owned by
two First Prairie money market funds prior to their transfer to the commingled
trust funds.

First Chicago said it initiated discussions with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the
Federal Reserve Board concerning the circumstances surrounding these events.
The Securities and Exchange Commission has initiated an informal inquiry
regarding the First Prairie Mutual Funds, and First Chicago Corporation is
cooperating fully.

The Corporation has also introduced a series of corrective measures,
including the termination of a portfolio manager.
