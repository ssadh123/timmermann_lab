Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits

Propelled by record growth in the number of cellular customers and
customer access lines, Ameritech Corporation (Ameritech) revenues rose
5.9 percent in the third quarter, growing to $3.12 billion from $2.95
billion in the third quarter a year ago.

Before one-time events in both years, income rose 15.4 percent to
$419.1 million in the third quarter of 1994, compared with $363.3
million in the third quarter of 1993. Based on these results, earnings
per share increased 13.4 percent to 76 cents per share in the third
quarter of 1994, up from 67 cents per share in the third quarter of
1993.

Growth in the third quarter was fueled by these developments:

o Ameritech gained a record 385,000 new cellular customers over the
past 12 months, up 51 percent from a year ago, to almost 1,140,000
customers.

o The company added 638,000 customer access lines in the past 12
months, expanding its total lines by a record 3.7 percent to more
than 18 million. Business lines grew 6.5 percent, while residence
lines were up 2.3 percent.

o Network access minutes of use grew 8.0 percent, compared with the
third quarter of 1993.

Reported net income for the third quarter of 1994 was $250.9
million, compared with $425.0 million a year ago. Reported earnings per
share were 46 cents, compared with 78 cents a year ago. Comparisons
between the two quarters are affected by one-time events in both years.

In the third quarter of 1994, Ameritech recorded an additional
after-tax charge of $168.2 million or 30 cents a share for a workforce
restructuring. When the restructuring plan was announced in March,
Ameritech had estimated that 6,000 employees would leave under the
plan. Now the company expects 10,000 employees to accept the plan, and
the third-quarter charge adjusts for the additional 4,000 employees.

In the third quarter of 1993, Ameritech recorded a one-time gain
of $61.7 million, or 11 cents a share, from the sale of shares of
Telecom Corporation of New Zealand.

For the first nine months of 1994, Ameritech revenues rose 6.5
percent to $9.26 billion, up from $8.69 billion in the first nine
months of 1993. Excluding one-time events, income for the first nine
months of 1994 rose 14.0 to $1.24 billion from $1.09 billion a year
ago. One-time events excluded in this calculation of income were the
1994 after-tax charges of $501.0 million for workforce restructuring; a
1993 charge of $37.3 million for restructuring at Telecom Corporation
of New Zealand; and the 1993 after-tax gain of $61.7 million from the
sale of shares of Telecom Corporation of New Zealand. Reported net

income was $741.3 million in the first nine months of 1994, compared
with $1,114.6 million in the first nine months of 1993.

Before one-time events, earnings per share for the first nine
months of 1994 grew 12.4 percent to $2.26 from $2.01 in the first nine
months of 1993. Including one-time events, reported earnings per share
were $1.35 in the first nine months of 1994, compared with $2.05 in the
first nine months of 1993.
