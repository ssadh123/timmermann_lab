Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On August 3, 1994, Grow Group, Inc. (the "Company"),
through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sinclair Acquisition Corp.
(the "Buyer"), completed the acquisition of substantially all of
the assets of Sinclair Paint Company ("Sinclair"), a division of
Insilco Corporation ("Insilco"). The acquisition was effectuated
pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the "Asset Purchase
Agreement"), dated May 7, 1994 (a copy of which was attached as
Exhibit 10.1 to the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K, date of
earliest event reported: May 7, 1994), as amended by a First
Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of August 1, 1994
(a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1(b)). The
discussion of the Asset Purchase Agreement contained herein is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the Asset Purchase
Agreement, as amended.

Sinclair is engaged in the manufacture and sale of
architectural paints through 49 company-operated stores in four
Western states. Sinclair generated over $95 million in revenue
in calendar 1993. The Sinclair operation will augment the
Company's other architectural paint operations.

The purchase price, which was negotiated between the
parties, was $51 million (subject to post-closing adjustments). 
In addition, the Buyer assumed certain obligations of Sinclair. 
The purchase price was paid in full at the closing and was funded
through a combination of cash and borrowings.

To the best of the Company's knowledge, there were no
material relationships between Insilco and its affiliates and the
Company or any of the Company's affiliates, directors or officers
or any associate of any director or officer of the Company.

Item 5. Other Events.

In connection with the acquisition of the Sinclair
assets, the amount of the Company's credit facilities with
Chemical Bank New Jersey, N.A., Fleet Bank and PNC Bank,
Kentucky, Inc., (collectively, the "Banks") was increased from
$40 million to $60 million. The Credit Agreement (the "Credit
Agreement"), dated as of March 31, 1993, as amended on August 6,
1993, by and among the Company, Grow Group Insurance, Ltd., the
Banks and Chemical Bank, was further amended on August 3, 1994
to, among other things, waive certain provisions of the Credit
Agreement to the extent they would restrict the Buyer's
performance under the Asset Purchase Agreement and amend the
defined levels of leverage and capital expenditures.

<PAGE>

The Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement
are secured by the accounts receivable of the Company and Cello
Corp., Sinclair Acquisition Corp. and Zynolyte Products Company,
wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company. Such subsidiaries also
guaranteed the Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement.

Item 7. Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Information
and Exhibits 

(a) Financial statements of business acquired:

The financial statements of Sinclair included herein
are prepared on a historical basis and include breakdowns between
a predecessor company and the current entity and "Fresh Start"
accounting adjustments due to the bankruptcy proceedings
described in Note (2) to the Sinclair financial statements. As a
result of these and other factors, the Sinclair financial
statements are not comparable nor are these financial statements
necessarily indicative of future results of operations or
financial position. The Company's acquisition decision was
affected by extensive reviews and examinations of detailed
financial and other information, both current and forecasted. 

The following financial statements of Sinclair are
presented herein:

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors
Insilco Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and
liabilities of Sinclair Paint Company (a division of Insilco
Corporation) as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the related
statements of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended
December 31, 1993 (successor period), three months ended March
31, 1993 and year ended December 31, 1992 (predecessor periods). 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of Sinclair Paint Company as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 and
the results of its operations and its cash flows the nine-month
period ended December 31, 1993, the three-month period ended
March 31, 1993 and the year ended December 31, 1992 in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in notes 2 and 4 to the financial statements,
effective March 31, 1993, the Company emerged from bankruptcy and
applied fresh start accounting. As a result, the statement of
assets and liabilities at December 31, 1993 and the related
statements of operations and cash flows for the nine-month period
ended December 31, 1993 are presented on a different basis than
that for the periods before fresh start and, therefore, are not
comparable.

SINCLAIR PAINT COMPANY
(A Division of Insilco Corporation)
Notes to Financial Statements
December 31, 1993 and 1992

(1) Nature of Business

The Sinclair Paint Company (the Company) is a division of
Insilco Corporation (Parent) which manufactures paints and
sells a variety of paints and related products (ladders,
tape, spray equipment, and the like) through approximately
50 retail stores in California, Hawaii and Arizona.

The financial statements of Sinclair Paint have been
prepared from the historical books and records of the
Company and Parent, except that certain reserves established
and maintained at the Parent level have been excluded from
the financial statements. The Company has applied the
principles of fresh start accounting as a result of the
reorganization described in notes 2 and 4.

The divisional balances in the statements of assets and
liabilities represent the Parent's investment and advances
to the Company on a historical-cost basis adjusted for
equity in operations and intercompany transactions. 
Expenses allocated to the Company not settled with the
Parent become a permanent component of the divisional
investment. The Parent believes that such expense
allocations are reasonable and proper. Cash generated by
the Company is transferred to the Parent on a daily basis
for cash management purposes. The cumulative amount of cash
transferred since the Company's acquisition represents a
reduction to the divisional investment account balance.

(2) Plan of Reorganization 

On April 1, 1993, the Parent and certain of its subsidiaries
(collectively with the Parent, the Debtors) emerged from
Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the Chapter
11 cases) pursuant to a plan of reorganization (the Plan of
Reorganization) which was confirmed by the United States
Bankruptcy Court (the Bankruptcy Court). For financial
reporting purposes, the effective date of the Plan of
Reorganization was March 31, 1993 (the Plan Effective Date). 
For periods prior to the Plan Effective Date, the Company is
sometimes referred to herein as the Predecessor. The
Chapter 11 cases were commenced on January 13, 1991 (the
Petition Date) when the Debtors filed separate voluntary
petitions for reorganization.

(3) Asset Purchase Agreement

On May 7, 1994, Insilco entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement (Agreement) with Grow Group Inc. (Grow). Under
the terms of the Agreement, Grow will acquire the majority
of the Company's assets and assume certain liabilities, as
defined in the Agreement.

(4) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis for Presentation - Fresh Start Accounting
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with the Statement of Position 90-7, "Financial
Reporting by Entities in Reorganization under the Bankruptcy
Code" (the Reorganization SOP), issued by the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants. As of the Plan
Effective Date, the Company adopted the "fresh start"
accounting principles prescribed by the Reorganization SOP.

As a result of the application of the Reorganization SOP,
including the application of fresh start accounting as of
March 31, 1993, financial information for periods subsequent
to the Plan Effective Date is not comparable with financial
information for prior periods.

The following summarizes the Reorganization SOP's
significant fresh start accounting principles and the
significant assumptions utilized in the application thereof.

Valuation of Assets and Liabilities

Using a valuation of the Company performed by the Parent's
financial advisor as well as fair values of the Company's
identifiable intangible assets, inventories and fixed and
other tangible assets based on management's estimates, the
Parent determined the total reorganization value of all of
its assets to be approximately $40 million as of the Plan
Effective Date, or approximately $18 million less than the
historical carrying value of its tangible assets.

10
<PAGE>

SINCLAIR PAINT COMPANY
(A Division of Insilco Corporation)

Notes to Financial Statements, Continued

In preparing the valuation of the Company, the Parent's
financial advisor conducted extensive due diligence and
updated its due diligence examinations as it deemed
appropriate. The activities included, but were not
restricted to the following: (i) a review and analysis of
the historical financial and operating performance of the
Predecessor based on data and reports provided by the 
Company, (ii) extensive discussions concerning the business,
operations, assets, present condition and future prospects
of the Company conducted with the Parent's senior management
and with selected operating management as deemed necessary,
(iii) a comparison of the Company's financial and operating
information with similar data available from public sources
for selected comparable companies and (iv) a review and
analysis of the Company's projected operating performance
based on business plans, which are revised periodically to
reflect actual and anticipated results of economic
developments.

SINCLAIR PAINT COMPANY
(A Division of Insilco Corporation)
Notes to Financial Statements, Continued

As a result of the valuation of assets described above, the
Company adjusted assets by approximately $18 million to the
estimated reorganization value in the three months ended
March 31, 1993. The effect of the Plan of Reorganization
and fresh start accounting principles on the Company's March
31, 1993 statement of assets and liabilities follows:

Accrued Expenses

Accrued expenses consisted of the following as of December 31,
1993 and 1992 (in thousands): 
Predecessor
1993 1992 
Salaries, wages and related expenses $ 2,668 2,425
Other 441 1,388 
$ 3,109 3,813 
Income Taxes

The Company has been included in the Parent's consolidated
Federal income tax return for the periods ended December 31,
1993, March 31, 1993 and the year ended December 31, 1992. The
Company was not party to any formal tax sharing agreement, and
accordingly, no provision or benefit for income taxes has been
reflected in the accompanying statements of income. In addition,
no deferred income taxes have been reflected for temporary
differences in the recognition of revenues and expenses for tax
and financial reporting purposes.

(5) Transactions with Parent

The Parent provides various treasury functions for the
Company and maintains a cash management system under which
excess cash generated by the Company is transferred to the
Parent and working capital requirements of the company are
paid by the Parent. Incident to this system, the Parent
pays for certain expenses, such as insurance, payroll taxes,
and 401(k) contributions specifically related to the
Company. The Parent also provides certain services to the
group such as operations management, treasury, insurance and
benefits management, legal, accounting and tax, among
others. Costs charged to the Company for these services are
allocated based on management's estimates of the Company's
proportionate share of the total group's expenses. 
Management believes that these expenses are reasonably
allocated. Expenses allocated to the Company by the Parent
for these services totaled approximately $1 million, $300
thousand and $1.3 million for the periods ended December 31,
1993, March 31, 1993 and the year ended December 31, 1992,
respectively. The Company is also allocated pension costs
by the Parent. See note 7 for a discussion of the Company's
retirement plans.

15
<PAGE>

SINCLAIR PAINT COMPANY
(A Division of Insilco Corporation)

Notes to Financial Statements, Continued

If net expenses charged to the Company for services provided
by the Parent are not settled with the Parent, they become a
permanent component of the divisional investment reflected
in the accompanying balance sheets. To the extent that
expenses paid by the Parent for the Company have not been
settled by the Parent at December 31, 1993, March 31, 1993
or December 31, 1992, respectively, the corresponding
liability allocated to the Company is included on the
statements of assets and liabilities within divisional
investment.

(6) Lease Commitments

The Company leases certain property, plant and equipment
under various leasing arrangements, most of which provide
that the Company pay taxes, maintenance, insurance and
certain other operating expenses associated with the asset. 
These leases are being accounted for as operating leases. 
Minimum future rental payments under all operating leases
are as follows (in thousands):

1994 $ 4,652
1995 3,802
1996 2,989
1997 2,367
1998 2,181
Thereafter 10,050 

Total minimum lease payments $26,041 

Rental expense for the periods ended December 31, 1993, March 31,
1993 and the year ended December 31, 1992 was approximately $2.3
million, $.8 million and $2.8 million, respectively.

(7) Pension Plans

Substantially all employees of the Company were covered
under various pension plans of the Parent during 1993 and
1992. The benefits under these plans are based primarily on
years of service and employees' compensation near
retirement. Plan assets consist principally of equity
investments, government obligations and noncallable
corporate debt securities. The Parent also contributes to
various multiemployer plans sponsored by bargaining units
for its union employees. The various plans' assets and
obligations remain with the Parent company after the closing
date of the agreement described in note 3.

16
<PAGE>

SINCLAIR PAINT COMPANY
(A Division of Insilco Corporation)

Notes to Financial Statements, Continued

The Parent allocated pension expense to the Company based on
its estimated share of the Parent's pension expense. 
Pension expense allocated to the Company was $318, $91 and
$78 for the periods ended December 31, 1993, March 31, 1993
and the year ended December 31, 1992, respectively.

(8) Contingencies

There are various lawsuits and claims pending against the
Parent relative to the division, including those related to
commercial transactions and environmental matters. Such
matters have not been reserved for at the division level but
are instead reflected on the Parent's financial statements
as the related contingent liabilities, if any, will remain
with the Parent company subsequent to the closing of the
Asset Purchase Agreement described in note 3.

FIRST AMENDMENT TO ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This First Amendment to Asset Purchase Agreement (this "First
Amendment") is entered into as of the 1st day of August, 1994,

WITNESSETH:

A. Insilco Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Seller"), and Grow
Group, Inc., a New York corporation ("Grow") entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement, dated as of May 7, 1994 (the "Asset Purchase Agreement"), for the
sale of substantially all of the assets of Seller's operating division known as
the Sinclair Paint Company (the "Division").

B. The Transferred Assets include the leases described on Exhibit A
(the "Leases"), in each of which Seller is the lessee and a third party is the
lessor. Pursuant to certain Assignment and Assumption and Lessor's Consents,
Seller has assigned the Leases to Purchaser.

C. Purchaser and Seller wish to amend the Asset Purchase Agreement.

D. Initial capitalized terms used but not defined herein are used as
defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the recitals and of the respective
agreements herein contained as well as other good and valuable consideration,
the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto covenant and
agree as follows:

1. Seller hereby agrees to indemnify and defend Purchaser against,
and to hold Purchaser harmless from, as an Offsite Environmental Loss pursuant
to Section 9.02(C)(i) of the Asset Purchase Agreement, any and all Losses
incurred by the Purchaser that (A) arise under or are based on an Environmental
Law and (B) result from the operation, use or closure prior to the Closing Date
by the Division (or the Seller on behalf of the Division) or the Predecessor of
underground storage tanks identified in the site assessment of the Division's
retail stores (Volume 1), dated July 1994, Summary of Recommendations, on the
premises covered by the Leases ("Premises") (but not including any Loss arising
under or based on requirements of Environmental Laws promulgated, enacted or
amended after the Closing Date to the extent such requirements impose greater
obligations (financial or otherwise) than those in effect as of the Closing
Date); provided, further, that if Purchaser purchases any such Premises or if an
investigation of the Premises is made in connection with an offer by Purchaser
or contract to purchase such Premises, or in reasonable contemplation thereof,
any Loss for which Seller is obligated to indemnify Purchaser pursuant to this
Paragraph 1 of this First Amendment will be treated as an Environmental Loss
pursuant to Section 9.02(B) of the Asset Purchase Agreement. Any claim by
Purchaser for reimbursement or indemnification under this First Amendment shall
be made pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.04 of the Asset Purchase
Agreement.

2. Purchaser shall pay and shall be solely liable for any costs of
any voluntary environmental assessment or investigation undertaken by Purchaser,
after the Closing Date, with respect to the environmental condition of the
<PAGE>

Premises, but not for any other Losses, which Losses are covered by Paragraph 1
of this First Amendment.

3. The parties agree to amend the second to the last sentence of
Section 14.02(B) of the Asset Purchase Agreement to read as follows: "As used
herein, "Fair Market Value" means the value of a Store as determined in its more
recent appraisal by the Appraiser, which appraisal shall be based on the
assumption that the Store is currently fully leased at market rent."

4. Except to the extent as amended herein, the Asset Purchase
Agreement remains in full force and effect.

5. This First Amendment will be governed by the laws of the State of
California.

6. This First Amendment may be signed in any number of counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same instrument.

7. All notices and other communications hereunder will be in writing
and will be deemed given when delivered personally or when received if sent by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or telecopy to the
parties at the following addresses (or at such other address as a party may

This Waiver, Consent and Amendment No. 2 ("Amendment No. 2") dated August

, 1994 to the Credit Agreement dated as of March 1, 1993, as amended by

Amendment No. 1 thereto dated August 6, 1993, is made by and among GROW GROUP,

INC., a New York corporation (the "Borrower"), GROW GROUP INSURANCE, LTD., a

Bermuda corporation ("Grow Insurance"), CELLO CORP., a Maryland corporation

("Cello"), SINCLAIR ACQUISITION CORP., a California corporation (f/k/a AMERITONE

CORPORATION) ("Ameritone"), ZYNOLYTE PRODUCTS COMPANY, a California corporation

("Zynolyte"), CHEMICAL BANK NEW JERSEY, N.A., a national banking association

("Chemical" or the "Agent"), FLEET BANK, a New York banking corporation

("Fleet"), and PNC BANK, KENTUCKY, INC., a Kentucky banking corporation ("PNC";

Chemical, Fleet and PNC sometimes herein each called a "Bank" and collectively,

the "Banks").

W I T N E S S E T H:

Section 1. Recitals.

This Amendment No. 2 is made in contemplation of the following matters:

1.1. The Borrower, Grow Insurance, the Banks and Chemical Bank, a New

York banking corporation, have entered into a certain Credit Agreement dated as

of March 1, 1993. That original agreement was amended by Amendment No. 1

thereto dated August 6, 1993 (the original agreement, as amended by said

Amendment No. 1, being herein called the "Existing Credit Agreement"). Terms

defined in the Existing Credit Agreement are used herein as therein defined

unless otherwise defined herein.
<PAGE>

1.2. The Borrower has entered into a certain Asset Purchase Agreement

(the "Sinclair Asset Purchase Agreement") with Insilco Corporation with respect

to the acquisition of certain of the assets of Sinclair Paint Company, a

division of Insilco Corporation ("Sinclair"). The Borrower has assigned its

rights and obligations under the Sinclair Asset Purchase Agreement to Ameritone,

which will effect the acquisition pursuant to a certain Assignment and

Assumption Agreement dated as of August 1, 1994. Section 9.4(b) of the Existing

Credit Agreement prohibits the Borrower or any Subsidiary from acquiring

substantially all of the assets of any Person unless such acquisition is a

Permitted Acquisition. Section 9.9 of the Existing Credit Agreement prohibits

the Borrower or any Subsidiary from making or committing to make any expenditure

for fixed assets during any fiscal year, if, after giving effect thereto, the

aggregate amount of all expenditures for fixed assets incurred by the Borrower

and Subsidiaries during such fiscal year would exceed the amounts specified. 

Section 9.10 of the Existing Credit Agreement prohibits the Borrower or any

Subsidiary from purchasing or otherwise acquiring any Person. Except to the

extent that the Banks consent in writing, the execution, delivery and

performance by the Borrower and/or Ameritone of the Sinclair Asset Purchase

Agreement may violate Sections 9.4(b), 9.9 and 9.10 of the Existing Credit

Agreement and may result in the occurrence of an Event of Default under the

Existing Credit Agreement. The Borrower has requested, and the Banks have

agreed, to waive the provisions of Sections 9.4(b), 9.9 and 9.10 of the Existing

Credit Agreement to the extent they would restrict the execution, delivery and

performance by the Borrower and/or Ameritone of the Sinclair Asset Purchase

Agreement and consent to the acquisition of Sinclair by Ameritone as more

specifically provided in Section 4 hereto.

-2-
<PAGE>

1.3. The Borrower has requested, and the Banks have agreed, to increase

the amount of the Aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments from $40 million to $60

million, the proceeds of such increase to be loaned by the Borrower to Ameritone

to acquire Sinclair and for other legal and proper corporate purposes and to

amend the Existing Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to reflect such

increase. The Banks have agreed to increase such Aggregate Revolving Credit

Commitments on the terms provided herein and on the further condition that the

Borrower execute and deliver to the Banks Amended and Restated Revolving Credit

Notes, in the aggregate amount of the increased Aggregate Revolving Credit

Commitments, in the forms of Exhibits L-1, L-2 and L-3 hereto.

1.4. Section 8.11 of the Existing Credit Agreement requires the Borrower

and its Subsidiaries on a Consolidated basis to maintain a ratio of Consolidated

Total Liabilities (except Subordinated Indebtedness) to Consolidated Tangible

Capital Funds of not less than the ratio specified therein. The failure of the

Borrower and its Subsidiaries to maintain the specified ratio of Consolidated

Total Liabilities (except Subordinated Indebtedness) to Consolidated Tangible

Funds, except to the extent waived in writing by the Banks, may result in an

Event of Default under the Existing Credit Agreement. The Borrower has

requested, and the Banks have agreed, to amend Section 8.11 of the Existing

Credit Agreement as more specifically provided in Section 2.8 hereto.

1.5. Section 9.9 of the Existing Credit Agreement prohibits the Borrower

or any Subsidiary from making or committing to make any expenditure for fixed

assets during any fiscal year if, after giving effect thereto, the aggregate

amount of all expenditures for fixed assets incurred by the Borrower and

Subsidiaries during any fiscal year would exceed the amount specified therein. 

The failure of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries to comply with Section 9.9 of

-3-
<PAGE>

the Existing Credit Agreement, except to the extent waived in writing by the

Banks, may result in an Event of Default under the Existing Credit Agreement. 

The Borrower has requested, and the Banks have agreed, to amend Section 9.9 of

the Existing Credit Agreement as more specifically provided in Section 2.9

hereto.

1.6. The Borrower and the Banks have agreed to amend Sections 2.8(b),

9.10 and 10.1(i) and (k) of the existing Credit Agreement in the manner set

forth herein. 

1.7. It is a condition precedent to the Banks' agreement to amend the

Existing Credit Agreement on the terms provided herein and to enter into this

Amendment No. 2 that Ameritone pledge to the Banks certain collateral. 

1.8. The Borrower has requested the Banks to enter into this Amendment

No. 2 and the Banks have agreed to enter into this Amendment No. 2 for the

foregoing purposes.
