ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On February 10, 1994, CRI Liquidating REIT, Inc. (the
Liquidating Company) received aggregate net proceeds of
approximately $48.7 million from the sale to unaffiliated third
parties of twelve government insured multifamily mortgages. The
sale of these government insured multifamily mortgages resulted
in an aggregate financial statement gain of approximately $11.7
million and an aggregate tax basis gain of approximately $14.7
million.

As previously discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Financial
Statements in the Liquidating Company's Annual Report filed on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993, the Liquidating
Company intends to dispose of its existing government insured
multifamily mortgages by 1997 through an orderly liquidation. In
order to achieve an orderly liquidation, the Liquidating Company
intends to dispose of approximately 25 percent of the December
31, 1993 portfolio balance during each year until 1997. The 
twelve government insured multifamily mortgages disposed of
represent approximately 20 percent of the Liquidating Company's
total portfolio as of December 31, 1993.

The Liquidating Company will distribute the net disposition
proceeds of approximately $1.60 per share to shareholders as part
of the first quarter dividend to be paid March 31, 1994, which
was declared by the Board of Directors on February 18, 1994.
