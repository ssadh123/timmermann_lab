NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Quarter ended July 1, 1994
(Unaudited; in millions)

The Company's press release on the results of operations for the second 
quarter and first six months of 1994 was released to the public on July 19, 
1994. This condensed financial information is prepared for the purpose of 
filing a summary of second-quarter and six-months 1994 financial information, 
which was included in the Company's press release on July 19, 1994, with the 
Securities and Exchange Commission.

(1) On June 30, 1993, the Company acquired from The Coca-Cola Company: 
(i) Coca-Cola Beverages Nederland B.V. in the Netherlands; (ii) Roddy 
Coca-Cola Bottling Company, Inc.; and (iii) Coca-Cola Bottling of 
Johnson City, Tennessee. The results of operations of these companies 
are included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations from
the beginning of third-quarter 1993.

(2) Per share data calculated prior to rounding to millions.

(3) Reported second-quarter and six month 1994 cash operating profit 
includes the effect of the acquisitions referred to in note (1) above. 
After appropriate adjustments to eliminate the effects of these 
acquisitions, comparable second-quarter and six-month 1994 cash 
operating profit increased approximately 7% and 5%, respectively, 
as compared to the same prior year periods.

(4) Adjusting 1993 volume for the effect of acquisitions, second-quarter 
and six-month 1994 comparable physical case bottle/can volume would 
have increased approximately 3.5% and 3%, respectively, and comparable 
fountain gallon volume would have increased approximately 3% and 4.5%, 
respectively, as compared to the same prior year periods.
