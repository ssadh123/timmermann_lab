On May 17, 1994, Registrant issued the following press release:

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA -- Caesars World, Inc. (NYSE/CAW) today 
announced net income for the fiscal 1994 third quarter was $11,648,000, or 47
cents per share, compared with $17,035,000, or 69 cents per share, in the
fiscal 1993 third quarter.
Revenue for the fiscal 1994 quarter ended April 30, 1994, was
$237,244,000, compared with $224,409,000 in the same fiscal 1993 quarter.
Caesars World's net income for the fiscal 1994 nine-month period amounted
to $61,456,000, or $2.51 per share, compared with $57,529,000, or $2.36 per
share, in the fiscal 1993 nine months. Revenue for the nine months of fiscal
1994 totaled $764,308,000, compared with $721,444,000 in the same prior-year
period.
The company said both table-game and slots activity in its Nevada
operations established records for any third quarter in Caesars World's
history. As previously announced, the lower earnings, when comparing the
fiscal third quarters, principally resulted from increased marketing expenses
related to the higher volume of business in Nevada, including a larger
provision for bad debts reflecting increased marketing costs and a world
heavyweight championship fight at Caesars Palace. The table-game win
percentages in Nevada were lower than the five-year average but about the same
as the year-earlier quarter. 
For the fiscal 1994 nine months in Nevada, the company also realized
record table-game and slots activity as well as slots win. Table-game win
percentages were about average but higher than the comparable percentages in
the year-earlier nine months.
In New Jersey, Caesars Atlantic City revenue increased during the fiscal
1994 third quarter, primarily due to slots activity and the impact from the
Simulcast Casino which opened in October 1993 and features high-tech horse race
betting, a poker section and additional casino table games. The contribution
to earnings from New Jersey declined slightly during both the fiscal 1994 third
quarter and nine months due to higher operating costs, principally reflecting
higher payroll for additional employees in the expanded casino.
During both fiscal 1994 reporting periods, when compared with the fiscal
1993 periods, Caesars World's net interest expenses decreased due to lower
outstanding debt and a debt refinancing which was substantially completed
during the fiscal 1993 first quarter.

(a) Other revenue is primarily from merchandising operations. Other expenses
include the contribution from merchandising operations and corporate
expenses.

(b) The effective income tax rate during the nine months ended April 30, 1994,
was 1.2 percentage points higher than the same period in 1993. The higher
tax rate reflects the impact of two non-recurring tax charges. In August
1993, the Federal tax rate increased, retroactive to January 1, 1993, from
34 to 35 percent. The company also changed its method for income tax
accounting by adopting FASB 109 effective August 1, 1993. The impact of
this cumulative change in accounting and the retroactive change in the
corporate tax rate aggregated a net charge of approximately $750,000 in the
first quarter of fiscal 1994.
