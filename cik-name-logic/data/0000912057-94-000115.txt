FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Tues., Jan. 18, 1994

WELLS FARGO REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS OF $190 MILLION;
FULL YEAR PER SHARE EARNINGS $10.10 VS. $4.44 A YEAR AGO.

Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) today reported net income of $190 million for
the fourth quarter of 1993, compared with $58 million for the fourth quarter
of 1992, an increase of 228%. Per share earnings for the fourth quarter of
1993 were $3.18, compared with 83 cents in the fourth quarter of 1992.
Earnings for the full year of 1993 were $612 million, or $10.10 per share,
compared with $283 million, or $4.44 per share, for 1992. Both fourth
quarter and full year 1993 results reflect smaller loan loss provisions than
were taken in comparable periods in 1992.
"Our credit quality improved over the last year and we saw new business
opportunities emerge in the latter half of 1993, especially with small and
mid-size companies," said Carl E. Reichardt, chairman. "The challenge in
'94 will be to build upon this foundation."
Return on average assets (ROA) was 1.46 percent and return on average
common equity (ROE) was 19.85 percent in the fourth quarter of 1993. In the
year-ago period, ROA was .44 percent and ROE was 5.85 percent. ROA was 1.20
percent and ROE was 16.74 percent for full year 1993, compared with .54
percent and 7.93 percent, respectively, in 1992.
Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis decreased to $666
million in the fourth quarter of 1993 from $677 million a year ago. For the
full year 1993, net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $2.659
billion, compared with $2.698 billion for the prior year.
The company's net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 1993 was
5.69 percent, down from 5.73 percent in the same quarter of 1992. The net
interest margin for the full year of 1993 was 5.74 percent, compared with
5.70 percent for 1992.
Noninterest income (NII) in the fourth quarter of 1993 was $295
million, compared with $258 million in the same quarter of 1992, an increase
of 14 percent. The increase was largely due to net gains on sales and
distributions from equity investments, primarily highly leveraged
transactions, (up $15 million) and higher service charges on deposit
accounts (up $10 million). For full year 1993, NII was $1.093 billion,
compared with $1.059 billion in 1992.
Noninterest expense (NIE) in the fourth quarter of 1993 was $557
million, compared with $527 million in the same quarter of 1992, a 6
percent increase. The increase primarily resulted from higher personnel-
related expenses (up $33 million) due to incentive bonus programs, including
the company-wide employee appreciation program announced in December 1993.
NIE totaled $2.162 billion in 1993, compared with $2.035 billion in 1992.
The provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter of 1993 was $80
million, compared

with $120 million in the third quarter of 1993 and $300 million in the
fourth quarter of 1992. For 1993, the provision totaled $550 million,
compared with $1.215 billion for 1992. Improvements in the company's loan
portfolio in 1993 resulted in a reduction of the provision.
Net charge-offs totaled $81 million, or 0.97 percent of average total
loans (annualized), for the fourth quarter of 1993. The largest category of
net charge-offs was credit card loans ($34 million).
For the fourth quarter of 1992, net charge-offs totaled $199 million,
or 2.09 percent of average total loans (annualized). The largest categories
of net charge-offs were real estate mortgage loans other than 1-4 family
($78 million), credit card loans ($41 million) and commercial loans ($38
million).
Full-year 1993 net charge-offs totaled $495 million, or 1.44 percent of
average total loans. The largest categories of net charge-offs were credit
card loans ($156 million) and real estate mortgage loans other than 1-4
family ($150 million).
For all of 1992, net charge-offs totaled $798 million, or 1.97 percent
of average total loans. The largest categories of net charge-offs were real
estate mortgage loans other than 1-4 family ($281 million), commercial loans
($179 million) and credit card loans ($168 million).
At Dec. 31, 1993, the allowance for loan losses equaled 6.41 percent of
total loans, compared with 6.32 percent at Sept. 30, 1993 and 5.60 percent
at Dec. 31, 1992.
At Dec. 31, 1993, total nonaccrual and restructured loans decreased to
$1.200 billion, or 3.6 percent of total loans, compared with $1.702 billion,
or 5.1 percent of total loans, at Sept. 30, 1993, and $2.142 billion, or 5.8
percent of total loans, at Dec. 31, 1992. Foreclosed assets were $348
million at Dec. 31, 1993, compared with $357 million at Sept. 30, 1993 and
$510 million at Dec. 31, 1992.
At Dec. 31, 1993, an estimated $704 million, or 59 percent, of
nonaccrual loans were less than 90 days past due, including an estimated
$595 million that were current as to payment of principal and interest.
This compares with an estimated $1.038 billion, or 61 percent, of nonaccrual
loans that were less than 90 days past due at Sept. 30, 1993, including an
estimated $871 million that were current.
During the fourth quarter of 1993, an estimated $34 million of cash
interest payments (including interest applied to principal) were received
from all loans that were on nonaccrual during the quarter. The average
nonaccrual book principal loan balance (net of charge-offs and interest
applied to principal) was $1.498 billion for the quarter. The estimated
average cash yield was 9.0 percent.
During the third quarter of 1993, an estimated $38 million of cash
interest payments (including interest applied to principal) was received
from all loans that were on nonaccrual during the quarter. The average
nonaccrual book principal loan balance (net of charge-offs and interest
applied to principal) was $1.809 billion for the quarter. The estimated
average cash yield was 8.3 percent.
The company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 115 (FAS 115),

Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, on
Dec. 31, 1993. FAS 115 establishes three classifications of securities,
each of which receives different accounting treatment. "Held-to-maturity
investment securities" are reported at cost. "Available-for-sale investment
securities" are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
(after applicable taxes) reported as a separate component of stockholders'
equity. "Trading securities" are reported at fair value, with unrealized
gains and losses included in earnings. At Dec. 31, 1993, the investment
securities portfolio was comprised of $9.887 billion of held-to-maturity
securities carried at cost and $3.171 billion of available-for-sale
securities carried at fair value. There were no trading securities.
At Dec. 31, 1993, the company's preliminary risk-based capital ratios
were 15.10 percent for total risk-based capital and 10.45 percent for Tier 1
risk-based capital, exceeding the minimum regulatory guidelines of 8 percent
and 4 percent, respectively. At Dec. 31, 1992, these risk-based capital
ratios were 13.15 percent and 8.22 percent, respectively. The ratio of
common equity to total assets at Dec. 31, 1993 was 7.00 percent, compared
with 6.03 percent at Dec. 31, 1992.

(1) Beginning with the fourth quarter of 1992, the Company changed its dividend declaration policy whereby quarterly dividends are
now considered at the Board of Directors' meeting following the quarter then ended. Accordingly, no dividend was declared
(recorded) in the fourth quarter of 1992.

(2) The December 31, 1993 ratios are preliminary. As currently required by the federal regulatory agencies, the risk-based capital
and leverage ratios do not include unrealized net gains ($21 million, net of tax) on available-for-sale investment securities
carried at fair value resulting from the adoption of FAS 115.

(1) There can be no assurance that individual borrowers will continue to perform at the level indicated or that the performance
characteristics will not change significantly. The December 31, 1993 amounts are preliminary.
(2) Contractually past due is defined as a borrower whose loan principal or interest payment is 30 days or more past due.
(3) Borrower has made no payments since being placed on nonaccrual.
(4) Borrower has made some payments since being placed on nonaccrual. Approximately $314 million and $498 million of these
loans had some payments made on them during the fourth and third quarters of 1993, respectively.
(5) Contractually current is defined as a loan for which principal and interest are being paid in accordance with the terms of the
loan. Approximately $113 million and $195 million of loans, both current and past due, were placed on nonaccrual in the
fourth and third quarters of 1993, respectively, of which approximately $15 million and $84 million were contractually current
at December 31, 1993 and September 30, 1993, respectively. All of the contractually current loans were placed on nonaccrual
due to uncertainty of receiving full timely collection of interest or principal.
(6) Cumulative amounts recorded since inception of the loan.
(7) Includes only those interest payments received subsequent to a borrower being placed on nonaccrual. Therefore, these amounts
do not include interest received before these loans were placed on nonaccrual. There were no interest payments received that
were recorded as recoveries on partially charged-off loans because payments on such loans were applied as a reduction of loan
principal or recognized as interest income.
