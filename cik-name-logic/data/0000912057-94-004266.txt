in form satisfactory to the Company duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his
attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute and deliver
to the Holder of such Debenture without service charge, a new Debenture or
Debentures of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in
aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion

9.02. BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS.

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of and be enforceable by the respective successors and assigns of the parties
hereto; PROVIDED that the Company may not assign and transfer any of its
interests without prior written consent of each Holders.

Nothing in this Agreement or in the Debentures, express or implied,
shall give to any Person other than the parties hereto and the holders from time
to time of Stock Appreciation Rights, any benefit or any legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under this Agreement.

9.03. NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. No failure or delay on the
part of any Holder in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or
under the Security Documents, the Collateral Trust Agreement or the Letter
Agreement and no course of dealing between the Company and any Holder shall
operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right, power or privilege hereunder or under the Security Documents, the
Collateral Trust Agreement or the Letter Agreement preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege
hereunder or thereunder. The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative
and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Holders would otherwise
have. No notice to or demand on the Company in any case shall entitle the
Company to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Holders to any other
or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

9.04. PAYMENT OF EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION. The Company agrees
to:

(i) pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of
Whitehall and the Holders in connection with the negotiation, preparation,
execution and delivery and administration of this Agreement, the Security
Documents, the Collateral Trust Agreement and the Letter Agreement and the
documents and instruments referred to therein and in connection with the
exchange of the Debentures for the New Debt, the negotiation, preparation,
execution and delivery of any New Documents as contemplated by Section
5.09 (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of Sullivan &

-46-
<PAGE>

Cromwell and any indenture trustee, administrative agent or like parties
in respect of the New Debt, and the resale of the New Debt and the
reasonable travel expenses of employees of Whitehall and any Holder) and
any amendment, waiver or consent relating hereto or thereto including, but
not limited to, any such amendments, waivers or consents resulting from or
related to any work-out, renegotiation or restructure relating to the
performance by the Company under this Agreement and of the Holders in
connection with enforcement of the Security Documents, the Collateral
Trust Agreement and the Letter Agreement and the documents and instruments
referred to therein (including, without limitation, the fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Company);

(ii) pay and hold the Holders harmless from and against any and all
present and future stamp and other similar taxes with respect to the
foregoing matters and save the Holders harmless from and against any and
all liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay or omission
(other than to the extent attributable to the Holders) to pay such taxes;

(iii) indemnify the Holders, their respective officers, directors,
partners, employees, representatives, affiliates and agents from and hold
each of them harmless against any and all losses, liabilities, claims,
damages or expenses incurred by any of them as a result of, or arising out
of, or in any way related to, or by reason of, any investigation,
litigation or other proceeding (whether or not any Holder is a party
thereto) related to the entering into and/or performance of this
Agreement, the Security Documents, the Collateral Trust Agreement or the
Letter Agreement or the use of proceeds of the Debentures hereunder or the
consummation of any other transactions contemplated in this Agreement, the
Security Documents, the Collateral Trust Agreement or the Letter Agreement
(including the resale of the Debentures and the exchange of the Debentures
as contemplated by Section 5.09), including, without limitation, the
reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in connection with
any such investigation, litigation or other proceeding, as the same are
incurred (but excluding any such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or
expenses to the extent incurred by reason of gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Person to be indemnified); and

-47-
<PAGE>

(iv) if the indemnification provided for in Section 9.04(iii) is
unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in
respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or
actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then the Company shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a
result of such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or
actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and
the Holders on the other from the consummation of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement. If, however, the allocation provided by
the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law,
then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the
Company on the one hand and the Holders on the other in connection with
the actions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or
expenses (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on
the one hand and the Holders on the other hand shall be deemed to be in
the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the Debentures (before
deducting expenses) received by the Debentures bear to the net fees paid
in accordance with Section 3.01(g) and retained by the indemnified
Holders. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether the action of the Company on the one hand or the
Holders on the other and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission. The Company and the Holders agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contributions pursuant to this subsection (iv) were
determined by any method of allocation which does not take account of the
equitable considerations referred to above in this subsection (iv). The
amounts paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses,
liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof)
referred to above in this subsection (iv) shall be deemed to include any
legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim, as
the same are incurred. The Company's and the Holders' obligations in this

-48-
<PAGE>

subsection (iv) to contribute are several and not joint.

Neither Whitehall nor any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall
be liable to the Company for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or
any of them under or in connection with any Loan Document, except for gross
negligence or willful misconduct attributable to such Person.

9.05. AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS AND CONSENTS. Any provision of this
Agreement, the Debentures, the Security Documents, the Collateral Trust
Agreement or the Letter Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such
amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Company and the Required
Holders and SARs; PROVIDED, that no such amendment, waiver or modification
shall, unless signed by all the Holders and holders of then outstanding Stock
Appreciation Rights (i) subject any Holder to any additional obligation, (ii)
reduce the principal of or rate of interest on any Debenture or any fees
hereunder, (iii) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal of or
interest on any Debenture or any fees hereunder, (iv) change the percentage of
the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Debentures, or the number of
Holders, and if applicable, holders of Stock Appreciation Rights, which shall be
required for the Holders, and if applicable, holders of Stock Appreciation
Rights or any of them to take any action under this Section 9.05 or any other
provision of this Agreement, (v) release all or substantially all of the
collateral for the Debentures or (vi) amend or waive the provisions of Section
6.12 or this Section 9.05.

9.06. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. It
shall not be necessary in making proof of this Agreement to produce or account
for more than one such counterpart.

9.07. HEADINGS. The headings of the sections and subsections
hereof are provided for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the
meaning or construction of any provision of this Agreement.

9.08. SURVIVAL OF INDEMNITIES. All indemnities set forth herein,
including, without limitation, in Section 9.04, shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the issuance of the Debentures, and the payment

-49-
<PAGE>

of principal of the Debentures and other obligations hereunder.

9.09. GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; VENUE.

(a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. Nothing herein shall affect the right of
any Holder to commence legal proceedings or to otherwise proceed against the
Company in any other jurisdiction.

(b) The Company hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions
or proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Security
Documents, the Collateral Trust Agreement or the Letter Agreement brought in the
courts referred to in subsection (a) hereof and hereby further irrevocably
waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any such action
or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient
forum.

(c) THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED THEREBY.

9.10. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Agreement is
determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be
fully severable and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and
effect and shall be construed without giving effect to the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions.

9.11. ENTIRETY. This Agreement together with the other Loan
Documents represents the entire agreement of the parties hereto and thereto, and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, if any,
relating to the Documents or the transactions contemplated herein; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that nothing shall affect the obligations of the Company to Goldman,
Sachs & Co., Whitehall (and their respective affiliates) under the letter of
intent, dated November 17, 1994, among the Company, Goldman, Sachs & Co. and
Whitehall.

negligence or willful misconduct as and to the extent the Trustee would be
liable for such losses or damages if the actions or omissions of such agents,
nominees or attorneys-in-fact constituting such negligence or willful misconduct
had been actions or omissions of the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents, nominees or
attorneys-in-fact selected by it without negligence or willful misconduct.

Section 5.4. RELIANCE BY TRUSTEE. (a) Whenever in the
administration of the trusts of this Agreement the Trustee shall deem it
necessary or desirable that a matter be proved or established with respect to
the Borrower in connection with the taking, suffering or omitting of any action
hereunder by the Trustee, such matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof
be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively provided or
established by a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the Borrower delivered

any action taken, suffered or omitted in reliance thereon; subject, however, to
the provisions of Section 5.5.

Lenders, and the amounts of Secured Debt held by them, the information provided
by the Borrower to the Trustee pursuant to Section 4.2 of this Agreement. In

conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the
opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the
Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Agreement or any Security
Document.

(d) The Trustee shall not be under any obligation to exercise any
of the rights or powers vested in the Trustee by this Agreement or any Security
Document unless the Trustee shall have been provided adequate security and
indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred by
it in compliance with such request or direction, including such reasonable
advances as may be requested by the Trustee.

Section 5.5. LIMITATIONS ON DUTIES OF TRUSTEE. (a) Prior to receipt
of a Notice of an Actionable Default, the Trustee shall be obligated to perform
such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement
or in any Security Document, and no implied covenants or obligations shall be
read into this Agreement or any Security Document against the Trustee. The
Trustee shall, upon receipt of a Notice of Actionable Default and during such
time as such Notice of Actionable Default shall not have been withdrawn in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.1(b) hereof, (i) exercise the rights
and powers vested in it by this Agreement or by any Security Document, and the

pursuant to Section 2.2(a) or 2.6 of this Agreement or (ii) if the Trustee shall
have initiated, or shall have received the written direction of the Requisite
Lenders to initiate, the exercise of any remedy with respect to the Collateral,
exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Agreement or by any
Security Document, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise,
as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of
his own affairs, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein
or in any Security Document. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee shall
follow written instructions of the Required Lenders, if any are received, as to
the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any right or remedy
available to the Trustee, or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the
Trustee, or for the appointment of a receiver, or for the taking of any other
action authorized by Section 2.

Trustee shall furnish to each New Private Lender, any New Trustee and the Public
Trustee promptly upon receipt thereof, a copy of each certificate or other paper
furnished to the Trustee by the Borrower under or in respect of this Agreement,

any Security Document a copy of the same is required to be furnished by some
other

Person directly to the New Private Lenders, any New Trustee and the Public
Trustee, or the Trustee shall have determined that the same has already been so
furnished.

Section 5.6. MONEYS TO BE HELD IN TRUST. All moneys received by the
Trustee under or pursuant to any provision of this Agreement or any Security
Document shall be held in trust for the purposes for which they were paid or are
held.

Section 5.7. RESIGNATION AND REMOVAL OF THE TRUSTEE. (a) The
Corporate Trustee or the Individual Trustee may at any time, by giving thirty
(30) days' prior written notice to the Borrower, the New Private Lenders, any
New Trustee and the Public Trustee, resign and be discharged of the
responsibilities hereby created, such resignation to become effective upon the
appointment of a successor trustee or trustees by the Borrower and the
acceptance of such appointment by such successor trustee or trustees. The
Corporate Trustee or the Individual Trustee may be removed at any time and a
successor trustee appointed by the affirmative vote of the Majority Holders;
PROVIDED THAT the Corporate Trustee and the Individual Trustee shall be entitled
to its or his fees and expenses to the date of removal. If no successor trustee
or trustees shall be appointed and approved within thirty (30) days from the
date of the giving of the aforesaid notice of resignation or within thirty (30)
days from the date of such removal, the Corporate Trustee or the Individual
Trustee, as applicable, shall, or any Holder may, apply to any court of
competent jurisdiction to appoint a successor trustee or trustees (which may be
an individual or individuals) to act until such time, if any, as a successor
trustee or trustees shall have been appointed as above provided. Any successor
trustee or trustees so appointed by such court shall immediately and without
further act be superseded by any successor trustee or trustees approved by the
Majority Holders as above provided.

(b) If at any time the Corporate Trustee or the Individual Trustee
shall resign, be removed or otherwise become incapable of acting, or if at any
time a vacancy shall occur in the office of the Corporate Trustee or the
Individual Trustee for any other cause, a successor trustee or trustees may be
appointed by the Majority Holders, and the powers, duties, authority and title
of the predecessor trustee or trustees terminated and cancelled without
procuring the resignation of such predecessor trustee or trustees, and without
any other formality (except as may be required by applicable law) than the
appointment and designation of a successor trustee or trustees in writing, duly
acknowledged, delivered to the predecessor trustee or trustees and the Borrower,
and filed for record in each public office, if any, in which this Agreement is
required to be filed.

(c) The appointment and designation referred to in Section 5.7(b)
of this Agreement shall, after any required filing, be full evidence of the
right and authority to make the same and of all the facts therein recited, and
this Agreement shall vest in such successor or trustee or trustees, without any
further act, deed or conveyance, all of the estate and title of its predecessor
or their predecessors, and upon such filing for record the successor trustee or
trustees shall become fully vested with all the estates, properties, rights,
powers, trusts, duties,

<PAGE>

23

authority and title of its predecessor or their predecessors; but such
predecessor or predecessors shall, nevertheless, on the written request of the
Majority Holders, the Borrower, or its or their successor trustee or trustees,
execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor or successors
all the estates, properties, rights, powers, trusts, duties, authority and title
of such predecessor or predecessors hereunder and shall deliver all securities
and moneys held by it or them to such successor trustee or trustees. Should any
deed, conveyance or other instrument in writing from the Borrower be required by
any successor trustee or trustees for more fully and certainly vesting in such
successor trustee or trustees the estates, properties, rights, powers, trusts,
duties, authority and title vested or intended to be vested in the predecessor
trustee or trustees, any and all such deeds, conveyances and other instruments
in writing shall, on request of such successor trustee or trustees, be so
executed, acknowledged and delivered.

(d) Any required filing for record of the instrument appointing a
successor trustee or trustees as hereinabove provided shall be at the expense of
the Borrower. The resignation of any trustee or trustees and the instrument or
instruments removing any trustee or trustees, together with all other
instruments, deeds and conveyances provided for in this Section 5 shall, if
required by law, be forthwith recorded, registered and filed by and at the
expense of the Borrower, wherever this Agreement is recorded, registered and
filed.

Section 5.8. STATUS OF SUCCESSORS TO THE CORPORATE TRUSTEE. Every
successor to the Corporate Trustee appointed pursuant to Section 5.7 of this
Agreement and every corporation resulting from a merger or consolidation
pursuant to Section 5.9 of this Agreement shall be a bank or trust company in
good standing and having power so to act, incorporated under the laws of the
United States or any State thereof or the District of Columbia, and having its
principal corporate trust office within the forty-eight (48) contiguous States,
and shall also have capital, surplus and undivided profits of not less than
$100,000,000.

Section 5.9. MERGER OF THE CORPORATE TRUSTEE. Any corporation into
which the Corporate Trustee shall be merged, or with which it shall be
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to
which the Corporate Trustee shall be a party, shall be the Corporate Trustee
under this Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of the parties hereto.

Section 5.10. ADDITIONAL CO-TRUSTEES; SEPARATE TRUSTEES. (a) If at
any time or times it shall be necessary or prudent in order to conform to any
law of any jurisdiction in which any of the Collateral shall be located, or the
Trustee shall be advised by counsel, satisfactory to it, that it is so necessary
or prudent in the interest of the Holders, or the Majority Holders shall in
writing so request, or the Trustee shall deem it desirable for its own
protection in the performance of its duties hereunder, the Trustee and the
Borrower shall execute and deliver all instruments and agreements necessary or
proper to constitute another bank or trust company, or one or more persons
approved by the Trustee and the Borrower either to act as co-trustee or co-
trustees of all or any of the Collateral, jointly with the Trustee originally
named herein or any

<PAGE>

24

successor or successors, or to act as separate trustee or trustees of any such
property. In the event the Borrower shall not have joined in the execution of
such instruments and agreements within ten (10) days after the receipt of a
written request from the Trustee so to do, or in case an Actionable Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, the Trustee may act under the foregoing
provisions of this Section 5.10 without the concurrence of the Borrower, and the
Borrower hereby irrevocably appoints the Trustee as its agent and attorney to
act for it under the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.10 in either of such
contingencies.

(b) Every separate trustee and every co-trustee, other than any
trustee which may be appointed as successor to [name of Corporate Trustee] or
[name of Individual Trustee], shall, to the extent permitted by law, be
appointed and act and be such, subject to the following provisions and
conditions, namely:

(i) all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred upon the
Trustee in respect of the custody, control and management of moneys, papers
or securities shall be exercised solely by [name of Corporate Trustee], or
its successors as Trustee hereunder;

(ii) all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or imposed
upon the Trustee hereunder shall be conferred or imposed and exercised or
performed by the Trustee and such separate trustee or separate trustees or
co-trustee or co-trustees, jointly, as shall be provided in the instrument
appointing such separate trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee or co-
trustees, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction in
which any particular act or acts are to be performed, the Trustee shall be
incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in which event such
rights, powers, duties and obligations shall be exercised and performed by
such separate trustee or separate trustees or co-trustee or co-trustees;

(iii) no power given hereby to, or which it is provided hereby may be
exercised by, any such co-trustee or co-trustees or separate trustee or
separate trustees, shall be exercised hereunder by such co-trustee or co-
trustees or separate trustee or separate trustees, except jointly with, or
with the consent in writing of, the Trustee, anything herein contained to
the contrary notwithstanding;

(iv) no trustee hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of
any act or omission of any other trustee hereunder; and

(v) the Borrower and the Trustee, at any time by an instrument in
writing, executed by them jointly, may accept the resignation of or remove
any such separate trustee or co-trustee, and in that case, by an instrument
in writing executed by the Borrower and the Trustee jointly, may appoint a
successor to such separate trustee or co-trustee, as the case may be,
anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding. In the event
that the Borrower shall not have joined in the execution of any such

<PAGE>

25

instrument within ten (10) days after the receipt of a written request from
the Trustee so to do, or in case an Actionable Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, the Trustee shall have the power to accept the
resignation of or remove any such separate trustee or co-trustee and to
appoint a successor without the concurrence of the Borrower, the Borrower
hereby irrevocably appointing the Trustee its agent and attorney to act for
it in such connection in either of such contingencies. In the event that
the Trustee shall have appointed a separate trustee or separate trustees or
co-trustee or co-trustees as above provided, it may at any time, by an
instrument in writing, accept the resignation of or remove any such
separate trustee or co-trustee, the successor to any such separate trust or
co-trustee to be appointed by the Borrower and the Trustee, or by the
Trustee alone, as hereinabove provided in this Section 5.10.

Certain terms, used principally in Sections 4, 5 and 6, are defined in

2. ORIGINAL ISSUE OF WARRANTS.

2.1. FORM OF WARRANT CERTIFICATES. The Warrant Certificates shall be
in registered form only and substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A, shall be dated the date on which countersigned by the Warrant Agent
and may have such legends and endorsements typed, stamped, printed, lithographed
or engraved thereon as provided in Section 3.5(f) and as required by the
Certificate of Incorporation or as may be required to comply with any law or
with any rule or regulation pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of
any securities exchange on which the Warrants may be listed.

Pending the preparation of definitive Warrant Certificates, temporary
Warrant Certificates may be issued, which may be printed, lithographed,
typewritten, mimeographed or otherwise produced, which will be substantially of
the tenor of the definitive Warrant Certificates in lieu of which they are
issued and which are not required to be countersigned by the Warrant Agent.

If temporary Warrant Certificates are issued, the Company will cause
definitive Warrant Certificates to be prepared without unreasonable delay.
After the preparation of definitive Warrant Certificates, the temporary Warrant
Certificates shall be exchangeable for definitive Warrant Certificates upon
surrender of the temporary Warrant Certificates to the Warrant Agent, without
charge to the Holder. Until so exchanged the temporary Warrant Certificates
shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Agreement as
definitive Warrant Certificates.

2.2. EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF WARRANT CERTIFICATES. Simultaneously with
the execution of this Agreement, Warrant Certificates evidencing Warrants to
purchase an aggregate of up to 4,156,927 shares of Common Stock, subject to
adjustment, shall be executed by the Company and delivered to the Warrant Agent
for countersignature, and the Warrant Agent shall thereupon countersign and
deliver such Warrant Certificates to Whitehall. Warrant Certificates evidencing
additional Warrants issued in exchange for Stock Appreciation Rights may be
executed, on or after the date of this Agreement, by the Company and delivered
to the Warrant Agent for countersignature, and the Warrant Agent shall thereupon
countersign and deliver such Warrant Certificates upon the order and at the
direction of the Company to the purchasers thereof on the date of issuance. The
Warrant Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized to countersign and deliver
Warrant Certificates as

<PAGE>

7

required by this Section 2.2, Section 7, Section 12.4 or Section 12.5. The
Warrant Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its President
or Vice President, either manually or by facsimile signature printed thereon.
The Warrant Certificates shall be manually countersigned by the Warrant Agent
and shall not be valid for any purpose unless so countersigned. In case any
officer of the Company whose signature shall have been placed upon any of the
Warrant Certificates shall cease to be such officer of the Company before
countersignature by the Warrant Agent and issue and delivery thereof, such
Warrant Certificates may, nevertheless, be countersigned by the Warrant Agent
and issued and delivered with the same force and effect as though such person
had not ceased to be such officer of the Company.

3. EXERCISE PRICE; EXERCISE OF WARRANTS AND EXPIRATION OF WARRANTS.

3.1. EXERCISE PRICE. Each Warrant Certificate shall, when
countersigned by the Warrant Agent, entitle the Holder thereof, subject to the
provisions of this Agreement, to purchase, except as provided in Section 3.4
hereof, one share of Common Stock for each Warrant represented thereby, subject
to all adjustments made on or prior to the date of issuance thereof, at an
exercise price (the "Exercise Price") of $5.00 per share, subject to all
adjustments made on or prior to the date of issuance thereof as herein provided.

3.2. EXERCISE OF WARRANTS. The Warrants shall be exercisable from
time to time on any Business Day beginning on the earliest of (i) the time
immediately after the Loans (as defined in the Loan Agreement) have been made by
the Lenders and the 14% Debentures have been purchased by Whitehall, (ii) such
time as any condition precedent specified in Section 3.01 of the Loan Agreement
(other than Section 3.01(c) as it relates to Sections 7.01(f) and (g) thereof)
is no longer capable of being fulfilled in accordance with the terms thereof and
(iii) March 31, 1995, and ending on the Expiration Date in the manner provided
for herein.

3.3. EXPIRATION OF WARRANTS. The Warrants shall expire and the
rights of the Holders of such Warrants shall terminate at the close of business
on the earlier of (i) March 31, 1995 in the event the Lenders fail to fund
under the Loan Agreement even though all of the conditions precedent set forth
in Section 3.01 thereof have been satisfied and (ii) December 31, 2007 (such
earlier date being referred to as the "Expiration Date").

3.4. METHOD OF EXERCISE; PAYMENT OF EXERCISE PRICE. In order to
exercise a Warrant, the Holder thereof must surrender the Warrant Certificate
evidencing such Warrant to the Warrant Agent, with the form on the reverse of or
attached to the Warrant Certificate duly executed, together with any required
payment in full of the Exercise Price then in effect for the shares of
Underlying Common Stock as to which a Warrant Certificate is submitted

<PAGE>

8

for exercise. Any such payment of the Exercise Price shall be by certified or
official bank check drawn on a New York City bank payable to the order of the
Company. All funds received upon the tender of Warrants shall be deposited by
the Warrant Agent for the account of the Company, unless otherwise instructed in
writing by the Company.

If fewer than all the Warrants represented by a Warrant Certificate
are surrendered, such Warrant Certificate shall be surrendered and a new Warrant
Certificate of the same tenor and for the number of Warrants that were not
surrendered shall promptly be executed and delivered to the Warrant Agent by the
Company. The Warrant Agent shall promptly countersign the new Warrant
Certificate, register it in such name or names as may be directed in writing by
the Holder and deliver the new Warrant Certificate to the Person or Persons
entitled to receive the same.

Upon surrender of a Warrant Certificate in conformity with the
foregoing provisions, the Warrant Agent shall thereupon promptly notify the
Company, and the Company shall transfer to the Holder of such Warrant
Certificate appropriate evidence of ownership of any shares of Underlying Common
Stock or other securities or property (including any money) to which the Holder
is entitled, registered or otherwise placed in, or payable to the order of, such
name or names as may be directed in writing by the Holder, and shall deliver
such evidence of ownership and any other securities or property (including any
money) to the Person or Persons entitled to receive the same, together with an
amount in cash in lieu of any fraction of a share as provided in Section 6.8. A
Holder shall be deemed to own and have all of the rights associated with any
Underlying Common Stock or other securities or property (including money) to
which it is entitled pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender of a Warrant
Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.4.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the
event of the occurrence of a business combination pursuant to which the
unaffiliated stockholders of the Company are given the opportunity to exchange
all or a portion of such stockholders' shares of Common Stock, the Holders may
exercise their Warrants by surrendering such Warrants to the Warrant Agent, with
the form on the reverse of or attached to the Warrant Certificate duly executed,
together with an indication that they are exercising these Warrants pursuant to
this paragraph and the Warrant Agent shall thereupon promptly notify the Company
of such surrender, and the Company shall promptly (i) in the case of only cash
consideration, pay to each Holder an amount equal to the number of shares for
which the Warrants submitted by each Holder may be exercised multiplied by the
difference between such cash consideration and the Exercise Price, on a per
share of Common Stock basis, and (ii) in the case of noncash consideration or
any combination of cash and noncash consideration, upon receipt from each Holder
of its Warrant Certificates, deliver to each such Holder the difference between
(x) the cash, if any, and the fair market value of the noncash consideration as
determined by an Independent Financial Expert in the same manner as Section
6.2(f) and (y) the Exercise Price, on a per share of Common Stock basis.

transferred or otherwise disposed of (any such sale, transfer or other

(b) A Holder may exercise its Warrants if it is an "accredited
investor" or a "qualified institutional buyer", as defined in Regulation D and
Rule 144A under the Securities Act, respectively, and a Holder may sell its
Warrants or any Registrable Common Stock to a transferee that is an "accredited

(ii) such Holder or transferee represents that it is acquiring the
Underlying Common Stock (in the case of an exercise) or the Warrants or
shares of Registrable Common Stock (in the case of a sale) for its own
account and that it is not acquiring such Underlying Common Stock or the
Warrants or shares of Registrable Common Stock with a view to, or for offer
or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of
the Securities Act) that would be in violation of the securities laws of
the United States or any applicable state thereof, but subject,
nevertheless, to the disposition of its property being at all times within
its control; and

(iii) such Holder or transferee agrees to be bound by the
provisions of this Section 3.5 with respect to any exercise of the Warrants
and any sale of the Warrants or shares of Registrable Common Stock.

(c) A Holder may exercise its Warrants and may sell its Warrants or
shares of Registrable Common Stock in accordance with Regulation S under the

(d) A Holder may exercise its Warrants or sell its Warrants or shares

and 3.5(b)(iii).

(e) Subject to Section 12.5, all stock certificates issued pursuant

THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED

OF ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS AND SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS
OF THE WARRANT AGREEMENT DATED AS OF DECEMBER 18, 1994 BETWEEN

Registrable Common Stock issued upon such exercise in a transaction that is
registered under the Securities Act.

(ii) any sale of a Warrant or shares of Registrable Common Stock in a

Warrants and the Underlying Common Stock constitute "publicly-offered
securities" within the meaning of Department of Labor Regulation 29 CFR
Section 2510.3-101(b), as amended, and the advisory opinions or other
administrative interpretations thereunder (collectively, the "Plan Asset
Regulations"), no Warrant may be sold to a "benefit plan investor" within the
meaning of the Plan Asset Regulations if the result of such sale would be that
benefit plan investors hold 25% or more of all nonpublicly-offered shares of
Common Stock, on a fully diluted basis (assuming, among other things, (i) an
exercise of all outstanding nonpublicly-offerered Warrants for Common Stock,
(ii) an exchange of all outstanding nonpublicly-offerered Stock Appreciations
Rights for Warrants and a subsequent exercise of such Warrants for Common Stock
and (iii) a conversion of all outstanding Convertible Debentures for Common
Stock).

4. REGISTRATION RIGHTS AND PROCEDURES.

4.1. DEMAND REGISTRATION. (a) At any time after the Warrants have
become exercisable pursuant to Section 3.2, the Holders of (i) at least 5% of
the Registrable Common Stock then deemed outstanding shall have the right to
request in writing that the Company effect a registration of such Holders'
Registrable Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of this Section 4.1 or (ii)
at least 1% of the Registrable Common Stock then deemed outstanding shall have
the right to request in writing that the Company effect a registration of such
Holder's Registrable Common Stock pursuant to a Takedown under this Section 4.1
(each such request, a "Registration Demand"). A Registration Demand shall
specify the number of shares of Registrable Common Stock that each such Holder
proposes to sell in the offering. If no Shelf Registration Statement (as
defined in Section 4.1(c)(i) below) shall be effective as of the date of the
Registration Demand, the demanding Holders may elect to register such
Registrable Common Stock in accordance with either Section 4.1(c)(i) or
Section 4.1(d). If a Shelf Registration Statement shall be effective as of the
date of the Registration Demand, then all demanding Holders shall be deemed to
have elected to register their Registrable Common Stock pursuant to Section
4.1(c)(ii). The Holders may make four Registration Demands pursuant to
Sections 4.1(c)(i) and 4.1(d) and four Registration Demands per year pursuant to
an existing Shelf Registration Statement

<PAGE>

12

pursuant to Section 4.1(c)(ii) for which the Company will pay and bear all costs
and expenses in accordance with Section 5.3 and thereafter the Holders may make
an unlimited number of Registration Demands for which such requesting Holders
shall pay and bear all costs and expenses.

(b) Upon receipt of a Registration Demand (other than a Takedown),
the Company shall give written notice thereof to all of the other Holders at
least 30 days prior to the initial filing of a Registration Statement relating
to such Registration Demand. Each of the other Holders shall have the right,
within 20 days after the delivery of such notice, to request that the Company
include all or a portion of such Holder's Registrable Common Stock in such
Registration Statement. Upon receipt of a Registration Demand that is a
Takedown, a representative of the selling holders shall give written notice
thereof to all of the other Holders at least three Business Days prior to the
initial filing of a Registration Statement relating to such Registration Demand.
Each of the other Holders shall have the right, within one Business Day after
the delivery of such notice, to request that the Company include all or a
portion of such Holder's Registrable Common Stock in such Registration
Statement.

(c) (i) As promptly as practicable and in no event later than 60
days after the Company receives a Registration Demand electing to register
Registrable Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4.1(c), the Company shall
file under the Securities Act a "shelf" registration statement (the "Shelf
Registration Statement") providing for the registration and the sale on a
continuous or delayed basis of all the Registerable Securities, pursuant to
Rule 415 under the Securities Act and/or any similar rule that may be
adopted by the SEC (the "Shelf Registration"). The Company agrees to use
its best efforts to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to become or be
declared effective no later than 60 calendar days after the filing (the "60
Day Effective Date") and to keep such Shelf Registration continuously
effective for a period ending on the occurrence of the earlier of: (x) the
third anniversary of the Registration Demand and (y) notification by all of
the requesting Holders that such Holders have sold all of the Registerable
Common Stock owned by them. The Company further agrees to supplement or
make amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement and the prospectus
included therein (x) as may be necessary to effect and maintain the
effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement for the period set forth
in the previous sentence and (y) as may be required by the rules,
regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by the
Company for such Shelf Registration or by the Securities Act or rules and
regulations thereunder for shelf registration. The Company agrees to
furnish to the Holders of the securities registered thereby copies of any
such supplement or amendment (but excluding any periodic reports required
to be filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act of 1934) so that the
Holders, through the Representative(s), have a reasonable opportunity to
comment thereon prior to its being used and/or filed with the SEC.

<PAGE>

13

(ii) As promptly as practicable after the Company receives a
Registration Demand from a Holder or Holders pursuant to which a Holder is
deemed to have elected to register Registrable Common Stock pursuant to an
existing Shelf Registration Statement (a "Takedown"), the Company shall
file a Prospectus with the SEC and otherwise comply with the Securities Act
and all rules, regulations and instructions thereunder applicable to such
Takedown. In the event that no Prospectus or other filing is required nor
any other action necessitating the Company's participation is required to
effect a sale of Registrable Common Stock pursuant to an effective Shelf
Registration Statement, a representative of the selling holder or holders
agrees to provide the Company with at least three Business Days' notice of
the proposed sale (which may or may not include the amount of shares of
Registrable Common Stock to be registered) pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall have the
right to postpone any such sale for a reasonable period of time not to
exceed 90 days if: (i) in the opinion of counsel for the Company, the
Company would, in connection with such sale, be required to disclose in
such Registration Statement (or any prospectus supplement to be used in
connection therewith) information not otherwise then required by law to be
publicly disclosed and (ii) in the good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company, such disclosure would adversely affect any
material corporate development or business transaction contemplated by the
Company.

(d) As promptly as practicable and in no event later than 60 days
after the Company receives a Registration Demand electing to register
Registrable Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4.1(d), the Company shall file
with the SEC a Registration Statement, on any form that shall be available and
appropriate for the sale of the Registrable Common Stock in accordance with the
intended method of distribution thereof. The Company shall include in such
Registration Statement all of the Registrable Common Stock of such requesting
Holders that such Holders have requested to be included therein pursuant to
Sections 4.1(a) and 4.1(b); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if the requested
registration involves an underwritten offering, the Registrable Common Stock to
be registered may be reduced if the managing underwriter delivers a notice (a
"Cutback Notice") pursuant to Section 4.1(g).

The Company shall use its best efforts to cause each such
Registration Statement to be declared effective and to keep such Registration
Statement continuously effective and usable for resale of such Registrable
Common Stock, for a period of 90 days from the date on which the SEC declares
such Registration Statement effective or such shorter period as is necessary to
complete the distribution of the securities registered thereunder.

(e) The Representative(s) shall determine the method of distribution
of shares of Registrable Common Stock pursuant to a Registration Demand.

<PAGE>

14

(f) If a Registration Demand involves an underwritten offering, GS
shall be the managing underwriter for such offering unless GS declines such
engagement, in which event, the Representative(s) shall select the managing
underwriter; PROVIDED that such managing underwriter so selected shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

(g) In the event that the proposed offering is an underwritten
offering and includes securities to be offered for the account of the Company
(the "Company Shares"), the provisions of this Section 4.1(g) shall be
applicable if the managing underwriter delivers a Cutback Notice stating that,
in its opinion, the aggregate number of shares of Registrable Common Stock, plus
the Company Shares proposed to be sold therein, exceeds the maximum number of
shares specified by the managing underwriter in such Cutback Notice that may be
distributed without adversely affecting the price, timing or distribution of the
Common Stock being distributed. If the managing underwriter delivers such
Cutback Notice, the number of shares of Registrable Common Stock requested to be
registered and Company Shares shall be reduced in the following order until the
number of shares to be offered has been reduced to the maximum number of shares
specified by the managing underwriter in the Cut Back Notice: first, the
Company Shares and second, the Registrable Common Stock in proportion to the
respective number of shares of Registrable Common Stock that each Holder has
requested to be registered.

(h) The underwriting agreement relating to any Registration Demand
shall provide that each requesting Holder shall have the right to sell either
its Warrants or its Registrable Common Stock to the underwriters.

(i) No Registration Demand (other than a Takedown) may be made until
the expiration of six months following the completion of the distribution of the
securities registered under any Registration Statement that has been filed and
has become effective pursuant to a prior Registration Demand.

(j) The Company shall not be obligated to file a Registration
Statement relating to any Registration Demand (other than a Takedown) unless the
requests by the Holders for such registration cover an aggregate of 5% or more
of the Registrable Common Stock then deemed outstanding.

4.2. PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION RIGHTS. (a) If the Company proposes to
file a Registration Statement with the SEC respecting an offering, whether
primary or secondary, of any equity securities of the Company, the Company shall
give written notice to all the Holders at least 30 days prior to the initial
filing of the Registration Statement relating to such offering. Each such
Holder shall have the right, within 20 days after delivery of such notice, to
request in writing that the Company include all or a portion of such Holder's
Registrable Common Stock in such Registration Statement ("Piggyback Registration
Rights").

<PAGE>
15

(b) In the event that the proposed offering is an underwritten
offering covering shares of Common Stock to be offered for the account of the
Company (the "Company Shares"), the provisions of this Section 4.2(b) shall be
applicable if the managing underwriter delivers a Cutback Notice stating that,
in its opinion, the aggregate number of shares of Registrable Common Stock and
the Company Shares that the Holders have requested to be registered, exceeds the
maximum number of shares specified by the managing underwriter in such Cutback
Notice that may be distributed without adversely affecting the price, timing or
distribution of the Common Stock being distributed. If the managing underwriter
delivers such Cutback Notice, the number of shares of Registrable Common Stock
and Company Shares requested to be included in such offering shall be reduced in
the following order until the number of shares to be offered has been reduced to
the maximum number of shares specified by the managing underwriter in the Cut
Back Notice: first, the Registrable Common Stock in proportion to the
respective number of shares of Registrable Common Stock that each Holder has
requested to be registered and second, the Company Shares.

(c) The provisions of this Section 4.2 shall not be applicable in
connection with (i) a registration statement filed by the Company pursuant to
Section 4.1 or (ii) a transaction in which a registration statement is filed by
the Company on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor forms.

4.3. COMPANY'S ABILITY TO POSTPONE REGISTRATION RIGHTS. (a) The
Company shall have the right to postpone the filing of any Registration
Statement relating to a Demand Registration for a reasonable period of time not
to exceed 90 days if: (i) in the opinion of counsel for the Company, the
Company would be required to disclose in such Registration Statement information
not otherwise then required by law to be publicly disclosed and (ii) in the good
faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, such disclosure would
adversely affect any material corporate development or business transaction
contemplated by the Company; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such 90-day period shall be
deducted from the six-month interval allowed between Registration Demands
pursuant to Section 4.1(i).

(b) If at any time after the Company notifies the Holders of its
intention to file a Registration Statement that would trigger Piggyback
Registration Rights, the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith shall
determine for any reason not to effect such registration or to postpone such
registration, the Company shall (i) in the case of a determination not to effect
such registration, be relieved of its obligation to register any Registrable
Common Stock of Holders requesting inclusion in such registration, and (ii) in
the case of a determination to postpone such registration, be permitted to
postpone registering the Registrable Common Stock of Holders requesting
inclusion in such registration.

(c) The Company shall as promptly as practicable notify the Holders
of any postponement pursuant to this Section 4.3, specifying the reasons
therefor.

<PAGE>

16

4.4. HOLDER WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS. The Company shall withdraw from
registration any Registrable Common Stock on request of a Holder; PROVIDED that,
in the case of a Registration Demand under Section 4.1, a Demand Registration
shall be deemed to have been made for the purpose of the number of such Demands
permitted to be made under Section 4.1(a) if the Company shall have incurred
$50,000 in expenses relating to such Demand Registration at such time as such
Holder makes such withdrawal. The Company shall not be obligated to maintain
the effectiveness of any Registration Statement if, after any withdrawal of
Registrable Common Stock by a Holder, the number of shares of Registrable Common
Stock remaining subject to such Registration Statement is less than 5% of the
Registrable Common Stock deemed outstanding, unless (i) the Company is also
registering securities on such Registration Statement for its own account or
(ii) if such Registration Statement relates to securities other than for the
account of the Company.

5. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES.

5.1. COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY APPLICABLE TO ALL REGISTRATION
STATEMENTS. This Section 5.1 applies to all Registration Statements filed by
the Company and referred to in Section 4.1 or 4.2. The securities covered by
each such Registration Statement are referred to as the "Registered Securities".
Each underwriter, agent, selling broker, dealer manager or similar securities
industry professional participating in any offering of the Registered Securities
is referred to as an "underwriter" or "agent" and any agreement entered into
with an underwriter or agent is referred to as an "underwriting or agency
agreement". In connection with each such registration, the Company covenants
with each Holder participating in such offering (each, a "selling holder") and
each underwriter or agent participating therein as follows:

(a) The Company will notify the selling holders and the managing
underwriter or agent, immediately, and confirm the notice in writing,
(i) when the Registration Statement, or any post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement, shall have become effective, or any supplement to
the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus shall have been filed, (ii) of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC, (iii) of any request by the SEC to
amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus or
for additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any
order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus, or of
the suspension of the qualification of the Registered Securities for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the institution or threatening
of any proceedings for any of such purposes, (v) if at any time when a
prospectus is required by the Securities Act to be delivered in connection
with sales of the Registered Securities the representations and warranties
of the Company contemplated by Section 5.1(j) cease to be true and correct
and (vi) of the existence of any fact that

<PAGE>

17

results or may result in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any
document incorporated therein by reference containing an untrue statement
of material fact or omitting to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make any statement therein not misleading.

(b) The Company will use every reasonable effort to prevent the
issuance of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any
preliminary prospectus and, if any such order is issued, to obtain the
lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.

(c) The Company will afford the Representative(s) and the managing
underwriters a reasonable opportunity to comment prior to its being filed
with the SEC any Registration Statement, any amendment thereto, or any
amendment of or supplement to the Prospectus (including amendments of the
documents incorporated by reference into the Prospectus but excluding any
periodic reports required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange
Act).

(d) The Company will furnish to each selling holder and to the
managing underwriter or agent, without charge, as many signed copies of the
Registration Statement (as originally filed) and of all amendments thereto,
whether filed before or after the Registration Statement becomes effective,
copies of all exhibits and documents filed therewith, including documents
incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and signed copies of all
consents and certificates of experts, as such selling holder or the
managing underwriter or agent may reasonably request, and will furnish to
the managing underwriter, for each other underwriter participating in an
underwritten offering, one conformed copy of the Registration Statement as
originally filed and of each amendment thereto (including documents
incorporated by reference into the Prospectus but without exhibits).

(e) The Company will deliver to each selling holder and each
underwriter or agent participating in such offering, without charge, as
many copies of each preliminary prospectus as such selling holder or such
underwriter or agent may reasonably request, and the Company hereby
consents to the use of such copies for purposes permitted by the Securities
Act. The Company will deliver to each selling holder and each underwriter
or agent participating in such offering, without charge, from time to time
during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, such number of copies of the Prospectus (as supplemented or
amended) as such selling holder or such underwriter or agent may reasonably
request.

(f) The Company will comply to the best of its ability with the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and the
Exchange Act and

<PAGE>

18

the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder so as to permit the
completion of the distribution of the Registered Securities in accordance
with the intended method or methods of distribution contemplated in the
Prospectus. If at any time when a prospectus is required by the Securities
Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Registered Securities
any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it is
necessary, in the opinion of counsel for the selling holders, counsel for
the underwriters or agents or counsel for the Company, to amend the
Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that
the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the
time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the
opinion any of such counsel, at any such time to amend the Registration
Statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder, the Company will promptly prepare and file with the SEC,
subject to Section 5.1(c), such amendment or supplement as may be necessary
to correct such untrue statement or omission or to make the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus comply with such requirements.

(g) The Company will use its best efforts, in cooperation with the
selling holders or the underwriters or agents, as the case may be, to
qualify the Registered Securities for offering and sale under the
applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions as the
selling holders or the managing underwriter or agents, as the case may be,
may designate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be obligated
to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a
foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in
which it is not so qualified or to subject itself to taxation in respect of
doing business in any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject.
The Company will file such statements and reports as may be required by the
laws of each jurisdiction in which the Registered Securities have been
qualified as above provided.

(h) The Company will use its best efforts to effect the listing of
the Registered Securities covered by a Registration Statement not then
listed on each national securities exchange on which similar securities
issued by the Company are then listed or, if no such securities are then
listed, on any national securities exchange, if, in either case, so
requested by Whitehall for so long as it is a Holder or the
Representative(s), or if requested by the managing underwriter.

(i) The Company shall make such representations and warranties to the
selling holders and the underwriters or agents, if any, in form, substance
and scope as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in
underwritten public offerings.

<PAGE>

19

(j) On the effective date of the Registration Statement or, in the
case of an underwritten offering, on the date of delivery of the Registered
Securities sold pursuant thereto, the Company shall cause to be delivered
to the selling holders and the underwriters or agents, if any, opinions of
counsel for the Company with respect to, among other things, the due
incorporation and good standing of the Company; the qualification of the
Company to transact business as foreign corporation; the due authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement; the due authorization, execution,
authentication and issuance, and the validity and enforceability, of the
Warrants and/or the Registerable Common Stock, as the case may be; the
absence of material legal or governmental proceedings involving the
Company; the absence of a breach by the Company of, or a default under,
agreements binding the Company; the absence of governmental approvals
required to be obtained in connection with the registration, offering and
sale of the Warrants and/or Registerable Common Stock, as the case may be;
the compliance as to form of the Registration Statement and any documents
incorporated by reference therein with the requirements of the Securities
Act; the effectiveness of such Registration Statement under the Securities
Act; and a statement that, as of the date of the opinion and of the
Registration Statement or most recent post-effective amendment thereto, as
the case may be, nothing has come to the attention of such counsel which
causes them to believe that either the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus included therein, as then amended or supplemented, or the
documents incorporate by reference therein (in the case of such documents,
in the light of the circumstances existing at the time that such documents
were filed with the Commission under the Exchange Act), contained an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading (it being understood that
such counsel need express no opinion as to the financial statements and
other financial data included therein or omitted therefrom).

In the event that any broker-dealer registered under the Exchange
Act shall be an "affiliate" of, or shall have a "conflict of interest"
with, the Company (each such term as defined in Schedule E to the By-Laws
of the National Association of Securities Dealers ("NASD")), and such
broker-dealer shall underwrite any Registerable Common Stock or participate
as a member of an underwriting syndicate or selling group or otherwise
"assist in the distribution" (within the meaning of the Rules of Fair
Practice and the By-Laws of the NASD) thereof, whether as a Holder or as an
underwriter, a placement or sales agent or a broker or dealer in respect of
such Registerable Common Stock or otherwise, the Company shall assist such
broker-dealer, in complying with the requirements of such Rules and By-
Laws, including, without limitation, by (1) if such Rules or By-Laws,
including Schedule E thereto, shall so require, engaging a "qualified
independent underwriter" (as defined in such Schedule) to participate in
the preparation of the registration statement relating to such Registerable
Common Stock, to exercise usual standards of due diligence in respect
thereto and, if any portion of the offering contemplated by the
Registration Statement

<PAGE>

20

is an underwritten offering or is made through a placement or sales agent,
to recommend the maximum public offering price of such Registerable Common
Stock, (2) paying the fees and expenses of any such qualified independent
underwriter and indemnifying the qualified independent underwriter to the
extent of the indemnification of underwriters provided in Section 5.4
hereof, and (3) providing to such broker-dealer such information concerning
the Company and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees and
securityholders as may be required in order for such broker-dealer to
comply with the requirements of Schedule E to the NASD By-laws and
Section 44 of the Rules of Fair Practice.

(k) Immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement or, in the case of an underwritten offering, at the time of
delivery of any Registered Securities sold pursuant thereto, the Company
shall cause to be delivered to the selling holders and the underwriters or
agents, if any, letters from the Company's independent public accountants
stating that such accountants are independent public accountants with
respect to the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the
applicable published rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and
otherwise in customary form and covering such financial and accounting
matters as are customarily covered by letters of the independent public
accountants delivered in connection with primary underwritten public
offerings.

(l) If the managing underwriter or agent so requests, the
underwriting or agency agreement shall set forth in full the provisions
hereof relating to covenants, registration expenses, lock-up agreements,
indemnification and contribution contained in Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4,
5.5, 5.8 and 5.9, with such changes therein as may be agreed to by the
managing underwriter or agent, the Company and the selling holders.

(m) The Company shall deliver such documents and certificates as may
be requested by any selling holder or the underwriters or agents, if any,
to evidence compliance with Section 5.1(i) and with any customary
conditions contained in the underwriting or agency agreement, if any.

(n) The Company will make available for inspection by representatives
of the selling holders and the underwriters or agents participating in such
offering, any attorney or accountant retained by such selling holders or
underwriters or agents and, with respect to any private placement of
Warrants or Underlying Common Stock, upon notice to the Company,
prospective purchasers, all financial and other records, pertinent
corporate documents and properties of the Company, and cause the Company's
officers, directors and employees to supply all information reasonably
requested by any such representative, underwriter or agent, attorney or
accountant in connection with the preparation of the Registration
Statement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any records, information or documents
that are designated by the Company in writing

<PAGE>

21

as confidential shall be kept confidential by each such person (by, among
other things, if so requested by the Company, entering into a
confidentiality agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the
Company) unless such records, information or documents become part of the
public domain through no fault of such person or unless disclosure thereof
is required by court or administrative order or the SEC (including the
federal securities law).

(o) The Company will make generally available to its security holders
as soon as practicable, but not later than 45 days after the close of the
period covered thereby (or 90 days if such period is a fiscal year), an
earnings statement of the Company (in form complying with the provisions of
Rule 158 under the rules and regulations of the SEC under the Securities
Act), covering a period of 12 months beginning after the effective date of
the Registration Statement but not later than the first day of the
Company's fiscal quarter next following such effective date.

(p) The Company will enter into such customary agreements, including
a customary underwriting or agency agreement with the underwriters or
agents, if any, and take all such other actions in connection with the
offering in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the
Registered Securities.

5.2. COVENANTS OF THE SELLING HOLDERS. (a) Each selling holder
shall use its best efforts to furnish to the Company such information regarding
the distribution of such Registered Securities as is customarily requested from
selling holders in underwritten public offerings.

(b) Each selling holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from
the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in
Section 5.1(a)(vi), such selling holder will forthwith discontinue the
disposition of its Registered Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement
until such selling holder's receipt of the copies of a supplemented or amended
Prospectus contemplated by Section 5.1(f), or until it is advised in writing by
the Company that the use of such Prospectus may be resumed. If the Company
shall give any such notice, the Company shall extend the period of time during
which the Company is required to keep the Registration Statement effective and
usable by the number of days during the period from the date of receipt of such
notice to the date when each selling holder of Registered Securities covered by
such Registration Statement either receives the copies of a supplemented or
amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 5.1(f) or is advised in writing by
the Company that the use of such Prospectus may be resumed.

(c) Each selling holder agrees to make customary representations and
warranties to the Company and the underwriters or agents, if any, in form,
substance and scope as are customarily made by selling holders in underwritten
public offerings, but no selling holders, as such, shall be required to make any
representation or warranty as to the

<PAGE>

22

accuracy or completeness of the Registration Statement (except as to written
information furnished to the Company by such selling holder expressly for use
therein).

(d) Each selling holder agrees to provide the Company, upon receipt
of its request, with such information about the selling holder to enable the
Company to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act and to execute
such certificates as the Company may reasonably request in connection with such
information and otherwise to satisfy any requirements of law.

5.3. REGISTRATION EXPENSES. (a) The Company will pay and bear all
costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement with respect to each registration pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.2,
including, without limitation:

(i) the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration
Statement (including financial statements and exhibits), as originally
filed and as amended, any preliminary prospectuses and the Prospectus and
any amendments or supplements thereto, and the cost of furnishing copies
thereof to the selling holders or the underwriters or agents, as the case
may be;

retained by the selling holders pursuant to Section 5.3(b);

(iv) the fees and disbursements of the underwriters or agents
customarily paid by issuers or sellers of securities and the reasonable

applicable securities laws in accordance with Section 5.1(g) and any filing
for review of the offering with the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc., including filing fees and fees and disbursements of counsel
for the selling holders and the underwriters or agents, as the case may be,
in connection therewith, in connection with any Blue Sky Survey and in
connection with any reserve share program; and

(vi) all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing, if
any, of any of the Registered Securities on any securities exchange
pursuant to Section 5.1(h).

<PAGE>

23

(b) In connection with the filing of each Registration Statement, the
Company will reimburse the selling holders for the reasonable fees and
disbursements of one firm of legal counsel, which shall be chosen by the
Representative(s) and shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

incident to the delivery of the Registered Securities to be sold by it,
including any stock transfer taxes payable upon the sale of such Registered
Securities to the purchaser thereof and any underwriting discounts or
commissions payable to underwriters or agents in connection therewith.

5.4. INDEMNIFICATION. (a) In connection with each registration
pursuant to Section 4.1 or 4.2, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each selling holder, each underwriter or agent participating in such
offering, and each person, if any, who controls any selling holder or any such
underwriter or agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act as
follows:

(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense
whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement
(or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom
of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading or arising out of an untrue statement of
a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged
omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading;

(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense
whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in
settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any
governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim
whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such
alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with
the written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld; and

(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred
(including fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the selling holders
and by the underwriters or agents), reasonably incurred in investigating,
preparing or defending against any litigation, or investigation or
proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or
any claim whatsoever based upon any such untrue

<PAGE>

24

statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue statement or omission, to
the extent that any such expense is not paid under subparagraph (i) or
(ii) above;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, with respect to any selling holder or any underwriter
or agent, this indemnity does not apply to any loss, liability, claim, damage or
expense to the extent arising out of an untrue statement or omission or alleged
untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Company by any such selling holder or
underwriter or agent, respectively, expressly for use in the Registration
Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any preliminary prospectus or the
Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).

(b) Each selling holder agrees severally, and not jointly, to
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who
signed a Registration Statement, each underwriter or agent participating in such
offering and the other selling holders, and each person, if any, who controls
the Company, any such underwriter or agent and any other selling holder within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any and all loss,
liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in
Section 5.4(a), as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or
omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration
Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any preliminary prospectus or the
Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such selling
holder expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment
thereto), or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto).

(c) The obligations of the Company under Section 5.4(a) and of the
selling holders under Section 5.4(b) to indemnify any underwriter or agent who
participates in an offering (or any person, if any, controlling such underwriter
or agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act) shall be
conditioned upon the underwriting or agency agreement with such underwriter or
agent containing an agreement by such underwriter or agent to indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed a
Registration Statement, and each selling holder, and each person, if any, who
controls the Company or any such selling holder within the meaning of Section 15
of the Securities Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and
expense described in the indemnity contained in Section 5.4(a), as incurred, but
only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue
statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment

<PAGE>

25

(d) Each indemnified party shall give prompt notice to each
indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which
indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying
party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability it may have
under this Agreement, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is
materially prejudiced thereby. If it so elects, after receipt of such notice,
an indemnifying party, jointly with any other indemnifying parties receiving
such notice, may assume the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it,
PROVIDED that the indemnified party shall be entitled to participate in the
defense of such action with counsel chosen by it, the fees and expenses of
which, subject to the next sentence, shall be paid by the indemnifying party.
In no event shall the indemnifying party or parties be liable for the fees and
expenses of more than one counsel for (i) the Company, its officer, directors
and controlling persons as a group, (ii) the selling holders and their
controlling persons as a group and (iii) the underwriters or agents and their
controlling persons as a group, in each case, in connection with any one action
or separate but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out
of the same general allegations or circumstances.

5.5. CONTRIBUTION. (a) In order to provide for just and equitable
contribution in circumstances under which the indemnity provided for in this
Section 5 is for any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified parties
although applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company, the selling
holders and the underwriters or agents shall contribute to the aggregate losses,
liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by such
indemnity incurred by the Company, the selling holders and one or more of the
underwriters or agents, as incurred, in such proportions that (i) the
underwriters or agents are responsible for that portion represented by the
percentage that the underwriting discounts and commissions for the offering
appearing on the cover page of the Prospectus (or, if not set forth on the cover
page, that are applicable to the offering) bear to the initial public offering
price appearing on the cover page (or, if not set forth on the cover page, that
are applicable to the offering) and (ii) each of the selling holders and the
Company is responsible for an equal portion of the balance.

(b) No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 5.5, each person, if any, who
controls an underwriter or agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such underwriter or
agent, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed
a Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or a
selling holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act shall have
the same rights to contribution as the Company or such selling holder, as the
case may be.

5.6. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES TO SURVIVE. The
indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 5 and the
representations and

<PAGE>

26

warranties of the Company referred to in Section 5.1(i) shall remain operative
and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any termination of any
underwriting or agency agreement, (ii) any investigation made by or on behalf of
the selling holders, the Company or any underwriter or agent or controlling
person or (iii) the consummation of the sale or successive resales of the
Registered Securities.

5.7. RULE 144. The Company covenants that it will continue to file
the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the rules
and regulations of the SEC thereunder and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder and it will take such further action as any
Holder of Registrable Common Stock may reasonably request, all to the extent
required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Registrable Common
Stock without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the
exemptions provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be
amended from time to time. Upon the request of any Holder of Registrable Common
Stock, the Company will deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether
it has complied with such requirements.

5.8. PARTICIPATION IN UNDERWRITTEN OFFERINGS. No Holder may
participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless:

(a) Such Holder executes a power of attorney appointing one or more
(up to three) attorneys (each, a "Representative") designated by the
selling holders proposing to sell a majority of the shares of Registrable
Common Stock proposed to be sold by all selling holders. Each such
Representative shall be authorized, on customary terms, to execute the
underwriting agreement on behalf of each selling holder and to otherwise
act for the selling holders in connection with the offering.

(b) Such Holder directly through its Representative, enters into an
underwriting agreement with the Company, the other selling holders, any
selling stockholders and the underwriters, which underwriting agreement
shall comply with the provisions of this Section 5.

(c) Such Holder executes all questionnaires and other documents
required by the underwriting agreement to be executed by such Holder.

5.9. LOCK-UP AGREEMENTS. (a) The Company agrees that it will not,
directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale of,
or otherwise dispose of, any Common Stock or securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock, other than any such sale or
distribution of Common Stock upon exercise of the Company's Warrants, in the
case of any registration pursuant to Section 4.1, for a period of 90 days from
the effective date of the Registration Statement pertaining to such Registrable
Common Stock.

<PAGE>

27

(b) Each Holder of Registrable Common Stock whose Registrable Common
Stock is covered by a Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 4.1 or
4.2 agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, grant
any option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of, any shares of Common Stock
or any Warrants or other securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for Common Stock, for a period of 90 days from the effective date of
the Registration Statement pertaining to such Registrable Common Stock.

(c) The lock-up agreements set forth in Sections 5.9(a) and 5.9(b)
shall be subject to customary exceptions that may be contained in an
underwriting agreement if any such registration involves an underwritten
offering.

6. ADJUSTMENTS.

6.1. ADJUSTMENTS UPON CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS. The Exercise Price and
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Warrant
shall be adjusted in case the Company shall (i) pay a dividend or make any other
distribution with respect to its Common Stock in shares of its capital stock,
(ii) subdivide its outstanding Common Stock, (iii) combine its outstanding
Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, or (iv) issue any shares of its
capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Stock (including any such
reclassification in connection with a merger, consolidation or other business
combination in which the Company is the continuing corporation). In such event,
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Warrant
immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution or the
effective date of such subdivision or combination shall be adjusted so that the
Holder of each Warrant shall thereafter be entitled to receive the kind and
number of shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company that such
Holder would have owned or have been entitled to receive after the happening of
any of the events described above, had such Warrant been exercised immediately
prior to the happening of such event or any record date with respect thereto.
In addition, upon an adjustment pursuant to this Section 6.1(a), the Exercise
Price for each share of Common Stock payable upon exercise of such Warrant shall
be adjusted (calculated to the nearest $.0001) so that it shall equal the price
determined by multiplying such Exercise Price immediately prior to such
adjustment by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares
issuable upon the exercise of each Warrant immediately prior to such adjustment,
and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares so issuable
immediately thereafter. Such adjustment shall become effective immediately
after the effective date of such event retroactive to the record date, if any,
for such event.

6.2. CONSENT OF WARRANT HOLDERS TO CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS. (a) Upon
any issuance of shares of Common Stock for consideration equal to or greater
than the "fair market value of Common Stock" (for purposes of this
Section 6.2(a), an "Issuance"), the

<PAGE>

28

Company shall issue to Holders of Warrants and holders of Stock Appreciation
Rights, on a pro rata basis, such additional Warrants and Stock Appreciation
Rights necessary in order that the aggregate percentage of Common Stock
represented by all outstanding Warrants and Warrants exchangeable for all
outstanding Stock Appreciation Rights shall not be diminished on account of such
Issuance. The Exercise Price for such Warrants and such additional Warrants
relating to the Stock Appreciation Rights shall equal the per share
consideration paid for the Common Stock issued.

(b) The Company shall not issue any shares of Common Stock for
consideration less than the "fair market value of Common Stock" (for purposes
of this Section 6.2(b), an "Issuance") without obtaining the prior approval of
such Issuance and of the Exercise Price of the additional Warrants and Stock
Appreciation Rights referred to in the last sentence of this Section 6.2(b) from
(i) for so long as GS and its Affiliates shall beneficially own Warrants and/or
Stock Appreciation Rights exercisable for at least 5% of the Common Stock then
outstanding on a "fully diluted basis", GS and (ii) Holders and holders of Stock
Appreciation Rights representing in the aggregate at least 75% of the Warrants
and Stock Appreciation Rights then outstanding. In the event such required
consent shall be obtained, the Company may make such approved Issuance; PROVIDED
that the Company shall simultaneously therewith issue to Holders and holders of
Stock Appreciation Rights, on a pro rata basis, such additional Warrants and
Stock Appreciation Rights, as the case may be, necessary in order that the
aggregate percentage of Common Stock represented by all outstanding Warrants and
Warrants issuable upon exchange of all outstanding Stock Appreciation Rights
shall not be diminished on account of such Issuance. The Exercise Price of any
Warrants and such additional Warrants relating to the Stock Appreciation Rights
issued pursuant to this Section 6.2(b) shall equal the per share consideration
paid for the Common Stock issued in the Issuance less any amount necessary to
compensate Holders thereof for the dilutive effect of such Issuance.

(c) The Company shall not issue any securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock ("Common Securities")
(for purposes of this Section 6.2(c), an "Issuance") without obtaining the prior
approval of such Issuance and of the Exercise Price of the additional Warrants
and Stock Appreciation Rights referred to in the last sentence of this
Section 6.2(c) from (i) for so long as GS and its Affiliates shall beneficially
own Warrants and/or Stock Appreciation Rights exercisable for at least 5% of the
Common Stock then outstanding on a fully diluted basis, GS, and (ii) Holders
and holders of Stock Appreciation Rights representing in the aggregate at least
75% of the Warrants and Stock Appreciation Rights then outstanding. In the
event such required consent shall be obtained, the Company may make such
approved Issuance; PROVIDED that the Company shall simultaneously therewith
issue to Holders and holders of Stock Appreciation Rights, on a pro rata basis,
such additional Warrants and Stock Appreciation Rights, as the case may be,
necessary in order that the aggregate percentage of Common Stock represented by
all outstanding Warrants and Warrants issuable upon exchange of all outstanding
Stock

Appreciation Rights shall not be diminished on account of such Issuance. The
Exercise Price for the Warrants and Stock Appreciation Rights issued pursuant to
this Section 6.2(c) shall be the consideration approved by the requisite Holders
of Warrants and holders of Stock Appreciation Rights in accordance with the
first sentence of this Section 6.2(c).

(d) For so long as any Warrant or Stock Appreciation Right shall be
issued and outstanding, the Company shall not issue any preferred stock or
create any additional series of common stock of the Company.

(e) For purposes of this Section 6.2, "on a fully diluted basis"
shall mean the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding, assuming (i)
that all Stock Appreciation Rights then outstanding can be and have been
exchanged for Warrants and such number of Warrants in addition to all Warrants
then outstanding have been exercised for Common Stock and (ii) no conversion of
Convertible Debentures for Common Stock.

(f) For purposes of this Section 6.2, "fair market value of Common
Stock" shall mean:

(i) if the Common Stock is registered under the Exchange Act,
deemed to be the average of the daily market prices of the Common Stock for
the 90 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the day as of which
"fair market value" is being determined or, if the Common Stock has been
registered under the Exchange Act for less than 90 consecutive trading days
before such date, then the average of the daily market prices for all of
the trading days before such date for which daily market prices are
available. The market price for each such trading day shall be: (A) in
the case of the Common Stock listed or admitted to trading on any
securities exchange, the closing price, regular way, on such day, or if no
sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked
prices on such day, (B) in the case the Common Stock not then listed or
admitted to trading on any securities exchange, the last reported sale
price on such day, or if no sale takes place on such day, the average of
the closing bid and asked prices on such day, as reported by a reputable
quotation source designated by the Company, (C) in the case the Common
Stock not then listed or admitted to trading on any securities exchange and
as to which no such reported sale price or bid and asked prices are
available, the average of the reported high bid and low asked prices on
such day, as reported by a reputable quotation service, or a newspaper of
general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New
York, customarily published on each business day, designated by the
Company, or if there shall be no bid and asked prices on such day, the
average of the high bid and low asked prices, as so reported, on the most
recent day (not more than 90 days prior to the date in question) for which
prices have been so reported, and (D) if there are no bid and asked prices
reported during the 90 days prior to the date in question, the of the
Common Stock shall be determined by an

<PAGE>

Independent Financial Expert using one or more valuation methods that the
Independent Financial Expert, in its best professional judgment, determines
to be most appropriate, giving effect to any discount attributable to any
lack of liquidity of the Common Stock.

(ii) if the Common Stock is not registered under the Exchange
Act, the "fair market value of Common Stock" shall be determined by an
Independent Financial Expert using one or more valuation methods that the
Independent Financial Expert, in its best professional judgment, determines
to be most appropriate, assuming such Common Stock is to be sold in an
arm's length transaction and there was no compulsion on the part of any
party to such sale to buy or sell and taking into account all relevant
factors.

6.3. ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK FOR NONCASH CONSIDERATION. In case the
Company shall issue and sell shares of Common Stock or rights, options, warrants
or convertible or exchangeable securities containing the right to subscribe for
or purchase shares of Common Stock for a consideration consisting, in whole or
in part, of property other than cash or its equivalent, then in determining the
"fair market value of Common Stock" for purposes of the first sentence of
Section 6.2(a) or (b), the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine, in
good faith, the fair value of such property. In case the Company shall issue
and sell rights, options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities
containing the right to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock,
together with one or more other securities as part of a unit at a price per
unit, then in determining the "fair market value of Common Stock" for purposes
of the first sentence of Section 6.2(a) or (b), the Board of Directors of the
Company shall determine, in good faith, the fair value of the rights, options,
warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities then being sold as part of
such unit.

6.4. DISTRIBUTIONS OF DEBT, ASSETS, SUBSCRIPTION RIGHTS OR
CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES: In case the Company shall fix a record date for the
making of a distribution to all holders of shares of its Common Stock of
evidence of Indebtness of the Company, assets (other than cash dividends) or
securities (excluding those referred to in Sections 6.2(a), 6.1(b) and 6.1(c))
(any such evidences of Indebtness, assets or securities, the "assets or
securities"), then in each case the Holders, upon the exercise of the Warrants,
shall be entitled to receive in addition to the shares of Common Stock, (i) the
assets or securities to which such Holder would have been entitled as a holder
of Common Stock if such Holder had exercised its Warrants immediately prior to
the record date for such distribution and (ii) any income earned on the assets
or securities distributed from the distribution date to the date of exercise or
repurchase, as the case may be, less the Exercise Price then in effect. At the
time of any such distribution, the Company shall either (a) deposit the assets
or securities payable to Holders pursuant hereto in trust for the Holders with
an "eligible institution" with instructions as to the investment of such
property and any proceeds therefrom so as to protect

<PAGE>

31

the value of such property for the Holders or (B) distribute to the Holders the
assets or securities to which they would be entitled upon exercise or
repurchase, as the case may be, and, upon any such distribution pursuant to this
Clause (b), the provisions of this Section 6.4 shall no longer apply to such
event. Such election shall be made by the Company giving written notice thereof
to the Holders.

For purposes of this Section 6.4, the term "eligible institution"
shall mean a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the
United States of America or of any state thereof, authorized under such laws to
exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at
least $50,000,000, and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or state
authority.

6.5. CERTAIN ISSUES EXCEPTED. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, the Company shall not be required to (i) make any adjustment of
the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon exercise of each Warrant
or of the Exercise Price or (ii) obtain a consent or issue additional Warrants
or Stock Appreciation Rights pursuant to Section 6.2, in either case with
respect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock (A) pursuant to options,
warrants or rights under employee benefit plans currently in effect or hereafter
adopted by the Company to the extent that the aggregate number of shares so
issued after the date hereof does not exceed 500,000 shares of Common Stock
(subject to adjustment on substantially the same terms as the number of shares
of Common Stock would be adjusted hereunder) as well as the grant or issuance of
any option, warrant or rights in connection therewith and (B) upon conversion of
the Convertible Debentures.

6.6. NOTICE OF ADJUSTMENT. Whenever the number of shares of Common
Stock or other stock or property issuable upon the exercise of each Warrant or
the Exercise Price is adjusted, as herein provided, the Company shall cause the
Warrant Agent promptly to mail by first class mail, postage prepaid, to each
Holder notice of such adjustment or adjustments and shall deliver to the Warrant
Agent a certificate of a firm of independent public accountants selected by the
Board of Directors of the Company (who may be the regular accountants employed
by the Company) setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock or other
stock or property issuable upon the exercise of each Warrant and the Exercise
Price after such adjustment, setting forth a brief statement of the facts
requiring such adjustment and setting forth the computation by which such
adjustment was made. The Warrant Agent shall be entitled to rely on such
certificate and shall be under no duty or responsibility with respect to any
such certificate, except to exhibit the same from time to time, to any Holder
desiring an inspection thereof during reasonable business hours. The Warrant
Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Holders
to determine whether any facts exist that may require any adjustment of the
Exercise Price or the number of shares of Common Stock or other stock or
property issuable on exercise of the Warrants, or with respect to the nature or
extent of any such adjustment when made, or with

<PAGE>

32

respect to the method employed in making such adjustment or the validity or
value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock or other stock or
property which may be issuable on exercise of the Warrants. The Warrant Agent
shall not be responsible for any failure of the Company to make any cash payment
or to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock
certificates or other common stock or properties upon the exercise of any
Warrant.

6.7. STATEMENT ON WARRANTS. Irrespective of any adjustment in the
Exercise Price or the number or kind of shares issuable upon the exercise of the
Warrants, Warrants theretofore or thereafter issued may continue to express the
same price and number and kind of shares as are stated in the Warrants initially
issuable pursuant to this Agreement.

6.8. FRACTIONAL INTERESTS. The Company shall not be required to
issue fractional shares of Common Stock on the exercise of Warrants. If more
than one Warrant shall be presented for exercise in full at the same time by the
same Holder, the number of full shares of Common Stock which shall be issuable
upon such exercise thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock acquirable on exercise of the Warrants so
presented. If any fraction of a share of Common Stock would, except for the
provisions of this Section be issuable on the exercise of any Warrant (or
specified portion thereof), the Company shall pay an amount in cash calculated
by it to be equal to the then Current Market Value per share of Common Stock
multiplied by such fraction computed to the nearest whole cent.

7. WARRANT TRANSFER BOOKS.

The Warrant Certificates shall be issued in registered form only. The
Company shall cause to be kept at the office of the Warrant Agent a register in
which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company
shall provide for the registration of Warrant Certificates and of transfers or
exchanges of Warrant Certificates as herein provided.

At the option of the Holder, Warrant Certificates may be exchanged at
such office, and upon payment of the charges hereinafter provided. Whenever any
Warrant Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute,
and the Warrant Agent shall countersign and deliver, the Warrant Certificates
that the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

All Warrant Certificates issued upon any registration of transfer or
exchange of Warrant Certificates shall be the valid obligations of the Company,
evidencing the same obligations, and entitled to the same benefits under this
Agreement, as the Warrant Certificates surrendered for such registration of
transfer or exchange.

<PAGE>

33

Every Warrant Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Warrant Agent) be duly
endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Warrant Agent, duly executed by the Holder
thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.

No service charge shall be made to a Holder for any registration of
transfer or exchange of Warrant Certificates. The Company may require payment
of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Warrant
Certificates.

Any Warrant Certificate when duly endorsed in blank shall be deemed
negotiable and when a Warrant Certificate shall have been so endorsed, the
Holder thereof may be treated by the Company, the Warrant Agent and all other
persons dealing therewith as the absolute owner thereof for any purpose and as
the Person entitled to exercise the rights represented thereby, or to the
transfer thereof on the register of the Company maintained by the Warrant Agent,
any notice to the contrary notwithstanding; but until such transfer on such
register, the Company and the Warrant Agent may treat the registered Holder
thereof as the owner for all purposes.

8. WARRANT HOLDERS.

8.1. NO VOTING RIGHTS. Except as provided below, prior to the
exercise of the Warrants, no Holder of a Warrant Certificate, as such, shall be
entitled to any rights of a stockholder of the Company, including, without
limitation, the right to vote, to consent, to exercise any preemptive right, to
receive any notice of meetings of stockholders for the election of directors of
the Company or any other matter or to receive any notice of any proceedings of
the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Holders of Warrants that are
exercisable pursuant to Section 3.2 will be entitled to receive at the addresses
shown in the register of the Company maintained by the Warrant Agent notice of
all meetings of stockholders of the Company and the Company will submit any item
that may be submitted to stockholders for consideration (other than elections of
directors, ratifications of appointments of auditors or amendments to Article
Ninth of the Certificate of Incorporation) to such Holders prior to submission
to stockholders for purposes of determining the number of Warrants that would
have approved of such action had such Holders and holders of Stock Appreciation
Rights been entitled to vote on such matters. In order to make such a
determination, the Holders shall appoint a representative (who may be the same
Person appointed by the holders of Stock Appreciation Rights pursuant to the
Stock Appreciation Rights Agreement) who shall poll the Holders and the holders
of the Stock Appreciation Rights in respect of any such action within five
Business Days of the date of receipt of the notice from the Company as to any
such action. If no response is given by such

<PAGE>

34

representative to the Company prior to the expiration of such period, all of the
Holders shall be deemed to have consented to the proposed action.

8.2. RIGHT OF ACTION. All rights of action in respect of this
Agreement are vested in the Holders of the Warrants, and any Holder of any
Warrant, without the consent of the Warrant Agent or the Holder of any other
Warrant, may, on such Holder's own behalf and for such Holder's own benefit,
enforce, and may institute and maintain any suit, action or proceeding against
the Company suitable to enforce, or otherwise in respect of, such Holder's right
to exercise or exchange such Holder's Warrants in the manner provided in this
Agreement.

9. WARRANT AGENT.

9.1. NATURE OF DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES ASSUMED. The Company
hereby appoints the Warrant Agent to act as agent of the Company as set forth in
this Agreement. The Warrant Agent hereby accepts such appointment as agent of
the Company and agrees to perform that agency upon the terms and conditions
herein set forth, by all of which the Company and the Holders of Warrants, by
their acceptance thereof, shall be bound. The Warrant Agent shall not by
countersigning Warrant Certificates or by any other act hereunder be deemed to
make any representations as to validity or authorization of the Warrants or the
Warrant Certificates (except as to its countersignature thereon) or of any
securities or other property delivered upon exercise or tender of any Warrant,
or as to the accuracy of the computation of the Exercise Price or the number or
kind or amount of stock or other securities or other property deliverable upon
exercise of any Warrant, the independence of any Independent Financial Expert or
the correctness of the representations of the Company made in such certificates
that the Warrant Agent receives. The Warrant Agent shall not have any duty to
calculate or determine any adjustments with respect either to the Exercise
Price, the kind and amount of shares or other securities or any property
receivable by Holders upon the exercise or tender of Warrants required from time
to time or the distributions on the Warrants pursuant to Section 11.3, and the
Warrant Agent shall have no duty or responsibility in determining the accuracy
or correctness of such calculation. The Warrant Agent shall not (a) be liable
for any recital or statement of fact contained herein or in the Warrant
Certificates or for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith on
the belief that any Warrant Certificate or any other documents or any signatures
are genuine or properly authorized, (b) be responsible for any failure on the
part of the Company to comply with any of its covenants and obligations
contained in this Agreement or in the Warrant Certificates, or (c) be liable for
any act or omission in connection with this Agreement except for its own
negligence or willful misconduct. The Warrant Agent is hereby authorized to
accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder from
the President, any Vice President or the Secretary of the Company and to apply
to any such officer for instructions (which instructions will be promptly given
in

<PAGE>

35

writing when requested) and the Warrant Agent shall not be liable for any action
taken or suffered to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the
instructions of any such officer, but in its discretion the Warrant Agent may in
lieu thereof accept other evidence of such or may require such further or
additional evidence as it may deem reasonable.

The Warrant Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights and
powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself or by or
through its attorneys, agents or employees, provided reasonable care has been
exercised in the selection and in the continued employment of any such attorney,
agent or employee. The Warrant Agent shall not be under any obligation or duty
to institute, appear in or defend any action, suit or legal proceeding in
respect hereof, unless first indemnified to its satisfaction, but this provision
shall not affect the power of the Warrant Agent to take such action as the
Warrant Agent may consider proper, whether with or without such indemnity. The
Warrant Agent shall promptly notify the Company in writing of any claim made or
action, suit or proceeding instituted against it arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement.

The Company will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to
be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further acts,
instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Warrant Agent in
order to enable it to carry out or perform its duties under this Agreement.

The Warrant Agent shall act solely as agent of the Company hereunder.
The Warrant Agent shall not be liable except for the failure to perform such
duties as are specifically set forth herein, and no implied covenants or
obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Warrant Agent, whose
duties and obligations shall be determined solely by the express provisions
hereof.

9.2. RIGHT TO CONSULT COUNSEL. The Warrant Agent may at any time
consult with competent legal counsel, and the Warrant Agent shall incur no
liability or responsibility to the Company or to any Holder for any action
taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith in accordance with the opinion or
advice of such counsel.

9.3. COMPENSATION AND REIMBURSEMENT. The Company agrees to pay to
the Warrant Agent from time to time compensation for all services rendered by it
hereunder as the Company and the Warrant Agent may agree from time to time, and
to reimburse the Warrant Agent for reasonable expenses and disbursements
incurred in connection with the execution and administration of this Agreement
(including the reasonable compensation and the expenses of its counsel), and
further agrees to indemnify the Warrant Agent for, and to hold it harmless
against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith
on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance and
administration of this Agreement, including the costs and expenses of defending
itself against any claim or liability in connection with the exercise or
performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder.

<PAGE>

36

9.4. WARRANT AGENT MAY HOLD COMPANY SECURITIES. The Warrant Agent
and any stockholder, director, officer or employee of the Warrant Agent may buy,
sell or deal in any of the Warrants or other securities of the Company or its
Affiliates or become pecuniarily interested in transactions in which the Company
or its Affiliates may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the
Company or its Affiliates or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were
not the Warrant Agent under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the
Warrant Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other
legal entity.

9.5. RESIGNATION AND REMOVAL; APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR. (a) No
resignation or removal of the Warrant Agent and no appointment of a successor
warrant agent shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor warrant agent as provided herein. The Warrant Agent may resign its
duties and be discharged from all further duties and liability hereunder (except
liability arising as a result of the Warrant Agent's own negligence or willful
misconduct) after giving written notice to the Company. The Company may remove
the Warrant Agent upon written notice, and the Warrant Agent shall thereupon in
like manner be discharged from all further duties and liabilities hereunder,
except as aforesaid. The Warrant Agent shall, at the Company's expense, cause
to be mailed (by first-class mail, postage prepaid) to each Holder of a Warrant
at his last address as shown on the register of the Company maintained by the
Warrant Agent a copy of said notice of resignation or notice of removal, as the
case may be. Upon such resignation or removal, the Company shall appoint in
writing a new warrant agent. If the Company shall fail to make such appointment
within a period of 20 days after it has been notified in writing of such
resignation by the resigning Warrant Agent or after such removal, then the
Holder of any Warrant may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a new warrant agent. Any new warrant agent, whether appointed by
the Company or by such a court, shall be a corporation doing business under the
laws of the United States or any state thereof, in good standing and having a
combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000. The combined capital
and surplus of any such new warrant agent shall be deemed to be the combined
capital and surplus as set forth in the most recent annual report of its
condition published by such warrant agent prior to its appointment, provided
that such reports are published at least annually pursuant to law or to the
requirements of a Federal or state supervising or examining authority. After
acceptance in writing of such appointment by the new warrant agent, it shall be
vested with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had
been originally named herein as the Warrant Agent, without any further
assurance, conveyance, act or deed; but if for any reason it shall be necessary
or expedient to execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance, act or
deed, the same shall be done at the expense of the Company and shall be legally
and validly executed and delivered by the resigning or removed Warrant Agent.
Not later than the effective date of any such appointment, the Company shall
give notice thereof to the resigning or removed Warrant Agent. Failure to give
any notice provided for in this Section, however, or any

<PAGE>

37

defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation of
the Warrant Agent or the appointment of a new warrant agent, as the case may be.

(b) Any corporation into which the Warrant Agent or any new warrant
agent may be merged or any corporation resulting from any consolidation to which
the Warrant Agent or any new warrant agent shall be a party, shall be a
successor Warrant Agent under this Agreement without any further act, provided
that such corporation would be eligible for appointment as successor to the
Warrant Agent under the provisions of Section 9.5(a). Any such successor
Warrant Agent shall promptly cause notice of its succession as Warrant Agent to
be mailed (by first-class mail, postage prepaid) to each Holder of a Warrant at
such Holder's last address as shown on the register of the Company maintained by
the Warrant Agent.

10. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

The Company hereby represents and warrants that, as of the Closing
Date:

10.1. EXISTENCE, POWER AND OWNERSHIP. (a) It is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in each other

certificate of incorporation and all material governmental licenses,
authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its business as now
conducted.

(b) It is subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust (a
"REIT") under Subchapter M of the Code and has satisfied all requirements to
continue to qualify as a REIT. It is not aware of any fact or circumstance that
could reasonably be expected to prevent it from continuing to so qualify in the
future.

10.2. AUTHORIZATION. It has the corporate power and authority to
enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations under, and consummate
the transactions contemplated by, this Agreement and has by proper action duly
authorized the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

(i) violate or conflict with any provision of its certificate of Incorporation
or By-laws; (ii) violate any law, regulation (including without limitation
Regulation G, T, U or X), order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree or permit
applicable to it; (iii) violate or materially conflict with any

<PAGE>

38

contractual provisions of, or cause an event of default under, any indenture,
loan agreement, mortgage, deed of trust, contract or other agreement or
instrument to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties may be
bound; or (iv) result in or require the creation of any lien, security interest
or other charge or encumbrance (other than those contemplated in or in

10.4. CONSENTS. No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or
filing, registration or qualification with, any court or governmental authority
or other Person is required in connection with the execution, delivery or

10.5. ENFORCEABLE OBLIGATIONS. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Company and constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms subject, as
to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,

creditors' rights and to general equity principles.

10.6. CAPITALIZATION. As of the date hereof, the Company's
authorized capital stock consists of 150,000,000 shares of Common Stock and
38,260,704 shares of Common Stock were issued and outstanding. As of the date
hereof, no shares of Common Stock are held in treasury and no shares of Common
Stock are reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding employee stock
options. The Common Stock constitutes all of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of the Company. There are no other classes of capital stock of the
Company authorized or outstanding. The Common Stock is duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Except for the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (as defined in the Loan
Agreement) and except in respect of the Company's Dividend Reinvestment Plan and
the indenture relating to the Convertible Debentures, there are no preemptive or
other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights or agreements or
commitments of any character relating to the Company's authorized and issued,
unissued or treasury shares of capital stock, and the Company has not issued any
debt securities, other securities, rights or obligations that are currently
outstanding and convertible into or exchangeable for, or giving any Person a
right to subscribe for or acquire, capital stock of the Company.

10.7. PERCENTAGE INTERESTS. The Stock Appreciation Rights and
Warrants issued and outstanding on the date hereof, assuming, with respect to
Stock Appreciation Rights, the exchange thereof for Warrants and, with respect
to Warrants, the exercise thereof for Common Stock, and assuming no conversion
of Convertible Debentures, represent in the aggregate 19.9% of the issued and
outstanding Common Stock on a fully diluted basis (I.E., taking into account the
Warrants and Stock Appreciation Rights but not including the Convertible
Debentures).

<PAGE>

11. COVENANTS.

11.1. RESERVATION OF COMMON STOCK FOR ISSUANCE ON EXERCISE OF
WARRANTS. The Company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep
available, free from pre-emptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued
Common Stock, solely for the purpose of issue upon exercise of Warrants as
herein provided, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall then be issuable
upon the exercise of all Warrants issuable hereunder. The Company covenants
that all shares of Common Stock which shall be so issuable shall, upon such
issue, be duly and validly issued and fully paid and non-assessable.

11.2. NOTICE OF DIVIDENDS. At any time when the Company declares any
dividend on its Common Stock, it shall give notice to the Holders of all the
then outstanding Warrants of any such declaration not less than 15 days prior to
the related record date for payment of the dividend so declared.

11.3. DISTRIBUTIONS ON WARRANTS. Each Holder will be entitled to an
annual distribution per Warrant payable on January 15 of each year commencing on
January 15, 1996 with respect to the prior calendar year equal to the positive
difference, if any, between the aggregate amount of dividends paid per share of
Common Stock during such prior calendar year and (i) with respect to years
ending on or before December 31, 2000, $0.60 or (ii) thereafter, the product of
the Exercise Price per Warrant then in effect multiplied by LIBOR in effect on
the preceding December 31 plus 1%; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, to the extent the number
of shares of Common Stock for which a Warrant is exercisable is adjusted
pursuant to Section 6.1, there shall be a corresponding adjustment to the amount
in clause (i) above.

11.4. RESTRICTION ON THE COMPANY'S INCURRENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS. The
Company covenants that it will not contract, create, incur, assume or permit to
exist any Indebtedness, except:

(i) Indebtedness arising under the Loan Agreement and the other Loan
Documents (as defined in the Loan Agreement);

(ii) Current liabilities for taxes and assessments incurred or
arising in the ordinary course of business;

acceptance of any Warrant Certificate.

12. MISCELLANEOUS.

12.1. MONEY AND OTHER PROPERTY DEPOSITED WITH THE WARRANT AGENT. Any
moneys, securities or other property which at any time shall be deposited by the
Company or on its behalf with the Warrant Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall
be and are hereby assigned, transferred and set over to the Warrant Agent in
trust for the purpose for which such moneys, securities or other property shall
have been deposited; but such moneys, securities or other property need not be
segregated from other funds, securities or other property except to the extent
required by law. The Warrant Agent shall distribute any money deposited with it
for payment and distribution to the Holders by mailing by first-class mail a
check in such amount as is appropriate, to each such Holder at the address shown
on the Warrant register of the Company, or as it may be otherwise directed in
writing by such Holder, upon surrender of such Holder's Warrants or shares of
Registrable Common Stock, as the case may be. Any money deposited with the
Warrant Agent for payment and distribution to the Holders that remains unclaimed
for two years after the date the money was deposited with the Warrant Agent
shall be paid to the Company upon its request therefor.

<PAGE>

41

12.2. PAYMENT OF TAXES. The Company shall pay all transfer, stamp
and other similar taxes that may be imposed in respect of the issuance or
delivery of the Warrants or in respect of the issuance or delivery by the
Company of any securities upon exercise of the Warrants with respect thereto.
The Company shall not be required, however, to pay any tax or other charge
imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue of any certificate
for shares of Common Stock or other securities underlying the Warrants or
payment of cash to any Person other than the Holder of a Warrant Certificate
surrendered upon the exercise or purchase of a Warrant, and in case of such
transfer or payment, the Warrant Agent and the Company shall not be required to
issue any stock certificate or pay any cash until such tax or charge has been
paid or it has been established to the Warrant Agent's and the Company's
satisfaction that no such tax or other charge is due.

12.3. SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES. Any Warrant Certificate surrendered
for exercise or purchase shall, if surrendered to the Company, be delivered to
the Warrant Agent, and all Warrant Certificates surrendered or so delivered to
the Warrant Agent shall be promptly cancelled by the Warrant Agent and shall not
be reissued by the Company. The Warrant Agent shall destroy such cancelled
Warrant Certificates and deliver its certificate of destruction to the Company
unless the Company shall otherwise direct.

12.4. MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST AND STOLEN WARRANT CERTIFICATES. If
(a) any mutilated Warrant Certificate is surrendered to the Warrant Agent or
(b) the Company and the Warrant Agent receive evidence to their satisfaction of
the destruction, loss or theft of any Warrant Certificate, and there is
delivered to the Company and the Warrant Agent such security or indemnity as may
be required by them to save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of
notice to the Company or the Warrant Agent that such Warrant Certificate has
been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its
written request the Warrant Agent shall countersign and deliver, in exchange for
any such mutilated Warrant Certificate or in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or
stolen Warrant Certificate, a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor and for a
like aggregate number of Warrants.

Upon the issuance of any new Warrant Certificate under this
Section 12.4, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and
other expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the Warrant Agent
and of counsel to the Company) in connection therewith.

Every new Warrant Certificate executed and delivered pursuant to this
Section 12.4 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Warrant Certificate shall
constitute an original contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the
destroyed, lost or stolen Warrant Certificate shall be at any time enforceable
by anyone, and shall be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement equally and
proportionately with any and all other Warrant Certificates duly executed and
delivered hereunder.

<PAGE>

42

The provisions of this Section 12.4 are exclusive and shall preclude
(to the extent lawful) all other rights or remedies with respect to the
replacement of mutilated, destroyed, lost, stolen or Warrant Certificates.

12.5. REMOVAL OF LEGENDS. Holder may surrender its Warrant
Certificates or certificates evidencing underlying Common Stock to the Warrant
Agent who, upon the direction of the Company, shall exchange such certificates
for certificates without the legends referred to in Sections 2.1, 3.5(d) and/or
3.5(e); PROVIDED THAT the Certificate of Incorporation no longer requires such
legend and/or the Company is reasonably satisfied that the Warrants or
Underlying Common Stock, as the case may be, represented by such certificates
are freely transferable under the Securities Act, as the case may be.

12.6. NOTICES. (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.5(b),
any notice, demand or delivery authorized by this Agreement shall be

prepaid, addressed to any Holder of a Warrant at such Holder's address shown on

irrevocably authorizes the Warrant Agent, in the name and at the expense of the

This Warrant Certificate is issued under and in accordance with the

<PAGE>

A-2

hereby incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. Reference is
hereby made to the Warrant Agreement for a full statement of the respective
rights, limitations of rights, duties, obligations and immunities thereunder of
the Company, the Warrant Agent and the Holders of the Warrants.

This Warrant Certificate shall terminate and be void as of the close
of business on the earlier of (i) March 31, 1995 in the event the lenders (the
"Lenders") under the Loan Agreement dated as of December 18, 1994 (the "Loan

as agent for the Lenders, fail to fund thereunder even though all of the
conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.01 thereof have been satisfied and
(ii) December 31, 2007 (such earlier date being referred to as the "Expiration
Date").

As provided in the Warrant Agreement and subject to the terms and

By acceptance of this Warrant Certificate, the Holder hereof
acknowledges that it understands the limitation on ownership of Common Stock set

as amended, and agrees not to acquire Warrants or Common Stock in an aggregate
amount that would violate such limitation.

may be imposed in respect of the issuance or delivery of the Warrants or in
respect of the issuance or delivery by the Company of any securities upon
exercise of the Warrants. The Company shall not be required, however, to pay
any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the
issue of any certificate for shares of Common Stock or other securities
underlying the Warrants or payment of cash to any Person other than the Holder
of a Warrant Certificate surrendered upon the exercise or purchase of a Warrant,
and in case of such transfer or payment, the Warrant Agent and the Company shall
not be required to issue any stock certificate or pay any cash until such tax or
other charge has been paid or it has been established to the Company's
satisfaction that no such tax or other charge is due.

the registered holder hereof, in whole or in part, on the register of the
Company, upon surrender of this Warrant Certificate for registration of transfer

New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer
in form satisfactory to the Company and the Warrant Agent duly executed by, the
Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, with signature
guaranteed as specified in the attached Form of Assignment. Upon any partial
transfer, the Company will issue and deliver to such holder a new Warrant
Certificate or Certificates with respect to any portion not so transferred.

transfer or exchange of the Warrant Certificates, but the Company may require
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge
payable in connection therewith.

Each taker and holder of this Warrant Certificate by taking or holding
the same, consents and agrees that this Warrant Certificate when duly endorsed
in blank shall be deemed negotiable and that when this Warrant Certificate shall
have been so endorsed, the holder hereof may be treated by the Company, the

2. ORIGINAL ISSUE OF SARS.

2.1. FORM OF SAR CERTIFICATES. The SAR Certificates shall be in
registered form only and substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A,
shall be dated the date on which countersigned by the SAR Agent and may have
such legends and endorsements typed, stamped, printed, lithographed or engraved
thereon as provided in Section 4.5(f) and as required by the Certificate of
Incorporation or as may be required to comply with any law or with any rule or
regulation pursuant thereto or with any rule or regulation of any securities
exchange on which the SARs may be listed.

Pending the preparation of definitive SAR Certificates, temporary SAR
Certificates may be issued, which may be printed, lithographed, typewritten,
mimeographed or otherwise produced, which will be substantially of the tenor of
the definitive SAR Certificates in lieu of which they are issued and which are
not required to be countersigned by the SAR Agent.

If temporary SAR Certificates are issued, the Company will cause
definitive SAR Certificates to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After
the preparation of definitive SAR Certificates, the temporary SAR Certificates
shall be exchangeable for definitive SAR Certificates upon surrender of the
temporary SAR Certificates to the SAR Agent, without charge to the Holder. Until
so exchanged the temporary SAR Certificates shall in all respects be entitled to
the same benefits under this Agreement as definitive SAR Certificates.

2.2. EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF SAR CERTIFICATES. Simultaneously with
the execution of this Agreement, SAR Certificates evidencing up to 5,348,541
SARs shall be executed by the Company and delivered to the SAR Agent for
countersignature, and the SAR Agent shall thereupon countersign and deliver such
SAR Certificates to Whitehall. The SAR Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized
to countersign and deliver SAR Certificates as required by this Section 2.2 or
by Section 7, 11.4 or 11.5. The SAR Certificates shall be executed on behalf
of the Company by its President or Vice President, either manually or by
facsimile signature printed thereon. The SAR Certificates shall be manually

countersigned. In case any officer of the Company whose signature shall have
been placed upon any of the SAR Certificates shall cease to be such officer of
the Company before countersignature by the SAR Agent and issue and delivery
thereof, such SAR Certificates may, nevertheless, be countersigned by the SAR
Agent and issued and delivered with the same force and effect as though such
person had not ceased to be such officer of the Company.

3. DISTRIBUTIONS ON SARS.

Each Holder will be entitled to an annual distribution for each SAR
payable on January 15 of each year commencing on January 15, 1996 with respect
to the prior calendar year equal to the positive difference, if any, between the
aggregate amount of dividends paid per share of Common Stock during such prior
calendar year and (i) with respect to years ending on or before December 31,
2000, $0.60 or (ii) thereafter, the product of the exercise price per share of
Common Stock then in effect under the Warrant Agreement multiplied by LIBOR in
effect on the preceding December 31 plus 1%; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the
event of an adjustment of the type described in Section 6.1 of the Warrant
Agreement, an equivalent adjustment to the per share amount in (i) above shall
be made in accordance with such adjustment described in such Section 6.1.

At any time when the Company declares any dividend on its Common
Stock, it shall give notice to the Holders of all the SARs then outstanding of
any such declaration not less than 15 days prior to the related record date for
payment of the dividend so declared.

4. EXERCISE; EXCHANGE AND EXPIRATION OF SARS.

4.1. EXERCISE OF SARS FOR 14% DEBENTURES; EXERCISE PRICE. (a) Each
SAR Certificate shall, when countersigned by the SAR Agent, entitle the Holder
thereof, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, to acquire a principal
amount of 14% Debentures equal to the product of (A) (i) the average of the
daily market prices of the Common Stock for the 30 consecutive trading days
immediately preceding the date of exercise minus the exercise price per share of
Common Stock then in effect under the Warrant Agreement times (B) the number of
shares of Common Stock to which such Holder would be entitled upon an exchange
of its SARs for Warrants in accordance with Section 4.2 and a subsequent
exercise for shares of Common Stock thereof pursuant to the Warrant Agreement at
an exercise price (the "Exercise Price") of $0.00 per SAR. Certificates
representing 14% Debentures will not be issued for amounts less than $1,000, but
cash will be paid in lieu of such amounts.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the SARs
shall be exercisable for 14% Debentures from time to time on any Business Day
beginning on the earliest of (i) the time immediately after the Loans (as
defined in the Loan Agreement) have been made by the Lenders and the 14%
Debentures have been purchased by Whitehall, (ii) such time as any condition
precedent specified in Section 3.01 of the Loan Agreement (other than 3.01 (c)
as it relates to Sections 7.01(f) and (g) thereof) is no longer capable of being

<PAGE>

8

fulfilled in accordance with the terms thereof and (iii) March 31, 1995 and
ending on the Expiration Date in the manner provided for herein.

4.2. EXCHANGE OF SARS FOR WARRANTS; EXCHANGE PRICE. (a) Each SAR
Certificate shall, when countersigned by the SAR Agent, entitle the Holder
thereof, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, to acquire one Warrant for
each SAR evidenced thereby at an exchange price (the "Exchange Price") of $0.00
per SAR.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the SARs
shall be exchangeable for Warrants from time to time on any Business Day
beginning on the earliest of (i) the time immediately after the Loans under the
Loan Agreement have been made by the Lenders and the 14% Debentures have been
purchased by Whitehall, (ii) such time as any condition precedent specified in
Section 3.01 of the Loan Agreement (other than 3.01 (c) as it relates to
Sections 7.01(f) and (g) thereof) is no longer capable of being fulfilled in
accordance with the terms thereof and (iii) March 31, 1995 and ending on the
Expiration Date in the manner provided for herein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that for
so long as the Certificate of Incorporation restricts ownership of the Common
Stock by any one Person to no more than 9.8% of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock (the "Ownership Restriction"), a Holder may not exchange any SARs for
Warrants if, as a result of such exchange, such Holder would receive Warrants
exercisable into a number of shares of Common Stock that, when added to the
number, if any, of shares of Common Stock then held by such Holder plus shares
of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Warrants then held by such Holder,
would equal more than 9.8% of the number of shares of Common Stock then
outstanding and Common Stock exchangeable for Warrants then outstanding.

Upon the execution of an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation
with respect to the Ownership Restriction, the SARs shall automatically be
exchanged for Warrants on a one-for-one basis, subject to any adjustments made
on or prior to the date thereof, to the extent permitted under such amendment.
In such event, the SAR Agent will notify the Holders affected thereby by first
class mail and within 15 days of the date of such notice, such Holders shall
surrender their SAR Certificates for exchange to the extent permitted under such
amendment. Any such SARs not so surrendered by the close of business on the
fifteenth day following the date of such notice shall automatically be deemed to
have been exchanged.

4.3. EXPIRATION OF SARs. The SARs shall expire and the rights of the
Holders of such SARs shall terminate at the close of business on the earliest of
(i) March 31, 1995 in the event the Lenders fail to fund under the Loan
Agreement even though all of the conditions precedent set forth in Section 3.01
thereof have been satisfied, (ii) December 31, 2007 and (iii) the first day on
which no SARs shall be outstanding.

4.4. METHOD OF EXERCISE OR EXCHANGE. In order to exercise or
exchange an SAR, the Holder thereof must surrender the SAR Certificate
evidencing such SAR to the SAR Agent, with the form on the reverse of or
attached to the SAR Certificate duly executed, together with any required
payment in full of the Exercise Price or Exchange Price, as the case may be,
then in effect for 14% Debentures or Warrants as to which an SAR Certificate is
submitted for exercise or exchange. Any such payment of the Exercise Price or
Exchange Price shall be by certified or official bank check drawn on a New York
City bank payable to the order of the Company. All funds received upon the
tender of SARs shall be deposited by the SAR Agent for the account of the
Company, unless otherwise instructed in writing by the Company.

If fewer than all the SARs represented by an SAR Certificate are
surrendered, such SAR Certificate shall be surrendered and a new SAR Certificate
of the same tenor and for the number of SARs that were not surrendered shall
promptly be executed and delivered to the SAR Agent by the Company. The SAR
Agent shall promptly countersign the new SAR Certificate, register it in such
name or names as may be directed in writing by the Holder and deliver the new
SAR Certificate to the Person or Persons entitled to receive the same.

Upon surrender of an SAR Certificate in conformity with the foregoing
provisions, the SAR Agent shall thereupon promptly notify the Company, and the
Company shall transfer to the Holder of such SAR Certificate appropriate
evidence of ownership of either 14% Debentures or Warrants or any other
securities or property (including any money) to which the Holder is entitled,
registered or otherwise placed in, or payable to the order of, such name or
names as may be directed in writing by the Holder, and shall deliver such
evidence of ownership and any other securities or property (including any money)
to the Person or Persons entitled to receive the same or, with respect to SARs
which, but for the last sentence of Section 4.1(a), would have been exercised
for 14% Debentures in a principal amount of less than $1,000, cash in such
amount. A Holder shall be deemed to own and have all of the rights associated
with any Underlying Securities or other securities or property (including money)
to which it is entitled pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender of an SAR
Certificate in accordance with this Section 4.4.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the
event of the occurrence of a business combination pursuant to which the
unaffiliated stockholders of the Company are given the opportunity to exchange
all or a portion of such stockholders' shares of Common Stock, the Holders may
exercise their SARs by surrendering such SARs to the SAR Agent, with the form on
the reverse of or attached to the SAR Certificate duly executed, together with
an indication that they are exercising these SARs pursuant to this paragraph
and, the SAR Agent shall thereupon promptly notify the Company of such
surrender, and the Company shall promptly (i) in the case of only cash
consideration, pay to each Holder an amount equal to the number of shares of
Common Stock to which such

<PAGE>

10

Holder would be entitled upon an exchange of its SARs for Warrants in accordance
with Section 4.2 and a subsequent exercise for shares of Common Stock thereof
pursuant to the Warrant Agreement multiplied by the difference between such cash
consideration and the exercise price then in effect under the Warrant Agreement,
on a per share of Common Stock basis, (ii) in the case of noncash consideration
or any combination of cash and non-cash consideration, upon receipt from each
Holder of its Warrant Certificates, deliver to each such Holder the difference
between (x) the cash, if any, and the fair market value of such noncash
consideration as determined by an Independent Financial Expert and (y) the
exercise price then in effect under the Warrant Agreement on a per share of
Common Stock basis.

4.5. COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES ACT. (a) No SAR may be
exercised or exchanged and no SAR nor Underlying Security may be sold,
transferred or otherwise disposed of (any such sale, transfer or other
disposition, a "sale"), except in compliance with this Section 4.5 and Section
4.6 below.

(b) A Holder may exercise or exchange its SARs if it is an
"accredited investor" or a "qualified institutional buyer", as defined in
Regulation D and Rule 144A under the Securities Act, respectively, and a Holder
may sell its SARs or Underlying Securities to a transferee that is an
"accredited investor" or a "qualified institutional buyer" as defined in such

conditions is satisfied:

to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any distribution thereof
(within the meaning of the Securities Act) that would be in violation of
the securities laws of the United States or any applicable state thereof,
but subject, nevertheless, to the disposition of its property being at all
times within its control; and

(iii) such Holder or transferee agrees to be bound by the provisions
of this Section 4.5 with respect to any exercise or exchange of the SARs
and any sale of the SARs or Underlying Securities.

transaction under Regulation S of the Securities Act.

(d) A Holder may exercise or exchange its SARs or sell its SARs or

4.5(b)(iii).

may be, then in effect is $0.00 and the transaction otherwise complies with
the requirements of Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act.

thereunder (collectively, the "Plan Asset Regulations"), no SAR may be sold to a

among other things, (i) an exercise of all outstanding nonpublicly-offerered
Warrants for Common Stock, (ii) an exchange of all outstanding nonpublicly-

number of SARs then outstanding shall have the right to request in writing that
the Company effect a registration of such Holders' SARs and the Underlying
Securities pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.1 or (ii) at least 1% of
the SARs then deemed outstanding shall have the right to request in writing that
the Company effect a registration of such Holders' SARs and Underlying
Securities pursuant to a Takedown under this Section 4.1 (each such request, a
"Registration Demand"). A Registration Demand shall specify the number of SARs
that each such Holder proposes to sell in the offering. If no Shelf
Registration Statement (as defined in Section 5(c)(i) below) shall be effective
as of the date of the Registration Demand, the demanding Holders may elect to
register such SARs in accordance with either Section 5.1(c)(i) or Section
5.1(d). If a Shelf Registration Statement shall be effective as of the date of
the Registration Demand, then all demanding Holders shall be deemed to have
elected to register their SARs pursuant to Section 5.1(c)(ii). The Holders may
make four Registration Demands pursuant to Sections 5.1(c)(i) and 5.1(d) and
four Registration Demands per year pursuant to an existing Shelf Registration
Statement pursuant to Section 4.1(c)(ii) for which the Company will pay and bear
all costs and expenses in accordance with Section 6.3 and thereafter the Holders
may make an unlimited number of Registration Demands for which such requesting
Holders shall pay and bear all costs and expenses.

(b) Upon receipt of a Registration Demand (other than for a
Takedown), the Company shall give written notice thereof to all of the other
Holders of SARs at least 30 days prior to the initial filing of a Registration
Statement relating to such Registration Demand. Each of the other Holders shall
have the right, within 20 days after the delivery of such notice, to request
that the Company include all or a portion of such Holder's SARs and Underlying
Securities in such Registration Statement. Upon receipt of a Registration
Demand that is a Takedown, a representative of the selling holders shall give
written notice thereof to all of the Holders at least three Business Days prior
to the initial filing of a Registration Statement relating to such Registration
Demand. Each of the other Holders shall have the right, within one Business Day
after the delivery of such notice, to request that the Company include all or a
portion of such Holder's SARs and Underlying Securities in such Registration
Statement.

(c) (i) As promptly as practicable and in no event later than
60 days after the Company receives a Registration Demand electing to register
SARs pursuant to this Section 5.2(c)(i), the Company shall file under the
Securities Act a "shelf" registration statement (the "Shelf Registration
Statement") providing for the registration and the sale on a continuous or
delayed basis of all of the SARs and all of the Underlying Securities, pursuant
to Rule 415 under the Securities Act and/or any similar rule that may be adopted
by the SEC (the "Shelf Registration"). The Company agrees to use its best
efforts to cause the Shelf Registration Statement to become or be declared
effective no later than 60 calendar days after the filing (the "60 Day Effective
Date") and to keep such Shelf Registration continuously effective for a period
ending on the occurrence of the earlier of (x) the third anniversary of the
Registration Demand and (y) notification by all of the requesting Holders that
such Holders have sold all of the SARS owned by them. The Company further
agrees to supplement or make amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement and
the prospectus included therein (x) as may be necessary to effect and maintain
the effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement for the period set forth
in the previous sentence and (y) as may be required by the rules, regulations or
instructions applicable to the registration form used by the Company for such
Shelf Registration or by the Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder
for shelf registration. The Company agrees to furnish to the Holders of the
securities registered thereby copies of any such supplement or amendment (but
excluding any periodic reports required to be filed with the SEC under the
Exchange Act) so that the Holders through the Representative(s) have a
reasonable opportunity to comment thereon prior to its being used and/or filed
with the SEC.

(ii) As promptly as practicable after the Company receives a
Registration Demand from a Holder or Holders pursuant to which a Holder is
deemed to have elected to register SARs pursuant to an existing Shelf
Registration Statement (a "Takedown"), the Company shall file a Prospectus with
the SEC and otherwise comply with the Securities Act and all rules, regulations
and instructions thereunder applicable to such Takedown. In the event that no
Prospectus or other filing is required nor any other action that necessitates
the Company's participation is required to effect a sale of SARs pursuant to an
effective Shelf Registration Statement, each selling holder agrees to provide
the Company with at least three Business Days' notice of its intention to sell
SARs pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
Company shall have the right to postpone any such sale for a reasonable period
of time not to exceed 90 days if: (i) in the opinion of counsel for the
Company, the Company would, in connection with such sale, be required to
disclose in such Registration Statement (or any prospectus supplement to be used
in connection therewith) information not otherwise then required by law to be
publicly disclosed and (ii) in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors
of the Company, such disclosure would adversely affect any material corporate
development or business transaction contemplated by the Company.

<PAGE>

15

(d) As promptly as practicable and in no event later than 60 days
after the Company receives a Registration Demand electing to register SARs
pursuant to this Section 5.1(d), the Company shall file with the SEC a
Registration Statement, on any form that shall be available and appropriate for
the sale of the SARs and the Underlying Securities in accordance with the
intended method of distribution thereof. The Company shall include in such
Registration Statement all of the SARs of such requesting Holders that such
Holders have requested to be included therein pursuant to Sections 5.1(a) and
5.1(b); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, if the requested registration involves an
underwritten offering, the SARs to be registered may be reduced if the managing
underwriter delivers a notice (a "Cutback Notice") pursuant to Section 5.1(g).

The Company shall use its best efforts to cause each such Registration
Statement to be declared effective and to keep such Registration Statement
continuously effective and usable for resale of such SARs, for a period of
90 days from the date on which the SEC declares such Registration Statement
effective or such shorter period as is necessary to complete the distribution of
the securities registered thereunder.

(e) The Representative(s) shall determine the method of distribution
of SARs pursuant to a Registration Demand.

(f) If a Registration Demand involves an underwritten offering, GS
shall be the managing underwriter for such offering unless GS declines such
engagement, in which event, the Representative(s) shall select the managing
underwriter; PROVIDED that such managing underwriter so selected shall be
reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

(g) In the event that the proposed offering is an underwritten
offering and includes securities to be offered for the account of the Company
(the "Company Shares"), the provisions of this Section 5.1(g) shall be
applicable if the managing underwriter delivers a Cutback Notice stating that,
in its opinion, the number of Company Shares and the number of SARs that the
Holders have requested to be registered exceeds the maximum number of securities
specified by the managing underwriter in such Cutback Notice that may be
distributed without adversely affecting the price, timing or distribution of the
securities being distributed. If the managing underwriter delivers such Cutback
Notice, the number of Company Shares and SARs requested to be registered shall
be reduced in the following order until the number of securities to be
registered has been reduced to the maximum number of securities specified by the
managing underwriter in the Cutback Notice: first, the Company Shares and
second, the SARs in proportion to the respective number of SARs that each Holder
has requested to be registered.

(h) No Registration Demand (other than a Takedown) may be made until
the expiration of six months following the completion of the distribution of the
securities

<PAGE>

16

registered under any Registration Statement that has been filed and has become
effective pursuant to a prior Registration Demand.

(i) The Company shall not be obligated to file a Registration
Statement relating to any Registration Demand (other than a Takedown) unless the
requests by the Holders for such registration cover 5% or more of aggregate
number of SARs then outstanding.

5.2. PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION RIGHTS. (a) If the Company proposes to
file a Registration Statement with the SEC respecting an offering, whether
primary or secondary, of any equity securities of the Company, the Company shall
give written notice to all the Holders at least 30 days prior to the initial
filing of the Registration Statement relating to such offering. Each such
Holder shall have the right, within 20 days after delivery of such notice, to
request in writing that the Company include all or a portion of such Holder's
SARs in such Registration Statement ("Piggyback Registration Rights").

(b) In the event that the proposed offering is an underwritten
offering covering shares of Common Stock to be offered for the account of the
Company (the "Company Shares"), the provisions of this Section 5.2(b) shall be
applicable if the managing underwriter delivers a Cutback Notice stating that,
in its opinion, the aggregate number of Company Shares and the number of SARs
that the Holders have requested to be registered exceeds the maximum number of
securities specified by the managing underwriter in such Cutback Notice that may
be distributed without adversely affecting the price, timing or distribution of
the securities being distributed. If the managing underwriter delivers such
Cutback Notice, the number of Company Shares and SARs requested to be registered
shall be reduced in the following order until the number of securities to be
offered has been reduced to the maximum number of securities specified by the
managing underwriter in the Cutback Notice: first, the SARs in proportion to
the respective number of SARs that each Holder has requested to be registered
and second, the Company Shares.

(c) The provisions of this Section 5.2 shall not be applicable in
connection with (i) a registration statement filed by the Company pursuant to
Section 5.1 or (ii) a transaction in which a registration statement is filed by
the Company on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor forms.

5.3. COMPANY'S ABILITY TO POSTPONE REGISTRATION RIGHTS. (a) The
Company shall have the right to postpone the filing of any Registration
Statement relating to a Demand Registration for a reasonable period of time not
to exceed 90 days if: (i) in the opinion of counsel for the Company, the
Company would be required to disclose in such Registration Statement information
not otherwise then required by law to be publicly disclosed and (ii) in the good
faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, such disclosure would
adversely affect any material corporate development or business transaction
contemplated by

<PAGE>

17

the Company; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that such 90-day period shall be deducted from
the six-month interval allowed between Registration Demands pursuant to
Section 5.1(i).

(b) If at any time after the Company notifies the Holders of its
intention to file a Registration Statement that would trigger Piggyback
Registration Rights, the Board of Directors of the Company in good faith shall
determine for any reason not to effect such registration or to postpone such
registration, the Company shall (i) in the case of a determination not to effect
such registration, be relieved of its obligation to register any SARs of Holders
requesting inclusion in such registration, and (ii) in the case of a
determination to postpone such registration, be permitted to postpone
registering the SARs of Holders requesting inclusion in such registration.

(c) The Company shall as promptly as practicable notify the Holders
of any postponement pursuant to this Section 5.3, specifying the reasons
therefor.

5.4. HOLDER WITHDRAWAL RIGHTS. The Company shall withdraw from
registration any SARs on request of a Holder; PROVIDED that, in the case of a
Registration Demand under Section 5.1, a Demand Registration shall be deemed to
have been made for the purpose of the number of such Demands permitted to be
made under Section 5.1(a) if the Company shall have incurred $50,000 in expenses
relating to such Demand Registration at such time as such Holder makes such
withdrawal. The Company shall not be obligated to maintain the effectiveness of
any Registration Statement if, after any withdrawal of SARs by a Holder, the
number of SARs remaining subject to such Registration Statement is less than 5%
of the aggregate number of SARs then outstanding, unless (i) the Company is also
registering securities on such Registration Statement for its own account or
(ii) if such Registration Statement relates to securities other than for the
account of the Company.

6. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES.

6.1. COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY APPLICABLE TO ALL REGISTRATION
STATEMENTS. This Section 6.1 applies to all Registration Statements filed by the
Company and referred to in Section 5.1 or 5.2. The securities covered by each
such Registration Statement are referred to as the "Registered Securities". Each
underwriter, agent, selling broker, dealer manager or similar securities
industry professional participating in any offering of the Registered Securities
is referred to as an "underwriter" or "agent" and any agreement entered into
with an underwriter or agent is referred to as an "underwriting or agency
agreement". In connection with each such registration, the Company covenants
with each Holder participating in such offering (each, a "selling holder") and
each underwriter or agent participating therein as follows:

<PAGE>

18

(a) The Company will notify the selling holders and the managing
underwriter or agent, immediately, and confirm the notice in writing,
(i) when the Registration Statement, or any post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement, shall have become effective, or any supplement to
the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus shall have been filed, (ii) of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC, (iii) of any request by the SEC to
amend the Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus or
for additional information, (iv) of the issuance by the SEC of any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any
order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus, or of
the suspension of the qualification of the Registered Securities for
offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the institution or threatening
of any proceedings for any of such purposes, (v) if at any time when a
prospectus is required by the Securities Act to be delivered in connection
with sales of the Registered Securities the representations and warranties
of the Company contemplated by Section 6.1(i) cease to be true and correct
and (vi) of the existence of any fact that results or may result in the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus or any document incorporated therein
by reference containing an untrue statement of material fact or omitting to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
any statement therein not misleading.

(b) The Company will use every reasonable effort to prevent the
issuance of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement or of any order preventing or suspending the use of any
preliminary prospectus and, if any such order is issued, to obtain the
lifting thereof at the earliest possible moment.

(c) The Company will afford the Representative(s) and the managing
underwriters a reasonable opportunity to comment prior to its being filed
with the SEC any Registration Statement, any amendment thereto, or any
amendment of or supplement to the Prospectus (including amendments of the
documents incorporated by reference into the Prospectus but excluding any
periodic reports required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange
Act).

(d) The Company will furnish to each selling holder and to the
managing underwriter or agent, without charge, as many signed copies of the
Registration Statement (as originally filed) and of all amendments thereto,
whether filed before or after the Registration Statement becomes effective,
copies of all exhibits and documents filed therewith, including documents
incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and signed copies of all
consents and certificates of experts, as such selling holder or the
managing underwriter or agent may reasonably request, and will furnish to
the managing underwriter, for each other underwriter participating in an
underwritten offering, one conformed copy of the Registration Statement as
originally

<PAGE>

19

filed and of each amendment thereto (including documents incorporated by
reference into the Prospectus but without exhibits).

(e) The Company will deliver to each selling holder and each
underwriter or agent participating in such offering, without charge, as
many copies of each preliminary prospectus as such selling holder or such
underwriter or agent may reasonably request, and the Company hereby
consents to the use of such copies for purposes permitted by the Securities
Act. The Company will deliver to each selling holder and each underwriter
or agent participating in such offering, without charge, from time to time
during the period when the Prospectus is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, such number of copies of the Prospectus (as supplemented or
amended) as such selling holder or such underwriter or agent may reasonably
request.

(f) The Company will comply to the best of its ability with the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder so as to
permit the completion of the distribution of the Registered Securities in
accordance with the intended method or methods of distribution contemplated
in the Prospectus. If at any time when a prospectus is required by the
Securities Act to be delivered in connection with sales of the Registered
Securities any event shall occur or condition exist as a result of which it
is necessary, in the opinion of counsel for the selling holders, counsel
for the underwriters or agents or counsel for the Company, to amend the
Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus in order that
the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances existing at the
time it is delivered to a purchaser, or if it shall be necessary, in the
opinion any of such counsel, at any such time to amend the Registration
Statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the rules and regulations of the SEC
thereunder, the Company will promptly prepare and file with the SEC,
subject to Section 6.1(c), such amendment or supplement as may be necessary
to correct such untrue statement or omission or to make the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus comply with such requirements.

(g) The Company will use its best efforts, in cooperation with the
selling holders or the underwriters or agents, as the case may be, to
qualify the Registered Securities for offering and sale under the
applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions as the
selling holders or the managing underwriter or agents, as the case may be,
may designate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be obligated
to file any general consent to service of process or to qualify as a
foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in any jurisdiction in
which it is not so

<PAGE>

20

qualified or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in
any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject. The Company will
file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws of each
jurisdiction in which the Registered Securities have been qualified as
above provided.

(h) The Company will use its best efforts to effect the listing of
the Registered Securities covered by a Registration Statement not then
listed on each national securities exchange on which similar securities
issued by the Company are then listed or, if no such securities are then
listed, on any national securities exchange if, in either case, so
requested by Whitehall for so long as it is a Holder or the
Representative(s), or if requested by the managing underwriter.

(i) The Company shall make such representations and warranties to the
selling holders and the underwriters or agents, if any, in form, substance
and scope as are customarily made by issuers to underwriters in
underwritten public offerings.

(j) On the effective date of the Registration Statement or, in the
case of an underwritten offering, on the date of delivery of the Registered
Securities sold pursuant thereto, the Company shall cause to be delivered
to the selling holders and the underwriters or agents, if any, opinions of
counsel for the Company with respect to, among other things, the due
incorporation and good standing of the Company; the qualification of the
Company to transact business as foreign corporation; the due authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement; the due authorization, execution,
authentication and issuance, and the validity and enforceability, of the
SARs; the absence of material legal or governmental proceedings involving
the Company; the absence of a breach by the Company of, or a default under,
agreements binding the Company; the absence of governmental approvals
required to be obtained in connection with the registration, offering and
sale of the SARs; the compliance as to form of the Registration Statement
and any documents incorporated by reference therein with the requirements
of the Securities Act; the effectiveness of such Registration Statement
under the Securities Act; and a statement that, as of the date of the
opinion and of the Registration Statement or most recent post-effective
amendment thereto, as the case may be, nothing has come to the attention of
such counsel which causes them to believe that either the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus included therein, as then amended or
supplemented, or the documents incorporate by reference therein (in the
case of such documents, in the light of the circumstances existing at the
time that such documents were filed with the Commission under the Exchange
Act), contained an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (it
being understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the
financial statements and other financial data included therein or omitted
therefrom).

<PAGE>

21

In the event that any broker-dealer registered under the Exchange
Act shall be an "affiliate" of, or shall have a "conflict of interest"
with, the Company (each such term as defined in Schedule E to the By-Laws
of the National Association of Securities Dealers ("NASD")), and such
broker-dealer shall underwrite any Registerable Common Stock or participate
as a member of an underwriting syndicate or selling group or otherwise
"assist in the distribution" (within the meaning of the Rules of Fair
Practice and the By-Laws of the NASD) thereof, whether as a Holder or as an
underwriter, a placement or sales agent or a broker or dealer in respect of
such Registerable Common Stock or otherwise, the Company shall assist such
broker-dealer, in complying with the requirements of such Rules and By-
Laws, including, without limitation, by (1) if such Rules or By-Laws,
including Schedule E thereto, shall so require, engaging a "qualified
independent underwriter" (as defined in such Schedule) to participate in
the preparation of the registration statement relating to such Registerable
Common Stock, to exercise usual standards of due diligence in respect
thereto and, if any portion of the offering contemplated by the
Registration Statement is an underwritten offering or is made through a
placement or sales agent, to recommend the maximum public offering price of
such Registerable Common Stock, (2) paying the fees and expenses of any
such qualified independent underwriter and indemnifying the qualified
independent underwriter to the extent of the indemnification of
underwriters provided in Section 6.4 hereof, and (3) providing to such
broker-dealer such information concerning the Company and its affiliates,
officers, directors, employees and securityholders as may be required in
order for such broker-dealer to comply with the requirements of Schedule E
to the NASD Bylaws and Section 44 of the Rules of Fair Practice.

(k) Immediately prior to the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement or, in the case of an underwritten offering, at the time of
delivery of any Registered Securities sold pursuant thereto, the Company
shall cause to be delivered to the selling holders and the underwriters or
agents, if any, letters from the Company's independent public accountants
stating that such accountants are independent public accountants with
respect to the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and the
applicable published rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and
otherwise in customary form and covering such financial and accounting
matters as are customarily covered by letters of the independent public
accountants delivered in connection with primary underwritten public
offerings.

(l) If the managing underwriter or agent so requests, the
underwriting or agency agreement shall set forth in full the provisions
hereof relating to covenants, registration expenses, lock-up agreements,
indemnification and contribution contained in Sections 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4,
6.5, 6.8 and 6.9, with such changes therein as may be agreed to by the
managing underwriter or agent, the Company and the selling holders.

<PAGE>

22

(m) The Company shall deliver such documents and certificates as may
be requested by any selling holder or the underwriters or agents, if any,
to evidence compliance with Section 6.1(i) and with any customary
conditions contained in the underwriting or agency agreement, if any.

(n) The Company will make available for inspection by representatives
of the selling holders and the underwriters or agents participating in such
offering, any attorney or accountant retained by such selling holders or
underwriters or agents and, with respect to any private placement of SARs
or Underlying Securities, upon notice to the Company, prospective
purchasers, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents
and properties of the Company, and cause the Company's officers, directors
and employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such
representative, underwriter or agent, attorney or accountant in connection
with the preparation of the Registration Statement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
any records, information or documents that are designated by the Company in
writing as confidential shall be kept confidential by each such person (by,
among other things, if so requested by the Company, entering into a
confidentiality agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the
Company) unless such records, information or documents become part of the
public domain through no fault of such person or unless disclosure thereof
is required by court or administrative order or the SEC (including the
federal securities law).

(o) The Company will make generally available to its security holders
as soon as practicable, but not later than 45 days after the close of the
period covered thereby (or 90 days if such period is a fiscal year), an
earnings statement of the Company (in form complying with the provisions of
Rule 158 under the rules and regulations of the SEC under the Securities
Act), covering a period of 12 months beginning after the effective date of
the Registration Statement but not later than the first day of the
Company's fiscal quarter next following such effective date.

(p) The Company will enter into such customary agreements, including
a customary underwriting or agency agreement with the underwriters or
agents, if any, and take all such other actions in connection with the
offering in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of the
Registered Securities.

(q) (i) Prior to or at the time the Registration Statement becomes
effective, the Company will prepare and qualify a trust indenture
relating to the 14% Debentures (an "Indenture") under the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939. In the event that any modification or
amendment to such Indenture is required by such Act or the rules and
regulations thereunder or by the staff of the SEC in order so to
qualify the Indenture, the Company shall without delay solicit
consents of holders (as defined in such Indenture) in the manner and
with the

<PAGE>

23

effect provided by such Indenture, pursuant to which such holders
shall be asked to consent to such modifications or amendments, but
only such modifications or amendments, as shall be so required. In
connection with any such solicitation, the Company shall recommend
that holders of 14% Debentures consent to such modifications or
amendments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that such
modifications or amendments may be effected without the consent of
such holders pursuant to the applicable provisions of the Indenture,
the Company shall use its best efforts to effect such modifications or
amendments without such consent.

(ii) In the event that any such amendment or modification
involves the appointment of a new trustee under the Indenture,
the Company shall appoint a new trustee thereunder pursuant to
the applicable provisions of the Indenture.

6.2. COVENANTS OF THE SELLING HOLDERS. (a) Each selling holder
shall use its best efforts to furnish to the Company such information regarding
the distribution of such Registered Securities as is customarily requested from
selling holders in underwritten public offerings.

(b) Each selling holder agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from
the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in
Section 6.1(a)(vi), such selling holder will forthwith discontinue the
disposition of its Registered Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement
until such selling holder's receipt of the copies of a supplemented or amended
Prospectus contemplated by Section 6.1(f), or until it is advised in writing by
the Company that the use of such Prospectus may be resumed. If the Company
shall give any such notice, the Company shall extend the period of time during
which the Company is required to keep the Registration Statement effective and
usable by the number of days during the period from the date of receipt of such
notice to the date when each selling holder of Registered Securities covered by
such Registration Statement either receives the copies of a supplemented or
amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 6.1(f) or is advised in writing by
the Company that the use of such Prospectus may be resumed.

(c) Each selling holder agrees to make customary representations and
warranties to the Company and the underwriters or agents, if any, in form,
substance and scope as are customarily made by selling holders in underwritten
public offerings, but no selling holders, as such, shall be required to make any
representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the
Registration Statement (except as to written information furnished to the
Company by such selling holder expressly for use therein).

<PAGE>

24

(d) Each selling holder agrees to provide the Company, upon receipt
of its request, with such information about the selling holder to enable the
Company to comply with the requirements of the Securities Act and to execute
such certificates as the Company may reasonably request in connection with such
information and otherwise to satisfy any requirements of law.

6.3. Registration Expenses. (a) The Company will pay and bear all
costs and expenses incident to the performance of its obligations under this
Agreement with respect to each registration pursuant to Section 5.1 or 5.2,
including, without limitation:

(i) the preparation, printing and filing of the Registration

any amendments or supplements thereto, and the cost of furnishing copies
thereof to the selling holders or the underwriters or agents, as the case
may be;

retained by the selling holders pursuant to Section 6.3(b);

(iv) the fees and disbursements of the underwriters or agents
customarily paid by issuers or sellers of securities and the reasonable
fees and expenses of any special experts retained in connection with the
Registration Statement, but excluding underwriting discounts and

(v) the qualification of the Registered Securities Stock under
applicable securities laws in accordance with Section 6.1(g) and any filing
for review of the offering with the National Association of Securities

in connection therewith, in connection with any Blue Sky Survey and in
connection with any reserve share program; and

(vi) all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing,
if any, of any of the Registered Securities on any securities exchange
pursuant to Section 6.1(h).

incident to the delivery of the Registered Securities to be sold by it,
including any stock transfer taxes payable upon the sale of such Registered
Securities to the purchaser thereof and any underwriting discounts or

6.4. INDEMNIFICATION. (a) In connection with each registration
pursuant to Section 5.1 or 5.2, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless each selling holder, each underwriter or agent participating in such
offering, and each person, if any, who controls any selling holder or any such
underwriter or agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act as
follows:

(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense
whatsoever, as incurred, arising out of an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement
(or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged omission therefrom
of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading or arising out of an untrue statement of
a material fact included in any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus
(or any amendment or supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged
omission therefrom of a material fact necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading;

(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and expense
whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid in
settlement of any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any
governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim
whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such
alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is effected with
the written consent of the Company, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld; and

(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as incurred (including
fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by the selling holders and by the
underwriters or agents), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or
defending against any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any
governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim
whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such
alleged untrue statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense
is not paid under subparagraph (i) or (ii) above;

<PAGE>

26

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, with respect to any selling holder or any
underwriter or agent, this indemnity does not apply to any loss, liability,
claim, damage or expense to the extent arising out of an untrue statement
or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made in reliance upon
and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by any
such selling holder or underwriter or agent, respectively, expressly for
use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any
preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement
thereto).

(b) Each selling holder agrees severally, and not jointly, to
indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who
signed a Registration Statement, each underwriter or agent participating in such
offering and the other selling holders, and each person, if any, who controls
the Company, any such underwriter or agent and any other selling holder within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against any and all loss,
liability, claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in
Section 6.4(a), as incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or
omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the Registration
Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any preliminary prospectus or the
Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such selling
holder expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment
thereto), or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto).

(c) The obligations of the Company under Section 6.4(a) and of the
selling holders under Section 6.4(b) to indemnify any underwriter or agent who
participates in an offering (or any person, if any, controlling such underwriter
or agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act) shall be
conditioned upon the underwriting or agency agreement with such underwriter or
agent containing an agreement by such underwriter or agent to indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed a
Registration Statement, and each selling holder, and each person, if any, who
controls the Company or any such selling holder within the meaning of Section 15
of the Securities Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and
expense described in the indemnity contained in Section 6.4(a), as incurred, but
only with respect to untrue statements or omissions, or alleged untrue
statements or omissions, made in the Registration Statement (or any amendment
thereto), or any preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished to the Company by such underwriter or agent expressly for use in the
Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), or any preliminary prospectus
or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).

(d) Each indemnified party shall give prompt notice to each
indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which
indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so notify an indemnifying
party shall not relieve the indemnifying

<PAGE>

27

party from any liability it may have under this Agreement, except to the extent
that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced thereby. If it so elects,
after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly with any other
indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume the defense of such
action with counsel chosen by it, PROVIDED that the indemnified party shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of such action with counsel chosen by it,
the fees and expenses of which, subject to the next sentence, shall be paid by
the indemnifying party. In no event shall the indemnifying party or parties be
liable for the fees and expenses of more than one counsel for (i) the Company,
its officer, directors and controlling persons as a group, (ii) the selling
holders and their controlling persons as a group and (iii) the underwriters or
agents and their controlling persons as a group, in each case, in connection
with any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the same
jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances.

6.5. CONTRIBUTION. (a) In order to provide for just and equitable
contribution in circumstances under which the indemnity provided for in this
Section 6 is for any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified parties
although applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company, the selling
holders and the underwriters or agents shall contribute to the aggregate losses,
liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by such
indemnity incurred by the Company, the selling holders and one or more of the
underwriters or agents, as incurred, in such proportions that (i) the
underwriters or agents are responsible for that portion represented by the
percentage that the underwriting discounts and commissions for the offering
appearing on the cover page of the Prospectus (or, if not set forth on the cover
page, that are applicable to the offering) bear to the initial public offering
price appearing on the cover page (or, if not set forth on the cover page, that
are applicable to the offering) and (ii) each of the selling holders and the
Company is responsible for an equal portion of the balance.

(b) No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 6.5, each person, if any, who
controls an underwriter or agent within the meaning of Section 15 of the
Securities Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such underwriter or
agent, and each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who signed
a Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company or a
selling holder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act shall have
the same rights to contribution as the Company or such selling holder, as the
case may be.

6.6. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND INDEMNITIES TO SURVIVE. The
indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section 6 and the
representations and warranties of the Company referred to in Section 6.1(i)
shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) any
termination of any underwriting or agency agreement, (ii) any investigation made
by or on behalf of the selling holders, the Company or any

<PAGE>

28

underwriter or agent or controlling person or (iii) the consummation of the sale
or successive resales of the Registered Securities.

6.7. RULE 144. The Company covenants that it will continue to file
the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the rules
and regulations of the SEC thereunder and the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder and it will take such further action as any
Holder of Registrable Common Stock may reasonably request, all to the extent
required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Registrable Common
Stock without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the
exemptions provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be
amended from time to time. Upon the request of any Holder of Registrable Common
Stock, the Company will deliver to such Holder a written statement as to whether
it has complied with such requirements.

6.8. PARTICIPATION IN UNDERWRITTEN OFFERINGS. No Holder may
participate in any underwritten offering hereunder unless:

(a) Such Holder executes a power of attorney appointing one or more
(up to three) attorneys (each, a "Representative") designated by the
selling holders proposing to sell a majority of the shares of Registrable
Common Stock proposed to be sold by all selling holders. Each such
Representative shall be authorized, on customary terms, to execute the
underwriting agreement on behalf of each selling holder and to otherwise
act for the selling holders in connection with the offering.

(b) Such Holder directly through its Representative, enters into an
underwriting agreement with the Company, the other selling holders, any
selling stockholders and the underwriters, which underwriting agreement
shall comply with the provisions of this Section 6.

(c) Such Holder executes all questionnaires and other documents
required by the underwriting agreement to be executed by such Holder.

6.9. LOCK-UP AGREEMENTS. (a) The Company agrees that it will not,
directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for the sale of,
or otherwise dispose of, any Common Stock or securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for Common Stock, other than any such sale or
distribution of Common Stock upon exercise of the Company's Warrants, in the
case of any registration pursuant to Section 5.1, for a period of 90 days from
the effective date of the Registration Statement pertaining to such Registrable
Common Stock.

(b) Each Holder of Registrable Common Stock whose Registrable Common
Stock is covered by a Registration Statement filed pursuant to Section 5.1 or
5.2 agrees that

<PAGE>

29

it will not, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, grant any option for
the sale of, or otherwise dispose of, any shares of Common Stock or any Warrants
or other securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for Common
Stock, for a period of 90 days from the effective date of the Registration
Statement pertaining to such Registrable Common Stock.

(c) The lock-up agreements set forth in Sections 6.9(a) and 6.9(b)
shall be subject to customary exceptions that may be contained in an
underwriting agreement if any such registration involves an underwritten
offering.

7. SAR TRANSFER BOOKS.

The SAR Certificates shall be issued in registered form only. The
Company shall cause to be kept at the office of the SAR Agent a register in
which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company
shall provide for the registration of SAR Certificates and of transfers or
exchanges of SAR Certificates as herein provided.

At the option of the Holder, SAR Certificates may be exchanged at such
office, and upon payment of the charges hereinafter provided. Whenever any SAR
Certificates are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the
SAR Agent shall countersign and deliver, the SAR Certificates that the Holder
making the exchange is entitled to receive.

All SAR Certificates issued upon any registration of transfer or
exchange of SAR Certificates shall be the valid obligations of the Company,
evidencing the same obligations, and entitled to the same benefits under this
Agreement, as the SAR Certificates surrendered for such registration of transfer
or exchange.

Every SAR Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the SAR Agent) be duly
endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company and the SAR Agent, duly executed by the Holder
thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.

No service charge shall be made to a Holder for any registration of
transfer or exchange of SAR Certificates. The Company may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of SAR Certificates.

Any SAR Certificate when duly endorsed in blank shall be deemed
negotiable and when an SAR Certificate shall have been so endorsed, the Holder
thereof may be treated by the Company, the SAR Agent and all other persons
dealing therewith as the absolute

<PAGE>

30

owner thereof for any purpose and as the Person entitled to exercise the rights
represented thereby, or to the transfer thereof on the register of the Company
maintained by the SAR Agent, any notice to the contrary notwithstanding; but
until such transfer on such register, the Company and the SAR Agent may treat
the registered Holder thereof as the owner for all purposes.

8. SAR HOLDERS.

8.1. NO VOTING RIGHTS. Except as provided below, no Holder of an SAR
Certificate, as such, shall be entitled to any rights of a stockholder of the
Company, including, without limitation, the right to vote, to consent, to
exercise any preemptive right, to receive any notice of meetings of stockholders
for the election of directors of the Company or any other matter or to receive
any notice of any proceedings of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Holders of SARs that are exercisable pursuant to Section 4.1(b) will be entitled
to receive at the addresses shown in the register of the Company maintained by
the SAR Agent notice of all meetings of stockholders of the Company and the
Company will submit any item that may be submitted to stockholders for
consideration (other than elections of directors, ratifications of appointments
of auditors or amendments to Article Ninth of the Certificate of Incorporation)
to such Holders prior to submission to stockholders for purposes of determining
the number of SARs that would have approved of such action had such Holders and
holders of Warrants been entitled to vote on such matters. In order to make
such a determination, the Holders shall appoint a representative (who may be the
same Person appointed by the holders of Warrants pursuant to the Warrant
Agreement) who shall poll the Holders and the holders of Warrants in respect of
any such action within five Business Days of the date of receipt of the notice
from the Company as to any such action. If no response is given by such
representative to the Company prior to the expiration of such period, all of the
Holders shall be deemed to have consented to the proposed action.

8.2. RIGHT OF ACTION. All rights of action in respect of this
Agreement are vested in the Holders of the SARs, and any Holder of any SAR,
without the consent of the SAR Agent or the Holder of any other SAR, may, on
such Holder's own behalf and for such Holder's own benefit, enforce, and may
institute and maintain any suit, action or proceeding against the Company
suitable to enforce, or otherwise in respect of, such Holder's right to exercise
or exchange such Holder's SARs in the manner provided in this Agreement.

9. SAR AGENT.

9.1. NATURE OF DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES ASSUMED. The Company
hereby appoints the SAR Agent to act as agent of the Company as set forth in
this Agreement. The

<PAGE>

31

SAR Agent hereby accepts such appointment as agent of the Company and agrees to
perform that agency upon the terms and conditions herein set forth, by all of
which the Company and the Holders of SARs, by their acceptance thereof, shall be
bound. The SAR Agent shall not by countersigning SAR Certificates or by any
other act hereunder be deemed to make any representations as to validity or
authorization of the SARs or the SAR Certificates (except as to its
countersignature thereon) or of any securities or other property delivered upon
exercise or exchange or tender of any SAR, or as to the accuracy of the
computation of the Exercise Price or Exchange Price or the number or kind or
amount of stock or other securities or other property deliverable upon exercise
or exchange of any SAR, or the correctness of the representations of the Company
made in such certificates that the SAR Agent receives. The SAR Agent shall not
have any duty to calculate the Exercise Price or Exchange Price, the kind and
amount of Warrants, 14% Debentures or other securities or any property
receivable by Holders upon the exercise, exchange or tender SARs required from
time to time or the distributions on the SARs pursuant to Section 3, and the SAR
Agent shall have no duty or responsibility in determining the accuracy or
correctness of such calculation. The SAR Agent shall not (a) be liable for any
recital or statement of fact contained herein or in the SAR Certificates or for
any action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith on the belief that any
SAR Certificate or any other documents or any signatures are genuine or properly
authorized, (b) be responsible for any failure on the part of the Company to
comply with any of its covenants and obligations contained in this Agreement or
in the SAR Certificates or (c) be liable for any act or omission in connection
with this Agreement except for its own negligence or willful misconduct. The
SAR Agent is hereby authorized to accept instructions with respect to the
performance of its duties hereunder from the President, any Vice President or
the Secretary of the Company and to apply to any such officer for instructions
(which instructions will be promptly given in writing when requested) and the
SAR Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or suffered to be taken by it
in good faith in accordance with the instructions of any such officer, but in
its discretion the SAR Agent may in lieu thereof accept other evidence of such
or may require such further or additional evidence as it may deem reasonable.

The SAR Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights and powers
hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either itself or by or through
its attorneys, agents or employees, provided reasonable care has been exercised
in the selection and in the continued employment of any such attorney, agent or
employee. The SAR Agent shall not be under any obligation or duty to institute,
appear in or defend any action, suit or legal proceeding in respect hereof,
unless first indemnified to its satisfaction, but this provision shall not
affect the power of the SAR Agent to take such action as the SAR Agent may
consider proper, whether with or without such indemnity. The SAR Agent shall
promptly notify the Company in writing of any claim made or action, suit or
proceeding instituted against it arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement.

<PAGE>

32

The Company will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to
be performed, executed, acknowledged and delivered all such further acts,
instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the SAR Agent in
order to enable it to carry out or perform its duties under this Agreement.

The SAR Agent shall act solely as agent of the Company hereunder. The
SAR Agent shall not be liable except for the failure to perform such duties as
are specifically set forth herein, and no implied covenants or obligations shall
be read into this Agreement against the SAR Agent, whose duties and obligations
shall be determined solely by the express provisions hereof.

9.2. RIGHT TO CONSULT COUNSEL. The SAR Agent may at any time consult
with competent legal counsel, and the SAR Agent shall incur no liability or
responsibility to the Company or to any Holder for any action taken, suffered or
omitted by it in good faith in accordance with the opinion or advice of such
counsel.

9.3. COMPENSATION AND REIMBURSEMENT. The Company agrees to pay to
the SAR Agent from time to time compensation for all services rendered by it
hereunder as the Company and the SAR Agent may agree from time to time, and to
reimburse the SAR Agent for reasonable expenses and disbursements incurred in
connection with the execution and administration of this Agreement (including
the reasonable compensation and the expenses of its counsel), and further agrees
to indemnify the SAR Agent for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss,
liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on its part,
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance and administration of this
Agreement, including the costs and expenses of defending itself against any
claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its
powers or duties hereunder.

9.4. SAR AGENT MAY HOLD COMPANY SECURITIES. The SAR Agent and any
stockholder, director, officer or employee of the SAR Agent may buy, sell or
deal in any of the SARs or other securities of the Company or its Affiliates or
become pecuniarily interested in transactions in which the Company or its
Affiliates may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or
its Affiliates or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not the
SAR Agent under this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the SAR Agent
from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other legal entity.

9.5. RESIGNATION AND REMOVAL; APPOINTMENT OF SUCCESSOR. (a) No
resignation or removal of the SAR Agent and no appointment of a successor
warrant agent shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the
successor warrant agent as provided herein. The SAR Agent may resign its duties
and be discharged from all further duties and liability hereunder (except
liability arising as a result of the SAR Agent's own negligence or willful
misconduct) after giving written notice to the Company. The Company

<PAGE>

33

may remove the SAR Agent upon written notice, and the SAR Agent shall thereupon
in like manner be discharged from all further duties and liabilities hereunder,
except as aforesaid. The SAR Agent shall, at the Company's expense, cause to be
mailed (by first-class mail, postage prepaid) to each Holder of an SAR at his
last address as shown on the register of the Company maintained by the SAR Agent
a copy of said notice of resignation or notice of removal, as the case may be.
Upon such resignation or removal, the Company shall appoint in writing a new SAR
agent. If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of
20 days after it has been notified in writing of such resignation by the
resigning SAR Agent or after such removal, then the Holder of any SAR may apply
to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new SAR agent.
Any new SAR agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be
a corporation doing business under the laws of the United States or any state
thereof, in good standing and having a combined capital and surplus of not less
than $50,000,000. The combined capital and surplus of any such new SAR agent
shall be deemed to be the combined capital and surplus as set forth in the most
recent annual report of its condition published by such SAR agent prior to its
appointment, provided that such reports are published at least annually pursuant
to law or to the requirements of a Federal or state supervising or examining
authority. After acceptance in writing of such appointment by the new SAR
agent, it shall be vested with the same powers, rights, duties and
responsibilities as if it had been originally named herein as the SAR Agent,
without any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed; but if for any reason it
shall be necessary or expedient to execute and deliver any further assurance,
conveyance, act or deed, the same shall be done at the expense of the Company
and shall be legally and validly executed and delivered by the resigning or
removed SAR Agent. Not later than the effective date of any such appointment,
the Company shall give notice thereof to the resigning or removed SAR Agent.
Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section, however, or any defect
therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation of the SAR
Agent or the appointment of a new SAR agent, as the case may be.

(b) Any corporation into which the SAR Agent or any new SAR agent may
be merged or any corporation resulting from any consolidation to which the SAR
Agent or any new SAR Agent shall be a party, shall be a successor SAR Agent
under this Agreement without any further act, provided that such corporation
would be eligible for appointment as successor to the SAR Agent under the
provisions of Section 9.5(a). Any such successor SAR agent shall promptly cause
notice of its succession as SAR Agent to be mailed (by first-class mail, postage
prepaid) to each Holder of an SAR at such Holder's last address as shown on the
register of the Company maintained by the SAR Agent.

10. COVENANTS AND REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

diluted basis (I.E., taking into account the Warrants and SARs but not including

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

11.1. MONEY AND OTHER PROPERTY DEPOSITED WITH THE SAR AGENT. Any
moneys, securities or other property which at any time shall be deposited by the
Company or on its behalf with the SAR Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be
and are hereby assigned, transferred and set over to the SAR Agent in trust for
the purpose for which such moneys, securities or other property shall have been
deposited; but such moneys, securities or other property need not be segregated
from other funds, securities or other property except to the extent required by
law. The SAR Agent shall distribute any money deposited with it for payment and
distribution to the Holders by mailing by first-class mail a check in such
amount as is appropriate, to each such Holder at the address shown on the SAR
register of the Company, or as it may be otherwise directed in writing by such
Holder, upon surrender of such Holder's SARs. Any money deposited with the SAR

years after the date the money was deposited with the SAR Agent shall be paid to
the Company upon its request therefor.

11.2. PAYMENT OF TAXES. The Company shall pay all transfer, stamp
and other similar taxes that may be imposed in respect of the issuance or
delivery of the SARs or in respect of the issuance or delivery by the Company of
any securities upon exercise or exchange of the SARs with respect thereto. The
Company shall not be required, however, to pay any such tax or other charge
imposed in connection with any transfer involved in the issue of any certificate
for Warrants, 14% Debentures or other securities underlying the SARs or payment
of cash to any Person other than the Holder of an SAR Certificate surrendered
upon the exercise, exchange or purchase of an SAR, and in case of such transfer
or payment, the SAR Agent and the Company shall not be required to issue any
certificate for Warrants or pay any cash until such tax or charge has been paid
or it has been established to the SAR Agent's and the Company's satisfaction
that no such tax or other charge is due.

<PAGE>

37

11.3. SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES. Any SAR Certificate surrendered for
exercise, exchange or purchase shall, if surrendered to the Company, be
delivered to the SAR Agent, and all SAR Certificates surrendered or so delivered
to the SAR Agent shall be promptly cancelled by the SAR Agent and shall not be
reissued by the Company. The SAR Agent shall destroy such cancelled SAR
Certificates and deliver its certificate of destruction to the Company unless
the Company shall otherwise direct.

11.4. MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST AND STOLEN SAR CERTIFICATES. If
(a) any mutilated SAR Certificate is surrendered to the SAR Agent or (b) the
Company and the SAR Agent receive evidence to their satisfaction of the
destruction, loss or theft of any SAR Certificate, and there is delivered to the
Company and the SAR Agent such security or indemnity as may be required by them
to save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or
the SAR Agent that such SAR Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide
purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its written request the SAR Agent
shall countersign and deliver, in exchange for any such mutilated SAR
Certificate or in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen SAR Certificate, a
new SAR Certificate of like tenor and for a like aggregate number of SARs.

Upon the issuance of any new SAR Certificate under this Section 11.4,
the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or
other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and other
expenses (including the reasonable fees and expenses of the SAR Agent and of

shares of Common Stock thereof pursuant to the Warrant Agreement at an exercise
price (the "Exercise Price") of $0.00 per SAR. Certificates representing 14%
Debentures will not be issued for amounts less than $1,000, but cash will be
paid in lieu of such amounts.

In addition, each SAR entitles the Holder thereof, subject to the
provisions contained herein and in the SAR Agreement referred to below, to
acquire from the Company one Warrant for each SAR evidenced thereby at an
exchange price (the "Exchange Price") of $0.00 per SAR.

This SAR Certificate is issued under and in accordance with the SAR
Agreement, dated as of December 18, 1994 (the "SAR Agreement"), between the
Company and Chemical Bank, agent (the "SAR Agent", which term includes any
successor SAR Agent under the SAR Agreement), and is subject to the terms and
provisions contained in the SAR Agreement, to all of which terms and provisions
the Holder of this SAR Certificate consents by acceptance hereof. The SAR
Agreement is hereby incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.
Reference is hereby made to the SAR Agreement for a full statement of the
respective rights, limitations of rights, duties, obligations and immunities
thereunder of the Company, the SAR Agent and the Holders of the SARs.

This SAR certificate shall terminate and be void at the close of
business on the earliest of (i) March 31, 1995 in the event the lenders (the
"Lenders") under the Loan Agreement dated as of December 18, 1994 (the "Loan
Agreement") among the Company, the Lenders and Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company,
agent for the lenders, fail to fund even though all of the conditions precedent
set forth in Section 3.01 of the Loan Agreement have been satisfied, (ii)
December 31, 2007 and (iii) the first day on which no SARs are outstanding (the
earliest of such dates being referred to as the "Expiration Date").

As provided in the SAR Agreement and subject to the terms and
conditions therein set forth, the SARs shall be exercisable for 14% Debentures
from time to time on any Business Day beginning on the earliest of (i) the time
immediately after the Loans (as defined in the Loan Agreement) have been made
and the 14% Debentures have been purchased by Whitehall ("Whitehall"), (ii) such
time as any condition precedent specified in Section 3.01 of the Loan Agreement
(other than 3.01(c) as it relates to Sections 7.01(f) and (g) thereof) is no
longer capable of being fulfilled in accordance with the terms thereof and (ii)
March 31, 1995 and ending on the Expiration Date.

As provided in the SAR Agreement and subject to the terms and
conditions therein set forth, the SARs shall be exchangeable for Warrants from
time to time on any Business Day beginning on the earliest of (i) the time
immediately after the Loans have been made and the 14% Debentures have been
purchased by Whitehall, (ii) such time as any condition precedent set forth in
Section 3.01 of the Loan Agreement (other than 3.01(c) as its

<PAGE>

A-3

relates to Sections 7.01(f) and (g) thereof) is no longer capable of being
fulfilled in accordance with the terms thereof and (iii) March 31, 1995 and
ending on the Expiration Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that for so long as the
Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, restricts ownership
of the Common Stock by any one Person to no more than 9.8% of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock (the "Ownership Restriction"), a Holder may not exchange
any SARs for Warrants if, as a result of such exchange, such Holder would
receive Warrants exercisable into a number of shares of Common Stock that, when
added to the number, if any, of shares of Common Stock then held by such Holder
plus shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Warrants then held by such
Holder, would equal more than 9.8% of the number of shares Common Stock then
outstanding and shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of Warrants then
outstanding. Upon the execution of an amendment to such Certificate of
Incorporation with respect to the Ownership Restriction, the SARs shall
automatically be exchanged for Warrants on a one-for-one basis, subject to any
adjustments made on or prior to the date thereof, to the extent permitted under
such amendment. In such event, the SAR Agent will notify the Holders affected
thereby by first class mail and within 15 days of the date of such notice, such
Holders shall surrender their SAR Certificates for exchange to the extent
permitted under such amendment. Any such SARs not so surrendered by the close
of business on the fifteenth day following the date of such notice shall
automatically be deemed to have been exchanged.

In order to exercise or exchange an SAR, the registered holder hereof
must surrender this SAR Certificate at the office of the SAR Agent, with the
Exchange and/or Exercise Form on the reverse hereof duly executed by the Holder
hereof, with signature guaranteed as therein specified, together with any
required payment in full of the Exercise Price or Exchange Price, if any, then
in effect for the Underlying Securities as to which the SAR(s) represented by
this SAR Certificate are submitted for exercise or exchange, all subject to the
terms and conditions hereof and of the SAR Agreement. Any such payment of the
Exercise Price or Exchange Price shall be by certified or official bank check
drawn on a New York City bank payable to the order of the Company.

The Company shall pay all transfer, stamp and other similar taxes that
may be imposed in respect of the issuance or delivery of the SARs or in respect
of the issuance or delivery by the Company of any securities upon exercise or
exchange of the SARs with respect thereto. The Company shall not be required,
however, to pay any tax or other charge imposed in connection with any transfer
involved in the issue of any certificate for Warrants, 14% Debentures or other
securities underlying the SARs or payment of cash to any Person other than the
Holder of an SAR Certificate surrendered upon the exercise, exchange or purchase
of an SAR, and in case of such transfer or payment, the SAR Agent and the
Company shall not be required to issue any certificate for Warrants or pay any
cash until such tax or charge has been paid or it has been established to the
SAR Agent's and the Company's satisfaction that no such tax or other charge is
due.

payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge
payable in connection therewith.

Each taker and holder of this SAR Certificate by taking or holding the
same, consents and agrees that this SAR Certificate when duly endorsed in blank
shall be deemed negotiable and that when this SAR Certificate shall have been so
endorsed, the holder hereof may be treated by the Company, the SAR Agent and all

Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc.

New York, New York 10020

Whitehall Street Real Estate
Limited Partnership V
Goldman, Sachs & Co.
85 Broad Street
New York, New York 10004

Dear Ladies and Gentlemen:

This letter (the "Letter Agreement") will confirm the agreement of
Rockefeller Center Properties, Inc. (the "Company"), Whitehall Street Real
Estate Limited Partnership V ("Whitehall") and Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("GS")
regarding members of the Company's Board of Directors and certain other matters.
The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained herein constitute an
integral part of the transactions (the "Transactions") described in the letter,
dated November 17, 1994, from GS and Whitehall to the Company and that the
Company's obligations hereunder constitute additional consideration for
Whitehall and GS to enter into the Transactions.

Immediately after the consummation of the Transactions including
funding of the Floating Rate Notes and the 14% Debentures (the "Closing"), the
Company shall cause one member of the Board of Directors to resign from the
Company's Board of Directors and shall cause the Company to fill the vacancy
created by the resignation of such member of the Board of Directors with Mr.
Daniel M. Neidich, or another individual designated by GS not less than 5
business days prior to the date of the Closing and not reasonably disapproved by
the Board of Directors of the Company.

In addition, for so long as GS, its affiliates and/or Whitehall shall
collectively beneficially own shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01, of the
Company (the "Shares"), warrants issued pursuant to the Warrant Agreement, dated
as of December 18, 1994 (the "Warrants"), and/or stock appreciation rights
issued pursuant to the Stock Appreciation Rights Agreement, dated as of
December 18, 1994 (the "SARs"), which constitute (assuming that all of the then
outstanding SARs have been exchanged for Warrants and that such number of
Warrants, in addition to the Warrants then held by GS, its affiliates and/or
Whitehall, have been exercised for Common Stock) in the aggregate in excess of
five percent (5%) of the Shares then outstanding assuming all outstanding
Warrants have been exercised and all outstanding SARs have been converted into
Warrants and such Warrants have been exercised, the Company shall use its best
efforts to cause the Board of Directors of the Company to include one member
designated by GS, who shall not be reasonably disapproved by the Company (the
"GS Nominee") and shall use its best efforts to cause each committee

<PAGE>

Whitehall Street Real Estate 2
Limited Partnership V

of the Board of Directors of the Company to include such GS Nominee, such best
efforts to include the following: (i) recommending the GS Nominee to the
shareholders of the Company as a nominee to the Company's Board of Directors,
(ii) not hindering the nomination or election of the GS Nominee to the Company's
Board of Directors, (iii) designating the GS Nominee, if elected to the Board of
Directors of the Company, as a member of each Board committee currently existing
and (iv) ensuring that such GS Nominee is appointed to any committee created
after the date hereof (except for any temporary committee of independent
directors in respect of which the GS Nominee is not considered independent).
For purposes of this Letter Agreement, the determination of "beneficially own"
shall be made in accordance with Rule 13d-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended. In addition, GS and its affiliates shall be deemed to have
met the 5% test if the Company shall have taken any action (other than any
action to which GS or its affiliates shall have consented) that had the effect
of reducing the beneficial ownership of GS and its affiliates so that such
threshold was not met.

The Company also hereby agrees that, during the period specified in
the preceding paragraph, without the consent of the GS Nominee, the Board of
Directors of the Company will not (i) amend any provision of the Company's
bylaws relating to the size of the Board of Directors, to the removal of members
of the Board of Directors, or to vacancies on the Board of Directors, (ii) to
the extent authorized to amend the Company's Certificate of Incorporation
without the vote of the Company's stockholders, amend the Company's Certificate
of Incorporation with respect to the matters specified in (i) above, (iii)
recommend to the Company's stockholders an amendment to the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws relating to the matters specified in (i)
above, (iv) remove the GS Nominee other than for cause, in which event such
vacancy shall be filled with a new GS Nominee, or (v) change the size of the
Board of Directors.

It is understood that the Transactions as set forth in the relevant
definitive documentation, if any (including all transactions contemplated
thereby, which shall include without limitation any subsequent sale or other
transfer, exercise or exchange of any securities of the Company issued and to be
issued in connection therewith in accordance with their respective terms and
conditions), are not subject to the restrictions set forth in Article Eighth of
the Company's Certificate of Incorporation by virtue of the approval by the
"Continuing Directors" (as such term is defined in such Article Eighth) of the
Transactions and that no subsequent approval of the Continuing Directors is
required in connection therewith; IT BEING UNDERSTOOD that nothing contemplated
or permitted by the Transactions (including fluctuations in beneficial ownership
of the shares or any other Voting Stock (as defined in Article Eighth of the
Company's Certificate of Incorporation)) shall be deemed to make Whitehall, GS
or any of its affiliates an Acquiring Person (as defined in Article Eighth of
the Company's Certificate of Incorporation); and IT BEING FURTHER UNDERSTOOD
that nothing

<PAGE>

Whitehall Street Real Estate 3
Limited Partnership V

herein is intended to constitute the approval of any Business Combination (as
defined in Article Eighth of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation) not
included within the Transactions.

Promptly after the Warrants and the SARs shall have become
exercisable pursuant to their terms, the Company will amend its bylaws to
provide that, unless a different vote is specified in the General Corporation
Law of Delaware or in the Company's Certificate of Incorporation, a vote of
62.5% of the then outstanding voting power of the Company shall be required to
approve any action submitted to the stockholders of the Company (other than the
election of directors or ratification of appointment of auditors) if less than
62.5% of the Warrants and the SARs have approved of such action as provided in
the Warrant Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Warrant and SAR holders shall
appoint a representative and shall have given the Company notice of such
appointment for the purpose of polling the holders of the Warrants and the SARs
in respect of any such action who shall respond to the Company with respect to
any such action within five business days of the date of receipt the notice from
the Company as to any such action (IT BEING UNDERSTOOD that if no such response
is made in such time period, all of the holders of the Warrants and SARs shall
be deemed to have consented to the proposed action). For so long as at least 2%
of the aggregate amount of SARs and Warrants initially issued are outstanding,
the Company will not submit to stockholders for their approval any item that is
not required to be submitted by the General Corporation Law of Delaware, the
Company's Certificate of Incorporation and bylaws, the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission or the fiduciary duty of the Directors of
the Company as advised by counsel regularly engaged in Delaware corporate
matters other than any proposal to eliminate or relax the Limit contained in
Article Ninth (A) of the Company's Certificate of Incorporation.

The Company hereby acknowledges that, in view of the unique nature of
the Transactions, the violation of this Letter Agreement by the Company would
not be compensable in monetary damages and in the event that a court of
competent jurisdiction determines that the Company has breached the terms of
this Letter Agreement, Whitehall and GS shall be entitled to the remedy of
injunctive relief, including specific performance and the Company will not
oppose the granting of injunctive relief. The Company acknowledges that the
provisions of this Letter Agreement shall inure to the benefit of all Warrant
and SAR holders.

This Letter Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York, without regard for principles of
conflicts of law.

If the foregoing correctly reflects our understanding, please confirm
your acceptance by executing the enclosed counterpart of this Letter Agreement
and return it to

4%, or, in the event the interest rate conversion provided by Section 2.08 is
elected by the Agent, the Base Rate plus 3%, from the Closing Date through and

Interest Period thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence

extent permitted by law, interest on the Loans shall bear interest, payable on

2.04. THE NOTES. The Loans shall be evidenced by duly executed

2.05. PREPAYMENTS.

(a) VOLUNTARY PREPAYMENTS. The Borrower shall have the right to

Voluntary prepayments of the Loans shall be applied first to accrued but unpaid
interest and then to the principal balance of the Loans. Amounts prepaid
hereunder may not be reborrowed.

(b) MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS. On each Interest Payment Date commencing
June 1, 1995 through the Maturity Date the Borrower shall prepay the Loans in an
amount equal to Net Cash Flow calculated as of the last day of the most recent
fiscal quarter; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that for each fiscal year through 1999, the
prepayment to be made by the Borrower on the last Interest Payment Date in each
such fiscal year shall be in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the amount

Payments received after such time shall be deemed to have been received on the

whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a
Business Day, the due date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding
Business Day (subject to accrual of interest and fees for the period of such
extension). All computations of interest and fees shall be made on the basis of
actual number of days elapsed over a year of 360 days. Interest shall accrue
from and include the date of the Loans, but exclude the date on which the Loans
are repaid. All payments received from the Borrower hereunder shall be applied
in the following order: FIRST, to the payment of any costs and expenses and
other amounts due pursuant to Section 9.04; SECOND, to the payment of any amount
due under this Loan Agreement other than any amount referred to in this
sentence; THIRD, to the ratable payment of interest due on the Notes; FOURTH, to

<PAGE>

2.07. TAXES; REGULATORY CHANGE. (a) TAXES. (i) To the extent
permitted by law, all payments under this Loan Agreement and under the Notes
(including payments of principal and interest) shall be payable to each Lender
free and clear of any and all present and future taxes, levies, imposts, duties,
deductions, withholdings, fees, liabilities and similar charges (collectively,
the "Taxes"); PROVIDED, that "Taxes" shall not include taxes imposed on or
measured by the overall net income of each Lender by the United States of
America or any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, or
taxes on or measured by the net income of any foreign office, branch or
subsidiary of such Lender by any foreign country or subdivision thereof in which
such office, branch or subsidiary is doing business or is organized or
considered to be resident. If any Taxes are required to be withheld or deducted
from any amount payable under this Loan Agreement or any Note, then the amount
payable under this Loan Agreement or such Note shall be increased to the amount
which, after deduction from such increased amount of all Taxes required to be
withheld or deducted therefrom, will yield to such Lender the amount stated to
be payable under this Loan Agreement or such Note. The Borrower shall execute
and deliver to any Lender upon its request such further instruments as may be
necessary or desirable to give full force and effect to any such increase. The
Borrower shall also hold each Lender harmless and indemnify it for any stamp or
other similar taxes with respect to the preparation, execution, delivery,
recording or enforcement of the Loan Documents (all of which shall be included
within "Taxes"). If any of the Taxes specified in this Section 2.07(a) are paid
by any Lender, the Borrower shall, upon demand of such Lender, promptly
reimburse such Lender for such payments, together with any interest, penalties
and expenses incurred in connection therewith. The Borrower shall deliver to
the Agent certificates or other valid vouchers for all Taxes or other changes
deducted from or paid with respect to payments made by the Borrower hereunder.

(ii) If any Lender or the Agent receives an official notice of refund
in respect of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower
pursuant to this Section 2.07, it shall promptly notify the Borrower of the
availability of such refund and apply for such refund at the Borrower's expense.
If any Lender or the Agent receives a refund in respect of any Taxes as to which
it has been indemnified by the Borrower, it shall promptly pay such refund
(including interest and penalties, if any) to the Borrower, net of reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses of such Lender or the Agent.

-14-

<PAGE>

(iii) Each Lender organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside
the United States (a "Non-U.S. Lender"), on or prior to the date of its
execution and delivery of this Loan Agreement in the case of each original
Lender or on the date of the assignment and acceptance pursuant to which it
becomes a Lender in the case of each other Lender (in each such case, the
"Initial Date"), and from time to time thereafter as appropriate (but only so
long as such Lender remains lawfully able to do so), shall provide each of the
Borrower and the Agent two true and complete copies of Internal Revenue Service
Form 1001 or 4224 or (in the case of a Lender that has delivered to the Borrower
and the Agent a duly executed certificate described below) Form W-8, as
appropriate, or any successor or other form prescribed by the Internal Revenue
Service, certifying that such Non-U.S. Lender is exempt from United States
withholding tax on all payments pursuant to this Loan Agreement or the Notes or,
in the case of a Lender providing a Form W-8, certifying that the Lender is a
foreign corporation, partnership, estate or trust. If such Non-U.S. Lender
delivers a Form W-8, it shall thereafter deliver a certificate representing that
such Non-U.S. Lender is not a "bank" for the purposes of Section 881(c) of the
Code, is not a 10-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section
871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower and is not a controlled foreign
corporation related to the Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of
the Code). A Non-U.S. Lender shall not be entitled to indemnification under the
Loan Documents in respect of United States withholding tax to the extent that
the obligation to withhold amounts with respect to such tax is imposed under the
law (including for purposes of this subparagraph (iii), without limitation,
statutes, regulations, and proposed regulations) in existence on the Initial
Date or, with respect to payments to a new lending office, the date such Non-
U.S. Lender designated such new lending office with respect to a Loan. Nothing
in the preceding sentence shall release the Borrower from its obligation to
indemnify a Lender other than an original Lender in respect of United States
withholding taxes to the extent that those taxes are imposed as a result of a
change after the date hereof in the portfolio interest exemption. Further, for
any period with respect to which a Non-U.S. Lender has failed to provide the
Borrower with the appropriate form and, if applicable, certificate described in
this subsection (other than if the Lender is legally unable to provide such form
or certificate due to a change in law occurring subsequent to the date on which
a form originally was required to be provided, or if such form or certificate
otherwise is not required under the first sentence of this subsection (iii),
such Lender shall not be

-15-

<PAGE>

entitled to indemnification under the Loan Documents with respect to withholding
taxes imposed by the United States.

(b) REGULATORY CHANGE. If, as a result of any change in law or
regulation or in the interpretation thereof by any court or governmental or
administrative authority or the enactment of any law or regulation, (a) any
reserve, special deposit, capital adequacy or similar requirements (other than
such requirements as are taken into account in determining the LIBO Rate)
relating to any extensions of credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or
other liabilities of any Lender is imposed, modified or deemed applicable; or
(b) any other condition affecting a Loan subject to the LIBO Rate (other than in
respect of taxes covered by Section 2.07(a) or expressly excluded from the
definition of Taxes as specified in Section 2.07(a)) is imposed on any Lender
and such Lender reasonably determines that, by reason thereof, the cost to such
Lender of making or maintaining its Loan is increased, or any amount receivable
by such Lender hereunder in respect of any portion of its Loan is reduced, in
each case by an amount deemed by such Lender to be material (such increases in
cost and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called "Increased
Costs"), then the Borrower agrees that it will pay to such Lender upon its
request such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for
such Increased Costs to the extent such Lender reasonably determines that such
Increased Costs are allocable to its Loan. Each Lender will notify the Borrower
of any event occurring after the date hereof which will entitle such Lender to
compensation pursuant to this Section 2.07 as promptly as practicable after it
obtains knowledge thereof and determines to request such compensation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Borrower be required to
compensate any Lender for any portion of its income or franchise taxes, whether
or not attributable to payments made by such Lender. If any Lender requests
compensation under this Section 2.07, the Borrower may, by notice to such
Lender, require that such Lender furnish to the Borrower a statement setting
forth the basis for requesting such compensation and the method for determining
the amount thereof.

2.08. UNAVAILABILITY. Without limiting the effect of Section 2.07,
in the event that, (a) the Agent shall have determined in good faith after
reasonable investigation that dollar deposits in the principal amount of the
Loans are not generally available in the London interbank market, or
(b) reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the LIBO Rate, then, if the
Agent so elects, by notice to the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the

-16-

<PAGE>

then outstanding principal balance of the Loans shall be converted to a rate
equal to the then Base Rate as in effect from time to time plus 3%. If the
Agent elects to convert the interest rate applicable to the Loans to the Base
Rate plus 3% pursuant to the terms of this Section 2.08 the Borrower may, by
notice to the Agent, require that the Agent furnish to the Borrower a statement
setting forth the basis for such election.

2.09. BREAK FUNDING COSTS. The Borrower agrees that it will
reimburse each Lender on demand for any loss incurred or to be incurred by such
Lender in the reemployment of the funds released by any prepayment of any
principal balance of the Loans if such prepayment occurs other than on the last
day of an Interest Period. Such loss shall be the difference as reasonably
determined by such Lender between the amount that would have been realized by
such Lender for the remainder of such Interest Period based on the LIBO Rate
applicable for such Interest Period (without regard to the applicable spread
over the LIBO Rate referred to in Section 2.03) and any lesser amount that would
be realized by such Lender in reemploying the funds received in prepayment by
making loans of the same type (but utilizing the then applicable LIBO Rate) in
the principal amount prepaid during the period from the date of prepayment to
the last day of the then applicable Interest Period.

2.10. MITIGATION. The Lenders shall use reasonable efforts to avoid
or mitigate any indemnifiable Taxes, increased cost, reduced receivable or
suspension of the availability of the LIBO Rate under Sections 2.07 and 2.08 to
the greatest extent practicable (including transferring the Loan to an
affiliate) unless, in the opinion of any Lender, such efforts would be likely to
have any adverse effect upon it.

2.11. PRO RATA TREATMENT. Except to the extent otherwise provided
herein, each Loan, each payment or prepayment of principal of any Loan, and each
payment of interest on the Loans, shall be allocated pro rata among the Lenders.
The Agent agrees to forward to the Lenders such principal and interest payments
on the same Business Day as such amounts are received, collected or applied by
the Agent from the Borrower unless the Agent receives such amounts after
2:00 p.m., New York time, in which case such payments shall be forwarded by the
Agent to the Lenders on the next Business Day.

2.12. SHARING OF PAYMENTS. Each Lender agrees that, in the event
that any Lender shall obtain any payment

-17-

<PAGE>

in respect of any Loan owing to such Lender under this Loan Agreement through
the exercise of a right of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or otherwise in
excess of its pro rata share as provided for in this Loan Agreement, such Lender
shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders a participation in such Lenders'
Loans, in such amounts and with such other adjustments from time to time, as
shall be equitable in order that all Lenders share such payment in accordance
with their respective ratable shares as provided for in this Loan Agreement.
Each Lender further agrees that if a payment to a Lender (which is obtained by
such Lender through the exercise of a right of set-off, banker's lien,
counterclaim or otherwise) shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored,
each Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by
repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit
to each Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored.
The Borrower agrees that any Lender so purchasing such a participation may, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including
set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Loan or other obligation in the
amount of such participation.

be used for the purpose of purchasing or carrying any "margin stock" as defined
in Regulation G, T, U, or X or for the purpose of reducing or retiring any
Indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase or carry "margin stock"
or for any other purpose which might constitute this transaction a "purpose
credit" within the

<PAGE>

meaning of Regulation G, T, U or X. As of the Closing Date the Borrower does

and (ii) the restrictions on transfer contained in the 1985 Loan Agreement, the
Letters of Credit and the Title Insurance. The Borrower has not granted to any
other person any rights, recorded or unrecorded, in the Mortgage or the Mortgage
Note. To the best of the Borrower's knowledge, no person, other than the
Borrower, has any right or option, recorded or unrecorded, to acquire the Real
Estate or any portion thereof or interest therein. The Mortgage remains a valid
lien on all the Real Estate and on the Lessor's interest in all Leases (as
defined in the Mortgage), with a priority in all material respects no less than
its priority as of September 19, 1985 except as such priority may be affected by
the subordination referred to in Clause (ii) of Recital G to the Amendment and
Restatement of the Mortgage dated as of December 1, 1988. The outstanding
aggregate principal amount of the Mortgage Note is $1,300,000,000, and no

Common Stock were held in treasury, and there were no outstanding employee stock

transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents and except in respect of the
Indenture Securities, there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights,
options, warrants, conversion rights or agreements or commitments of any
character relating to the Borrower's authorized and issued, unissued or treasury
shares of capital stock, and the Borrower has not issued any debt securities,
other securities, rights or obligations that are currently outstanding and are
convertible into or exchangeable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe
for or acquire, capital stock of the Borrower.

payments that are due in escrow or trust accounts, except to the extent
otherwise prohibited by the 1985 Indenture and except that no such escrow shall
be required in respect of regularly scheduled payments on account of the Loans
and (f) the New Documents will be in such form and will contain such terms and
provisions as are necessary to comply with all applicable securities laws,

amended. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Borrower will provide the Lenders
with all such documents and information, financial or otherwise, assist in all
such due diligence and do such other things and enter into such other agreements

or the Letter Agreement shall fail to be in full force and effect or to
give the Collateral Agent, the Agent and the Lenders the Liens, rights,
powers and privileges purported to be created thereby (except insofar as
such failure is due to the act of the Collateral Agent, the Agent or any
Lender); or

(e) BANKRUPTCY, ETC. (i) The Borrower shall commence a voluntary
case concerning itself under the Bankruptcy Code in Title 11 of the United
States Code (as amended, modified, succeeded or replaced, from time to

other Indebtedness, or (y) default in the observance or performance of any
agreement or condition relating to any such Indebtedness or contained in
any instrument or agreement evidencing, securing or relating thereto, or

or permit, the holder or holders of such Indebtedness (or trustee or agent
on behalf of such holders) to cause (determined without regard to whether
any notice or lapse of time is required), any such Indebtedness, in an
amount of $1,000,000 or more, to become due prior to stated maturity, or
(ii) any such Indebtedness of the Borrower, in an amount of $1,000,000 or

pending appeal within the time permitted to appeal therefrom.

7.02 REMEDIES. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Agent
shall, upon the request and direction of the Required Lenders, by written notice
to the Borrower, take any of the following actions without prejudice to its
rights to enforce its claims against the Borrower, except as otherwise
specifically provided for herein:

(i) ACCELERATION OF LOAN. Declare the unpaid principal of and any
accrued interest in respect of the Loans and the Notes to be due whereupon
the same shall be immediately due and payable without presentment, demand,
protest or other notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived by the
Borrower; and

(ii) ENFORCEMENT OF RIGHTS. Enforce any and all Liens and security
interests in favor of the Agent and the Lenders in respect of the Notes and
the Loans and any other amounts due, including, without limitation, all
rights and interests created and existing under the Assignment of Mortgage,
the Collateral Trust Agreement and the Letter Agreement and all rights of
set-off;

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Event of Default
specified in Section 7.01(e) shall occur, then the Notes and the Loans shall
immediately become due and payable without the giving of any notice or other
action by the Agent or any Lender.

SECTION 8
THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS

8.01. THE AGENCY. Each Lender appoints Goldman Sachs Mortgage
Company as its Agent hereunder and irrevocably authorizes the Agent to take such
action on its behalf and to exercise such powers hereunder and thereunder as are
specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together
with such powers as are reasonably incidental hereto and thereto, including the
execution and delivery by the Agent on behalf of such Lender of the Collateral
Trust Agreement and any documents related thereto and the exercise by the Agent
of powers delegated to the Agent and the Lenders thereby, and the Agent hereby
accepts such appointment subject to the terms hereof. The relationship between
the Agent and the Lenders shall be that of agent and principal only and nothing
herein or therein

-38-

<PAGE>

shall be construed to constitute the Agent a trustee for any Lender nor to
impose on the Agent duties or obligations other than those expressly provided
for herein.

8.02. THE AGENT'S DUTIES. The Agent shall promptly forward to each
Lender copies, or notify each Lender as to the contents, of all notices and
other communications received from the Borrower pursuant to the terms of this
Loan Agreement, the Assignment of Mortgage, the Collateral Trust Agreement and
the Letter Agreement and, in the event that the Borrower fails to pay when due
the principal of or interest on any Loan, the Agent shall promptly give notice
thereof to the Lenders. As to any other matter not expressly provided for
herein or therein, the Agent shall have no duty to act or refrain from acting
with respect to the Borrower, except upon the instructions of the Required
Lenders. The Agent shall not be bound by any waiver, amendment, supplement, or
modification of this Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents which affects
its duties hereunder and thereunder, unless it shall have given its prior
written consent thereto. The Agent shall have no duty to ascertain or inquire
as to the performance or observance of any of the terms, conditions, covenants
or agreements binding on the Borrower pursuant to this Loan Agreement, the
Assignment of Mortgage, the Collateral Trust Agreement or the Letter Agreement
nor shall it be deemed to have knowledge of the occurrence of any Default or
Event of Default (other than a failure of the Borrower to pay when due the
principal or interest on any Loan), unless it shall have received written notice
from the Borrower or a Lender specifying such Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default".

8.03. THE AGENT'S LIABILITIES. Each of the Lenders and the Borrower
agrees that (i) neither the Agent in such capacity nor any of its officers or
employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of
them hereunder except for its or their own gross negligence or wilful
misconduct, (ii) neither the Agent in such capacity nor any of its officers or
employees shall be liable for any action taken or omitted to be taken by any of
them in good faith in reliance upon the advise of counsel, independent public
accountants or other experts selected by the Agent, and (iii) the Agent in such
capacity shall be entitled to rely upon any notice, consent, certificate,
statement or other document (including any telegram, cable, telex, facsimile or
telephone transmission) believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have
been signed and/or sent by the proper Persons.

-39-

<PAGE>

8.04. THE AGENT AS A LENDER. The Agent shall have the same rights
and powers hereunder as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it
were not the Agent, and the terms "Lender" or "Lenders", unless the context
otherwise indicated, include the Agent in its individual capacity. The Agent
may, without any liability to account, maintain deposits or credit balances for,
invest in, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking business
with the Borrower or any affiliate of the Borrower as if it were any other
Lender and without any duty to account therefor to the other Lenders.

8.05. LENDER CREDIT DECISION. Neither the Agent nor any of its
officers or employees has any responsibility for, gives any guaranty in respect
of, nor makes any representation to the Lenders as to, (i) the condition,
financial or otherwise, of the Borrower or the truth of any representation or
warranty given or made herein or in any other Loan Document, or in connection
herewith or therewith or (ii) the validity, execution, sufficiency,
effectiveness, construction, adequacy, enforceability or value of this Loan
Agreement, the Assignment of Mortgage, the Collateral Trust Agreement or the
Letter Agreement or any other document or instrument related hereto or thereto.
Except as specifically provided herein and in the Assignment of Mortgage, the
Collateral Trust Agreement and the Letter Agreement to which the Agent is a
party, the Agent shall have no duty or responsibility, either initially or on a
continuing basis, to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
with respect to the operations, business, property, condition or
creditworthiness of the Borrower, whether such information comes into the
Agent's possession on or before the date hereof or at any time thereafter. Each
Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Agent or any other Lender, based on such documents and information as it has
deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this
Loan Agreement and to authorize the Agent to execute on its behalf the
Collateral Trust Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will
independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender, based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Loan Agreement or any other Loan Document.

8.06. INDEMNIFICATION. Each Lender agrees (which agreement shall
survive payment of the Loans and the Notes) to indemnify the Agent, to the
extent not reimbursed by the Borrower, ratably in accordance with their Loans
(as of the

-40-

<PAGE>

time of the incurrence of the liability being indemnified against), from and
against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, claims, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted
against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of this Loan Agreement
or any other Loan Document, or any action taken or omitted to be taken by the
Agent hereunder or thereunder; PROVIDED, that no Lender shall be liable for any
portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions,
judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements resulting from the gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of the Agent or any of its officers or
employees. Without limiting the foregoing, each Lender agrees to reimburse the
Agent promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any out-of-pocket expenses
(including counsel fees) incurred by the Agent in such capacity in connection
with the preparation, execution or enforcement of, or legal advice in respect of
rights or responsibilities under, this Loan Agreement, the Assignment of
Mortgage, the Collateral Trust Agreement or the Letter Agreement or any
amendments or supplements hereto or thereto, to the extent that the Agent is not
reimbursed for such expenses by the Borrower.

8.07 SUCCESSOR AGENT. The Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrower, and the Agent may be
removed at any time by the Required Lenders by giving written notice thereof to
the Agent, the other Lenders and the Borrower at least 10 Business Days prior to
the effective date of such removal. Upon any such resignation or removal, the
Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Agent. If no
successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall
have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the resigning Agent's giving
of notice of resignation, or the Required Lenders' giving notice of removal, as
the case may be, the resigning or removed Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders,
appoint a successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized under the
laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and having a
combined capital and surplus of at least $250,000,000. Upon the acceptance of
any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent
shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers
privileges and duties of the resigned or removed Agent, and the resigned or
removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this
Loan Agreement. After any Agent's resignation or removal hereunder as Agent,
the provisions of this Section 8 shall

-41-

<PAGE>

inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while
it was Agent under this Loan Agreement.

9.02. BENEFIT OF AGREEMENT; ASSIGNMENTS AND PARTICIPATIONS.

(a) This Loan Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the respective successors and assigns of the
parties hereto; PROVIDED that

-42-

<PAGE>

the Borrower may not assign and transfer any of its interests without prior
written consent of the Lenders.

(b) Any Lender may at any time grant to one or more banks or other
institutions (each a "Participant") participating interests in its Loan. In the
event of any such grant by a Lender of a participating interest to a
Participant, whether or not upon notice to the Borrower and the Agent, such
Lender shall remain responsible for the performance of its obligations
hereunder, and the Borrower and the Agent shall continue to deal solely and
directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's rights and
obligations under this Loan Agreement. Any agreement pursuant to which any
Lender may grant such a participating interest shall provide that such Lender
shall retain the sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the
Borrower hereunder including the right to approve any amendment, modification or
waiver of any provision of this Loan Agreement; PROVIDED, that such
participation agreement may provide that such Lender will not agree to any
modification, amendment or waiver of this Loan Agreement described in clauses
(i) through (vi), inclusive, of Section 9.05 without the consent of the
Participant. The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 2.07, 2.09 and 9.04 with respect to its participating
interest; PROVIDED, that all amounts payable to a Lender for the account of a
Participant under Sections 2.07, 2.09 and 9.04 shall be determined as if such
Lender had not granted such participation to the Participant.

(c) Any Lender may at any time assign to one or more banks or other
institutions (each as "Assignee") all or a proportionate part, of its rights and
obligations under this Loan Agreement and its Note, and such Assignee shall
assume such rights and obligations, pursuant to an instrument executed by such
Assignee, such transferor Lender and the Agent. Upon execution and delivery of
such an instrument, notification to the Borrower of such Assignment and payment
by such Assignee to such transferor Lender of an amount equal to the purchase
price agreed between such transferor Lender and such Assignee, such Assignee
shall be a Lender party to this Loan Agreement and shall have all the rights and
obligations of a Lender and the transferor Lender shall be released from its
obligations hereunder to a corresponding extent. Upon the consummation of any
assignment pursuant to this subsection (c), the transferor Lender, the Agent and
the Borrower shall make appropriate arrangements so that, if required, a new
Note is issued to the Assignee.

-43-

<PAGE>

(d) The Agent shall maintain at its address referred to in Section
9.01 a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders
and the principal amount of the Loans owing to each Lender from time to time
(the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding
for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Agent and the
Lenders shall treat only the Person whose name is recorded in the Register as a
Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The Register shall be
available for inspection by the Borrower or any Lender at any reasonable time
and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

9.03. NO WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. No failure or delay on the
part of the Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or
under the Assignment of Mortgage, the Collateral Trust Agreement or the Letter
Agreement and no course of dealing between the Borrower and any Lender shall
operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any
right, power or privilege hereunder or under the Assignment of Mortgage, the
Collateral Trust Agreement or the Letter Agreement preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege
hereunder or thereunder. The rights and remedies provided herein are cumulative
and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which the Lenders would otherwise
have. No notice to or demand on the Borrower in any case shall entitle the
Borrower to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the Lenders to any other
or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

9.04. PAYMENT OF EXPENSES; INDEMNIFICATION. The Borrower agrees to:

(i) pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of the
Agent in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery and administration of this Loan Agreement, the Assignment of
Mortgage, the Collateral Trust Agreement and the Letter Agreement and the
documents and instruments referred to therein and in connection with the
resale of the Loans, the exchange of the Notes for the New Debt and the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of any New Documents as
contemplated by Section 5.09 (including, without limitation, the fees and
expenses of Sullivan & Cromwell and Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton,
special counsel to the Agent, and any indenture trustee, administrative
agent

-44-

<PAGE>

or like parties in respect of the New Debt, and the reasonable travel
expenses of employees of the Agent) and any amendment, waiver or consent
relating hereto or thereto including, but not limited to, any such amend-
ments, waivers or consents resulting from or related to any work-out,
renegotiation or restructure relating to the performance by the Borrower
under this Loan Agreement and of the Agent and the Lenders in connection
with enforcement of the Assignment of Mortgage, the Collateral Trust
Agreement and the Letter Agreement and the documents and instruments
referred to therein (including, without limitation, the fees and disburse-
ments of counsel for the Agent and the Lenders);

(ii) pay and hold the Agent and the Lenders harmless from and
against any and all present and future stamp and other similar taxes with
respect to the foregoing matters and save the Agent and the Lenders
harmless from and against any and all liabilities with respect to or
resulting from any delay or omission (other than to the extent attributable
to the Agent or the Lenders) to pay such taxes;

(iii) indemnify the Agent and the Lenders, their respective officers,
directors, partners, employees, representatives, affiliates and agents from
and hold each of them harmless against any and all losses, liabilities,
claims, damages or expenses incurred by any of them as a result of, or
arising out of, or in any way related to, or by reason of, any
investigation, litigation or other proceeding (whether or not the Agent or
any Lender is a party thereto) related to the entering into and/or
performance of this Agreement, the Assignment of Mortgage, the Collateral
Trust Agreement or the Letter Agreement or the use of proceeds of the Loans
hereunder or the consummation of any other transactions contemplated in
this Agreement, the Assignment of Mortgage, the Collateral Trust Agreement
or the Letter Agreement (including the resale of the Loans and the exchange
of the Notes as contemplated by Section 5.09), including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel incurred in
connection with any such investigation, litigation or other proceeding, as
the same are incurred (but excluding any such losses, liabilities, claims,
damages or expenses to the extent incurred by reason of gross negligence or
willful misconduct on the part of the Person to be indemnified); and

-45-

<PAGE>

(iv) if the indemnification provided for in Section 9.04(iii) is
unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in
respect of any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions
in respect thereof) referred to therein, then the Borrower shall contribute
to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such
losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (or actions in respect
thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
benefits received by the Borrower on the one hand and the Lenders and the
Agent on the other from the consummation of the transactions contemplated
in this Loan Agreement. If, however, the allocation provided by the
immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then
each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by
such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not
only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on
the one hand and the Lenders and the Agent on the other in connection with
the actions which resulted in such losses, liabilities, claims, damages or
expenses (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Borrower
on the one hand and the Agent and the Lenders on the other hand shall be
deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the
Loans (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the net
fees paid in accordance with Section 3.01(g) and retained by the
indemnified Agent or Lender. The relative fault shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the action of the Borrower on the
one hand or the Lenders and the Agent on the other and the parties relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
prevent such statement or omission. The Borrower and the Lenders and the
Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contributions
pursuant to this subsection (iv) were determined by any method of
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
referred to above in this subsection (iv). The amounts paid or payable by
an indemnified party as a result of the losses, liabilities, claims,
damages or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in
this subsection (iv) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating or defending any such action or claim, as the same are
incurred.

-46-

<PAGE>

Neither the Agent nor any Lender, nor any of their partners, directors,
officers, agents or employees, shall be liable to the Borrower for any action
taken or omitted to be taken by it or any of them under or in connection with
any Loan Document, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct
attributable to such Person.

9.05. AMENDMENTS, WAIVERS AND CONSENTS. Any provision of this Loan
Agreement, the Notes, the Assignment of Mortgage, the Collateral Trust Agreement
or the Letter Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment
or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Borrower and the Required Lenders
(and, if the rights or duties of the Agent are affected thereby, by the Agent);
PROVIDED, that no such amendment, waiver or modification shall, unless signed by
all the Lenders (i) subject any Lender to any additional obligation, (ii) reduce
the principal of or rate of interest on any Loan or any fees hereunder, (iii)
postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal of or interest on any Loan
or any fees hereunder, (iv) change the percentage of the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of the Notes, or the number of Lenders, which shall be required
for the Lenders or any of them to take any action under this Section 9.05 or any
other provision of this Loan Agreement, (v) release all or substantially all of
the collateral for the Loans or (vi) amend or waive the provisions of Section
6.12 or this Section 9.05.

9.06. COUNTERPARTS. This Loan Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. It
shall not be necessary in making proof of this Loan Agreement to produce or
account for more than one such counterpart.

9.07. HEADINGS. The headings of the sections and subsections hereof
are provided for convenience only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
construction of any provision of this Loan Agreement.

9.08. SURVIVAL OF INDEMNITIES. All indemnities set forth herein,
including, without limitation, in Section 9.04, shall survive the execution and
delivery of this Loan Agreement, the making of the Loan, and the repayment of
the Loan and other obligations hereunder.

-47-

<PAGE>

9.09. GOVERNING LAW; SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; VENUE.

(a) THIS LOAN AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. Nothing herein shall affect the right of the
Agent or any Lender to commence legal proceedings or to otherwise proceed
against the Borrower in any other jurisdiction.

(b) The Borrower hereby irrevocably waives any objection which it may
now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any of the aforesaid actions or
proceedings arising out of or in connection with this Loan Agreement, the
Assignment of Mortgage, the Collateral Trust Agreement or the Letter Agreement
brought in the courts referred to in subsection (a) hereof and hereby further
irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any such court that any
such action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum.

(c) THE BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
LOAN AGREEMENT, ANY OF THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
THEREBY.

9.10. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this Loan Agreement is
determined to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be
fully severable and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and
effect and shall be construed without giving effect to the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable provisions.

9.11. ENTIRETY. This Loan Agreement together with the other Loan
Documents represents the entire agreement of the parties hereto and thereto, and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, if any,
relating to the Loan Documents or the transactions contemplated herein;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing contained herein shall affect any of the
obligations of the Borrower to Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Whitehall (and their
respective affiliates) under the letter of intent, dated November 17, 1994 among
the Borrower and Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Whitehall.

9.12. SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. All
representations and warranties made by the Borrower

-48-

<PAGE>

herein shall survive delivery of the Notes and the making of the Loans
hereunder.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties hereto has caused a
counterpart of this Loan Agreement to be duly executed under seal and delivered
as of the date first above written.
