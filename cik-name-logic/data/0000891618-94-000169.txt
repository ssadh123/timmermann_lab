<PAGE> 20

12

SECTION 104. Acts of Holders; Record Dates.

(a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver
or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders may
be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar
tenor signed by such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing;
and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become
effective when such instrument or instruments are received by the Trustee and,
where it is hereby expressly required, by the Company. Such instrument or
instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein
sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or
instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing
appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture
and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company,
if made in the manner provided in this Section.

(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such instrument
or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such execution or by a
certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by law to take
acknowledgements of deeds, certifying that the individual signing such
instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such
execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual
capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof
of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or
writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved
in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.

(c) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security Register.

(d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver
or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder of the
same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the registration of
transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in respect of
anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the
<PAGE> 21

13
Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made upon
such Security.

(e) The Company may, in the circumstances permitted by the Trust Indenture
Act, fix any day as the record date for the purpose of determining the Holders
of Securities of any series entitled to give or take any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, or to vote on
any action, authorized or permitted to be given or taken by Holders of
Securities of such series. If not set by the Company prior to the first
solicitation of a Holder of Securities of such series made by any Person in
respect of any such action, or, in the case of any such vote, prior to such
vote, the record date for any such action or vote shall be the 30th day (or, if
later, the date of the most recent list of Holders required to be provided
pursuant to Section 701) prior to such first solicitation or vote, as the case
may be. With regard to any record date for action to be taken by the Holders of
one or more series of Securities, only the Holders of Securities of such series
on such date (or their duly designated proxies) shall be entitled to give or
take, or vote on, the relevant action. With regard to any record date set
pursuant to this paragraph, the Holders of Outstanding Securities of the
relevant series on such record date (or their duly appointed agents), and only
such Persons, shall be entitled to give or take the relevant action, whether or
not such Holders remain Holders after such record date. With regard to any
action that may be given or taken hereunder only by Holders of a requisite
principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any series (or their duly
appointed agents) and for which a record date is set pursuant to this paragraph,
the Company may, at its option, set an expiration date after which no such
action purported to be given or taken by any Holder shall be effective hereunder
unless given or taken on or prior to such expiration date by Holders of the
requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such
record date (or their duly appointed agents). On or prior to any expiration date
set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company may, on one or more occasions at its
option, extend such date to any later date. Nothing in this paragraph shall
prevent any Holder (or any duly appointed agent thereof) from giving or taking,
after any expiration date, any action identical to, or, at any time, contrary to
or different from, any action given or taken, or purported to have been given or
taken, hereunder by a Holder on or prior to such date, in which event the
Company may set a record date in respect thereof pursuant to this paragraph.

(f) Without limiting the foregoing, a Holder entitled hereunder to give or
take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so
<PAGE> 22

14
with regard to all or any part of the principal amount of such Security or by
one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such
appointment with regard to all or any different part of such principal amount.

SECTION 105. Notices, Etc., to Trustee and Company.

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or
Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be
made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,

(1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company shall be sufficient
for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing
to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Corporate
Trust Administration provided, however, that such notice shall not be
deemed to be given until received by the Trustee, or

(2) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient
for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if
in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Company
addressed to it at the address of its principal office specified in the
first paragraph of this instrument or at any other address previously
furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company; provided, however, that
such notice shall not be deemed to be given until received by the Company.

SECTION 106. Notice to Holders; Waiver.

Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any event, such
notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided)
if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder affected
by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later
than the latest date (if any), and not earlier than the earliest date (if any),
prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is
given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any
notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such
notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice
in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to
receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be
the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with
the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity
of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.
<PAGE> 23

15
In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of
any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such
notification as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute
a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

SECTION 107. Conflict with Trust Indenture Act.

If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with a provision of
the Trust Indenture Act that is required under such Act to be a part of and
govern this Indenture, the latter provision shall control. If any provision of
this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act
that may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to
apply to this Indenture as so modified or to be excluded, as the case may be.

SECTION 108. Effect of Headings and Table of Contents.

The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for
convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.

SECTION 109. Successors and Assigns.

All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Company shall bind
its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.

SECTION 110. Separability Clause.

In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Securities shall be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

SECTION 111. Benefits of Indenture.

Nothing in this Indenture or in the Securities, express or implied, shall
give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their successors
hereunder, any Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Security Registrar and the
Holders, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this
Indenture.

SECTION 112. Governing Law.

This Indenture and the Securities shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
<PAGE> 24

16
SECTION 113. Legal Holidays.

In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Repayment
Date or Stated Maturity of any Security shall not be a Business Day at any Place
of Payment, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or the
Securities (other than a provision of the Securities of any series which
specifically states that such provision shall apply in lieu of this Section))
payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made at such
Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business
Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the
Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Repayment Date or at the Stated
Maturity, provided that no interest shall accrue for the period from and after
such Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date, Repayment Date or Stated Maturity,
as the case may be.

issued at the same time and, unless otherwise provided, a series may be reopened

If any of the terms of the Securities of any series are established by
action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an appropriate record of
such action shall be certified by the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the
Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the
Officer's Certificate setting forth the terms of the series.

SECTION 302. Denominations.

SECTION 303. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.

The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman
of the Board, its Vice Chairman of the Board, its President, one of its Vice
Presidents or its Treasurer, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon
attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The signature of
any of these officers on the Securities may be manual or facsimile.

Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who
were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company,
notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such

At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this
Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the
<PAGE> 37

29
Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the
authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance
with the Company Order (which may provide that Securities that are the subject
thereof will be authenticated and delivered by the Trustee from time to time
upon the telephonic or written order of Persons designated in said Company Order
and that such Persons are authorized to determine such terms and conditions of
said Securities as are specified in the Company Order) shall authenticate and
deliver such Securities. If the form or terms of the Securities of the series
have been established in or pursuant to one or more Board Resolutions as
permitted by Sections 201 and 301, in authenticating such Securities, and
accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to
such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to
Section 601) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel
stating,

(1) if the form of such Securities has been established by or pursuant
to a Board Resolution as permitted by Section 201, that such form has been
established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;

(2) if the terms of such Securities have been established by or
pursuant to a Board Resolution as permitted by Section 301, that such terms
have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
and

(3) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the
Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any
conditions specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and
legally binding obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with
their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles
and to such other matters as counsel may specify.

If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be
required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities
pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or
immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner
which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding
paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one
time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise
required
<PAGE> 38

30
pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel otherwise
required pursuant to such preceding paragraph at or prior to the time
authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are delivered
at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security
of such series to be issued and contemplate issuance of all Securities of such
series.

Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.

No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be
valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a
certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein
executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any
Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security
has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder
but never issued and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such
Security to the Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309, for all
purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been
authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the
benefits of this Indenture.

SECTION 304. -- Temporary Securities.

Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company
may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver,
temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed
or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the
tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they are issued and with
such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as
the officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their
execution of such Securities.

If temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause
definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay.
After the preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary
Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of
such series upon surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the
office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to Section 1002 in a Place
of Payment for that series for the purpose of exchanges of Securities of such
series, without charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any
<PAGE> 39

31
one or more temporary Securities of any series the Company shall execute and the
Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more
definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of
a like aggregate principal amount and tenor. Until so exchanged the temporary
Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits
under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series and tenor.

SECTION 305. -- Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.

The Company shall cause to be kept at an office or agency to be maintained
by the Company in accordance with Section 1002 a register (being the combined
register of the Security Registrar and all transfer agents designated pursuant
to Section 1002 for the purpose of registration of transfer of Securities and
sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject
to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide
for the registration of Securities and of transfers of Securities. The Trustee
is hereby appointed "Security Registrar" for the purpose of registering
Securities and transfers of Securities as herein provided.

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Security of any series
at the office or agency maintained pursuant to Section 1002 for such purpose in
a Place of Payment for that series, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or
transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized
denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor.

At the option of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for
other Securities of the same series of any authorized denominations and of a
like aggregate principal amount and tenor, upon surrender of the Securities to
be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any Securities are so
surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, the Securities which the Holder making the exchange is
entitled to receive.

All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of
Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same
debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities
surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

Every Security presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for
exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee) be duly endorsed,
or be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
<PAGE> 40

32
satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by the
Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.

No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or
exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection
with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than
exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906, 1107 or 1404 not involving any transfer.

The Company shall not be required (a) to issue, register the transfer of or
exchange Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of
business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of
Securities of that series selected for redemption under Section 1103 and ending
at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (b) to register the
transfer of or exchange any Security so selected for redemption in whole or in
part, except in the case of any Security to be redeemed in part, the portion
thereof not to be redeemed.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, any Global Security
shall be exchangeable pursuant to this Section 305 for Securities registered in
the names of Persons other than the Depositary for such Global Security or its
nominee only when (a) such Depositary notifies the Company and the Trustee in
writing that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global
Security or if at any time such Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency
registered under the Exchange Act, and a successor Depositary is not appointed
by the Company within 90 days, (b) the Company in its sole discretion determines
that Securities shall no longer be represented by a Global Security and executes
and delivers to the Trustee a Company Order that such Global Security shall be
so exchangeable, (c) there shall have occurred and be continuing an Event of
Default or an event which, with the giving of notice or lapse of time, or both,
would constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Securities represented
by such Global Security or (d) there shall exist such other circumstances, if
any, as shall be specified for this purpose as contemplated by Section 301. Any
Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to clause (a), (b), (c) or (d)
above, shall be surrendered by the Depositary, or such other depositary as shall
be specified in the Company Order with respect thereto, to the Trustee, as the
agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or in part, for definitive
Securities without charge, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in
exchange for each portion of such permanent Global Security, an equal aggregate
principal amount of definitive Securities,
<PAGE> 41

33
executed by the Company, of the same series of authorized denominations and of
like tenor as the portion of such Global Security to be exchanged, which shall
be in the form of registered Securities as provided in the Company Order.

Every Security authenticated and delivered upon registration of transfer
of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security other than pursuant to
clauses (a), (b), (c) or (d) in the preceding paragraph, whether pursuant to
this Section, Sections 304, 306, 906, 1107 or 1404 or otherwise, shall be
authenticated and delivered in the form of, and shall be, a Global Security.

SECTION 306. -- Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.

If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall
execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a
new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and
bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (a) evidence to
their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (b)
such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and
any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the
Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide
purchaser, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security
of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number
not contemporaneously outstanding.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become
or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may,
instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.

Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may
require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including
the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.

Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of
any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional
contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or
stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be
entitled
<PAGE> 42

34
to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and
all other Securities of that series duly issued hereunder.

The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the
extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or
payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

SECTION 307. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.

Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to
any series of Securities, interest on any Security which is payable, and is
punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid
to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor
Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date
for such interest.

In the case of Securities represented by a Global Security registered in
the name of or held by a Depositary or its nominee, unless otherwise specified
by Section 301, payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any,
will be made to the Depositary or its nominee, as the case may be, as the
registered owner or Holder of such Global Security. None of the Company, the
Trustee, any Paying Agent, any Authenticating Agent nor the Security Registrar
for such Securities will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of
the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership
interest in a Global Security or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any
records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.

Any interest on any Security of any series which is payable, but is not
punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein
called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the Holder
on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and
such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each
case, as provided in Clause (1) or (2) below:

(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to
the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their
respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business
on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which
shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the
Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid
on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and
at the same time the Company shall deposit with the
<PAGE> 43

35
Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be
paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the
proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the
benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this
Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for
the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days
and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not
less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the
proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such
Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company,
shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and
the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid,
to each Holder of Securities of such series at his address as it appears in
the Security Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record
Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the
Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest
shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series
(or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of
business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable
pursuant to the following Clause (2).

(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the
Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with
the requirements of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be
listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after
notice is given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment
pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable
by the Trustee.

At the option of the Company, interest on Securities of any series that
bear interest may be paid by mailing a check to the address of the Person
entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register, except
as otherwise provided pursuant to Section 301.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Security
delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange
for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued
and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.
<PAGE> 44

SECTION 308. Persons Deemed Owners.

Prior to due presentment of a Security for registration of transfer, the
Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the
Person in whose name such Security is registered as the owner of such Security
for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of and any premium and (except
as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301(3) and subject to Section
307) any interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever,
whether or not such Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee
nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the
contrary.

In the case of a Global Security, so long as the Depositary for such Global
Security, or its nominee, is the registered owner of such Global Security, such
Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole
owner or Holder of the Securities represented by such Global Security for all
purposes under this Indenture. Except as provided in Section 305, owners of
beneficial interests in a Global Security will not be entitled to have
Securities that are represented by such Global Security registered in their
names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of such
Securities in definitive form and will not be considered the owners or Holders
thereof under this Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Global Security, nothing
herein shall (a) prevent the Company, the Trustee, or any agent of the Company
or the Trustee, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other
authorization furnished by a Depositary or (b) impair, as between a Depositary
and holders of beneficial interests in any Global Security, the operation of
customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of the Depositary as
Holder of such Global Security.

None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security
Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the
records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership
interests of a Security issued in global form or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.

the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated and
delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner
whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery
to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated
hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so
delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be

in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled

with its customary practices and the Trustee shall from time to time, or upon
request by the Company, deliver to the Company certificates of destruction with
respect thereto.

of any series, interest on the Securities of each series shall be computed on

<PAGE> 46

38
(B) all such Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation

(i) have become due and payable, or

(ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity
within one year and are not repayable at the option of the Holder
prior thereto, or

(iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under
arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice

the Company and are not repayable at the option of the Holder
prior thereto,

and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has
deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in
trust for the purpose, lawful money of the United States or U.S.
Government Obligations which through the payment of interest and
principal in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will
provide lawful money not later than the due dates of principal (and
premium, if any) or interest, or any combination thereof, in an amount
sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such

Trustee shall be required to execute an instrument acknowledging satisfaction
and discharge of this Indenture only if requested to do so with respect to the
Securities of all series to which it is Trustee and if the other conditions
thereto are met. In the event there are two or more Trustees hereunder, then the
effectiveness of any such instrument shall be conditioned upon receipt of such
instruments from all Trustees hereunder.
<PAGE> 47

obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 607, the obligations of
the Trustee to any Authenticating Agent under Section 614 and, if money shall

the Company), in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this
Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent
(including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may
determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal and any premium and
interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the Trustee.

<PAGE> 50

SECTION 502. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time
Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the
Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities
of that series may declare the principal amount (or, if any of the Securities of
that series are Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of the
principal amount of such Securities as may be specified in the terms thereof) of
all of the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a
notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and
upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified amount) shall
become immediately due and payable.

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to
Securities of any series has been made, but before a judgment or decree for
payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this
Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the
Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:

(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum
sufficient to pay

(A) all overdue interest on all Securities of that series,

(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of
that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration
of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates
prescribed therefor in such Securities, to the extent that payment of
such interest is lawful,

(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful,
interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed
therefor in such Securities, and

(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel;

and

(2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series,
other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that series
<PAGE> 51

43
which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been
cured or waived as provided in Section 513.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair
any right consequent thereon.

SECTION 503. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.

The Company covenants that if

(1) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security
when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a
period of 30 days, or

(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if
any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof, or

(3) default is made in the payment of any sinking or purchase fund or
analogous obligation when the same becomes due by the terms of the
Securities of any series, and any such default continues for any period of
grace provided with respect to the Securities of such series.

the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the
Holder of any such Security (or the Holders of any such series in the case of
clause (3) above), the whole amount then due and payable on any such Security
(or on the Securities of any such series in the case of clause (3) above) for
principal and any premium and interest and, to the extent that payment of such
interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal and
premium and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor by
the terms of any such Security (or of Securities of any such series in the case
of clause (3) above); and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be
sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee,
its agents and counsel and all other amounts owing the Trustee under Section
607.

If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the
Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a
judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may
prosecute such proceedings to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same
against the Company or any other obligor upon the Securities of such series and
collect the money adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner
<PAGE> 52

44
provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon
such Securities, wherever situated.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce
its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such
appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to
protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any
covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power
granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

SECTION 504. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.

In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company (or any other
obligor upon the Securities), its property or its creditors, the Trustee shall
be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, to
take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture Act in order to
have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such proceeding. In
particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or
other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the
same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator
or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized
by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the
Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments to the Trustee and, in the
event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to
the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents
and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 607.

No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to
authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities
or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in
respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

SECTION 505. Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities.

All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may
be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the
<PAGE> 53

45
Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any
such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as
trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision
for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of
the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been
recovered.

SECTION 506. Application of Money Collected.

Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be
applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and,
in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal or any premium
or interest, upon presentation of the Securities and the notation thereon of the
payment if only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under Section
607;

SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for
principal of and any premium and interest on the Securities in respect of
which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected, ratably,
without preference or priority of any kind, according to the amounts due
and payable on such Securities for principal and any premium and interest,
respectively; and

THIRD: The balance, if any, to the Company or any other Person or
Persons entitled thereto.

In any case where Securities are outstanding which are denominated in more
than one currency, or in a composite currency and at least one other currency,
and the Trustee is directed to make ratable payments under this Section to
Holders of Securities, the Trustee shall calculate the amount of such payments
as follows: (i) as of the day the Trustee collects an amount under this Article,
the Trustee shall, as to each Holder of a Security to whom an amount is due and
payable under this Section which is denominated in a foreign currency or a
composite currency, determine that amount of U.S. Dollars that would be obtained
for the amount owing such Holder, using the rate of exchange at which in
accordance with normal banking procedures the Trustee could purchase in The City
of New York U.S. Dollars with such amount owing, (ii) calculate the sum of all
U.S. Dollar amounts determined under (i) and add thereto any amounts due and
payable in U.S. Dollars; and
<PAGE> 54

46
(iii) using the individual amounts determined in (i) or any individual amounts
due and payable in U.S. Dollars, as the case may be, as a numerator and the sum
calculated in (ii) as a denominator, calculate as to each Holder of a Security
to whom an amount is owed under this Section the fraction of the amount
collected under this Article payable to such Holder. Any expenses incurred by
the Trustee in actually converting amounts owing Holders of Securities
denominated in a currency or composite currency other than that in which any
amount is collected under this Article shall be likewise (in accordance with
this paragraph) borne ratably by all Holders of Securities to whom amounts are
payable under this Section.

To the fullest extent allowed under applicable law, if for the purpose of
obtaining judgment against the Company in any court it is necessary to convert
the sum due in respect of the principal of, or any premium or interest on the
Securities of any series (the "Required Currency") into a currency in which
judgment will be rendered (the "Judgment Currency"), the rate of exchange used
shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the
Trustee could purchase in The City of New York the Required Currency with the
Judgment Currency on the New York Business Day preceding that on which final
judgment is given. The Company shall not be liable for any shortfall nor shall
it benefit from any windfall in payments to Holders of Securities under this
Section caused by a change in exchange rates between the time the amount of a
judgment against it is calculated as above and the time the Trustee converts the
Judgment Currency into the Required Currency to make payments under this Section
to Holders of Securities, but payment of such judgment shall discharge all
amounts owed by the Company on the claim or claims underlying such judgment.

SECTION 507. Limitation on Suits.

No Holder of any Security of any series shall have any right to institute
any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for
the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder,
unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of
a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that
series;

(2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to
the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in
its own name as Trustee hereunder;
<PAGE> 55

47
(3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee reasonable
indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to be incurred in
compliance with such request;

(4) the Trustee for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and
offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and

(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given
to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;

it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have
any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision
of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of
such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any
other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in
the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all of such
Holders.

SECTION 508. Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and
Interest.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the Holder of any
Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive
payment of the principal of and any premium and (except as specified as
contemplated by Section 301(3) and subject to Section 307) any interest on such
Security on the Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in
the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the
enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired without
the consent of such Holder.

SECTION 509. Restoration of Rights and Remedies.

If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any
right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued
or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or
to such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in
such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored
severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter
all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though
no such proceeding had been instituted.
<PAGE> 56

48
SECTION 510. Rights and Remedies Cumulative.

Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section
306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee or to
the Holders is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every
right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in
addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter
existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any
right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent
assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

SECTION 511. Delay or Omission Not Waiver.

No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Securities to
exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any
such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an
acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to
the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to time, and as often
as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may
be.

SECTION 512. Control by Holders.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities
of any series shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising
any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the Securities of
such series, provided that

(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or
with this Indenture,

(2) the Trustee shall not determine (it being understood that the
Trustee shall have no obligation to make such determination) that the
action so directed would be unjustly prejudicial to Holders of Securities
of that series, or any other series, not taking part in such direction, and

(3) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee
which is not inconsistent with such direction.
<PAGE> 57

49
SECTION 513. Waiver of Past Defaults.

The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the
Securities of such series waive any past default hereunder with respect to such
series and its consequences, except a default

(1) in the payment of the principal of or any premium or interest on
any Security of such series, or

(2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article
Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of
each Outstanding Security of such series affected.

Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of
Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose
of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other
default or impair any right consequent thereon.

SECTION 514. Undertaking for Costs.

In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this
Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or
omitted by it as Trustee, a court may require any party litigant in such suit to
file an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and may assess costs against
any such party litigant, in the manner and to the extent provided in the Trust
Indenture Act; provided that neither this Section nor the Trust Indenture Act
shall be deemed to authorize any court to require such an undertaking or to make
such an assessment in any suit instituted by the Company.

SECTION 515. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.

The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it
will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or
take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted,
now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the
performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may
lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law
and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any
power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of
every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

The duties and responsibilities of the Trustee shall be as provided by the
Trust Indenture Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing (but subject to Section 107),
no provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its
own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any
of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if
it shall have reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or
adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to
it. Whether or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this
Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording
protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section.

SECTION 602. Notice of Defaults.

If a default occurs hereunder with respect to Securities of any series, the

default known to the Trustee as and to the extent provided by the Trust
Indenture Act and in the manner provided in Section 106; provided, however, that
in the case of any default of the character specified in Sections 501(4), 501(5)
and 501(6) with respect to Securities of such series, no such notice to Holders
shall be given until at least 30 days after the occurrence thereof. For the
purpose of this Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after
notice or lapse of time or both would become, an Event of Default with respect
to Securities of such series.

SECTION 603. Certain Rights of Trustee.

Subject to the provisions of Section 601:

(1) the Trustee may rely and shall be protected in acting or
refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement,

bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or
document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented
by the proper party or parties;

(2) any request or direction of the Company mentioned herein shall be
sufficiently evidenced by a Company Request or Company Order and
<PAGE> 59

51
any resolution of the Board of Directors may be sufficiently evidenced by a
Board Resolution;

(3) whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee shall
deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking,
suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Trustee (unless other
evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad
faith on its part, rely upon an Officers' Certificate;

(4) the Trustee may consult with counsel and the written advice of
such counsel or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete
authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, suffered or
omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;

(5) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction
of any of the Holders pursuant to this Indenture (including, without
limitation, under Section 512), unless such Holders shall have offered to
the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses
and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance with such
request or direction;

(6) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the
facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order,
bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or
document, but the Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry
or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the

at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with
the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.

SECTION 610. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.

(a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a
successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the
acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the
applicable requirements of Section 611.

(b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities of
one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the
instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall

request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who has been a bona fide

<PAGE> 63

or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect
to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Resolution,
shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the
Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor
Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of
such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to
the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable
requirements of Section 611. If, within one year after such resignation, removal
or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee with
respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series
delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so
appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance
with the applicable requirements of Section 611, become the successor Trustee
with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the
successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect

of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.

SECTION 611. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.

(a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with
respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an
instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal
of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the
<PAGE> 64

56
request of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall,
upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to
such successor Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee
and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all
property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.

(b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with
respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the
retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of
one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto
wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (i) shall
contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and
confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers,
trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that
or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (ii)
if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall
contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm
that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with
respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring
Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and
(iii) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be
necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts
hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or
in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the
same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts
hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by
any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental
indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become
effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the
Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor
Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such
retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor
Trustee all property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with
respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of
such successor Trustee relates.

(c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall execute
any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and
<PAGE> 65

57
confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred
to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.

(d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the time of
such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible under
this Article.

SECTION 612. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.

Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any
corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business
of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such
corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article,
without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of
any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been authenticated,
but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger,
conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such
authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect
as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities. In the
event any Securities shall not have been authenticated by such predecessor
Trustee, any such successor Trustee may authenticate and deliver such
Securities, in either its own name or that of its predecessor Trustee, with the
full force and effect which this Indenture provides for the certificate of
authentication of the Trustee.

SECTION 613. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.

Reference is made to Section 311 of the Trust Indenture Act. For purposes
of Sections 311(b)(4) and 311(b)(6) of the Trust Indenture Act, the following
terms shall have the following meanings:

"cash transaction" means any transaction in which full payment for goods or
securities sold is made within seven days after delivery of the goods or
securities in currency or in checks or other orders drawn upon banks or bankers
acceptances and payable upon demand.

"self-liquidating paper" means any draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or
obligation which is made, drawn, negotiated or incurred by the Company for the
purpose of financing the purchase, processing, manufacture, shipment, storage or
sale of goods, wares or merchandise and which is secured by
<PAGE> 66

58
documents evidencing title to, possession of or a lien upon, the goods, wares or
merchandise or the receivables or proceeds arising from the sale of the goods,
wares or merchandise previously constituting the security, provided the security
is received by the Trustee simultaneously with the creation of the creditor
relationship with the Company arising from the making, drawing, negotiating or
incurring of the draft, bill of exchange, acceptance or obligation.

SECTION 614. Appointment of Authenticating Agent.

The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to
one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of
the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original issue
and upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or
pursuant to Section 306, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to
the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all
purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is
made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities by the
Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such reference shall be
deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an
Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed on behalf of
the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be
acceptable to the Company and shall at all times be a corporation organized and
doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof
or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating
Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $5,000,000 and
subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such
Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant
to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then,
for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such
Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as
set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an
Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately
in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.

Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent
shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or
corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an
<PAGE> 67

59
Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible
under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.

An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice
thereof to the Trustee and the Company. The Trustee may at any time terminate
the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such
Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of
resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such
Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating
Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall mail written notice of
such appointment by first-class mail, postage prepaid, to all Holders of
Securities of the series with respect to which such Authenticating Agent will
serve, as their names and addresses appear in the Security Register. Any
successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder
shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor
hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent.
No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the
provisions of this Section.

The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time
reasonable compensation for its services under this Section, and the Trustee
shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such payments, subject to the provisions
of Section 607.

If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to
this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in
addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative
certificate of authentication in the following form:

This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to
in the within-mentioned Indenture.

location, and any change in the location, of such office or agency. If at any
time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or
shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations,
surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust
<PAGE> 75

67
Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent
to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.

The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices
or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or
surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such
designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in
any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency
in each Place of Payment for Securities of any series for such purposes. The
Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation
or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other office or
agency.

SECTION 1003. Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust.

If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect
to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the
principal of or any premium or interest on any of the Securities of that series,
segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a
sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium and interest so becoming due
until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein
provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to
act.

Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of
Securities, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of or any premium
or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum
sufficient to pay such amount, such sum to be held as provided by the Trust
Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will
promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.

The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other
than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which
such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of
this Section, that such Paying Agent will (a) comply with the provisions of the
Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying Agent and (b) during the
continuance of any default by the Company (or any other obligor upon the
Securities of that series) in the making of any payment in respect of the
Securities of that series, upon the written request of the Trustee, forthwith
pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent for payment in
respect of the Securities of that series.
<PAGE> 76

68
The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction
and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company
Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by
the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the
same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such
Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such
Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such
money.

Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by
the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of or any premium or
interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years
after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable shall be
paid to the Company, or (if then held by the Company) shall be discharged from
such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall thereafter, as an unsecured
general creditor, look only to the Company for payment thereof, and all
liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money,
and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease.

SECTION 1004. Statement by Officers as to Default.

The Company will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of
each fiscal year of the Company ending after the date hereof, a brief
certificate from the principal executive, financial or accounting officer of the
Company as to his or her knowledge of the Company's compliance (without regard
to any period of grace or requirement of notice provided hereunder) with all
conditions and covenants hereof.

SECTION 1005. Existence.

Subject to Article Eight, the Company will do or cause to be done all
things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its corporate
existence, rights (charter and statutory) and franchises; provided, however,
that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise
if the Company shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer
desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and that the loss
thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.
<PAGE> 77

69
SECTION 1006. Maintenance of Properties.

The Company will cause all material properties used or useful in the
conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary to be maintained and
kept in good condition, repair and working order and supplied with all necessary
equipment and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals,
replacements, betterments and improvements thereof, all as (and to the extent)
in the judgment of the Company may be necessary or appropriate in connection
with its business; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall prevent
the Company from discontinuing the operation or maintenance of any of such
properties if such discontinuance is, in the judgment of the Company, desirable
in the conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary and not
disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.

SECTION 1007. Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.

The Company will pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged, within
30 days after the Company shall have received notice that the same has become
delinquent (1) all material taxes, assessments and governmental charges levied
or imposed upon the Company or any Subsidiary or upon the income, profits or
property of the Company or any Subsidiary, and (2) all lawful claims for labor,
materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by law become a material lien
upon the property of the Company or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or
discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim whose amount, applicability
or validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings;
provided, further, that the Company shall not be required to pay or discharge or
cause to be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim unless
the failure to pay or discharge such tax, assessment, charge or claim would,
individually or in the aggregate with all such failures, have a material adverse
effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

SECTION 1008. Limitations on Liens.

(a) So long as any Securities of such series remain Outstanding, the
Company will not, nor will it permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, issue, incur,
create, assume or guarantee any debt for borrowed money (hereinafter in this
Article 10 referred to as "Debt"), secured by a mortgage, security interest,
pledge, lien, charge or other encumbrance (mortgages, security interests,
pledges, liens, charges and other encumbrances being hereinafter in this Article
<PAGE> 78

70
10, referred to as "mortgage" or "mortgages") upon any Principal Property or
Domestic Receivables or Inventory of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or
upon any shares of stock or indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary (whether
such Principal Property, or Domestic Receivables or Inventory, shares of stock
or indebtedness are now existing or owed or hereafter created or acquired)
without in any such case effectively providing concurrently with the issuance,
incurrence, creation, assumption or guaranty of any such Debt that the
Securities of such series Outstanding (together with, if the Company shall so
determine, any other indebtedness of or guarantee by the Company or such
Restricted Subsidiary ranking equally with the Securities of such series
Outstanding and then existing or thereafter created) shall be secured equally
and ratably with (or, at the Company's option, prior to) such Debt; provided,
however, that the foregoing restrictions shall not apply to Debt secured by:

(1) mortgages on property, shares of stock or indebtedness or other
assets of any corporation existing at the time such corporation becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary; provided that such mortgages are not incurred in
anticipation of such corporation becoming a Restricted Subsidiary;

(2) (A) mortgages on property, shares of stock, indebtedness or other
assets existing at the time of acquisition thereof by the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary (which may include property previously leased by the
Company and leasehold interests thereon, provided that the lease terminates
prior to the acquisition) or mortgages thereon to secure the payment of all
or any part of the purchase price thereof, or (B) mortgages on property,
shares of stock, indebtedness or other assets to secure any Debt incurred
prior to, at the time of, or within 270 days after, the latest of the
acquisition thereof, or, in the case of property, the completion of
construction, the completion of improvements or the commencement of
substantial commercial operation of such property for the purpose of
financing all or any part of the purchase price thereof, such construction
or the making of such improvements;

(3) mortgages securing Debt owing to the Company or to a Restricted
Subsidiary;

(4) mortgages existing on the date of initial issuance of the
Securities of such series;

(5) mortgages on property or other assets of a corporation existing at
the time such corporation is merged into or consolidated with the Company
or a Restricted Subsidiary or at the time of a sale, lease or other
<PAGE> 79

71
disposition of the properties of a corporation as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary;
provided that such mortgage was not incurred in anticipation of such merger
or consolidation or sale, lease or other disposition;

(6) mortgages on or other conveyances of property or other assets
owned by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary in favor of the United
States of America or any State, territory or possession thereof (or the
District of Columbia), or any department, agency, instrumentality or
political subdivision of the United States of America or any State,
territory or possession thereof (or the District of Columbia), to secure
partial, progress, advance or other payments pursuant to any contract or
statute or to secure any Debt incurred for the purpose of financing all or
any part of the purchase price or the cost of construction or improvement
of the property subject to such mortgages;

(7) any extension, renewal or replacement (or successive extensions,
renewals or replacements), in whole or in part, of any mortgage referred to
in the foregoing clauses (1) to (6), inclusive, without increase of the
principal of the Debt secured thereby; provided, however, that such
extension, renewal or replacement shall be limited to all or a part of the
property which secured the mortgage so extended, renewed or replaced (plus
improvements on such property); and provided, further, that any mortgage
permitted by any of the foregoing clauses (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6)
of this Section 1008 shall not extend to or cover any property of the
Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, other than the
property specified in such clauses and improvements thereto.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1008, the
Company and any one or more Restricted Subsidiaries may issue, incur, create,
assume or guarantee Debt secured by mortgages which would otherwise be subject
to the foregoing restrictions ("Exempted Secured Debt") in an aggregate amount
which, together with all other outstanding Debt of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries which (if originally issued, incurred, created, assumed
or guaranteed at such time) would otherwise be subject to the foregoing
restrictions (including Attributable Debt in respect of Sale and Lease-Backs as
provided in Section 1009, but not including Debt permitted to be secured under
any of clauses (1) through (7) above or Attributable Debt with respect to a Sale
and Lease-Back if Debt at least equal in amount to the Attributable Debt in
respect of such Sale and Lease-Back could have been issued, incurred, created,
assumed or guaranteed by the Company or one or
<PAGE> 80

72
more Restricted Subsidiaries under any of clauses (1) through (7) above), does
not at the time exceed 5% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets of the Company.

SECTION 1009. Limitations on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions.

(a) So long as any Securities of such series remain Outstanding, the
Company will not, nor will it permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into
any direct or indirect arrangement with any Person that provides for the leasing
to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of any Principal Property (except
for leases for a term of not more than three years and except for leases between
the Company and a Restricted Subsidiary or between Restricted Subsidiaries),
which Principal Property has been or is to be sold or transferred by the Company
or such Restricted Subsidiary to such Person (such arrangement herein in this
Section 1009 referred to as a "Sale and Lease-Back"), unless:

(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled,
pursuant to the provisions of Section 1008, to issue, incur, create, assume
or guarantee Debt secured by a mortgage upon such property at least equal
in amount to the Attributable Debt in respect of such Sale and Lease-Back
without equally and ratably securing the Securities of such series
Outstanding; provided, however, that from and after the date on which such
Sale and Lease-Back becomes effective the Attributable Debt in respect of
such Sale and Lease-Back shall be deemed for all purposes under Section
1008 and this Section 1009 to be Debt subject to the provisions of Section
1008 (including, to the extent relying on the provisions of Section
1008(b), for purposes of calculating Exempted Secured Debt as provided in
Section 1008(b)); or

(2) within 180 days of the effective date of such Sale and Lease-Back,
the Company shall apply an amount in cash equal to the greater of the net
proceeds of the sale involved in such Sale and Lease-Back or the
Attributable Debt in respect of such Sale and Lease-Back either (or a
combination of) (i) to the retirement (other than any mandatory retirement,
mandatory prepayment or sinking fund payment or by way of payment at
maturity), of Debt of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than
Debt owed by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary or Debt which is subordinate to Securities of such
series Outstanding) which by its terms matures at or is extendible or
renewable at the option of the obligor to a date more than twelve months
after the date of the creation of such Debt,
<PAGE> 81

73
or (ii) to the purchase, construction or development (or any combination
thereof) of other comparable property.

(b) For the purposes of this Section 1009, the term "Attributable Debt"
with respect to a Sale and Lease-Back means, at the time of determination, the
lesser of:

(1) the fair market value of the property which is the subject of such
Sale and Lease-Back (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors)
or;

(2) the then present value of the total net amount of rent required to
be paid under the lease in respect of such Sale and Lease-Back during the
remaining term thereof (including any renewal term or period for which such
lease has been extended) computed by discounting from the respective due
dates to such date such total net amount of rent at the actual interest
factor included in such rent or implicit in the terms of the applicable
Sale and Lease-Back, or, if not practicable to determine such rate, the
rate per annum equal to the weighted average interest rate per annum borne
by the Securities of each series outstanding pursuant to this Indenture
compounded semi-annually, in either case as determined in good faith by the
principal financial or accounting officer of the Company, which computation
shall be binding for purposes of this Indenture absent manifest error;
provided, however, that the net amount of rent required to be paid for any
such period shall be the aggregate amount of the rent payable by the lessee
with respect to such period after excluding amounts required to be paid on
account of or contingent upon maintenance and repairs, insurance, taxes,
assessments, water rates and similar charges. In the case of any lease
which is terminable by the lessee upon the payment of a penalty, such net
amount shall be the lesser of (i) the net amount determined assuming
termination upon the first date such lease may be terminated (in which case
the net amount shall also include the amount of the penalty, but no rent
shall be considered as required to be paid under such lease subsequent to
the first date upon which it may be so terminated) or (ii) the net amount
determined assuming no such termination.

SECTION 1010. Restrictions on Funded Debt of Restricted Subsidiaries.

(a) So long as any Securities of such series remain Outstanding, the
Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to create, incur, issue,
assume or guarantee any Funded Debt. This restriction will not apply if:
<PAGE> 82

74
(1) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled
pursuant to the provisions of Section 1008 to create Debt secured by
mortgages or pursuant to the provisions of Section 1009 to enter into a
Sale and Lease-Back involving Attributable Debt in an amount equal to such
Funded Debt, without equally and ratably securing the applicable series of
Securities; or

(2) such Funded Debt existed on the date of the original issuance by
the Company of any Securities of such series, or such other date as may be
specified in the Board Resolution, Officers' Certificate or the
supplemental indenture establishing the terms of the Securities of such
series pursuant to Section 301 prior to the issuance of any Securities of
such series for an applicable series of Securities issued pursuant to the
Indenture; or

(3) such Funded Debt is owed to the Company or any Subsidiary; or

(4) such Funded Debt existed at the time the corporation that issued
such Funded Debt became a Restricted Subsidiary, or was merged with or into
or consolidated with such Restricted Subsidiary; or at the time of a sale,
lease or other disposition of the properties of such corporation as an
entirety to such Restricted Subsidiary, or arising thereafter (a) otherwise
than in connection with the borrowing of money arranged thereafter and (b)
pursuant to contractual commitments entered into prior to and not in
contemplation of such corporation becoming a Restricted Subsidiary and not
in contemplation of such merger or consolidation or any such sale, lease or
other disposition; or

(5) such Funded Debt is issued, assumed or guaranteed in connection
with, or with a view to, compliance by such Restricted Subsidiary with the
requirements of any program adopted by any federal, state or local
governmental authority and applicable to such Restricted Subsidiary and
providing financial or tax benefits to such Restricted Subsidiary which are
not available directly to the Company; or

(6) such Funded Debt is issued, assumed or guaranteed to pay all or
any part of the purchase price or the construction cost of land, land
improvements, buildings, fixtures and equipment acquired by a Restricted
Subsidiary, provided such Funded Debt is incurred within 270 days after
acquisition, completion of construction or commencement of full operation
of such property, whichever is later; or
<PAGE> 83

75
(7) such Funded Debt is incurred for the purpose of extending,
renewing, substituting, replacing or refunding Funded Debt permitted by the
foregoing.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1010, any
Restricted Subsidiary may create, incur, issue, assume or guarantee Funded
Debt which would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions in an
aggregate principal amount which, together with the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of all other Funded Debt of Restricted Subsidiaries which
would otherwise be subject to the foregoing restrictions (not including
Funded Debt permitted to be incurred pursuant to any of clauses (1) through
(7) above), does not at the time such Funded Debt is incurred exceed an
amount equal to 5% of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets.

SECTION 1011. Waiver of Certain Covenants.

The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term,
provision or condition set forth in Sections 1008, 1009 and 1010 with respect to
the Securities of any series if before the time for such compliance the Holders
of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such
series shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such
instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision or condition,
but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition
except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become
effective, the obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee in
respect of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and
effect.

<PAGE> 84

76
SECTION 1102. Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.

The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be evidenced by
a Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at the election of the Company of
less than all the Securities of any series of the same tenor, the Company shall,

series or of any series with the same (i) Stated Maturity, (ii) period or

which such Securities may or shall be redeemed or purchased, in whole or in
part, at the option of the Company or pursuant to any sinking fund or analogous
provision or repayable at the option of the Holder and (iii) rate or rates at
which the Securities bear interest, if any, or formula pursuant to which such
rate or rates accrue (collectively, the "Equivalent Principal Terms")) prior to
the Redemption Date fixed by the Company (unless a shorter notice shall be
satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date of the
principal amount of Securities of such series to be redeemed and, if applicable,
of the tenor of the Securities to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of
Securities prior to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption
provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the
Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing
compliance with such restriction.

SECTION 1103. Selection by Trustee of Securities to Be Redeemed.

If less than all the Securities with Equivalent Principal Terms of any
series are to be redeemed (unless all of the Securities of such series and of a
specified tenor are to be redeemed), the particular Securities to be redeemed
shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date by the
Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series not previously called
for redemption, by such method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate
and which may provide for the selection for redemption of portions (equal to the
minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series with Equivalent
Principal Terms or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of
Securities of such series with Equivalent Principal Terms of a denomination
larger than the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series.
Unless otherwise provided in the terms of a particular series of Securities, the
portions of the principal of Securities so selected for partial redemption shall
be equal to the minimum authorized denomination of the Securities of such
series, or an integral multiple thereof, and the principal
<PAGE> 85

77
amount which remains outstanding shall not be less than the minimum authorized
denomination for Securities of such series.

The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities
selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial
redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.

For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires,
all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the
case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion
of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.

SECTION 1104. Notice of Redemption.

Notice of redemption shall be given by first-class mail, postage prepaid,
mailed not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date,
unless a shorter period is specified in the Securities to be redeemed, to each
Holder of Securities to be redeemed, at his address appearing in the Security
Register.

Any notice that is mailed to the Holder of any Securities in the manner
herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether
or not such Holder receives the notice.

All notices of redemption shall state:

(1) the Redemption Date,

(2) the Redemption Price and the amount of accrued interest, if any,
to be paid,

(3) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series are to
be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption of
any Securities, the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be
redeemed,

(4) in case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice
which relates to such Security shall state that on and after the Redemption
Date, upon surrender of such Security, the Holder of such Security will
receive, without charge, a new Security or Securities of authorized
denominations for the principal amount thereof remaining unredeemed,

(5) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become due
and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that
interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date,
<PAGE> 86

78
(6) the place or places where such Securities are to be surrendered
for payment of the Redemption Price, and

(7) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case.

Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the
Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the
Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company and shall be irrevocable.

SECTION 1105. Deposit of Redemption Price.

On or prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the
Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying
Agent, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of
money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption
Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities
which are to be redeemed on that date.

SECTION 1106. Securities Payable on Redemption Date.

Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to
be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the
Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the
Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued
interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any
such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall
be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest
to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified as
contemplated by Section 301, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is
on or prior to the Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such
Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the
close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the
provisions of Section 307.

If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender
thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium shall, until paid, bear
interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the
Security.

SECTION 1107. Securities Redeemed in Part.

Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at a
Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires,
<PAGE> 87

79
due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney
duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service
charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series and of like tenor, of
any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal
amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of
the Security so surrendered.

ARTICLE TWELVE

SINKING FUNDS

SECTION 1201. Applicability of Article.

The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for
the retirement of Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as
contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of such series.

The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of
Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund
payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the
terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking
fund payment". The cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to
reduction as provided in Section 1202. Each sinking fund payment shall be
applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the
terms of Securities of such series.

SECTION 1202. Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.

The Company (a) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series (other than
any previously called for redemption) and (b) may apply as a credit Securities
of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company
pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted
optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each
case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect
to the Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of
such Securities as provided for by the terms of such Series; provided that such
Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be
received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee
<PAGE> 88

80
at the Redemption Price specified in such Securities for redemption through
operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall
be reduced accordingly.

SECTION 1203. Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.

Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any
series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for
that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any,
which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any,
which is to be satisfied by delivering the crediting Securities of that series
pursuant to Section 1202 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to
be so delivered. Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment
date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking
fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of
the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the
Company in the manner provided in Section 1104. Such notice having been duly
given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the
manner stated in Sections 1106 and 1107.

ARTICLE THIRTEEN

DEFEASANCE AND COVENANT DEFEASANCE

SECTION 1301. Company's Option to Effect Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.

Section 1302 and/or Section 1303 shall apply to the Outstanding Securities
of any series to the extent specified as contemplated by Section 301 for
Securities of such series.

SECTION 1302. Defeasance and Discharge.

The Company shall be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations
with respect to the Outstanding Securities of such series as provided in this
Section on and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are
satisfied (hereinafter called "Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Defeasance
means that the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire
indebtedness represented by the Outstanding Securities of such series and to
have satisfied all of its other obligations under the Securities of such series
and this Indenture insofar as the Securities of such series are concerned
<PAGE> 89

81
(and the Trustee, at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper
instruments acknowledging the same), subject to the following which shall
survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of
Holders of Securities of such series to receive, solely from the trust fund
described in Section 1304 and as more fully set forth in such Section, payments
in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities
of such series when payments are due, (b) the Company's obligations with respect
to the Securities of such series under Sections 304, 305, 306, 1002 and 1003,
(c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee hereunder
and (d) this Article Thirteen. Subject to compliance with this Article Thirteen,
the Company may defease the Outstanding Securities of any series pursuant to

Securities of such series pursuant to Section 1303.

SECTION 1303. Covenant Defeasance.

The Company shall be released from its obligations under Sections 1005
through 1010, inclusive, and the occurrence of any event specified in Sections

shall be deemed not to be or result in an Event of Default, in each case with
respect to Outstanding Securities of any series as provided in this Section on
and after the date the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied
(hereinafter called "Covenant Defeasance"). For this purpose, such Covenant
Defeasance means that the Company may omit to comply with and shall have no
liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such
specified Section (to the extent so specified in the case of Section 501(4)),
whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to
any such Section or by reason of any reference in any such Section to any other
provision herein or in any other document, but the remainder of this Indenture
and the Securities of such series shall be unaffected thereby.

for the purpose of making the following payments, specifically pledged as
security for, and dedicated solely to, the benefit of the Holders of
Outstanding Securities of such series, (A) money in an amount, or (B) U.S.
Government Obligations that through the scheduled payment of principal and
interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide,
not later than the due date of any payment, money in an amount, or (C) a
combination thereof, in each case sufficient, in the opinion of a
nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a
written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and
discharge each installment of principal (including mandatory sinking fund
payments and amounts that may be payable at the option of the Holder on any
Repayment Date) of, and premium (not relating to optional redemption), if
any, and interest on, the Outstanding Securities of such series on the
dates such installments of principal of, and premium (not relating to
optional redemption), if any, or interest are due.

(2) In the case of Defeasance under Section 1302, the Company shall
have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (A) the
Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal
Revenue Service a ruling or (B) since the date first set forth hereinabove,
there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax law, in either
case (A) or (B) to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion shall
confirm that, the Holders of the Outstanding Securities of such series will
not recognize gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of
the deposit, Defeasance and discharge to be effected with respect to the
Securities of such series and will be subject to Federal income tax on the
same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case
if such deposit, Defeasance and discharge were not to occur.

(3) In the case of Covenant Defeasance under Section 1303, the Company
shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
that the Holders of the Outstanding Securities of such series will not
recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result
of the deposit and Covenant Defeasance to be effected with respect to the
Securities of such series and will be subject to Federal income tax on the
same amount, in the same manner and at the same times as would be the case
if such deposit and Covenant Defeasance were not to occur.
<PAGE> 91

83
(4) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's
Certificate to the effect that the Securities of such series, if then
listed on any securities exchange, will not be delisted as a result of such
deposit.

(5) No Event of Default or event that (after notice or lapse of time
or both) would become an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing at the time of such deposit or, with regard to any Event of
Default or any such event specified in Sections 501(7) and (8), at any time
on or prior to the 90th day after the date of such deposit (it being
understood that this condition shall not be deemed satisfied until after
such 90th day).

Act).

(7) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance (including the deposit
pursuant to such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance) shall not result in a
breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, the Indenture or any
other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which
it is bound.

(8) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions
precedent with respect to such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance have been
complied with.

(9) Such Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in the
trust arising from such deposit constituting an investment company within
the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, unless such
trust shall be qualified under such Act or exempt from regulation
thereunder.

SECTION 1305. Deposited Money and U.S. Government Obligations to be Held in
Trust; Other Miscellaneous Provisions.

Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money
and U.S. Government Obligations (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with
the Trustee or other qualifying trustee (solely for purposes of this Section and
Section 1306, the Trustee and any such other trustee are referred to
collectively as the "Trustee") pursuant to Section 1304 in respect of the
Securities of any series shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in
<PAGE> 92

84
accordance with the provisions of the Securities of such series and this
Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any such Paying Agent
(including the Company acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may
determine, to the Holders of Securities of such series, of all sums due and to
become due thereon in respect of principal and any premium and interest, but
money so held in trust need not be segregated from other funds except to the
extent required by law.

The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or
other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Government Obligations
deposited pursuant to Section 1304 or the principal and interest received in
respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge that by law is for
the account of the Holders of Outstanding Securities.

Anything in this Article Thirteen to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company
Request any money or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in
Section 1304 with respect to Securities of any series that, in the opinion of a
nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a
written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the
amount thereof that would then be required to be deposited to effect an
equivalent Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance with respect to the Securities of
such series.

SECTION 1306. Reinstatement.

If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in
accordance with this Article Thirteen with respect to the Securities of any
series by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority
enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the
Company's obligations under this Indenture and the Securities of such series
shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to
this Article Thirteen with respect to Securities of such series until such time
as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all money held in trust
pursuant to Section 1305 with respect to Securities of such series in accordance
with this Article Thirteen; provided, however, that if the Company makes any
payment of principal of or any premium or interest on any Security of such
series following the reinstatement of its obligations, the Company shall be
subrogated to the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series to receive
such payment from the money so held in trust.

ARTICLE FOURTEEN

REPAYMENT AT OPTION OF SECURITY HOLDERS

SECTION 1401. Applicability of Article.

Securities of any series which are repayable at the option of the Holders
thereof before their Stated Maturity shall be repaid in accordance with their
terms and (except as otherwise contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of
such series) in accordance with this Article.

SECTION 1402. Repayment of Securities.

Each Security which is subject to repayment in whole or in part at the
option of the Holder thereof on a Repayment Date shall be repaid at the
applicable Repayment Price together with interest accrued to such Repayment Date
as specified pursuant to Section 301.

SECTION 1403. Exercise of Option; Notice.

Each Holder desiring to exercise his option for repayment shall, as
conditions to such repayment, surrender the Security to be repaid together with
all coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing after the Repayment Date and
with written notice of the exercise of such option at any office or agency of
the Company in a Place of Payment, not less than 15 nor more than 30 days prior
to the Repayment Date. Such notice, which shall be irrevocable, shall identify
the Security to be repaid and shall specify the principal amount of such
Security to be repaid, which shall be not less than the minimum authorized
denomination for such Security or an integral multiple thereof and, in the case
of a partial repayment of the Security, the denomination or denominations of the
Security or Securities with Equivalent Principal Terms to be issued to the
Holder for the portion of the principal of the Security surrendered which is not
to be repaid.

Any Security which is to be repaid only in part shall be surrendered at a
Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due
endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney
duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service
charge, a new Security or Securities with Equivalent Principal Terms, of any
authorized denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate
<PAGE> 94

86
principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the
principal of the Security so surrendered.

For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires,
all provisions relating to the repayment of Securities shall relate, in the case
of any Security repaid or to be repaid only in part, to the portion of the
principal of such Security which has been or is to be repaid.

SECTION 1404. Securities Payable on the Repayment Date.

Notice of exercise of the option of repayment having been given and the
Securities so to be repaid having been surrendered as aforesaid, such Securities
shall, on the Repayment Date, become due and payable at the Repayment Price
therein specified and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default
in the payment of Repayment Price and accrued interest) such Securities shall
cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for repayment in
accordance with Section 1403, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the
Repayment Price, together with accrued interest to the Repayment Date; provided,
however, that, installments of interest on Securities whose Stated Maturity is
on or prior to the Repayment Date shall be payable to the Holders of such
Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the
close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the
provisions of Section 307.

If any Security duly surrendered for repayment shall not be so paid, the
principal and any premium shall, until paid, bear interest from the Repayment
Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the Security.

This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts
shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

aggregate offering price of up to $250,000,000 or the equivalent thereof in one
or more foreign currencies or composite currencies (of which $115,575,000 has
been sold as of the date hereof), pursuant to a registration statement on Form
S-3 (File No. 33-52471) (the "Registration Statement"). The Senior Debt
Securities are to be issued under an Indenture, a form of which has been filed
as an exhibit to the Form 8-K (the "Indenture") between the Company and Harris
Trust Company of California, as Trustee (the "Trustee"). The Common Stock and
the Senior Debt Securities are to be issued pursuant to an Underwriting
Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), in the form filed as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement. The Senior Debt Securities are to be issued in the form
filed as an exhibit to the Form 8-K. The Senior Debt Securities and the Common
Stock are to be sold from time to time as set forth in the Registration
Statement, the Prospectus contained therein (the "Prospectus") and the
supplements to the Prospectus (the "Prospectus Supplements").

We have examined instruments, documents and records which we deemed
relevant and necessary for the basis of our opinion hereinafter expressed. In
such examination, we have assumed the following: (a) the authenticity of
original documents and the genuineness of all signatures; (b) the conformity to
the originals of all documents submitted to us as copies; and (c) the truth,
accuracy, and completeness of the
<PAGE> 2

information, representations and warranties contained in the records, documents,
instruments and certificates we have reviewed.

Based on such examination, we are of the opinion that:

1. When the issuance of Senior Debt Securities has been duly authorized by
appropriate corporate action and the Senior Debt Securities, in the form filed
as an exhibit to the Form 8-K, have been duly completed, executed, authenticated
and delivered in accordance with the Indenture and sold pursuant to the
Underwriting Agreement and as described in the Registration Statement, any
amendment thereto, the Prospectus and the Prospectus Supplement relating
thereto, the Senior Debt Securities will be legal, valid and binding obligations
of the Company, entitled to the benefits of such Indenture.

2. When the issuance of the Common Stock has been duly authorized by
appropriate corporate action and the Common Stock has been duly issued, sold and
delivered in accordance with the Underwriting Agreement and as described in the
Registration Statement, any amendment thereto, the Prospectus and the Prospectus
Supplement relating thereto, the Common Stock will be legally issued, fully
paid, and nonassessable.

Our opinion that any document is legal, valid and binding is qualified as
to:

(a) limitations imposed by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
arrangement, fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other laws relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors generally; and

(b) general principles of equity, including without limitation concepts of
materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing, and the possible
unavailability of specific performance or injunctive relief, regardless of
whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Form 8-K
and its incorporation by reference in the Registration Statement and to the use
of our name wherever it appears in the Registration Statement, the Prospectus,
the

such consent, we do not believe that we are "experts" within the meaning of such
term as used in the Act or the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission issued thereunder with respect to any part of the

APPLIED MATERIALS ANNOUNCES RECORD REVENUES OF $440 MILLION
AND RECORD NEW ORDERS OF $504 MILLION

REVENUE UP 56.5 PERCENT, RECORD NET INCOME OF $58.1 MILLION

SANTA CLARA, Calif., August 16, 1994 -- Applied Materials, Inc. reported
record results for its third quarter ended July 31, 1994, with net sales of
$440.2 million, up 56.5 percent from third quarter of fiscal 1993 net sales of
$281.4 million. Net income more than doubled to $58.1 million, or $0.68 per
share, from $28.2 million, or $0.34 per share in the third quarter of fiscal
1993. Backlog rose to $560.9 million from $498.8 million at the end of the
second quarter of fiscal 1994. Record new orders of $503.7 million were received
from customers in the quarter.

Sales in the quarter reflect continued demand for the Company's advanced
deposition, etch and ion implantation systems and global support services as
leading semiconductor manufacturers continue to increase their production
capacity. Etch, dielectric and metal Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), Physical
Vapor Deposition (PVD), and ion implant systems sales posted large increases,
compared to the third quarter of fiscal 1993, as heavy demand continued for the
Company's wafer process technology capable of addressing the metallization and
dielectric process requirements of advanced devices.

"With the strength of the personal computer and electronics markets in the
U.S. and the upturn in consumer and business spending in Europe and Japan, our
customers have continued to invest in leading-edge fabrication capacity to
supply advanced semiconductor devices. While the industry has increased its
capacity, end-product demand has grown as well, keeping current capital
investment at a healthy level," said James C. Morgan, chairman and chief
executive officer.

The strong improvement in operating and pre-tax income, compared with the
third quarter of fiscal 1993, reflects improved gross margins, reduced operating
expenses as a percent of revenue and the economies of scale from higher sales
volumes. "We are concentrating on improving the cost-effectiveness of our major
products through continuous improvement programs (CIPs) for our major systems.
These CIPs, combined with economies of scale in
-more -
<PAGE> 2

August 16, 1994

Page 2

manufacturing, service and support should allow us over time to meet our
operating objectives," said Morgan.

New orders of $503.7 million were highlighted by record orders for PVD
systems, reflecting strong customer demand for the Endura HP PVD and new Centura
HP PVD platforms. Combined dielectric and metal CVD system orders were also at
record levels as the Company introduced new sub-atmospheric CVD and tungsten xZ
process chambers, both for the Precision 5000. Investments in new eight-inch
equipment in North America and Japan kept orders for the Precision Implant 9500
at near record levels. Orders for the Company's leading etch systems remained at
high levels, compared with the third quarter of fiscal 1993, as customers
demanded the 0.5 and 0.35 micron-capable etch technology of the Omega-Centura
etch, the recently introduced Metal Etch MxP Centura and the Precision 5000 Etch
MxP systems.

Geographically, third quarter fiscal 1994 record orders in North America
reflected large bookings from several key accounts. Orders in Japan moved up to
record levels and orders in Europe and Asia/Pacific declined after the very high
levels experienced in the first half of fiscal 1994.

"North American-based microprocessor, memory and ASIC manufacturers
continue to order both for capacity additions to existing fabs as well as new
investments in eight-inch capacity in both the United States and Europe.
Business in Japan continues to expand as major DRAM manufacturers invest in new
eight-inch fabrication lines. European manufacturers are adding capacity to
produce devices for telecommunication and consumer products. Investment in logic
and foundry facilities in Taiwan and Singapore fueled our Asia/Pacific business
as Korean DRAM manufacturers' orders moderated from the very high levels of the
fiscal first half," said Morgan.

"While economic, demographic and technological trends point to a healthy
demand for semiconductors and thus our equipment and services, our expectation
is that our very high growth rates will moderate. Given our excellent long-term
opportunities, the rapid growth of the business over the past two years, and our
strong backlog, we will continue to make significant investments to augment our
physical plant infrastructure and human resource capability. As planned, we will
expand our facilities in Santa Clara and Austin, Texas this fall, and we are
building or enhancing our application labs and assembly and service centers in
Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. We also have an ongoing program to add field
service engineers, particularly in Korea and Asia/Pacific. The Company possesses
the liquidity and financial resources for these strategic investments which are
critical to satisfying our long-term customer requirements," Morgan concluded.

Applied Materials, Inc. is a Fortune 500 global growth company and the
world's largest supplier of wafer fabrication systems and services to the global
semiconductor industry. Applied Materials is traded on the NASDAQ National
Market System under the symbol "AMAT."
