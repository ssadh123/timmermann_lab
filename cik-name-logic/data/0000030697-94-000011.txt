Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.

On June 9, 1994, Triarc Companies, Inc. (the "Company")
dismissed its independent accountant, Arthur Andersen & Co. (the
"Former Accountant") and engaged Deloitte & Touche (the "New
Accountant"). The decisions to dismiss the Former Accountant and
engage the New Accountant were recommended by the Audit Committee
of the Company's Board of Directors and approved by the Board of
Directors. 

During each of the two fiscal years in the period ended April
30, 1993 and in the eight month transition period ended December
31, 1993, (i) there were no "reportable events" as such term is
described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K and (ii) the
Former Accountant's reports on the consolidated financial
statements of the Company did not contain an adverse opinion or a
disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to
uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles except for the
fiscal year ended April 30, 1992 where the Former Accountant's
report contained a going concern uncertainty fourth paragraph
(subsequently removed when the report for the fiscal year ended
April 30, 1993 was issued). In addition, as of the date of filing
this Report on Form 8-K, management of the Company knows of no
disagreements with the Former Accountant on any matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure,
or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement(s), if not
resolved to the satisfaction of the Former Accountant, would have
caused the Former Accountant to make a reference to the subject
matter of the disagreement(s) in connection with its report.

The letter from the Former Accountant requested by the Company
to be addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission in
accordance with Item 304(a)(3) of Regulation S-K regarding the
agreement of the Former Accountant with the foregoing accompanies
this Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 16.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

(16) Letter regarding change in certifying accountant received from
Arthur Andersen & Co. 

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on
its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
