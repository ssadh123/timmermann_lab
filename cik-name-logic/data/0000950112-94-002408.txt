INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Board of Directors of
Petroleum Heat and Power Co., Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of the Fuel Oil and
Liquid Propane Divisions (the Divisions) of DeBlois Oil Company (the
Parent Company) as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related
statements of operations and division capital and cash flows for the
years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility
of the Parent Company management. Our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

The accompanying financial statements were prepared to present the
net assets of the Divisions as of and for the years ended
December 31, 1993 and 1992, in connection with the sale of such net
assets to Petroleum Heat and Power, Co., Inc. pursuant to the
purchase and sales agreement referred to in Note 1, in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Fuel
Oil and Liquid Propane Divisions of DeBlois Oil Company at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their operations and
cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

DeBLOIS OIL COMPANY
(Fuel Oil And Liquid Propane Divisions)

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
_____________________

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying financial statements include only the net
assets and operations of the fuel oil and liquid propane
divisions (the Divisions) of DeBlois Oil Company.

On June 29, 1994, the Parent Company sold the majority of its
assets relating to its fuel oil and liquid propane divisions to
Petroleum Heat and Power Co., Inc. Assets included in the sale
consisted principally of property and equipment, certain
inventories and other assets, including customer lists, etc.

The accompanying financial statements include the net assets
and operations of the Company's fuel oil and liquid propane
divisions which were sold in June 1994, with the exception of
accounts receivable that have been included in the financial
statements for 1993 and 1992 to comply with the financial
statement presentation required by certain regulatory agencies.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General
-------

DeBlois Oil Company (the Parent Company) primarily sells
gasoline and fuel oil products to wholesale and retail
customers throughout southeastern New England.

The following significant accounting policies were used in the
preparation of the accompanying financial statements:

Operations
----------

Operating expenses represent certain direct expenses charged
specifically to the Divisions and Parent Company expenses
allocated to the Divisions. Allocated expenses, including
general and administrative salaries and related fringe
benefits, are estimated by management based on the overall
relationship of these expenses to the operations of the
Divisions.

Interest and other income consists mainly of financing income
related to accounts receivable and equipment sales related to
the assets of the Divisions.

- 5 -

<PAGE>

The Parent Company does finance its working capital needs
through an unsecured demand line of credit with a bank; 
however, interest expense has not been allocated by the Parent
Company to the Divisions in the accompanying financial
statements.

Notes and Accounts Receivable
-----------------------------

Notes receivable represent receivables related to the sale of
burner equipment. These notes are generally paid over a three-
year period.

Inventories
-----------

Fuel oil inventories are stated at the lower of cost (last-in,
first-out method (LIFO)) or market. Other inventories are
stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out method) or
market.

The Parent Company periodically enters into commodity futures
contracts and options to hedge the impact of price fluctuations
on fuel oil inventories (or firm purchase commitments or
anticipated transactions for the purchase thereof). Gains and
losses on hedging transactions are deferred and recognized in
cost of sales of the Divisions upon the sale of the related
inventories.

Property and Equipment
----------------------

Property and equipment is stated at cost and represents those
assets that were sold pursuant to the sale of June 29, 1994. 
Depreciation and amortization is computed on both the straight-
line and declining-balance methods over the respective useful
lives ranging from three to ten years.

Customer Credit Balances
------------------------

Customer credit balances represent prepayments received from
customers that have established a budget payment plan with the
Divisions.

Deferred Revenue
----------------

Deferred revenue represents sales of burner equipment which are
being recognized over the life of the respective financing
agreements.

Division Capital
----------------

Division capital represents the net assets of the fuel oil and
liquid propane divisions.

Employee Benefit Plan
---------------------

The Parent Company has a contributory defined contribution plan
(the Plan) covering substantially all employees, including
those employed by the Divisions. Such Plan qualifies under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code whereby eligible
employees are allowed

- 6 -

<PAGE>

to contribute up to 15% of their compensation with the Parent
Company matching up to 2% of compensation. The Plan also allows
for additional discretionary contributions by the Parent
Company.

Taxes on Income
---------------

The Company does not allocate any income taxes to the Divisions
and, accordingly, no provision for Federal and state income
taxes has been recorded on the accompanying financial
statements.

Distributions to Parent Company
-------------------------------

All available cash is distributed to the Parent Company. 
Accordingly, the accompanying financial statements reflect such
distributions as reductions in division capital.

3. INVENTORIES

As of December 31, 1993 and 1992, inventories consisted of the
following:

1993 1992
--------------------------

Fuel oils $ 558,409 $ 630,610
Burner parts and equipment 306,107 282,997
--------------------------
Sub-total 864,516 913,607
Less allowance to reduce carrying value to
LIFO basis for gasoline and fuel oils --- 33,425
--------------------------

Total $ 864,516 $ 880,182
==========================

The Parent Company purchases and sells futures contracts to
hedge the impact of price fluctuations on gasoline and fuel oil
inventories (product). These contracts are for the delayed
delivery or purchase of product at a specified future date at a
specified price. The Parent Company settles its positions by
entering into equal but opposite contracts and, as such, the
contract amounts do not necessarily represent future cash
requirements.

4. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

The Parent Company allocated to the Divisions a contribution of
approximately $114,600 and $102,000 to its defined contribution
plan for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

- 7 -

<PAGE>

5. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Divisions
to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade
accounts receivable.

The Divisions do not require collateral on trade accounts
receivable but perform periodic credit evaluations of its
wholesale and certain retail customers. Also, there are a
significant number of customers. As a consequence,
concentrations of credit risk are limited.
