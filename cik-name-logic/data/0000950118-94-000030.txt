Independent Auditors' Report

To the Owners of
Riverwind Apartments

We have audited the accompanying statement of rental operations
(as defined in Note 2) of Riverwind Apartments for the year
ended December 31, 1992. This financial statement is the
responsibility of the management of Riverwind Apartments. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on this statement based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The statement was prepared for the purpose of complying with the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(for inclusion in a Current Report on Form 8-K of United
Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.), as described in Note 4, and is not
intended to be a complete presentation of Riverwind Apartments
revenues and expenses.

In our opinion, the statement referred to above presents fairly,
in all material respects, the income and operating expenses, as
described in Note 2, of Riverwind Apartments for the year ended
December 31, 1992, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

NOTES TO SUMMARY OF REVENUES
AND CERTAIN RENTAL EXPENSES

The summaries of revenues and certain rental expenses
reflect the operations of Riverwind Apartments, (the "property")
for the year ended December 31, 1992 based upon the audited
statement of rental operations of the properties appearing
elsewhere herein and for the nine month period ended September
30, 1993 based upon the unaudited statement of rental operations
of the property. During 1992 and a portion of 1993, the property
was owned and operated by entities other than United Dominion
Realty Trust, Inc. (the "Trust").

The summaries have been prepared on the accrual method of
accounting. Rental expenses include repair and maintenance
expenses, utilities, real estate taxes, insurance and certain
other expenses. In accordance with the regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, mortgage interest expenses,
depreciation, and general and administrative costs have been
excluded from operating expenses, as they are dependent upon a
particular owner, purchase price or financial arrangement.

In assessing the property, management considered the
existing and potential tenant base, expected job growth in the
area, occupancy rates, the competitive nature of the market and
comparative rental rates. Furthermore, current and anticipated
maintenance and repair costs, real estate taxes and anticipated
capital improvements were assessed.
