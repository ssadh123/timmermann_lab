COMPAQ REPORTS RECORD FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR
1993 EARNINGS PER SHARE UP 112%; SALES INCREASE 75% TO $7.2
BILLION

HOUSTON, January 26, 1994 -- Compaq Computer

Corporation (NYSE:CPQ) today announced record 1993 sales of

$7.2 billion, an increase of 75 percent over the $4.1

billion reported in 1992. Earnings per share for 1993

increased 112 percent to a record $5.35, compared with

earnings per share of $2.52 for 1992.

The Company's sales and earnings per share for the

fourth quarter ended December 31, 1993 also reached record

levels. Fourth quarter sales were $2.2 billion, a 55

percent increase over the $1.4 billion reported for the same

period in 1992. Earnings per share for the fourth quarter

were $1.73 versus $1.10 for the same period in 1992.

"Compaq's record sales growth is the result of

unprecedented customer demand for our products throughout

the world," said Eckhard Pfeiffer, president and chief

executive officer, Compaq Computer Corporation. "We

experienced strong demand for desktop, portable and server

products in our traditional markets and dramatic growth of

consumer sales through retail outlets," he said.

The resulting sales growth in 1993 set records in every

region. North America grew 100 percent to $3.7 billion;

Europe (including Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa)

grew 44 percent to $2.7 billion; other international markets

(including Japan, Latin America and Pacific Rim) grew 111

percent to $800 million. Worldwide unit shipments reached

3.1 million, an increase of 98% over 1992.

1993 HIGHLIGHTS

Compaq made significant gains in its goal to become the

leading supplier of personal computers worldwide. The

Company was credited with achieving the industry's largest

1993 market share growth by independent market research

firms Dataquest, Inc. and International Data Corporation

(IDC).

Customer Satisfaction
---------------------

During 1993 Compaq continued to deliver customer

satisfaction through a broad array of service and support

programs and by making its products easier to use. Compaq's

three-year warranty on all of its computers continues to be

the most comprehensive in the industry. The Company

significantly enhanced customer service and support for its

award-winning server products in September by announcing

CompaqCare for Systems.

Important ease-of-use achievements included the greatly

simplified customer setup for the Compaq Presario; the

innovative Tabworks user interface for Windows and the

industry's first "Plug and Play" ready product, the Compaq

Deskpro XE.

Product Technology
------------------

Compaq announced a record number of new products

during the year and continued to provide technology

leadership with such products as the Compaq ProLiant line of

servers, the Compaq Presario and Compaq Deskpro XE and the

convertible Compaq Concerto notebook computer. The Compaq

ProLiant broke new ground for the Company and the market by

providing an unmatched combination of performance, fault

tolerance, ease-of-management and value.

Total Delivered Cost
--------------------

With annual sales per employee reaching approximately

$700,000 in 1993, the highest among major computer

manufacturers, Compaq continued to improve its position as

one of the lowest cost producers of personal computers.

Significant material cost reductions and continuing cost

controls further enhanced the Company's competitive

position.

Distribution
------------

The Company made it easier for customers to buy its

products by expanding the number of worldwide marketing

partners from approximately 9,500 at the beginning of 1993

to more than 16,000. Geographic expansion continued to open

new markets for Compaq products in many regions of the

world. Compaq further enhanced its Asian operations in the

People's Republic of China with the September opening of a

Beijing sales office. The Company also expanded its

European reach by establishing subsidiaries in Hungary,

Poland and Portugal.

Company/Employees
-----------------

"Credit for our 1993 results belongs to all our

employees," said Pfeiffer. "Compaq's divisional structure,

aligned to key market segments, creates an environment for

committed effort, clear lines of responsibility, and

accountability. Compaq employees have the same interests as

our stockholders and share in our financial results. As a

result of Compaq's 1993 financial performance, the worldwide

profit sharing program paid out over $27 million to

employees."

In 1993 Compaq delivered on its promise to help protect

the environment by eliminating CFCs from all its

manufacturing processes; introducing a number of Energy Star

compliant desktop and notebook products; and by labeling

plastics on Compaq products with recycling codes to improve

the recycling process at the end of the product's life

cycle. In October, Compaq received a Stratospheric Ozone

Protection Award from the Environmental Protection Agency

for eliminating ozone-depleting substances.

1994 PLANS

"Compaq will increasingly leverage its strong brand

name to continue gaining market share in the consolidating

computer market," said Pfeiffer.

"We will focus our efforts on the business and consumer

customer segments and work to increase sales in government

and education. The company will announce a significant

number of new desktop, portable and server products to meet

a variety of customer needs.

"New product technologies will center around such areas

as multi media, mobile computing and communications, and

ease-of-use advancements such as "Plug and Play".

"We think it is especially important that the Company

is building a rapidly growing base of client-server and

enterprise computing solutions. These products and services

are enabling Compaq to play a larger role in the total

computing marketplace by providing customers everywhere with

new tools for the information age," said Pfeiffer.
