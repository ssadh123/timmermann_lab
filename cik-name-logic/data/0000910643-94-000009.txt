Item 2. Acquisition and Disposition of Assets

Since the last Form 8-K filed by New Plan Realty Trust (the
"Company") dated February 10, 1994, the Company, on March 24,
1994, acquired a shopping center, Victoria Square from Compson
Development Company. The property is located in Midlothian,
Virginia and consists of approximately 271,260 square feet of
gross leasable area on approximately 33.7 acres. Victoria Square
has space for 34 tenants and is currently 98% occupied. The
major tenants are: Kmart, Lowes and Farm Fresh.

Item 7. Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Statements and
Exhibits.

(a) and (b) Financial Statements of Businesses Acquired
and Pro Forma Financial Information.

The purchase price of the acquired property described in
Item 2 above (the "Property") was approximately $17,800,000, all
of which was paid by the Company in cash. The purchase price of
the Property represents less than 10% of the total unaudited
assets of the Company.

However, because the Property when added to prior unaudited
acquisitions exceeds 10% of the unaudited assets of the Company,
audited statements of revenues and certain operating expenses
relative to the Property and pro forma condensed financial
information reflecting the acquisition of the Property will be
filed under cover of Form 8-K/A as soon as practicable, but not
later than 60 days after this report on Form 8-K.

(c) Exhibits.

None.
