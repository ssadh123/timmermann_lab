UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INTRODUCTION

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements
present a balance sheet as of December 31, 1993, and statements of earnings for
each of the three years ended December 31, 1993. The pro forma balance sheet
presents certain acquisitions completed subsequent to December 31, 1993, and
probable pending acquisitions. The statement of earnings for the year ended
December 31, 1993, presents the pro forma impact of certain acquisitions
completed in 1993 and probable pending acquisitions assuming the acquisitions
were all completed at January 1, 1993. Acquisitions accounted for as poolings
of interests and completed in 1993 are included in the Corporation's 1993
results. Pro forma statements of earnings are also presented for the two years
ended December 31, 1992, to reflect the pending acquisition via pooling of
interests of BNF BANCORP, Inc. (formerly BANCFIRST Corporation) (BNF), a
probable acquisition that meets the test for a significant subsidiary. The pro
forma impact of the other probable acquisitions expected to be accounted for as
poolings of interests is not presented because they are not considered
significant to consolidated results. The pro forma financial statements should
be read in connection with the Corporation's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Additionally, the Corporation's Current Reports on Form 8-K dated February 8
and April 14, 1994, contain audited financial statements and unaudited interim
financial statements for BNF Bancorp, Inc. Note 1 to these

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. CONSUMMATED ACQUISITIONS

The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and statements of
earnings reflect the consummated and probable pending acquisitions listed
below. The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet gives effect to
these transactions at December 31, 1993, as if they had occurred on that date,
and the unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of earnings reflect the
impact of the transactions as if they had occurred January 1, 1993, except for
the BNF BANCORP, Inc. (formerly BANCFIRST Corporation) (BNF) acquisition which
is presented assuming the transaction occurred January 1, 1991. The unaudited
pro forma consolidated results shown are not necessarily indicative of future
operating results, nor can there be any assurance that the pending transactions
will be consummated. For the probable pending acquisitions to be accounted for
as poolings of interests, except BNF, statements of earnings for periods prior
to 1993 are not presented because the transactions are not significant.
