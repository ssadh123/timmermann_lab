Item 4. Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.

On June 9, 1994, Southeastern Public Service Company (the
"Company") dismissed its independent accountant, Arthur Andersen &
Co. (the "Former Accountant") and engaged Deloitte & Touche (the
"New Accountant"). The decisions to dismiss the Former Accountant
and engage the New Accountant were recommended by the Audit
Committee of the Company's Board of Directors and approved by the
Board of Directors. 

During the fiscal year in the period ended February 28, 1993
and in the ten month transition period ended December 31, 1993, (i)
there were no "reportable events" as such term is described in Item
304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, and (ii) the Former Accountant's
reports on the consolidated financial statements of the Company did
not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and were
not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principles. In addition, as of the date of filing this
Report on Form 8-K, management of the Company knows of no
disagreements with the Former Accountant on any matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure,
or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement(s), if not
resolved to the satisfaction of the Former Accountant, would have
caused the Former Accountant to make a reference to the subject
matter of the disagreement(s) in connection with its report.

The letter from the Former Accountant requested by the Company
to be addressed to the Securities and Exchange Commission in
accordance with Item 304(a)(3) of Regulation S-K regarding the
agreement of the Former Accountant with the foregoing accompanies
this Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 16.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

(16) Letter regarding change in certifying accountant received from
Arthur Andersen & Co.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on
its behalf by the undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
