ITEM 5: OTHER EVENTS
------------

Beginning on December 8, 1994, Ames Department Stores, Inc. ("the
Company") will distribute to its banks and other lenders,
principal trade vendors and factors, summaries of its unaudited
financial results for the four and forty-three weeks ended
November 26, 1994. These monthly and year-to-date results
(collectively, the "monthly results") are attached hereto as
Exhibit 20 and are incorporated by reference herein.

Compared with the projections contained in the Form 8-K dated May
27, 1994 (referred to herein as the "Plan"), sales for the four
weeks ended November 26, 1994 were $1.4 million less than Plan and
EBITDA (as defined in Exhibit 20) was $.7 million less than Plan
and $2.2 million less than last year. In November, the
unfavorable sales variance was primarily due to a shortfall in
ladies apparel. Apparel sales have improved after a slow start in
November. November's gross margin rate was less than Plan due
primarily to an unfavorable mix of sales. Store non-payroll,
field and home office expenses were less than Plan in November. 

Sales for the forty-three weeks ended November 26, 1994 were $36.0
million less than Plan and EBITDA was $11.0 million less than Plan
but $6.2 million greater than last year. The year-to-date
unfavorable sales variance was due primarily to shortfalls in
ladies apparel, crafts, and convenience goods. The lower
year-to-date gross margin rate was due primarily to an unfavorable
mix of sales and higher-than-planned markdowns, particularly in
apparel. The unfavorable impact on the year-to-date EBITDA from
the lower-than-planned sales and gross margin rate was partially
offset by lower-than-planned expenses. Year-to-date store, field
and home office expenses were all less than Plan. 

As of November 26, 1994, LIFO inventories were $11.8 million
greater than Plan, with the variance split proportionately between
hardlines and softlines. The variance was due primarily to the
sales shortfall and special purchases. Trade payables were $15.6
million greater than Plan due primarily to higher-than-planned
merchandise purchases and improved payment terms. Outstanding
borrowings under the Company's revolving line of credit as of
November 26, 1994 were $9.1 million greater than Plan due
primarily to the lower-than-planned EBITDA. 

The Company is distributing the monthly results to its banks and
other lenders, principal trade vendors and factors to facilitate
their credit analyses. The summary results SHOULD NOT BE RELIED
UPON FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE and should be read in conjunction with
the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29,
1994, the Company's Form 10-Q for the first and second fiscal
quarters ended April 30 and July 30, 1994, respectively, the
Company's Form 10-Q to be filed for the third fiscal quarter ended
October 29, 1994, and the Company's Form 8-K dated May 27, 1994. 
The monthly results are being reported publicly solely because
they are being distributed to a large number of the Company's
vendors for purposes of their credit analyses.

During the pendency of its reorganization case, the Company
disclosed publicly its monthly results through filings with the
Office of the U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee and continued to report
publicly its monthly results during the fiscal year ended January
29, 1994. Although the Company expects to continue to make its
monthly results public for the fiscal year ending January 28,
1995, the Company does not believe it is obligated to provide such
information indefinitely, other than as required by applicable
regulations, and the Company may cease making such disclosures and
updates at any time. The monthly results were not examined,
reviewed or compiled by the Company's independent certified public
accountants. Moreover, the Company does not believe that it is
obligated to update the monthly results to reflect subsequent
events or developments. The reported monthly results are subject
to future adjustments, if any, that could materially affect such
results. However, in the opinion of the Company, the monthly
results contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
adjustments) necessary for a fair statement of the results for the
periods presented.
