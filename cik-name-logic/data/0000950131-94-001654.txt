DUE NOVEMBER 1, 1999

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes or
other evidences of indebtedness (hereinafter called the "Securities") of the
Company, all such Securities issued and to be issued under an Indenture for
Senior Securities (herein, together with all indentures supplemental thereto,
called the "Indenture") dated as of February 24, 1993, between the Company and
The First National Bank of Boston, as Trustee, to which Indenture and all
indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made for a specification of
the rights and limitation of rights thereunder of the Holders of the Securities
and of the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the Trustee and of the
Company. As provided in the Indenture, the Securities may be issued in one or
more series, which different series may be issued in various aggregate principal
amounts, may mature at different times, may bear interest, if any, at different
rates, may be subject to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject
to different sinking, purchase or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to
different covenants and Events of Default and may otherwise vary as in the
Indenture provided or permitted. This Note is one of a series designated on the
face hereof (the "Notes").

The Notes are not redeemable by the Company prior to maturity and do not
provide for any sinking fund.

If any Event of Default with respect to the Notes, as defined in the
Indenture, shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Notes may be
declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the
Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities under the Indenture at
any time by the Company with the consent of the Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding, as defined
in the Indenture, of each series of Securities to be affected thereby. The
Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified
percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the

-1-
<PAGE>

time Outstanding, as defined in the Indenture, on behalf of the Holders of all
the Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain
provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and
their consequences with respect to such series, to waive compliance by the
Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under
the Indenture and their consequences with respect to such series. Any such
consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding
upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued
upon the transfer herefor or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or
not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or
of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at
the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, this Note is transferable on the Securities Register of the
Company, upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office
or agency of the Company to be maintained for that purpose in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer in the form satisfactory to the Company and the
Securities Registrar duly executed by, the Holder herefor or his attorney duly
authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized
denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the
designated transferee or transferees.

The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in
denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000. As provided in the
Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the Notes are
exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of a like tenor and
of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering
the same.

This Security is exchangeable by the Company only if (x) the
Depository notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as
Depository for this global Note or if at any time the Depository ceases to be a
clearing agency registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, (y) the Company in its sole discretion determines that this Note shall
be exchangeable for certificated Notes in registered form or (z) an 

-2-

Event of Default, or an event which with the passage of time or the giving of
notice would become an Event of Default, with respect to the Notes represented
hereby has occurred and is continuing, provided that the certificated Notes so
issued by the Company in exchange for this permanent global Note shall be in
denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof
and be of like aggregate principal amount and tenor as the portion of this
permanent global Note to be exchanged, and provided further that, unless the
Company agrees otherwise, Notes of this series in certificated registered form
will be issued in exchange for this permanent global Note, or any portion
hereof, only if such Notes in certificated registered form were requested by
written notice to the Trustee or the Securities Registrar by or on behalf of a
Person who is beneficial owner of an interest hereof given through the Holder
hereof. Except as provided above, owners of beneficial interests in this
permanent global Note will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Notes
in certificated registered form and will not be considered the Holders thereof
for any purpose under the Indenture.

No recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the
Company in the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto or in this Note,
or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had
against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, as such, past,
present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either
directly or indirectly through the Company or any successor corporation, under
any rule of law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of
any assessment, penalty or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise,
all such liability being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof
and as a condition of and as part of the consideration for the issue hereof.

The Indenture with respect to any series will be discharged and
cancelled except for certain Sections thereof, subject to the terms of the
Indenture, upon the payment of all the Securities of such series or upon the
irrevocable deposit with the Trustee of cash or Government Obligations (or a
