CORPORATE OVERVIEW

International Paper is a global leader in the manufacture of printing and 
writing papers, industrial and consumer packaging, and forest products. These
enterprises are complemented by a broad array of specialty products businesses
and an extensive distribution capability, giving us the diversity we need to
enhance the growth and stability of our earnings, achieve substantial economies
of scale, and strengthen our presence in some of the fastest growing segments of
our industry. With an unwavering focus on the needs of our customers,
International Paper reaches markets in more than 130 countries from facilities 
in 27 nations.

INTERNATIONAL PAPER: THE BUSINESSES WE'RE IN

PRINTING PAPERS

International Paper is one of the world's largest producers of high-quality
printing and writing papers. We serve growing markets for uncoated papers,
specialty fine papers and nearly 100 different grades of recycled papers. We
are leaders in the manufacture of coated papers used in magazines and catalogs;
heavyweight papers used for folders, tags and tickets; and pulp for
international markets. Our Springhill, Hammermill, Strathmore and Beckett
brands rank among the most popular in the industry. International Paper's
Aussedat Rey, Zanders and Kwidzyn subsidiaries are major producers of printing
and writing papers in Europe.

PACKAGING

Our reputation for exceptional quality and innovative designs has helped
International Paper become a leader in industrial and consumer packaging. Our
operations in the U.S. and overseas make us one of the world's largest producers
of containerboard and corrugated boxes, and the leading provider of agricultural
packaging in Europe. Our kraft division offers the widest array of kraft paper
and packaging in the industry. And our premium Everest line of bleached board
is known for its superior quality and is used worldwide for folding cartons,
liquid containers and food service products.

DISTRIBUTION

International Paper is a leading local, national and internatioal distributor of
paper, industrial products and graphic arts supplies. ResourceNet International
unites more than 260 strategically located regional distribution facilities in
the U.S., Canada and Mexico. And our Aussedat Rey and Scaldia affiliates in
France and the Netherlands give us broad exposure to the growing European
marketplace. Our distribution business has built its success by delivering a
wide range of products and superior customer service in a timely and economical
manner.

SPECIALTY PRODUCTS

Because they share materials, processes or customers with other International
Paper businesses, Specialty Products help us leverage the strengths and 
resources of our core enterprises. Our imaging products business serves the
photography and graphic arts markets. Specialty panels produces siding, door
facings, decorative surfaces, foam products and furniture components. Specialty
industrial papers includes products used for laminating, tape and release
applications such as pressure-sensitive labels. Veratec, our nonwovens
producer, is a leading manufacturer of spunbond fabrics used in consumer
disposable products. Arizona Chemical upgrades the natural byproducts of
papermaking into specialty products. And our petroleum operations play an
important role in our energy strategy.

FOREST PRODUCTS

International Paper owns or controls 6.1 million acres of U.S. forestlands,
giving us one of the largest fiber bases in our industry. The sawlogs and
pulpwood yielded by our forestry operations are used in our own plants and mills
and sold to other companies. We are also the fourth largest U.S. producer of
southern pine lumber, and we manufacture a broad range of panel and other wood
products. We take very seriously our responsibility to maintain the health and
vitality of the forests under our stewardship. The environmentally sound,
scientifically based forest management techniques we practice help us ensure
that our precious natural resources will be sustained and renewed for many
generations to come.

CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY

International Paper puts the safety of its employees, communities and 
environment first. We seek balanced solutions to environmental concerns, and
we strive to reduce the environmental impact of our operations. We have met
this challenge through responsible stewardship of our natural and industrial
resources, through conservation of wildlife habitats and by making our
forestlands available to the public for recreational and educational use. In
the same spirit, we dedicate considerable resources to improving safety in our
operations. Our constant focus on teamwork, technology and innovative thinking
helps us fulfill those responsibilities in a way that satisfies the needs of our
customers, the public, our employees, the environment and our shareholders.

UPDATE AND OUTLOOK: MID-1994 REVIEW

The first half of 1994 saw steady improvement in International Paper's 
overall results. Sales for the period totaled $7.0 billion versus $6.9 billion
during the first six months of 1993. Net earnings were $159 million, or $1.28
per share, up from $141 million and $1.14, respectively, one year ago. 

Although these increases are relatively modest, we believe that they represent
the beginning of a fundamental turnaround in many of our key markets. As
economic growth, worldwide demand, pricing trends and internal cost-cutting
initiatives all gather strength during the second half of this year, we expect
operating results to improve further.

More specifically, expanding economies in the U.S. and Europe are likely to
benefit many of our businesses. Over the next several years, for example,
demand for most of our paper grades is expected to grow faster than our
industry's capacity-expansion plans. This should lead to higher prices and,
together with the cost-control measures we have implemented, increased company
earnings over time. Similarly, continued strength in our fast-growing specialty
products and distribution businesses should also contribute to higher earnings.
Diverse markets, a strong balance sheet and prudent business strategies
position us to take full advantage of the upturn in the economic cycle that is
under way.

rapidly than many other species. By increasing our ownership of Carter Holt
Harvey from 16 percent to 24 percent in March, we realized a more substantial

interest in radiata pine forests in New Zealand and broader participation in the
growing markets of the Pacific Rim.

UPDATE 1

<PAGE>

PRINTING PAPERS

While our Printing Papers businesses reported a loss during the first six 
months of 1994, operating results improved considerably on sales of $2.0 
billion. First-half prices for uncoated papers declined slightly compared to a
year ago, but sales began to improve late in the period in response to low 
merchant inventories and rising end-user demand. Prices of coated papers have 
stabilized, supported by greater U.S. demand, stronger order backlogs, and 
growth in the catalog and insert markets.

We are especially encouraged by the improvement of our paper business in
Europe, where pulp prices, paper product prices and sales volume have rebounded
in response to the region's economic recovery. Our refurbished Saillat pulp
mill in France is operating near full capacity, and capital improvements at the
Kwidzyn paper mill in Poland have already had an impact on both quality and
output.

We are optimistic about the prospects for continued improvement in the 
printing papers markets during the second half of this year. Price increases 
for uncoated papers are being implemented domestically and further increases 
are expected in Europe. Over the longer term, we believe that margins in our 
uncoated papers business will expand when our new paper machine and wastepaper
deinking facility begin operations next year at our Riverdale mill in Alabama. 
This new system will help us reduce costs substantially, enhance our ability to
produce high-grade recycled papers and allow us to use other manufacturing 
assets more efficiently.

Caption: Recycling has become a way of life in communities throughout America,
and International Paper is pleased to provide markets for the nation's
recyclable waste. Springhill Incentive 100 and Hammermill Unity printing papers
are the first in the U.S. to contain 100 percent recycled fiber from old
newspapers and magazines.

<PAGE>

PACKAGING

Stronger markets for containerboard helped boost sales in our Packaging 
operations to $1.6 billion. Demand for containerboard rose in response to 
strong domestic and export markets, enabling us to raise prices late in 1993 
and again in the spring and summer of 1994. While bleached board prices 
declined compared to first-half 1993 levels, stronger global demand for 
consumer packaging should support higher prices in the months ahead.

The outlook for our Packaging businesses is strong as we continue to develop
premium products and solidify partnerships with key customers. To meet rising
demand, we are adding a recycling plant and a lightweight containerboard
machine to our mill in Mansfield, La. When construction is complete in 1996,
the new machine will have an annual capacity of 400,000 tons, giving
International Paper the widest selection of containerboard grades in the
industry, including the fast-growing white-top and mottled-white grades. 

Finally, we recently announced plans to increase our penetration of the 
important aseptic packaging market. Construction of a new facility in Lyons, 
France, and expansion of our Raleigh, N.C., plant will help us strengthen our 
position as a manufacturer of aseptic packaging, which keeps juice and other
perishable beverages fresh without refrigeration.

that provide innovative solutions to customers' needs. Among them is Triton, a 
degradable paperboard beverage ring carrier that is an efficient, printable and
environmentally friendly alternative to traditional plastic rings.

<PAGE>

DISTRIBUTION

Distribution earnings for the first half of 1994 grew slightly compared to 
year-ago results on sales of $1.6 billion. This improvement can be attributed 
to better business conditions in our U.S. and European markets.

Greater demand and higher prices for printing papers should boost 
Distribution sales further in the months ahead. Moreover, we believe that 
results will continue to improve as we complete the process of integrating our
various regional operations into one North American system, ResourceNet 
International, and achieve the economies of scale that a more coordinated
organization should produce. Moreover, this structure will enable us to enhance
service and strengthen relationships with customers in new and existing
markets.

SPECIALTY PRODUCTS

Buoyed by sales of $1.3 billion during the first half of this year, operating 
earnings in our Specialty Products businesses exceeded those of the same period
last year.

Our specialty panels business led the group in sales growth and operating
profits, supported by the ongoing success of CraftMaster door facings and
robust sales of decorative products. To meet rising demand, a new door facings
line at our Laurel, Miss., plant is scheduled for completion next year. Profits
from our imaging products businesses are also ahead of last year's first-half
levels, due primarily to upgraded products and lower manufacturing costs.

We expect Specialty Products to achieve record sales and earnings for 
full-year 1994. Looking forward, several major projects are under way that will

drive growth in these businesses. A rebuilt paper

machine in our Kaukauna, Wis., specialty industrial papers mill will meet
rising demand for backing papers for pressure-sensitive labels. A second
spunbond line in Toronto, Canada, will help us increase capacity, improve
quality and reduce costs for light- to medium-weight nonwovens. In addition,
higher commodity prices in our chemicals and petroleum operations should lead
to higher earnings in those businesses as well. 

FOREST PRODUCTS

Steady demand for curtailed supplies of stumpage and wood products helped 
Forest Products produce operating profits only slightly below the record pace 
set during the first half of 1993. Sales rose to $870 million as building 
activity remained strong in response to still-low interest rates and improved 
consumer confidence. Despite some moderation in the second quarter of 1994,
overall pricing levels for stumpage and wood products remained high.

Due in part to higher prices for conventional wood products, which have been
affected by logging restrictions on federal lands in the Pacific Northwest,
demand for engineered wood products such as oriented strand board (OSB) has
increased substantially. To satisfy this growing need, we are building a new
OSB plant in the southern U.S. that will more than double our manufacturing
capacity. 

We expect Forest Products to have another good year in 1994. Our harvest and
wood products volumes over the next six months should match first-half levels
in a favorable pricing environment.

used in pressure-sensitive adhesive products, International Paper is well
positioned to capture a larger share of this growing market.

operations; they are also home to a wide variety of wildlife. We are proud to
have received the National Wild Turkey Federation's first Industrial Forestry
Award in recognition of our wildlife preservation programs in company-owned
forests.
