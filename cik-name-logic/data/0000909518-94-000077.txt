FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
---------------------

JPS TEXTILE GROUP ENTERS INTO LETTER OF INTENT FOR
--------------------------------------------------
FOAMEX INTERNATIONAL TO ACQUIRE AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTS
---------------------------------------------------
AND SYNTHETIC INDUSTRIAL FABRICS BUSINESS
-----------------------------------------

GREENVILLE, SOUTH CAROLINA, April 28, 1994 -- JPS Textile Group, Inc.
announced today that it has signed a letter of intent to sell its
automotive products and synthetic industrial fabrics businesses to
Foamex International Inc. (NASDAQ: FMXI) for a purchase price of
approximately $272 million (which includes approximately $8 million in
assumed long-term debt).

On February 18, 1994, registration statements were filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission for the sale of common stock and
$150 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes of a newly
formed corporation, JPS Automotive Products Corp., organized to
acquire all of the automotive products and synthetic industrial
fabrics operations from JPS Textile Group.

Consummation of the transaction with Foamex is contingent upon, among
other things, the completion of due diligence reviews, the execution
of definitive agreements between the parties, the obtaining of certain
necessary third party consents and approvals, and the securing of
financing by Foamex. As part of the financing of the purchase prince,
it is contemplated that JPS Automotive will amend the terms of its
public offering of its senior notes to reflect the sale contemplated
by the letter of intent. The registration statement covering the
common stock of JPS Automotive will be withdrawn.

JPS Textile Group intends to utilize the net proceeds after taxes from
the sale of these businesses to retire indebtedness in accordance with
the terms of its indentures and credit agreements.

JPS Textile Group, Inc. is one of the largest diversified domestic
manufacturers of textile and textile related products, principally for
the apparel fabric, industrial and home fashion markets.

Commission but has not yet become effective. These securities may not
