Ladies and Gentlemen:

We previously were principal accountants for Structural Dynamics
Research Corporation and, under the date of January 17, 1994, we
reported on the consolidated financial statements of Structural
Dynamics Research Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1993 and 1992 and for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and
1991. On October 26, 1994, we resigned as principal accountants. 
We have read Structural Dynamics Research Corporation's statements
included under Item 4 of its Form 8-K dated October 26, 1994. We
agree with such statements except that we do not agree with
Structural Dynamics Research Corporation's statement that there
were no disagreements on any matter of accounting principles or
practices. On October 7, 1992, in connection with our timely
review of the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 1992,
we informed Structural Dynamics Research Corporation that if it did
not reverse revenue that it had recognized during the quarter ended
September 30, 1992 relating to a certain transaction with Hewlett
Packard that we would inform the audit committee of Structural
Dynamics Research Corporation that we believed that that material
transaction had been accounted for in a manner that was
inconsistent with generally accepted accounting principles. The
accounting for that transaction was resolved to our satisfaction.

Very truly yours,

/s/KPMG Peat Marwick LLP
