GREIF BROS. CORPORATION 

(Registrant)

By 

Allan Hull, General
Counsel and 
Member of the Board of Directors<PAGE>

Item 1.

The Board of Directors of Greif Bros. Corporation has
just received an opinion from the attending doctor for John C.
Dempsey, long-time Chairman and Chief Executive of the Company,
to the effect that recent severe deterioration has rendered Mr.
Dempsey unable to continue his responsibilities as a director and
officer of the Company.

By action of the Board of Directors, Mr. Dempsey's
responsibilities as Chief Executive Officer have been transferred
to Michael J. Gasser, Vice Chairman of the Board and previously
Chief Operating Officer of the Company. Mr. Dempsey has been
elected to the post of Chairman Emeritus of the Board of
Directors.

Mr. Dempsey has, for many years, exercised complete
voting control of the Company, primarily through voting trusts
from many shareholders holding beneficial ownership of the
Company's Class B Common Stock, as well as shares held by him as
trustee under a trust established in 1944 by Naomi A. Coyle.

As a result of Mr. Dempsey's inability to continue to
act in a trustee capacity, voting control of the Company has
passed to Mrs. Naomi C. Dempsey, 782 W. Orange Road, Delaware,
Ohio 43015, the beneficial owner of 3,021,618 shares of the Class
B Common Stock, and successor trustee of the 831,520 Class B
shares held in the Naomi A. Coyle Trust.

There are 6,657,215 Class B Common shares outstanding. 
The Class B Common shares are the only shares entitled to vote in
ordinary circumstances and under present circumstances.

Naomi C. Dempsey has stated that she has no intention
of varying the basic Greif policies long established by Mr.
Dempsey and has no intention whatsoever of parting with her
shares or the shares of which she is trustee.
