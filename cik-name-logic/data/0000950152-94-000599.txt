Report of Independent Auditors

Board of Directors and Shareholders
The J. M. Smucker Company

We have audited the accompanying statements of net assets acquired of The 
Frozen Pie Business of Mrs. Smith's Frozen Foods Co. as of December 31, 1993
and 1992 and the related statements of operations before income taxes for the
years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of Mrs.
Smith's Frozen Foods Co.'s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

As described in Note 1, the accompanying financial statements were prepared
solely to present the net assets acquired by The J. M. Smucker Company
pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, and are not intended to be a complete
presentation of The Frozen Pie Business's assets and liabilities.

In our opinion, the statements referred to above present fairly the net assets
acquired of The Frozen Pie Business of Mrs. Smith's Frozen Foods Co. at
December 31, 1993 and 1992 and its operations before income taxes for the years
then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Notes to Financial Statements

December 31, 1993 and 1992,
and unaudited three months ended March 31, 1994 and 1993

(Amounts in thousands)

NOTE A: ACQUISITION

On March 31, 1994 The J. M. Smucker Company acquired certain assets and assumed
certain liabilities of The Frozen Pie Business of Mrs. Smith's Frozen Foods
Co., a wholly owned subsidiary of Kellogg Company. The acquisition was made
pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated March 1, 1994. The Frozen Pie
Business manufactures and markets branded frozen retail pies, frozen retail
desserts, frozen pie shells and in-store bake pies under the Mrs. Smith's brand
name. The business is seasonal with the majority of sales and earnings
occurring during the second half of the calendar year.

Historically, earnings in the first calendar quarter were at a loss. In the
three months ended March 31, 1994, the loss was increased over the same period
last year by significant costs incurred with the national rollout of "Smart
Style", a new line of thaw-and-serve desserts.

The Frozen Pie Business had no separate legal status as it was an
integral part of Mrs. Smith's Frozen Foods Co.'s overall operations. As a
result, separate financial statements of The Frozen Pie Business were not
prepared. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared from the
historical accounting records of Mrs. Smith's Frozen Foods Co. Since only
certain assets are being acquired and liabilities assumed, statements of
financial position and cash flows are not applicable.

NOTE B: ACCOUNTING POLICIES

INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The unaudited interim financial statements reflect all adjustments which are,
in the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results for
the interim periods presented.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market determined on the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Costs include material, direct labor and
manufacturing overhead.

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant, and equipment are carried at cost with depreciation computed
over the estimated useful life by the straight-line method, based on the
following lives:

Buildings -- 40 years and machinery and equipment -- 10 years. Depreciation
expense was $3,255 and $2,863 for 1993 and 1992, respectively, and $808 and
$665 for the three months ended March 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

NOTE C: ALLOCATED COSTS

Since The Frozen Pie Business is an integral component of Mrs. Smith's
Frozen Foods Co., certain common costs incurred have been allocated in the
accompanying statements of operations before income taxes, based upon relative
sales volume, units of production, and assets in service. Allocated costs are
included in cost of products sold and selling and administrative expenses, as
follows:

believes are reasonable; however, these allocations are not necessarily
indicative of the expenses that would have been incurred had The Frozen Pie
Business been operated as a stand-alone business.

The Frozen Pie Business of Mrs. Smith's Frozen Foods Co.

Pro Forma Financial Information (Unaudited)

The following unaudited pro forma financial information is based on the
historical financial statements of The J. M. Smucker Company. The Frozen Pie 
Business of Mrs. Smith's Frozen Foods Co., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kellogg
Company, had no separate legal status as it was an integral part of Mrs.
Smith's Frozen Foods Co.'s overall operations. As a result, separate financial
statements of the frozen pie business were not prepared. The following pro
forma financial information has been prepared from the historical accounting
records of Mrs. Smith's Frozen Foods Co.

The pro forma information gives effect to the acquisition by The J. M. Smucker 
Company of certain net assets of The Frozen Pie Business pursuant to the Asset
Purchase Agreement, under the purchase method of accounting and the assumptions
and adjustments set forth in the accompanying notes to the unaudited pro forma
condensed consolidated financial statements.

The pro forma financial information may not be indicative of the results that
would have occurred if the transaction had taken place on the date indicated
nor do they represent a basis for assessing future performance. The pro forma
financial information should be read in conjunction with the historical
financial statements of The J. M. Smucker Company and Mrs. Smith's.
