REPUBLIC NEW YORK CORPORATION NET INCOME UP 16.1 PERCENT IN FIRST QUARTER

NEW YORK - APRIL 20, 1994: Republic New York Corporation announced today that
net income for the quarter ended March 31, 1994, increased 16.1 percent to
$79.8 million, compared to $68.7 million in the first quarter of 1993. Net
income in the fourth quarter of 1993 was $79.9 million.

Primary earnings per common share increased 16.9 percent to $1.38 in the first
quarter of 1994, compared to $1.18 in the first quarter of 1993. First quarter
1994 fully diluted earnings per common share rose 16.5 percent to $1.34,
compared to $1.15 in the first quarter of last year. Primary earnings per
common share in the fourth quarter of 1993 were $1.38. On a fully diluted
basis, earnings per common share were $1.34.

During the first quarter of 1994, Republic National Bank of New York agreed,
subject to obtaining necessary regulatory approval, to acquire a branch in
Brazil from Banco Exterior de Espana S.A. Also, Republic will open a
representative office in Copenhagen on July 1. This office will market
institutional banking services in Scandinavian countries.

As previously announced, Republic New York Securities Corporation, the
corporation's full-service brokerage subsidiary, formed a futures division.
This division will provide futures brokerage services with an initial focus on
foreign exchange, precious metals and financial futures.

NET INTEREST INCOME

Net interest income rose to $198.2 million in the first quarter of 1994 from
$191.5 million in the first quarter of last year. Net interest income on a
fully taxable equivalent basis was $206.5 million in the first quarter of 1994,
up from $199.0 million in the first quarter of 1993.

The net interest rate differential was 2.53 percent in the first quarter of
1994, compared to 2.41 percent in the first quarter of last year. This increase
is due primarily to a decrease in the cost of interest-bearing funds, primarily
deposits and long-term debt.

Average interest-earning assets were $33.1 billion in the first quarter of
1994, compared to $33.5 billion in the first quarter of last year. During the
current quarter, interest-bearing deposits with banks declined significantly,
while investment securities of U.S. Government agency mortgage-backed
securities, federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements
and loans in both domestic and foreign offices each increased over the first
quarter of 1993. Increases in interest-bearing deposits with the corporation,
long-term debt and trading account liabilities were offset by a decline in
short-term borrowings.

The corporation manages its sensitivity to interest rates through transactions
in the cash market and by entering into off-balance-sheet contracts, including
interest rate and currency swaps and interest rate caps and floors. These
contracts hedge specifically identified assets or liabilities with the
corresponding revenues or expenses reflected in the yield of the related
on-balance-sheet asset or liability. During the past year, the corporation has
taken steps to lengthen the maturity of its liabilities. At March 31, 1994, the
gross notional amount of such contracts used in asset and liability management
was approximately $8.3 billion. At March 31, 1994, the net effect of these
contracts was to decrease the net interest rate differential by 17 basis
points.

PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES AND OTHER CREDIT-RELATED ITEMS

The corporation's provision for loan losses was $10 million in the first
quarter of 1994, compared to $25 million in the first quarter of 1993 and $15
million in the fourth quarter. Net loan charge-offs, excluding restructuring
country debt, were $14.1 million in the first quarter of 1994. In the first
quarter of 1993, net charge-offs, excluding restructuring country debt, were
$14.9 million.

Net recoveries of restructuring country debt in the first quarter of 1994
amounted to $5.7 million, compared to recoveries of $1.2 million in the first
quarter of last year.

*On April 15, 1994, in the Brazilian restructuring settlement, the corporation
received bonds in exchange for substantially all of its outstandings from
Brazil, including bonds for payment of past-due interest. The market value of
the bonds received exceeded the carrying value of the non-accrual loans. Upon
sale of the bonds, the corporation will recognize any gain as a recovery to the
allowance for loan losses. The effect of this receipt is to reduce non-accrual
loans by $33.4 million.

</TABLE>

The allowance for possible loan losses, which is available to absorb credit
losses in the corporation's entire portfolio was 3.12 percent of total loans
outstanding at March 31, 1994, compared to 3.28 percent at year end 1993.

OTHER OPERATING INCOME

Total other operating income was $104.5 million in the first quarter of 1994,
compared to $81.0 million in the first quarter of 1993. Income from trading
activities rose to $48.8 million in the first quarter of 1994, compared to
$39.2 million in the first quarter of last year. This increase was due
primarily to higher levels of income from precious metals, a portion of which
is attributable to the additional business generated by the recent acquisition
of Republic Mase Bank Limited. Trading account profits and commissions also
rose in comparison to the first quarter of 1993, principally as a result of the
derivative products group activities. This group contributed $10.0 million of
revenue in the first quarter of 1994, compared to $3.9 million in the first
quarter of last year when they commenced operations. These increases were
partially offset by a decline in foreign exchange trading income.

Investment securities gains were $3.1 million in the first quarter of 1994,
compared to investment securities losses of $0.1 million in the first quarter
of last year. A net loss on loans sold or held for sale of $0.5 million in the
first quarter of 1994 compares with a net loss of $0.7 million in the first
quarter of last year.

Commission income amounted to $17.5 million in the first quarter of 1994,
compared with $9.4 million in the corresponding period of 1993. The increase
in the first quarter of 1994 is attributable to fees earned from the
corporation's full-service securities brokerage and investment management
activities, as well as to growth in other institutional fee-based services.

Equity in the earnings of Safra Republic Holdings S.A., a European
international private banking group of which the corporation owns approximately
49 percent, increased 58.7 percent to $21.1 million in the first quarter of
1994 from $13.3 million in the first quarter of last year.

- Page 4 of 6 -
<PAGE> 5
Other income was $14.6 million in the first quarter of 1994. In the first
quarter of 1993, other income was $19.8 million, which included a $5.1 million
gain on the sale of certain data processing rights.

OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES

Total operating expenses were $175.9 million in the first quarter of 1994,
compared to $146.9 million in the first quarter of 1993 and $174.4 million in
the fourth quarter of 1993.

Total operating expenses increased $29.1 million, or 19.8 percent, in the first
of quarter of 1994 from the first quarter of 1993. Of this increase,
approximately $21.9 million is associated with investments in recently
established business units, including Republic Mase Bank Limited, the bank's
derivative products group, the bank's retail branch expansion in California,
New York and Toronto, its increased domestic private banking and global trust
activities and the corporation's securities brokerage and investment management
subsidiaries, as well as increased levels of incentive-based compensation.

Salaries and employee benefits of $95.6 million in the first quarter of 1994
reflect an increase of 19.5 percent from $80.0 million in the first quarter of
the prior year. This increase is attributable primarily to recently established
business units mentioned above, which required increased staffing levels, as
well as increased levels of incentive-based compensation.

INCOME TAXES

Income taxes were $37.0 million in the first quarter of 1994 and $31.9 million
in the first quarter of last year. The increase is due to the higher level of
income subject to income taxes and the effect of applying a higher U.S.
statutory tax rate.

CAPITAL

On December 31, 1993, the corporation adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities" ("SFAS No. 115"). SFAS No. 115 requires, among other things, that
securities designated as available for sale be carried at market value with the
unrealized gain or loss, net of tax effect, recorded as a component of
stockholders' equity. At March 31, 1994, stockholders' equity included a
deduction of $21.8 million, which represents the after-tax unrealized loss in
the securities available for sale portfolio and approximately 49 percent of
Safra Republic Holdings' unrealized loss in its securities available for sale
portfolio.

The corporation's leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to quarterly average assets)
and its risk-based capital ratios (Tier 1 and total qualifying capital to
risk-weighted

- Page 5 of 6 -
<PAGE> 6
assets) include the assets and capital of Safra Republic Holdings on a
consolidated basis in accordance with the requirements of the Federal Reserve
Board specifically applied to the corporation. Regulatory guidelines require
the corporation to exclude Republic New York Securities Corporation's assets
and off-balance-sheet contracts from Republic New York Corporation's capital
calculations. It also requires the corporation to exclude one-half of its
investment in this subsidiary from each of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. These
regulations also require the corporation to exclude the $21.8 million reduction
of stockholders' equity related to the net unrealized losses on securities
available for sale, net of income taxes as recorded under SFAS No. 115.

On January 1, 1994, the corporation adopted Financial Accounting Standards
Board Interpretation No. 39, "Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain
Contracts." This interpretation requires, among other things, that unrealized
gains and losses on certain off-balance financial instruments be reported on a
gross basis except when a legally enforceable netting agreement with a
counterparty exists. At March 31, 1994, the adoption of this interpretation
resulted in an increase in the corporation's trading assets and liabilities of
approximately $1.6 billion.

At March 31, 1994, the corporation's estimated leverage ratio was 5.60 percent;
its estimated Tier 1, or "core", capital ratio was 16.15 percent, and the
estimated ratio of total qualifying capital was 27.80 percent. These ratios
substantially exceed the minimums in effect for bank holding companies.

At March 31, 1994, the ratio of the corporation's total common stockholders'
equity to total assets was 4.68 percent, compared to 5.05 percent on the
corresponding date last year. The decline in this ratio is primarily
attributable to the growth in total assets, which grew at a rate faster than
common equity.

Return on average common stockholders' equity, based on net income applicable
to common stock, was 13.43 percent for the first quarter of 1994. Excluding the
effect of SFAS No. 115 on average common stockholders' equity, the return was
15.18 percent in the first quarter of 1994, compared to 14.46 percent in the
corresponding quarter of 1993.

Return on average total assets, based on net income applicable to common stock,
was 0.72 percent in the first quarter of 1994, compared to 0.67 in the first
quarter of 1993. The book value of the corporation's common stock was $37.32
per share at March 31, 1994. Excluding the effect of SFAS No. 115, book value
was $37.73.

At March 31, 1994, the corporation's principal subsidiary, Republic National
Bank of New York, had deposits of $18.5 billion and capital of $2.0 billion.
The Republic Bank for Savings had deposits of $4.7 billion and capital of $445
million.
