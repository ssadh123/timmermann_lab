Report of Independent Auditors

Shareholder and Board of Directors
Summers Group, Inc.

We have audited the balance sheets of Summers Group, Inc. as of December 31,
1992, 1991, and 1990, and the related statements of income, shareholder's
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1992. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Summers Group, Inc. at
December 31, 1992, 1991, and 1990, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1992,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Notes to Financial Statements

December 31, 1992, 1991, and 1990

1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ORGANIZATION

Summers Group, Inc. (Summers or the Company), a Delaware corporation, is a
wholly owned subsidiary of SGDHC, Inc. (SGDHC) and an indirect, wholly owned
subsidiary of BTR Dunlop, Inc. (the Parent), a company incorporated in the
United States. The Parent is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of BTR plc
(BTR), a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The Company has
significant transactions with SGDHC, the Parent, BTR, and their affiliates,
which transactions are recorded on the bases determined by the parties (Notes 2
and 4).

The Company is a wholesale distributor selling electrical equipment and
supplies to commercial building contractors, public utilities and industrial
companies in various locations in the United States and operating under
numerous trade names.

Prior to January 1, 1990, the operations of the Company were conducted by
Summers Electric Company (and its wholly owned subsidiary, Summers Electric of
Oklahoma), Glasco Electric Company, and ESD (collectively referred to hereafter
as the Predecessor Companies). Each of the Predecessor Companies was a wholly
owned subsidiary of SGDHC. Effective January 1, 1990, the Company was formed
and issued, in the aggregate, 9,040 shares of its common stock to the
Predecessor Companies in exchange for the net operating assets of the
Predecessor Companies and 960 shares to Summers Electric of Oklahoma in
exchange for its net assets. Effective December 31, 1990, each of the
Predecessor Companies was liquidated into SGDHC and Summers Electric of
Oklahoma was liquidated into the Company. As a result of these transactions,
at December 31, 1990, SGDHC held 9,040 shares of the Company's common stock and
the remaining 960 shares, previously held by Summers Electric of Oklahoma, were
held in treasury by the Company. In March 1991, the treasury shares were
canceled and the Company issued 960 new shares of its common stock to SGDHC.
Accordingly, subsequent to March 1991, all 10,000 shares of the Company's
common stock are held by SGDHC.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

Accounts receivable represent amounts due from customers related to the sale of
electrical equipment and supplies. Credit is extended based upon an evaluation
of the customer's financial condition, and generally, collateral is not
required. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable
are limited because of the large number of customers in the Company's customer

Summers Group, Inc.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

base and their dispersion across geographic areas. The Company provides
allowances for potentially uncollectible accounts and cash discounts expected
to be taken by its customers.

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost being
determined on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. For purposes of the LIFO
calculation, the current cost of the Company's inventories is measured by
invoice cost less allowances for cash and volume purchase discounts earned.
Replacement cost exceeded the carrying value of the Company's inventories by
$8,897,000, $9,607,000, and $10,669,000 at December 31, 1992, 1991, and 1990,
respectively.

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Additions to and major improvements of property, plant, and
equipment are capitalized. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as
incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of the
assets and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
and any gain or loss is reflected in other income for the period. Net gains on
disposals of property, plant and equipment included in other income totaled
$1,086,000 and $636,000 in 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the Company's assets (20 to 30 years for buildings, 5 to 10 years for
computer equipment and software, and 5 to 10 years for fixtures and equipment).
Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lives of
the respective leases or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and noncompete agreements and
are amortized on a straight-line basis over terms that do not exceed 40 years.

INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense is provided on transactions recognized for financial
reporting purposes regardless of when such items are reported for tax purposes.
Deferred taxes are provided for the tax effects of timing differences between
financial statement reporting and income tax reporting of certain income and
expense items.

Summers Group, Inc.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

2. RELATED PARTIES

The Company is involved in a combined cash management program with other BTR
subsidiaries located in the United States. The amounts due (to) from
affiliates under these arrangements were ($8,151,000), ($11,777,000), and
$15,414,000 at December 31, 1992, 1991, and 1990, respectively. The advances
due (to) from affiliates fluctuate based upon the cash inflows and requirements
of the Company, but are repayable upon demand and do not bear interest.

In 1991, the Company distributed $35 million to SGDHC. This distribution was
recorded by increasing the balance of the Company's advances payable to
affiliate and, at the instruction of the Parent, represented a $17 million
dividend and a $18 million return of capital charged against the additional
paid-in capital of the Company.

The parent company charge represents an allocation of various costs from the
Parent and BTR.

3. PROPERTY, PLAN, AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant, and equipment costs of the following:

Less accumulated depreciation
and amortization 15,969 15,262 12,766
$19,139 $19,230 $15,710

4. INCOME TAXES

The Company's operations are included in the consolidated federal income tax
return of the BTR Dunlop Holdings, Inc. (Holdings), a U.S. corporation that is
the immediate parent company of the Parent. The Company's federal tax
provisions are computed as though the Company were filingseparate returns

<PAGE>
Summers Group, Inc.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

4. INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

utilizing the tax elections made by Holdings and in accordance with the
provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 11, "Accounting for
Income Taxes." An amount equal to the provision as computed is remitted to the
Parent annually through intercompany advances.

The provision for income taxes includes the following components:

[CAPTION]
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31
1992 1991 1990
(In Thousands)

[S] [C] [C] [C]
Current $2,646 $3,774 $5,145
Deferred 847 908 321
$3,493 $4,682 $5,466

The recorded tax provisions exceed the amounts resulting from the
multiplication of consolidated income before income taxes by the 34% statutory
federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes.

The deferred tax provision is attributable primarily to excess tax over book
depreciation and amortization of the Company's fixed assets. The tax effects
of such differences were $742,000, $404,000, and $273,000 in 1992, 1991, and
1990, respectively.

In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes,"
which the Company will be required to adopt as of January 1, 1993. SFAS No.
109 requires a change from the deferred to the liability method of computing
income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are provided on
differences in the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and
tax reporting purposes and are adjusted for enacted changes in tax rates and
laws. The Company has not yet implemented SFAS No. 109, and the impact of
adoption, if any, on the Company's financial statements has not been
determined.

5. CAPITALIZED LEASE OBLIGATIONS

The Company leases certain buildings under capital leases that expire at
various dates through 2003. The present value of the Company's obligations
under capital lease arrangements, based upon imputed interest rates ranging
from 8.0% to 10.2%, aggregated $531,000, $630,000, and $225,000 at December 31,

<PAGE>
Summers Group, Inc.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

5. CAPITALIZED LEASE OBLIGATIONS (CONTINUED)

1992, 1991, and 1990, respectively. The carrying value of buildings held under
capital lease arrangements and included in the Company's balance sheet
aggregated $519,000, $576,000, and $139,000 at December 31, 1992, 1991, and
1990, respectively.

6. OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS

The Company leases its corporate office and most of its branch warehouse
operational space under noncancelable operating leases. In addition, the
Company leases certain transportation, computer, and office equipment. Rental
expense under operating leases was $3,217,000, $3,330,000, and $3,338,000 in
1992, 1991, and 1990, respectively.

Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases, including
certain leases for properties abandoned by the Company, as of December 31,
1992, are as follows (in thousands):

1993 $ 3,199
1994 2,416
1995 1,853
1996 1,222
1997 1,106
Thereafter 3,230
$13,026

When a property is vacated or abandoned by the Company prior to the expiration
of its lease term, the present value of future minimum lease payments is
accrued in the period of abandonment. Accruals for abandoned leases are
included in other noncurrent liabilities and totaled $1,255,000, $1,335,000,
and $1,434,000 at December 31, 1992, 1991, and 1990, respectively.

7. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

RETIREMENT AND SAVINGS PLAN

The Company has a retirement and savings plan (the Plan). All full-time
employees with at least one year of qualifying continuous service are eligible
to participate in the Plan. Participating employees are permitted to make
voluntary contributions to the Plan on a pretax salary reduction basis in
accordance with the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.

<PAGE>
Summers Group, Inc.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

7. EMPLOYEES BENEFITS (CONTINUED)

Under the provisions of the Plan, the Company matches 50% of the employees'
contributions, up to 3%of each employee's compensation. Company matching
contributions to the Plan were $1,161,000, $1,183,000, and $1,024,000 in 1992,
1991, and 1990, respectively.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

In December 1990, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 106,
"Employer's Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," which
the Company will be required to implement in 1993. SFAS No. 106 requires
recognition of a liability for postretirement benefits as the employees render
service. While the Company has not yet completed the analysis required to
calculate the impact of adoption of SFAS No. 106, it does not believe that such
adoption will have a material impact on the Company's future financial position
or results of operations.

8. ACQUISITIONS

On September 25, 1992, the Company acquired the inventory, trade accounts
receivable, and fixed assets of Sterett Supply, Inc., which operates electrical
and utility supply houses throughout south Central Texas. The total
consideration paid was $3,577,000. The acquisition was recorded as a purchase,
and the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets
acquired ($861,000) has been recorded as goodwill and is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over 40 years.

On March 27, 1990, the Company acquired the inventory, trade accounts
receivable, and fixed assets of Southern Electric, which operates electrical
supply houses throughout northwest Arkansas. The total consideration paid was
$4,209,000. The acquisition was recorded as a purchase, and the excess of
purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired ($373,000)
has been recorded as goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-line basis
over 40 years.

On December 1, 1990, the Company acquired the inventory, fixed assets, and
certain trade accounts receivable of Cummins Supply, Inc., which operates
electrical and utility supply houses throughout Texas. The total consideration
paid was $13,573,000. The acquisition was recorded as a purchase, and the
excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired
($5,132,000) has been recorded as goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-
line basis over 40 years.

9. CONTINGENCIES

In March 1993, a competitor filed suit against the Company and one of the
Predecessor Companies (collectively Companies) in the District Court in Dallas
County, Texas. The suit asserts that the Companies interfered with existing
contracts, prospective contracts, and business relations of the competitor,
which prevented the competitor from becoming an authorized distributor for a
supplier. The competitor is seeking $2,057,000 in actual damages and
$15,000,000 in punitive damages, and the trial is currently scheduled for
January 24, 1994. The Company, after consultation with legal counsel, believes
that the suit is without merit and is vigorously defending its position.
Certain other claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
the Company's business are pending against the Company. Management believes
that neither the aforementioned suit nor these other claims or lawsuits,
individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations; therefore, no provision
has been recorded in the financial statements.

addressed to W&G stating that 1993 PBIT as set forth in the 1993 Certificate
was calculated in accordance with this Agreement. W&G shall cause Summers to
give Seller full access to the personnel, books and records of Summers during
normal business hours upon reasonable request of Seller and shall cause Summers
to provide to Seller information reasonably requested by Seller by completing
forms customarily utilized by BTR in the past to collect financial information

Financial Statements and the calculation of 1993 PBIT. Seller shall make
available to W&G its accountants' work papers (excluding papers containing
Accountants Proprietary Information of such accountants) and such other
information relating to the 1993 Financial Statements or the calculation of the
1993 PBIT as W&G shall reasonably request.

(b) As promptly as practicable after December 31, 1994, and in
any event not later than March 1, 1995, W&G shall deliver to Seller (i) a
balance sheet of Summers as of December 31, 1994 and a statement of income and

unqualified opinion without explanatory language of Summers' independent public
accountants with respect to the 1994 Financial Statements, (iii) a certificate
of W&G (the "1994 Certificate") showing its calculation of the PBIT of Summers

Information of such accountants) and such other information relating to the
1994 Financial Statements or the calculation of the 1994 PBIT, and shall
provide Seller access to such personnel of Summers and its accountants, as
Seller shall reasonably request.

(c) In the event that W&G disputes the calculation of 1993 PBIT
or Seller disputes the calculation of 1994 PBIT, the disputing party shall give
written notice thereof (the "Dispute Notice") to the other parties to this
Agreement within 30 days after the 1993 Certificate or 1994 Certificate on
which the dispute is based was given to the disputing party, which notice shall
set forth the basis for such dispute in reasonable detail. The parties shall
use all reasonable efforts to resolve any such dispute, but if any such dispute
cannot be resolved by the parties within 30 days after the date the Dispute
Notice is given, all unresolved disputes shall be referred to an Arbitrating
Firm for resolution. The parties shall seek to cause the Arbitrating Firm to
make its determination within 60 days after referral of a dispute to it. The
determination of the Arbitration Firm shall be conclusive and binding on each
party. The fees of the Arbitrating Firm shall be allocated and paid by Seller
or W&G, or divided between them, on a basis determined by the Arbitrating Firm
to be fair taking into account the correctness of the positions asserted by
each of them with respect to the disputed matters resolved by the Arbitrating
Firm.

(d) 1993 PBIT shall be deemed to be finally determined in the
amount set forth in the 1993 Certificate on the 30th day after such Certificate
is given to W&G, and 1994 PBIT shall be deemed to be finally determined in the
amount set forth in the 1994 Certificate on the 30th day after such Certificate
is given to Seller, in each case unless a Dispute Notice is given in accordance
with Section 3.2(c) with respect to the calculation thereof. If such a Dispute

<PAGE>
Notice is given, the PBIT subject to dispute shall be deemed finally determined
on the date that the Arbitrating Firm gives written notice to W&G and Seller of
its determination with respect to all disputes regarding the calculation
thereof, or, if earlier, the date on which Seller and W&G agree in writing on
the amount thereof, in which case such disputed PBIT shall be calculated in
accordance with such determination or agreement, as the case may be.

(e) If the product of 1993 PBIT, as finally determined,
multiplied by seven (such product, the "1993 PBIT Price") exceeds $85 million
(such excess amount, the "1993 Additional Amount"), on the fifth Business Day
after 1993 PBIT is finally determined, Buyer shall deliver to Seller:

(i) A promissory note of W&G, dated the date of
delivery and substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, in a
Principal Amount at Maturity equal to the sum of (A) the 1993
Principal Amount plus (B) the Interest Component with respect to such
note. "1993 Principal Amount" shall mean (x) the 1993 Additional
Amount, up to $15 million, plus (y) if the 1993 Additional Amount
exceeds $15 million (such excess, the "1993 Excess Amount"), 40% of

in no event be more than $23 million.

(ii) Cash (the "1993 Cash Amount") equal to 60% of any 1993
Excess Amount, up to a maximum cash payment of $12 million.

(f) If 1994 PBIT exceeds 110% of 1993 PBIT, in each case as

and the sum of the 1993 PBIT Price plus the 1994 PBIT Price exceeds $85 million
(such excess, the "Total Additional Amount"), on the fifth Business Day after
1994 PBIT is finally determined, Buyer shall deliver to Seller:

(i) A promissory note of W&G, dated the date of delivery and
substantially in the form of Exhibit A hereto, in a Principal Amount
at Maturity equal to the sum of (A) the 1994 Principal Amount plus
(B) the Interest Component with respect to such note. "1994
Principal Amount" shall mean (x) if the Total Additional Amount is
$15 million or less, the excess, if any, of the Total Additional
Amount over the 1993 Principal Amount or (y) if the Total Additional
Amount is more than $15 million, the sum of (1) the excess, if any,
of $15 million over the 1993 Principal Amount plus (2) 40% of any

<PAGE>
excess (the "1994 Excess Amount") of (I) the Total Additional Amount
less any excess amount referred to in the preceding clause (1) over
(II) the 1993 Additional Amount, provided that the 1994 Principal
Amount shall in no event be more than $23 million less the 1993
Principal Amount.

(ii) Cash equal to 60% of any 1994 Excess Amount, up to a
maximum cash payment of $12 million less the 1993 Cash Amount.

(g) Buyer's obligation to make the deliveries of cash and notes
pursuant to Section 3.2(e) is subject to the condition that the Closing shall
have occurred prior thereto, and if the Closing shall not have occurred when
such obligation otherwise arises, such obligation shall be deemed to be an
obligation of Buyer to be performed at the Closing. If a Change of Control of
W&G shall have occurred and be continuing at the time Buyer is obligated to
deliver any Purchase Price Note pursuant to this Section 3.2, Buyer shall
deliver in lieu of such Note cash in an amount equal to the Stated Principal of
such Note. Payments of cash pursuant to this Section shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account in the United States
designated by Seller to Buyer at least two Business Days prior to the date such
payment is due. Deliveries of promissory notes pursuant to this Section shall
be made at the principal executive office of W&G.

(a) Set forth in Schedule 4.5 hereto is an accurate list of:

(i) each "employee benefit plan" within the meaning
of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and

including, without limitation, any stock option, stock purchase, sick
leave, vacation pay, holiday pay, employee loan, educational
assistance, incentive or bonus plan, policy or arrangement or any
employment, indemnification, consulting or severance plan, policy or
agreement,

covering current or former employees or directors of Summers or any Subsidiary
of Summers, or with respect to which Summers or any Subsidiary of Summers has
any liability, whether written or oral ("Benefit Plans", except that such term

<PAGE>
shall not include any plan identified on Schedule 4.8(e) hereto). Except as
disclosed in Schedule 4.5 hereto, neither Summers nor any Subsidiary of Summers
has made any commitment to create any additional Benefit Plan or to terminate
or modify or change in any respect any existing Benefit Plan.

(b) Summers has delivered to W&G prior to the date of this
Agreement complete and correct copies of each Benefit Plan, or written
summaries of any unwritten Benefit Plan, and, with respect to each Benefit
Plan, any related trust agreements, insurance contracts, collective bargaining
agreements, the latest Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") determination letter,
the last three annual reports on IRS Form 5500 or annual financial statements,
the last three actuarial reports, and the most recent summary plan description
or other employee handbook. Set forth in Schedule 4.8(b) hereto is a true and
complete statement of (i) the names, current rates of base compensation and
amounts of supplemental compensation of all officers and of other employees of
Summers whose total compensation is expected to exceed $75,000 during 1993, and
(ii) the compensation from Summers of all sales agents, dealers or distributors
of Summers listed in (g) of Schedule 4.5 hereto for the calendar year 1992 and
first eight months of 1993.

(c) Each Benefit Plan is and has been in substantial
compliance, in form and operation, with all applicable laws and regulatory
requirements, and has been administered substantially in accordance with its
terms. Each Benefit Plan intended to be tax-qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to its
tax-qualified status under the Code, and nothing has occurred since the date of
such favorable determination letter which would adversely affect its tax-
qualified status. Each trust of a Benefit Plan which is intended to be a
voluntary employees' beneficiary association under Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code ("VEBA") has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS as to
its tax-qualified status under the Code, and nothing has occurred since the
date of such favorable determination letter which would adversely affect its
tax-qualified status.

(d) Within the last seven years, neither Summers nor any
Subsidiary of Summers has contributed to or had an obligation to contribute to
any "single employer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA.

(e) Schedule 4.8(e) hereto identifies each "multiemployer plan"
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA and each health or welfare
plan which is subject to Section 302 of the Labor Management Relations Act of

<PAGE>
1947 to which Summers or its Subsidiaries contributes or has an obligation to
contribute, and sets forth the number of covered employees, number of
contribution base units, and amount of contributions for each of the last five
years with respect to each such plan. To the knowledge of BTR, Seller, and
Summers and its Subsidiaries, each such plan is in substantial compliance with
all applicable laws and regulatory requirements, and no such plan is in
reorganization, is insolvent, is in the process of terminating, or is a party
to any pending merger or transfer of assets and liabilities. With respect to
any such plan to which Summers or its Subsidiaries currently or formerly
contributed or had an obligation to contribute: (x) neither Summers nor its
Subsidiaries has incurred any withdrawal liability which has not been
satisfied, and (y) Summers and its Subsidiaries have timely made all
contributions required by the terms of the plan or any collective bargaining
agreement. Neither Summers nor any Subsidiary of Summers has made any
commitment to contribute to an additional multiemployer plan or, except as
provided in a collective bargaining agreement, a copy of which has been
provided to W&G, to increase, terminate or modify its contributions with
respect to any multiemployer plan. Neither Summers nor any Subsidiary of
Summers has ever contributed to or had an obligation to contribute to a
"multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA.

(f) No event has occurred and no condition exists with respect
to any Benefit Plan which is reasonably expected to subject Summers, any
Subsidiary of Summers, W&G, Buyer, or any of their employees, directly or
indirectly (through an indemnification agreement or otherwise), to a liability
for a breach of fiduciary duty or for an excise tax, penalty tax or fine under
the Code or ERISA, including, without limitation, liability for a "prohibited
transaction" within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the
Code. No Benefit Plan or related trust is liable for any federal, state, local
or foreign taxes. There are no actions, suits, or claims (other than routine
claims for benefits in the ordinary course) with respect to any Benefit Plan
pending or threatened which could give rise to a material liability, and
Summers has no knowledge of any facts which could give rise to any such
actions, suits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits in the
ordinary course). No Benefit Plan is currently under investigation, audit or
review by any governmental agency and, to the knowledge of Summers, no such
investigation, audit or review is contemplated or under consideration.

(g) No event has occurred nor does any condition exist with
respect to any employee benefit plan or arrangement maintained, sponsored or

<PAGE>
contributed to by any entity which is treated as a single employer with Summers
under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code ("ERISA Affiliate") which is
reasonably expected to subject Summers, any Subsidiary of Summers, W&G, Buyer
or any of their employees, directly or indirectly (through an indemnification
agreement or otherwise), to liability, including, without limitation, liability
under Section 412, 4971 or 4980B of the Code or Title IV of ERISA. Neither the
execution of this Agreement nor the Closing will be a "reportable event" under
Section 4043 of ERISA (for which the 30-day notice requirement has not been
waived by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC")), with respect
to any defined benefit plan maintained, sponsored or contributed to by an ERISA
Affiliate.

(h) All contributions and premium payments required to have
been made under or with respect to any Benefit Plan have been timely made.

(i) Schedule 4.8(i) hereto sets forth: (i) the amount of
premiums paid by Summers with respect to current and former employees of
Summers or any Subsidiary of Summers under any insured group health plan for
each of the last two calendar years and eight months ending August 31, 1993;
and (ii) the amount of claims paid by Summers or any Subsidiary of Summers with
respect to current and former employees of Summers or any Subsidiary of Summers
under any self-insured group health plan for each of the last two calendar
years and eight months ending August 31, 1993. No Benefit Plan provides life,
health or other welfare benefits to retirees or other terminated employees,
other than continuation coverage mandated by Section 4980B of the Code or any
state law requiring similar continuation coverage.

(j) The execution and performance of this Agreement will not
trigger or accelerate the payment or vesting, or increase the amount of
compensation or remuneration (whether of severance pay or otherwise) due any
employee, former employee, or director of Summers or any Subsidiary of Summers.

(k) Each Benefit Plan covers only current or former employees
or directors of Summers or any Subsidiary of Summers and their beneficiaries.
Substantially accurate and complete records for each Benefit Plan have been
maintained and are in the custody of Summers or a third party service provider
retained by Summers.

4.9 Labor Relations. Summers has paid or made provision for payment
of all salaries and accrued wages and has complied with all applicable laws,

<PAGE>
rules and regulations relating to the employment of labor, including those
relating to wages, hours, collective bargaining and the payment and withholding
of taxes. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.9 hereto, no union or other
collective bargaining unit has been certified or recognized by Summers as
representing any of its employees. No more than 20 employees of Summers are
represented by a union or other collective bargaining unit. There are no
proceedings pending or, to the knowledge of Summers, threatened between Summers
and any labor union or other collective bargaining unit representing any of
such employees. Summers is not affected by any current or, to Summers'
knowledge, threatened strike or other labor disturbance. To Summers'
knowledge, no union not already recognized as a collective bargaining agent of
Summers' employees is attempting to represent any of the Summers' employees as
collective bargaining agent nor is any current collective bargaining agent
attempting to represent any additional group of the Summers' employees.

4.10 Environmental Matters.
(a) Summers has obtained all permits, licenses and other

regulations, rules, codes, plans, decrees, judgments, injunctions, notices and
demand letters issued, entered, promulgated or approved thereunder, all as

being herein referred to as "Environmental Laws"). Summers is in compliance in
all material respects with all terms and conditions of all Environmental
Permits required under the Environmental Laws, and is also in compliance in all
material respects with all other limitations, restrictions, conditions,

knowledge of Summers, Seller and BTR, there are no past or present events,

law or other legal liability or obligation with respect to the Businesses or
the Assets, including, but not limited to, liability or obligation under the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
("CERCLA"), based on or related to the manufacture, processing, distribution,
use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling or the emission,

under CERCLA or any applicable similar state law) has occurred or is currently
occurring in connection with the conduct of the business of Summers or any

such transactions being referred to herein as an "Acquisition Transaction"),
and Summers, Seller and BTR shall not, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates (including their respective directors, officers, employees and
advisors) not to, accept any proposal with respect to any Acquisition
Transaction. If Summers, Seller, BTR or any of their respective Affiliates
(including their respective directors, officers, employees and advisors) shall
receive any proposal with respect to any Acquisition Transaction, Summers,
Seller or BTR shall immediately communicate to Buyer and W&G the terms of such
proposal.

6.11 Non-Competition. BTR agrees that it shall not and that it shall
cause its Affiliates not to, prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date
(the "Non-Compete Period"), directly or indirectly, individually or for, with
or through any other Person (which shall be deemed to include any equity
participation in any other Person), compete with Buyer or any subsidiary or
other Affiliate of Buyer or any of its or their successors or assigns of the
business conducted at the Closing by Summers (collectively, "Non-Compete
Parties"), with respect to the business of distributing electrical parts and
supplies in any state in the United States in which any Non-Compete Party is
engaged in such business ("Restricted Operations"); provided, however, that
nothing herein shall be construed to prevent BTR from owning, as an investment,
up to 10% of a class of equity securities issued by any competitor of any Non-
Compete Party that is publicly traded and registered under Section 12 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934; and provided further, however, that nothing in
this Agreement shall prohibit the acquisition by BTR or any of its Affiliates
of any equity interest or similar financial interest in, or control of, a
diversified company having not more than 10% of its total assets (based on its
most recently prepared annual financial statements prior to the acquisition)
attributable to Restricted Operations, as long as BTR or the Affiliate divests
the Restricted Operations of the diversified company within two years after the
acquisition. The parties intend that the covenant contained in the preceding
sentence shall be construed as a series of separate covenants, one for each

<PAGE>
county and city included within each state or other jurisdiction and, except
for geographic coverage, each such separate covenant shall be deemed identical.
The parties agree that the covenants deemed included in this Section are, taken
as a whole, reasonable in their geographic scope and their duration and no
party shall raise any issue of the reasonableness of the scope or duration of
the covenants in any proceeding to enforce any such covenants. If, in any
judicial proceeding, a court shall refuse to enforce any separate covenant,
then the unenforceable covenant shall be modified in order to make it
acceptable to the court and enforced accordingly, or, if necessary, deemed
eliminated to the extent necessary to permit the remaining separate covenants
to be enforced.

6.12 Non-Solicitation of Employees. Seller and BTR agree that, until
the end of the Non-Compete Period, neither Seller, BTR nor any of their
respective Affiliates will, directly or indirectly, (i) influence or attempt to
influence any Person employed by Summers to leave Summers' employ, or (ii)
employ any Person who was employed by Summers at any time within one year prior
to the time of such employment with Seller, BTR or any of their respective
Affiliates.

6.13 Additional Agreements. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its best efforts at
its own expense and in compliance with applicable law to take, or cause to be
taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In case at any time after the Closing any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the proper
officers of Seller and Buyer, as appropriate, shall take all such action.

6.14 Financing. W&G shall use its best efforts to obtain the
Financing required to effect the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and shall pay all related fees and expenses. W&G will promptly deliver to
Seller and BTR accurate and complete copies of all final documentation relating
to the Financing received by it or any of its Affiliates after the date of this
Agreement. In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable,
regardless of the reason therefor, W&G shall, upon learning thereof, promptly
so advise Seller and BTR and use its best efforts to obtain alternative
financing from other sources. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, W&G shall use its best efforts to satisfy on or before the Closing

<PAGE>
all requirements of the Lender which are conditions to closing the Financing
referred to in the Commitment Letter. The obligations contained in this
Section are not intended, nor shall they be construed, to benefit or confer any
rights upon any person other than the parties hereto.

6.15 Post-Closing Operations. During the period from and after the
Closing to and including December 31, 1994, except as specifically consented to
or approved by Seller or BTR in writing or as permitted under Schedule 1.1
hereto:

(a) Summers shall conduct its business and operations only in
the ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practice of Summers
(except to the extent that any such past practice would breach a representation
or warranty of Summers, Seller and BTR made in or pursuant to this Agreement).

(b) Summers will use its best efforts to preserve and maintain
its business and properties and to maintain the profitability of Summers.

(c) Summers will not engage in any business other than the
distribution of electrical parts and supplies.

(d) Summers will not consolidate with or merge into any Person
or transfer all or substantially all of its assets to any Person.

(e) Summers will not transfer any of its branch operations or
customer accounts to W&G or any of W&G's Affiliates and Summers will not
acquire from W&G or any of its Affiliates any branch operations or customer
accounts.

(f) Summers will not make any strategic business decision the
main purpose of which is to reduce PBIT during 1993 or 1994.

(g) W&G will cause a senior executive of BTR plc designated by
BTR plc to W&G to be elected as a director of Summers.

6.16 Taxes.
(a) Seller will cause to be duly prepared and timely filed all
consolidated, unitary, or combined federal, foreign, state and local Income Tax
Returns of any group in which Seller or any of its Affiliates and Summers are
included (any such group being referred to herein as a "Seller Group") for all
taxable periods of Summers ending on or before the Closing Date. Seller will

<PAGE>
cause Seller Parent to include Summers in the Seller's Affiliated Group's
consolidated federal Income Tax Returns for all taxable periods of Summers
ending on or before the Closing Date. Seller will cause Seller Parent to
include Summers in any other consolidated or combined basis filing for any
taxable period of Summers ending on or before the Closing Date as Seller Group
shall require. Seller will pay, and will indemnify and hold harmless on a Net
After-Tax Basis Summers, Buyer and Buyer's Affiliates from and against, any
Income Taxes imposed upon any Seller Group for any taxable period, including
any such Income Taxes imposed as the result of the deemed asset sale pursuant
to the Election made pursuant to Section 6.16(d) (and any comparable election
under state or local tax law).

(b) Seller will cause to be prepared and filed all Income Tax
Returns other than those described in Section 6.16(a) above required to be
filed by Summers for periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date ("Pre-
Closing Separate Returns"). Seller will pay, and will indemnify and hold
harmless on a Net After-Tax Basis Summers, Buyer and Buyer's Affiliates from
and against, any Income Taxes imposed on Summers other than those described in
Section 6.16(a) above attributable to periods ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, including any such Income Taxes imposed as the result of the deemed asset
sale pursuant to the Election made pursuant to Section 6.16(d) (and any
comparable election under state or local tax law).

(c) Seller will cause to be prepared and filed all Income Tax
Returns required to be filed by Summers for periods ending after the Closing
Date that include the Closing Date ("Straddle Periods"); provided, however,
that Buyer shall cause to be prepared and filed any such Income Tax Return if
the Closing Date is after December 31, 1993. Buyer will cause Summers to pay,
and will indemnify and hold harmless on a Net After-Tax Basis Seller and its
Affiliates from and against, any Income Taxes imposed upon Summers for any such
taxable period; except that Seller will reimburse Buyer for, and will indemnify
and hold harmless Summers, Buyer and Buyer's Affiliates from and against, the
amount of Income Taxes attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Period") that would be reflected
on Income Tax Returns of Summers for the Pre-Closing Period, assuming that the
books of Summers were closed as of and including the Closing Date and such
Income Tax Returns were permitted in respect thereof ("Pro Forma Returns"),
including any such Income Taxes imposed as the result of the deemed asset sale
pursuant to the Election made pursuant to Section 6.16(d) (and any comparable
election under state or local tax law).

<PAGE>
(d) Buyer and Seller Parent will jointly make an election
pursuant to Sections 338(g) and 338(h)(10) of the Code (the "Election") and any
comparable election under state or local tax laws with respect to the purchase
by Buyer of the Shares. Seller, Buyer, and their respective Affiliates will
cooperate with each other to take all actions necessary and appropriate
(including filing such forms, returns, elections, schedules and other documents
as may be required) to effect a timely Election in accordance with the
provisions of Temporary Treasury Regulation Section 1.338(h)(10)-1T (and any
comparable provisions of state or local tax law) or any successor provisions.
Seller, Buyer, and their respective Affiliates will report the sale of the
Shares pursuant to this Agreement consistent with the Election (and any
comparable elections under state or local tax laws) and will take no position
inconsistent therewith in any Tax Return, any proceeding before any taxing
authority or otherwise. For purposes of this Section 6.16, any election under
state or local tax law which is comparable to the election under Section 338(g)
of the Code (whether or not such election is comparable to the election under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code) shall be considered to be comparable to the
Election. Buyer and Seller shall endeavor in good faith to agree upon the
allocation of the "adjusted grossed-up basis" and the "deemed sales price" (as
such terms are defined in Section 338 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder) among the assets of Summers (the "Allocation"). If Buyer and
Seller are not able to agree upon the Allocation within 60 days after the
Closing, the Allocation shall be determined by an appraisal firm selected by
Buyer and reasonably acceptable to Seller. The costs and expenses for the
services of such appraisal firm shall be borne by Buyer. The parties hereto
shall reflect the Allocation in all Tax Returns. Seller shall cause Seller
Parent and its other Affiliates to take any actions necessary in order to
effect the Election (and any comparable elections under state or local tax
laws) and to comply with the provisions of this Section 6.16(d).

(e) Seller will be entitled to retain, or receive prompt
payment from Buyer or Summers of, any refund or credit for overpayment of taxes
attributable to any Seller Group Taxes, Pre-Closing Separate Returns or, in the
case of Income Taxes subject to Section 6.16(c), the Pre-Closing Period, plus
any interest received with respect thereto from the relevant taxing
authorities; provided, however, that Seller will not be entitled to, and will
promptly pay over to Summers, any refund or credit resulting from a carryback
attributable to Summers arising in a period after the Closing.

<PAGE>
(f) Buyer will promptly notify Seller in writing upon receipt
by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of notice of any pending or threatened audit
or assessment with respect to Taxes for which Seller would be required to pay
or indemnify Buyer or any of its Affiliates pursuant to Sections 6.16(a),
6.16(b) or 6.16(c), but any failure to so notify Seller shall not relieve
Seller from any liability it may have to Buyer under this Section 6.16, except
to the extent that Seller is prejudiced by the failure to give such notice.
Seller will have the sole right to represent the Seller Group's interest in any
audit, administrative or court proceeding relating to Seller Group Taxes or Pre-
Closing Separate Returns, except that Seller may not settle or compromise any
such proceeding without Buyer's consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, if
the settlement or compromise could adversely affect the liability of Buyer or
Summers for Income Taxes for periods after the Closing. Seller will have the
right to participate at its expense in any audit, administrative or court
proceeding relating to Straddle Periods.

(g) After the Closing Date, each of Buyer and Seller shall (i)
furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information (including access to books, records and
personnel) and assistance as is reasonably requested for the preparation and
filing of any Tax Return or related document, for the preparation for any tax
audit and for the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding
relating to Taxes and (ii) use reasonable efforts, upon request, to obtain any
certificate or other document from any taxing authority, customer or any other
person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any taxation that
would otherwise be imposed, provided that neither Seller nor Buyer shall be
required to take any action under the preceding provisions of this paragraph
that is inconsistent with another tax position being taken by such party. So
long as Seller is exercising its rights hereunder to control the preparation of
any Tax Returns and the conduct of any proceedings with respect to the Taxes in
question, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall, without Seller's
permission, take any position in relation to its assets or activities in
respect of tax periods for which Buyer would be entitled to make a claim
against Seller under the provisions of this Agreement which is inconsistent
with the tax position previously taken by Seller, except to the extent that
there is no reasonable basis for continuing to maintain any such previous tax
position as determined by Buyer by agreement with Seller, such agreement not to
be unreasonably withheld. As part of the information required to be provided
under the terms of this sub-clause, Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared
by Summers the schedules (known as the BTR Group T-Schedules) containing the

<PAGE>
information necessary to prepare the consolidated tax return and to comply with
tax accrual requirements.

(h) As of the Closing, Summers will be released from any
obligation with respect to any period under any tax sharing or tax allocation
agreements between Summers and Seller or its Affiliates.

(i) All provisions of this Section 6.16 which apply to Summers
shall apply with equal force and effect to the Subsidiaries of Summers. All
references in this Section 6.16 to Summers shall be deemed to include
references to predecessors of Summers.

6.17 Confidential Information.

(a) W&G shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and their
respective officers, employees, auditors, attorneys and other authorized
representatives ("Representatives") to, hold in confidence (unless and to the
extent compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process or, in the
opinion of its counsel, by other requirements of law) all Summers Confidential
Information (as defined below) and shall not disclose the same to any third
party except as may reasonably be necessary to carry out this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including any due diligence review. If this
Agreement is terminated, W&G shall promptly return to Summers, upon the
reasonable request of Summers, all Summers Confidential Information furnished
by Summers to W&G, including all copies and summaries thereof. As used in this
Section 6.17(a), "Summers Confidential Information" shall mean all information
concerning Summers obtained by W&G from Summers, Seller or BTR or any of their
Representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement except information (i) ascertainable or obtained from public
information, (ii) received from a third party not employed by or otherwise
affiliated with Summers, Seller or BTR, (iii) which is or becomes known to the
public, other than through a breach of this Agreement, or (iv) furnished to W&G
for use in any governmental or regulatory filing.

(b) BTR shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives to, hold in confidence (unless and to the extent
compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process or, in the opinion
of its counsel, by other requirements of law) all Confidential Information (as
defined below) and shall not disclose the same to any third party except as may
reasonably be necessary to carry out this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. As used in this Section 6.17(b), "Confidential

<PAGE>
Information" shall mean all information concerning Summers or any of its
Subsidiaries obtained by BTR or any of its Affiliates or any of their
Representatives except information (i) ascertainable or obtained from public
information, (ii) received from a third party not employed by or otherwise
affiliated with Summers or any of its Subsidiaries, (iii) which is or becomes
known to the public, other than through a breach of this Agreement or (iv)
furnished to BTR for use in any governmental or regulatory filing.

6.18 Remedial Action. Prior to undertaking any W&G Remedial Action,
Summers shall consult with BTR with respect to its proposals for such W&G
Remedial Action and shall provide to BTR such information concerning the W&G
Remedial Action (including without limitation, cost estimates) and the
Environmental Condition to which it relates as BTR shall reasonably request.
Summers shall provide BTR a reasonable opportunity prior to undertaking any W&G
Remedial Action to develop a proposal with respect to any such W&G Remedial
Action at a cost less than that projected by Summers, and Summers will give
reasonable consideration to any such proposal.

10. CLOSING NET ASSET VALUE.

10.1 Calculation of Closing Net Asset Value.
(a) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, and in
any event not later than 42 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver
to W&G (i) a balance sheet of Summers as of the end of the Closing Date (the
"Closing Balance Sheet"), prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP consistently
applied with the Certified Financial Statements but without giving effect to
any changes attributable to the purchase of the Shares by Buyer, (ii) the
unqualified opinion without explanatory language of Seller's Accountants with
respect to the Closing Balance Sheet, (iii) a certificate of Seller (the "Net
Asset Certificate") showing its calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value and
(iv) a report of Seller's Accountants addressed to W&G stating that the Closing
Net Asset Value as set forth in the Net Asset Certificate was calculated in
accordance with this Agreement. W&G shall cause Summers to give Seller full
access to the personnel, books and records of Summers during normal business
hours upon reasonable request of Seller and shall cause Summers to provide to
Seller information reasonably requested by Seller by completing forms
customarily utilized by BTR in the past to collect financial information from
Summers, all to enable Seller and its representatives to prepare the Closing
Balance Sheet and the Net Asset Certificate. Seller shall make available to

<PAGE>
W&G its accountants' work papers (excluding papers containing Accountants
Proprietary Information of such accountants) and such other information
relating to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the calculation of
the Closing Net Asset Value as W&G shall reasonably request.

(b) In the event that W&G disputes the calculation of the
Closing Net Asset Value, W&G shall give written notice thereof to Seller on or
before the later of (the "W&G Deadline Date") (i) the 42nd day after the Net
Asset Certificate was given to W&G and (ii) the fifth Business Day after the
financial statements, opinion, certificate and report required to be delivered
to W&G pursuant to Section 3.2(a) have been so delivered, which notice shall
set forth the basis for such dispute in reasonable detail. The parties shall
use all reasonable efforts to resolve any such dispute, but if any such dispute
cannot be resolved by the parties within 21 days after the date the dispute
notice is given, all unresolved disputes shall be referred to an Arbitrating
Firm for resolution. The parties shall seek to cause the Arbitrating Firm to
make its determination within 21 days after referral of a dispute to it. The
determination of the Arbitrating Firm shall be conclusive and binding on each
party. The fees of the Arbitrating Firm shall be allocated and paid by Seller
or W&G, or divided between them, on a basis determined by the Arbitrating Firm
to be fair taking into account the correctness of the positions asserted by
each of them with respect to the disputed matters resolved by the Arbitrating
Firm.

(c) The Closing Net Asset Value shall be deemed to be finally
determined in the amount set forth in the Net Asset Certificate on the W&G
Deadline Date unless a dispute notice is given in accordance with Section
10.1(b) with respect to the calculation thereof. If such a dispute notice is
given, the Closing Net Asset Value shall be deemed finally determined on the
date that the Arbitrating Firm gives written notice to W&G and Seller of its
determination with respect to all disputes regarding the calculation thereof,
or, if earlier, the date on which Seller and W&G agree in writing on the amount
thereof, in which case the Closing Net Asset Value shall be calculated in
accordance with such determination or agreement, as the case may be.

10.2 Payment Based On Closing Net Asset Value. If the Closing Net
Asset Value, as finally determined, is more than the Target Amount, W&G shall
pay, or shall cause Summers to pay, to Seller an amount in cash equal to such
excess. If the Closing Net Asset Value, as finally determined, is less than
the Target Amount, Seller shall pay to Summers an amount in cash equal to such

<PAGE>
deficiency. In addition, any payment required pursuant to either of the
preceding sentences (the "Adjustment Amount") shall be accompanied by cash
equal to interest on the Adjustment Amount from and including the Closing Date
to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to the Average
LIBO Rate. Payments of cash required pursuant to this Section, if any, shall
be made on the fifth Business Day after the Closing Net Asset Value is finally
determined by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account in the
United States designated by the party entitled to payment to the party required
to make the payment at least two Business Days prior to the date such payment
is due. Any payment pursuant to this Section shall be deemed to be an
adjustment to the purchase price for the Shares.

11. INDEMNIFICATION.

11.1 Indemnification Obligations.

(a) BTR shall indemnify and hold harmless on a Net After-Tax
Basis Buyer, W&G, and their respective directors, officers, employees and
Affiliates against and in respect of any and all losses, damages, liabilities,
costs and expenses (including, without limitation, Legal Expenses)
(collectively, "Losses") arising out of, based upon or resulting from:

(i) the breach of any representation or warranty of

statement or certification of Summers, Seller or BTR furnished
pursuant hereto (but only, in the case of Summers, in respect of any
representation or warranty made by it at or prior to the Closing),

(ii) the breach by Summers, Seller or BTR of or
failure of any of them to observe any of their respective covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement (but only, in the case of
Summers, in respect of covenants and agreements required to be
performed by it at or prior to the Closing),

(iii) any liability or obligation of or attributable to
Seller, BTR or any of their respective Affiliates (other than
Summers) (including, without limitation, (A) any liability or
obligation arising under or in connection with an employee benefit
plan, policy or arrangement maintained or contributed to by Seller or
any entity treated as a single employer with Seller under Section
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code and (B) any liability

<PAGE>
arising in connection with the provision by Summers of group health
continuation coverage to the persons listed in Schedule 4.8(k)
hereto (and their dependents)),

(iv) any defects in goods sold, services rendered or
other action taken by Summers prior to the Closing,

(v) any Environmental Condition,

(vi) any Contract Default, and

(vii) the claims made in the litigation referred to in
Schedule 4.6 hereto under the caption Crawford Electric Supply Co. vs
Summers Group, Inc. and Summers Electric Company,

(regardless of whether, in the case of third party actions, suits or
proceedings with respect to any of the foregoing, Summers, Seller or BTR may
have a meritorious defense). Notwithstanding the foregoing, BTR shall not be
obligated to provide such indemnification referred to in this Section 11.1(a)
(i) with respect to any claim if all Losses arising out of, based upon or
resulting from such claim do not exceed $10,000 in the aggregate (a "Small
Claim") unless and until the cumulative aggregate amount of all Losses paid or
suffered by Buyer and such other Persons described above as to which Buyer and
such other Persons would otherwise be indemnified hereunder with respect to all
Small Claims exceeds $300,000 (the "Small Claim Limitation"), in which case BTR
shall then be held liable hereunder for all such Losses attributable to Small
Claims in excess of the initial $300,000 (subject to clause (ii) of this
sentence), (ii) unless and until the cumulative aggregate amount of all Losses
paid or suffered by Buyer and such other Persons described above as to which
Buyer and such other Persons would otherwise be indemnified hereunder
(excluding any amount not indemnifiable pursuant to the Small Claim Limitation)
exceeds $1,500,000 (the "Basket Limitation"), in which case BTR shall then be
held liable hereunder for all such Losses, excluding $500,000 of such initial
$1,500,000, and (iii) in no event shall BTR be obligated to provide such
indemnification for more than an amount in the aggregate equal to $85 million
(the "Cap Limitation"); provided that BTR shall provide such indemnification on
a dollar-for-dollar basis (x) without regard to the Small Claim Limitation or
the Basket Limitation for Losses arising out of, based upon or resulting from
(A) the matters referred to in clause (iii) of the first sentence of Section
11.1(a), the breach or failure to observe by Summers, Seller or BTR of any
provision of Section 6.6, 6.16, 10.2, or 12.1 or Article 11 or the breach of

<PAGE>
any representation or warranty set forth in Section 4.7 (collectively the "Full
Indemnity Matters") or (B) the matters referred to in clauses (vi) and (vii) of
the first sentence of Section 11.1(a) or any breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in Section 4.14(b) or the first sentence of Section 4.4(a)
(as it relates to Real Property) (collectively, and together with the Full
Indemnity Matters, the "First Dollar Matters") and (y) without regard to the
Cap Limitation for Losses arising out of, based upon or resulting from the Full
Indemnity Matters. In addition, BTR's obligation to provide indemnification
with respect to Losses arising out of, based upon or resulting from any
Environmental Condition (i) shall exclude Losses to the extent arising out of,
based upon or resulting from the negligence or misconduct of W&G or any of its
Affiliates or any of their respective employees, agents or representatives
occurring after the Closing and (ii) shall be limited to 50% of costs and
expenses of any Remedial Action initiated by Summers after the Closing with
respect to an Environmental Condition that was not (at the time of such
initiation) the subject of any notice or complaint from any Person other than
an employee, agent or representative of W&G or any of its Affiliates ("W&G
Remedial Action"). If the Closing shall have occurred, BTR shall not be
entitled to any contribution or reimbursement from Summers with respect to
payments made by BTR pursuant to this Section. W&G shall be deemed to have
suffered directly any Losses suffered by Summers.

(b) W&G shall indemnify and hold harmless on a Net After-Tax
Basis Seller and BTR, and their respective directors, officers, employees and
Affiliates against and in respect of any and all Losses arising out of, based
upon or resulting from (i) the breach of any representation or warranty of
Buyer or W&G contained in this Agreement or in any statement or certification
of Buyer or W&G furnished pursuant hereto and (ii) the breach by Buyer or W&G
of or failure of either of them to observe any of their respective covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement (regardless of whether, in the case of
third party actions, suits or proceedings, Buyer or W&G may have a meritorious
defense). Notwithstanding the foregoing, W&G shall not be obligated to provide
such indemnification referred to in this Section 11.1(b) (i) with respect to
any Small Claim unless and until the cumulative aggregate amount of all Losses
paid or suffered by Seller, BTR and such other Persons described above as to
which Seller, BTR and such other Persons would be indemnified hereunder with
respect to all Small Claims exceeds $300,000, in which case W&G shall then be
held liable hereunder for all such Losses attributable to Small Claims in
excess of the initial $300,000 (subject to clause (ii) of this sentence), (ii)
unless and until the cumulative amount of all Losses paid or suffered by

<PAGE>
Seller, BTR and such other Persons described above as to which Seller, BTR and
such other Persons would otherwise be indemnified hereunder (excluding any
amount not indemnifiable pursuant to clause (i) of this sentence) exceeds
$1,500,000, in which case W&G shall then be held liable hereunder for all such
Losses, excluding $500,000 of such initial $1,500,000 and (iii) in no event
shall W&G be obligated to provide such indemnification referred to in the
preceding sentence for more than an amount in the aggregate equal to $85
million; provided that the limitations in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) of this
sentence shall not apply to the breach or failure to observe by Buyer or W&G of
any provision of Section 3.1, 3.2(e), 3.2(f), 10.2 or 12.1 or Article 11.

11.2 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) Promptly after receipt by any person entitled to
indemnification under Section 11.1 (an "indemnified party") of notice of the
commencement of any action, suit or proceeding by a person not a party to this
Agreement in respect of which the indemnified party will seek indemnification
hereunder (a "Third Party Action"), the indemnified party shall notify the
person that is obligated to provide such indemnification (an "indemnifying
party") thereof in writing, but any failure to so notify the indemnifying party
shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to the indemnified
party under Section 11.1, except to the extent that the indemnifying party is
prejudiced by the failure to give such notice. The indemnifying party shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of such Third Party Action and to assume
control of such defense with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
indemnified party; provided, however, that:

(i) the indemnified party shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such Third Party Action and to employ
counsel at its own expense to assist in the handling of such Third
Party Action;

(ii) the indemnifying party shall obtain the prior
written approval of the indemnified party before entering into any
settlement of such Third Party Action or ceasing to defend against
such Third Party Action, if pursuant to or as a result of such
settlement or cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief would
be imposed against the indemnified party or the indemnified party
would be adversely affected thereby;

(iii) no indemnifying party shall consent to the entry
of any judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as

<PAGE>
an unconditional term thereof the giving by each claimant or
plaintiff to each indemnified party of a release from all liability
in respect of such Third Party Action; and

(iv) the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to
control the defense of any Third Party Action unless within 21 days
after receipt of such written notice from the indemnified party the
indemnifying party confirms in writing its responsibility to
indemnify the indemnified party with respect to such Third Party
Action and reasonably demonstrates that it will be able to pay the
full amount of the reasonably expected Losses in connection with any
such Third Party Action.

After written notice by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its
election to assume control of the defense of any such Third Party Action in
accordance with the foregoing and compliance by the indemnifying party with
Section 11.2(a)(iv), (i) the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such
indemnified party hereunder for any Legal Expenses subsequently incurred by
such indemnified party attributable to defending against such Third Party
Action, and (ii) as long as the indemnifying party is reasonably contesting
such Third Party Action in good faith, the indemnified party shall not admit
any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge the claim
underlying, such Third Party Action without the indemnifying party's prior
written consent. If the indemnifying party does not assume control of the
defense of such Third Party Action in accordance with this Section 11.2, the
indemnified party shall have the right to defend and/or settle such Third Party
Action in such manner as it may deem appropriate at the cost and expense of the
indemnifying party, and the indemnifying party will promptly reimburse the
indemnified party therefor in accordance with this Article 11. The
reimbursement of fees, costs and expenses required by this Article 11 shall be
made by periodic payments during the course of the investigation or defense, as
and when bills are received or expenses incurred.

(b) If the indemnifying party shall be obligated to indemnify
the indemnified party pursuant to this Article 11, the indemnifying party
shall, upon payment of such indemnity in full, be subrogated to all rights of
the indemnified party with respect to the claims to which such indemnification
relates.

(c) If an indemnified party becomes entitled to any
indemnification from an indemnifying party, such indemnification shall be made
in cash upon demand, provided that BTR may elect, by written notice given to

<PAGE>
W&G within ten Business Days after demand for such payment, to satisfy such
indemnification obligations of BTR by reducing the unpaid Principal Amount at
Maturity of an outstanding Purchase Price Note in accordance with the terms of
such Note. In addition, if BTR shall fail to make any payment when due
pursuant to this Article 11 (i) with respect to any First Dollar Matters, W&G
may elect, at its option, to reduce the Principal Amount at Maturity of an
outstanding Purchase Price Note in accordance with the terms of such Note or
(ii) with respect to any matter other than a First Dollar Matter, W&G may elect
to reduce the Principal Amount at Maturity of either the Purchase Price Note
issued pursuant to Section 3.2(e) or the Purchase Price Note issued pursuant to
Section 3.2(f), which Purchase Price Note so elected shall be the only Purchase
Price Note available for reduction pursuant to this clause (ii). The right of
W&G to make a reduction pursuant to the preceding sentence is subject to the
express condition precedent that W&G shall give to BTR written notice 28 days
in advance of the effective date of any proposed reduction to be made by W&G
pursuant to the preceding sentence and no such reduction shall be made if BTR
fully remedies the subject matter of the indemnification claim prior to such
effective date, and if W&G effects any such reduction that is determined by
final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction to be not
authorized by the terms of this Agreement (in respect of the underlying claim
to indemnification hereunder, the failure by W&G to give BTR notice as provided
in this sentence or the remedial action taken by BTR), W&G shall immediately
pay to BTR the amount of such unauthorized reduction plus interest thereon from
and including the effective date of such reduction to but excluding the date of
such payment at a rate per annum equal to the Average LIBO Rate multiplied by
2, but excluding any other amounts of interest with respect thereto payable
pursuant to the Purchase Price Note that was so reduced. Any reduction of a
Purchase Price Note pursuant to this Section (except a reduction by W&G with
respect to any matter other than a First Dollar Matter) shall be applied to the
Purchase Price Note with the earliest original issue date then outstanding
before applied to any subsequently issued Purchase Price Note.

(d) Any payment made by an indemnifying party to an indemnified
party pursuant to this Article 11 shall be deemed an adjustment to the purchase
price for the Shares. The right of indemnification pursuant to this Article 11
shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of each of the parties to this
Agreement for a breach of any representation or warranty by another party
contained in this Agreement or in any statement or certification furnished
pursuant to this Agreement.

12. MISCELLANEOUS.

12.1 Brokerage. In the event any person shall assert a claim to a
fee, commission or other compensation on account of alleged employment as a
broker or finder, or performance of services as a broker or finder, in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the party (or
parties) alleged to have been responsible for such employment or performance of
services shall hold harmless the other party (or parties) as well as the other
party's (or parties') directors, officers and employees, from and against such
claim and at the indemnifying party's (or parties') sole expense defend any and
all actions, suits or proceedings involving such claim that may at any time be
brought against those so indemnified and satisfy promptly any settlement or
judgment arising therefrom. If, however, it is ultimately determined in any
such action, suit or proceeding in which the indemnified party (or parties)
were afforded the opportunity to have their counsel participate in the defense,
that the employment was by or services were performed for the indemnified party
(or parties), then the latter shall be responsible under this Section and shall
reimburse any amounts theretofore paid by the indemnifying party (or parties)
by reason hereof. BTR acknowledges its sole and exclusive responsibility for
all fees, commissions and other compensation payable to Jo Hambro Magan & Co.
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

12.2 Survival. All covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement and the right to indemnification with respect to all representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any certificate, document or
statement delivered pursuant hereto, shall survive (and not be affected in any
respect by) the Closing, any investigation conducted by any party hereto and
any information which any party may receive. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the right to indemnification with respect to each representation and warranty
contained in this Agreement or made pursuant to any certificate, document or
statement delivered pursuant hereto shall terminate on the last day of the
fifteenth month following the month in which the Closing occurs (the "Cut-Off
Date"); provided, however, that (i) the right to indemnification with respect
to the representations and warranties set forth in (x) Sections 4.7 and 4.8
shall survive until 30 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations relating to the matters set forth in such sections, (y) Section
4.10 and the first sentence of Section 4.4(a) (as it relates to Real Property)
shall survive until the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date and (z) Section
4.14(b) shall survive without limitation and (ii) the right to indemnification

<PAGE>
with respect to such representations and warranties, and the liability of any
party with respect thereto, shall not terminate with respect to any claim,
whether or not fixed as to liability or liquidated as to amount, with respect
to which such party has been given written notice prior to the Cut-Off Date,
such fourth anniversary or such 30th day after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations, whichever shall be applicable thereto in accordance
with this Section.

12.3 Notices. Any notice, direction or other advice or communication
required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be
given by certified mail, next day delivery service such as Federal Express, or
personal delivery against receipt to the party to whom it is to be given (i) at
such party's address set forth in the preamble to this Agreement, or (ii) to
such other address as the party shall have furnished in writing in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 12.3. Any notice or other communication
shall be deemed to have been given as of the date so delivered, on the next
business day when sent by overnight delivery service or five days after the
date so mailed. Any notice or other communication given hereunder to Buyer or
Summers after the Closing shall be made to Buyer or Summers in care of W&G at
W&G's address for notices.

12.4 Affiliate Obligations. Each obligation of Buyer and Summers (to
the extent required to be performed by this Agreement after the Closing)
hereunder shall be deemed to include an obligation of W&G to cause Buyer or
Summers, as the case may be, to perform such obligation. Each obligation of
Summers (to the extent required to be performed at or prior to the Closing) and
Seller hereunder shall be deemed to include an obligation of BTR to cause
Summers or Seller, as the case may be, to perform such obligation.

12.5 Termination. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby may be terminated and abandoned at any time prior to the Closing (i) by
mutual written agreement of the parties hereto, (ii) by W&G or BTR upon written
notice to the other party if the Closing shall not have taken place by March
31, 1994, other than by reason of a matter within the control of the party
asserting such termination. Except for any breach of this Agreement occurring
at or prior to termination and for the obligations contained in Sections 6.8,
6.18(a) and 12.1, upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
Section, this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and none of the
parties hereto or any of their respective officers, directors, employees,

<PAGE>
agents, consultants, stockholders or principals shall have any liability or
obligation hereunder or with respect hereto.

12.6 Consent to Jurisdiction. Each party hereto, hereby consents to,
and confers nonexclusive jurisdiction upon, the courts of the State of New York
and the Federal courts of the United States of America located in the City of
New York, Borough of Manhattan, and appropriate appellate courts therefrom,
over any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement. Each party hereto hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, as a
defense in any such action, suit or proceeding that it is not subject to such
jurisdiction or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is
not maintainable in said courts or that this Agreement may not be enforced in
or by said courts or that its property is exempt or immune from execution, that
the suit, action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, or that the
venue of the suit, action or proceeding is improper. Service of process in any
such action, suit or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the
world, whether within or without the State of New York, provided that notice
thereof is provided pursuant to provisions for notice under this Agreement.

12.7 Binding Effect; Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns and the provisions of
Article 11 shall inure to the benefit of the indemnified parties referred to
therein; provided, however, that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any of the parties hereto
without the prior written consent of the other parties and any such purported
assignment shall be void. This Agreement is not intended to confer upon any
other person any rights or remedies hereunder.

12.8 Specific Performance. The parties to this Agreement recognize
that any breach of the terms of this Agreement by any party may give rise to
irreparable harm for which money damages would not be an adequate remedy, and
accordingly agree that, in addition to other remedies, each party shall be
entitled to enforce the terms of this Agreement by a decree of specific
performance without the necessity of proving the inadequacy as a remedy of
money damages.

12.9 Entire Agreement; Modifications; Headings; Counterparts. This
Agreement and the Exhibits and Schedules attached hereto, and the other

Understanding, dated October 28, 1993, between W&G and BTR plc.). This
Agreement may be modified only by a written instrument duly executed by or on
behalf of each party. No breach of any covenant, agreement, warranty or
representation shall be deemed waived unless expressly waived in writing by and
on behalf of the party who might assert such breach. The Article and Section
headings of this Agreement and the Table of Contents to this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and do not form a part hereof and do not in any
way modify, interpret or construe the intentions of the parties. This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, and all such
counterparts shall constitute one and the same instrument.

12.10 Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.
