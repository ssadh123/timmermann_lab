(i) each share (a "Share" and, collectively, the
"Shares") of SFP common stock, par value $1.00 per share
(the "SFP Common Stock"), outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, except as otherwise provided in
Section 1.2(a)(ii) below, be converted into 0.27 shares of
the common stock, no par value (the "BNI Common Stock"), of
BNI (0.27 being defined herein as the "Exchange Ratio"); and

(ii) each Share held by SFP as treasury stock or owned
by BNI or any Subsidiary (as defined in Section 1.2(c)) of
BNI immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

(b) The BNI Common Stock (accompanied by rights issued
pursuant to the BNI Rights Agreement (as defined in Section
4.20)) to be received as consideration pursuant to the Merger by
each holder of Shares is referred to herein as the "Merger
Consideration".

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the word
"Subsidiary" when used with respect to any Person means any
corporation or other organization, whether incorporated or
unincorporated, of which (i) at least a majority of the
securities or other interests having by their terms ordinary
voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or 

-2-

<PAGE>
others performing similar functions with respect to such
corporation or other organization is directly or indirectly owned
or controlled by such Person or by any one or more of its
Subsidiaries or (ii) such Person or any other Subsidiary of such
Person is a general partner, it being understood that
representations and warranties of a Person concerning any former
Subsidiary of such Person shall be deemed to relate only to the
periods during which such former Subsidiary was a Subsidiary of
such Person. 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the word "Person"
means an individual, a corporation, a partnership, an
association, a trust or any other entity or organization,
including a government or political subdivision or any agency or
instrumentality thereof, or any affiliate (as that term is
defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange Act")) of any
of the foregoing.

SECTION 1.3. Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the
Effective Time, BNI shall appoint an agent reasonably
satisfactory to SFP (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of
exchanging certificates representing Shares as provided in
Section 1.2(a)(i). At the Effective Time, BNI will deposit with
the Exchange Agent certificates representing the aggregate Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares. Promptly
after the Effective Time, BNI will send, or will cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of Shares at the Effective
Time a letter of transmittal for use in such exchange (which
shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
certificates representing Shares to the Exchange Agent).

(b) Each holder of Shares that have been converted
into a right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon surrender
to the Exchange Agent of a certificate or certificates
representing such Shares, together with a properly completed
letter of transmittal covering such Shares, will be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such
Shares. Until so surrendered, each such certificate shall, after
the Effective Time, represent for all purposes only the right to
receive such Merger Consideration.

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to
be paid to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Shares represented by the certificate or certificates surrendered
in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment
that the certificate or certificates so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and
that the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange
Agent any transfer or other taxes required as a result of such

-3-

<PAGE>
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Shares or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Shares. If, after the
Effective Time, certificates representing Shares are presented to
the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Article I.

(e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited
with the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 1.3(a), and any
portion of the Common Shares Trust (as defined in Section 1.7)
that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares twelve months
after the Effective Time shall be returned to BNI, upon demand,
and any such holder who has not exchanged his Shares for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article I prior to
that time shall thereafter look only to BNI for his claim for BNI
Common Stock, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of BNI Common
Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect to BNI
Common Stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, BNI shall not be
liable to any holder of Shares for any amount paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property laws.

(f) No dividends or other distributions with respect
to the BNI Common Stock constituting part of the Merger
Consideration shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
certificates representing Shares until such certificates are
surrendered as provided in this Section 1.3. Upon such
surrender, there shall be paid, without interest, to the person
in whose name the certificates representing the BNI Common Stock
into which such Shares were converted are registered, (1) all
dividends and other distributions in respect of BNI Common Stock
that are payable on a date subsequent to, and the record date for
which occurs after, the Effective Time and (2) all dividends or
other distributions in respect of Shares that are payable on a
date subsequent to, and the record date for which occurs before,
the Effective Time.

SECTION 1.4. Stock Options. (a) At the Effective
Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of SFP Common
Stock (a "SFP Stock Option") granted under any employee stock
option or compensation plan or arrangement of SFP shall be
canceled and substituted with an option (a "BNI Option") to
acquire BNI Common Stock. Such cancellation and substitution
shall comply in all respects with, and shall be performed in
accordance with, the methodology prescribed by the provisions of
Section 424(a) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, and
each BNI Option shall provide the option holder with rights and

-4-

<PAGE>
benefits that are no less favorable to him than were provided
under the SFP Stock Option for which it was substituted.

(b) At or as soon as practicable after the Effective
Time, BNI shall issue to each holder of an SFP Stock Option which
is cancelled pursuant to Section 1.4(a) an agreement that
accurately reflects the terms of the BNI Option substituted
therefor as contemplated by Section 1.4(a).

(c) BNI shall take all corporate actions necessary to
reserve for issuance such number of shares of BNI Common Stock as
will be necessary to satisfy exercises in full of all BNI Options
after the Effective Time. With respect to such BNI Common Stock,
BNI shall (i) as soon as practicable after the Effective Time
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") a
Registration Statement on Form S-8 and use its reasonable best
efforts to have such registration statement become and remain
continuously effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "1933 Act") and (ii) file with the New York Stock
Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE") a listing application and use its
reasonable best efforts to have such shares admitted to trading
thereon upon exercises of BNI Options. BNI shall also use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that all incentive stock
options within the meaning of the Code continue to qualify as
such at all times after the Effective Time.

SECTION 1.5. Adjustments. If, prior to the Effective
Time, BNI or SFP (as the case may be) should split or combine the
BNI Common Stock or the SFP Common Stock, or pay a stock dividend
or other stock distribution in BNI Common Stock or SFP Common
Stock, or otherwise change the BNI Common Stock or SFP Common
Stock into any other securities, or make any other dividend or
distribution in respect of the BNI Common Stock or the SFP Common
Stock (other than the Spinoff, stock options permitted or
contemplated by this Agreement, and normal dividends as the same
may be adjusted from time to time in accordance with this
Agreement), then the Exchange Ratio will be appropriately
adjusted to reflect such split, combination, dividend or other
distribution or change.

SECTION 1.6. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") shall take place (i) at the offices of Davis Polk &
Wardwell, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York, at 10:00 A.M.
on the second business day after all the conditions set forth in
Article IX (other than those that are waived by the party or
parties for whose benefit such conditions exist) are satisfied or
(ii) at such other place and/or time and/or on such other date as
the parties may agree. The date upon which the Closing shall
occur is herein called the "Closing Date".

<PAGE>
SECTION 1.7. Fractional Shares. No certificates or
scrip representing fractional shares of BNI Common Stock will be
issued in the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of Shares
otherwise entitled to a fractional share of BNI Common Stock will
be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 1.7, a cash payment in lieu
of such fractional shares of BNI Common Stock representing such
holder's proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the sale
by the Exchange Agent in one or more transactions (which sale
transactions shall be made at such times, in such manner and on
such terms as the Exchange Agent shall determine in its
reasonable discretion) on behalf of all such holders of the
aggregate of the fractional shares of BNI Common Stock which
would otherwise have been issued (the "Excess Shares"). The sale
of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on
the NYSE through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall
be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. Until the
net proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the
holders of Shares, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in
trust (the "Common Shares Trust") for the holders of the Shares. 
BNI shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-
pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and compensation
of the Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with this sale of
the Excess Shares. The Exchange Agent shall determine the
portion of the Common Shares Trust to which each holder of Shares
shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the
aggregate net proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a
fraction the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional
BNI Common Stock Interest to which such holder of Shares is
entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of
fractional share interests to which all holders of Shares are
entitled. As soon as practicable after the determination of the
amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Shares in lieu
of any fractional shares of BNI Common Stock, the Exchange Agent
shall make available such amounts to such holders of Shares
without interest.

corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and has all
corporate powers and all material governmental licenses,
authorizations, consents and approvals required to carry on its
business as now conducted. SFP is duly qualified to do business
as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction where the character of the property owned or leased
by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification
necessary, except for those jurisdictions where the failure to be
so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a

BNI true and complete copies of SFP's certificate of
incorporation and bylaws as currently in effect. For purposes of
this Agreement, a "Material Adverse Effect" means, with respect
to any Person, a material adverse effect, whether existing or
prospective, on the financial condition, business or properties

ability of such Person to perform its obligations hereunder. For
purposes of this Agreement, any reference to any event, change or
effect being "material" with respect to any Person means an
event, change or effect, whether existing or prospective, which
is material in relation to the financial condition, business or
properties of such Person and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole

majority of the outstanding shares of SFP Common Stock entitled

asset.

adequate under generally accepted accounting principles to cover
the tax liabilities accruing through the date thereof; and (v) as
of the date of this Agreement, there is no action, suit,
proceeding, investigation, audit or claim now proposed or pending
against or with respect to SFP or any of its Subsidiaries in
respect of any tax where there is a reasonable possibility of a
determination or decision against SFP or any of its Subsidiaries
which would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on SFP.

SECTION 3.15. ERISA. (a) Schedule III identifies (i)
each "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") (other
than multiemployer plans (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA)),
and (ii) each employment, severance or other similar contract,
arrangement or policy and each retirement or deferred
compensation plan, stock plan, incentive compensation plan,
vacation pay, severance pay, bonus or benefit arrangement,
insurance (including self-insured arrangements) or
hospitalization program, workers' compensation program,
disability program, supplemental unemployment program or fringe
benefit arrangement, whether maintained pursuant to contract or
informal understanding, which does not constitute an "employee
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), which, in 
the case of items described in both clauses (i) and (ii), is
maintained, administered or contributed to by SFP or any of its
ERISA Affiliates (as defined below), and covers any employee or
former employee of SFP or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect
to which SFP or any of its ERISA Affiliates has any liability
(collectively, the "SFP Employee Plans"). True and correct
copies of each of the SFP Employee Plans, all amendments thereto,

-14-

<PAGE>
any written interpretations thereof distributed to employees, and
all contracts relating thereto or the funding thereof, including,
without limitation, all trust agreements, insurance contracts,
administration contracts, investment management agreements,
subscription and participation agreements, recordkeeping
agreements and summary plan descriptions, all as currently in
effect, have been furnished or made available to BNI. SFP has
supplied or made available to BNI an accurate description of any
SFP Employee Plan that is not in written form. To the extent
applicable, true and correct copies of the three most recent
annual reports (Form 5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B
thereto) prepared in connection with any SFP Employee Plan and
the most recent actuarial valuation report prepared in connection
with any such plan have been furnished or made available to BNI. 
For purposes of this Agreement, "ERISA Affiliate" of any Person
means any other Person which, together with such Person, would be
treated as a single employer under Section 414 of the Code. SFP
has made available to BNI with complete age, salary, service and
related data as of the most recent practical date for employees
and former employees of SFP and any of its Subsidiaries covered
under the SFP Employee Plans.

(b) The only SFP Employee Plans that are subject to
Title IV of ERISA (the "SFP Pension Plans") are identified in the
list of such plans provided or made available to BNI by SFP in
accordance with Section 3.15(a). As of the most recent valuation
date of each SFP Pension Plan, the present value of all benefits
accrued under each SFP Pension Plan determined on a termination
basis using the assumptions established by the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") as in effect on such date was
exceeded by the fair market value of the assets of such SFP
Pension Plan (excluding for these purposes any accrued but unpaid
contributions). No "accumulated funding deficiency", as defined
in Section 412 of the Code, has been incurred with respect to any
SFP Pension Plan, whether or not waived. SFP knows of no
"reportable event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA
and the regulations promulgated thereunder, and no event
described in Section 4041 (other than a standard termination),
4042, 4062 or 4063 of ERISA has occurred in connection with any
SFP Pension Plan, other than a "reportable event" that will not
have a Material Adverse Effect on SFP. No condition exists and
no event has occurred that could constitute grounds for
termination of or the appointment of a trustee to administer any
SFP Pension Plan under Section 4042 of ERISA and, to SFP's
knowledge, neither SFP nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has
engaged in, or is a successor or parent corporation to an entity
that has engaged in, a transaction for which SFP or any of its
ERISA Affiliates would have liability under Section 4069 or
4212(c) of ERISA. To SFP's knowledge, nothing done or omitted to
be done and no transaction or holding of any asset under or in
connection with any SFP Employee Plan has or will make SFP or any

-15-

<PAGE>
of its ERISA Affiliates or any officer or director of SFP or any
of its ERISA Affiliates subject to any liability under Title I or
Section 4071 of ERISA or liable for any tax pursuant to Section
4975 or Chapters 43, 47, or 68 of the Code that could have a
Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Each SFP Employee Plan which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and
has been so qualified during the period from its adoption to
date, and each trust forming a part thereof is exempt from tax
pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Code. SFP has furnished or
made available to BNI copies of the most recent Internal Revenue
Service determination letters with respect to each such SFP
Employee Plan. Each SFP Employee Plan has been maintained in
substantial compliance with its terms and with the requirements
prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and
regulations, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code,
which are applicable to such SFP Employee Plan.

(d) None of the payments contemplated by the
contracts, plans or arrangements covering any employee or former
employee of SFP or any of its ERISA Affiliates and arising solely
as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby would, in the
aggregate, constitute excess parachute payments as defined in
Section 280G of the Code (without regard to subsection (b)(4)
thereof).

(e) Except for obligations arising pursuant to any
collective bargaining agreements, no condition exists that would
prevent SFP or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or
terminating any SFP Employee Plan providing health or medical
benefits in respect of any active or former employees of SFP and
its Subsidiaries.

(f) There has been no amendment to, written
interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) by SFP or
any of its ERISA Affiliates relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, any SFP Employee Plan which
would increase materially the expense of maintaining such SFP
Employee Plan above the level of the expense incurred in respect
thereof for the fiscal year ended on the Balance Sheet Date.

(g) To the extent applicable, each SFP Employee Plan
which constitutes a "group health plan" (as defined in Section
607(1) of ERISA or Section 4980B(g)(2) of the Code), including
any plans of current or former affiliates which must be taken
into account under Sections 4980B and 414(t) of the Code or
Section 601 of ERISA, has been operated in substantial compliance
with applicable law, including the group health plan continuation
coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and Section
601 of ERISA.

-16-

<PAGE>
(h) There are no actions, suits or claims (other than
routine claims for benefits) pending or, to SFP's knowledge,
threatened involving any SFP Employee Plan or the assets thereof
and no facts exist with could give rise to any such actions,
suits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits).

(i) SFP has provided or will promptly provide BNI with
a list of each employee pension benefit plan (as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA) which is a multiemployer plan with respect
to which SFP or any of its ERISA Affiliates may have any
liability (including any liability attributable to a current or
former member of SFP's or any of its ERISA Affiliates'
"controlled group" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA))
and the maximum amount of such liability (determined as if a
complete withdrawal occurred with respect to each such plan
immediately after the Effective Time). With respect to each such
plan, (i) all contributions have been made as required by the
terms of the plans, the terms of any collective bargaining
agreements and applicable law, (ii) neither SFP nor any of its
ERISA Affiliates has withdrawn, partially withdrawn or received
any notice of any claim or demand for withdrawal liability or
partial withdrawal liability that would have a Material Adverse
Effect, and (iii) neither SFP nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has
received any notice that any such plan is in reorganization, that
increased contributions may be required to avoid a reduction in
plan benefits or the imposition of any excise tax, that any such
plan is or has been funded at a rate less than that required
under Section 412 of the Code or that any plan is or may become
insolvent.

(j) As of the Balance Sheet Date, the Expected
Postretirement Benefit Obligation (as defined in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106) in respect of
postretirement health and medical benefits for current and former
employees of SFP or any of its Subsidiaries calculated by SFP's
actuary using reasonable actuarial assumptions was $291,200,000. 

SECTION 3.16. Finders' Fees. Except for Goldman,
Sachs & Co., a copy of whose engagement agreement has been or
will be provided to BNI, there is no investment banker, broker,
finder or other intermediary which has been retained by or is
authorized to act on behalf of SFP or any of its Subsidiaries who
might be entitled to any fee or commission from BNI or any of its
affiliates upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

SECTION 3.17. Environmental Matters. (a) Except as
set forth in the SFP Form 10-K or otherwise previously disclosed
in writing by SFP to BNI, there are no Environmental Liabilities
(as defined below) of SFP that, individually or in the aggregate,

-17-

<PAGE>
have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on SFP.

(b) As used in this Agreement, "Environmental Laws"
means any and all federal, state, local and foreign statutes,
laws, judicial decisions, regulations, ordinances, rules,
judgments, orders, decrees, codes, plans, injunctions, permits,
concessions, grants, franchises, licenses, agreements and
governmental restrictions, whether now or hereafter in effect,
relating to human health, the environment or to emissions,
discharges or releases of pollutants, contaminants, Hazardous
Substances or wastes into the environment, including without
limitation ambient air, surface water, ground water or land, or
otherwise relating to the manufacture, processing, distribution,
use, treatment, storage, disposal, transport or handling of
pollutants, contaminants, Hazardous Substances or wastes or the
clean-up or other remediation thereof. "Environmental
Liabilities" with respect to any Person means any and all
liabilities of or relating to such Person or any of its
Subsidiaries (including any entity which is, in whole or in part,
a predecessor of such Person or any of its Subsidiaries), whether
vested or unvested, contingent or fixed, actual or potential,
known or unknown, which (i) arise under or relate to matters
covered by Environmental Laws and (ii) relate to actions
occurring or conditions existing on or prior to the Closing Date. 
"Hazardous Substances" means any toxic, radioactive, caustic or
otherwise hazardous substance, including petroleum, its
derivatives, by-products and other hydrocarbons, or any substance
having any constituent elements displaying any of the foregoing
characteristics, including, without limitation, any substance
regulated under Environmental Laws.

SECTION 3.18. Takeover Statutes. No "fair price",
"moratorium", "control share acquisition" or other similar
antitakeover statute or regulation enacted under state or federal
laws in the United States (each a "Takeover Statute"), including,
without limitation, Section 203 of the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), applicable to SFP or any of its
Subsidiaries is applicable to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 3.19. Compliance With Laws. Except as
publicly disclosed, and except for any matter that would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on SFP,
neither SFP nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of, or
has violated, any applicable provisions of any laws, statutes,
ordinances or regulations.

of SFP has declared the Spinoff Dividend, and the Liquidation of

from the Internal Revenue Service a valid and effective private
letter ruling dated February 16, 1994 (and supplemented on May
18, 1994) (the "Private Letter Ruling") to the effect that
(i) the Spinoff qualifies as a tax-free distribution under
Section 355 of the Code and (ii) the merger of SFP Properties,
Inc. ("Properties") with and into SFP (the "Liquidation") will be
treated as a distribution by Properties to SFP in complete
liquidation of Properties within the meaning of Section 322 of
the Code. A copy of the Private Letter Ruling has been provided
to BNI.

SECTION 3.22. Excess Loss Accounts. The income that
will be recognized, for federal income tax purposes, upon the

the character of the property owned or leased by it or the nature

of, or other ownership interests in, each BNI Subsidiary, is

(b) As of its filing date, each such report or

of BNI and at the time such stockholders vote on adoption of this
Agreement, the BNI Proxy Statement, as supplemented or amended,
if applicable, will not contain any untrue statement of a

circumstances which could reasonably be expected to result in
such a liability; provided, however, that this representation

result of, any such liability that primarily results from a
Customary Action (as defined in Section 5.1 below).

SECTION 4.13. Litigation. Except as set forth in the
BNI Form 10-K or the BNI Form 10-Q, (i) there is no action, suit,

SECTION 4.15. ERISA. (a) Schedule IV identifies (i)
each "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA
(other than multiemployer plans (as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA)), and (ii) each employment, severance or other similar
contract, arrangement or policy and each retirement or deferred
compensation plan, stock plan, incentive compensation plan,
vacation pay, severance pay, bonus or benefit arrangement,
insurance (including self-insured arrangements) or
hospitalization program, workers' compensation program,
disability program, supplemental unemployment program or fringe
benefit arrangement, whether maintained pursuant to contract or
informal understanding, which does not constitute an "employee
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), which, in
the case, of items described in both clauses (i) and (ii) is
maintained, administered or contributed to by BNI or any of its
ERISA Affiliates and covers any employee or former employee of
BNI or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to which BNI or
any of its ERISA Affiliates has any liability (collectively, the
"BNI Employee Plans"). True and correct copies of each of the
BNI Employee Plans, all amendments thereto, any written
interpretations thereof distributed to employees, and all
contracts relating thereto or the funding thereof, including,
without limitation, all trust agreements, insurance contracts,
administration contracts, investment management agreements,
subscription and participation agreements, recordkeeping
agreements and summary plan descriptions, all as currently in
effect, have been furnished or made available to SFP. BNI has
supplied or made available to SFP an accurate description of any
BNI Employee Plan that is not in written form. To the extent
applicable, true and correct copies of the three most recent
annual reports (Form 5500 including, if applicable, Schedule B
thereto) prepared in connection with any BNI Employee Plan and
the most recent actuarial valuation report prepared in connection
with any such plan have been furnished or made available to SFP. 
BNI has made available to SFP complete age, salary, service and
related data as of the most recent practical date for employees
and former employees of BNI and any of its Subsidiaries covered
under the BNI Employee Plans.

(b) The only BNI Employee Plans that are subject to
Title IV of ERISA (the "BNI Pension Plans") are identified in the
list of such Plans provided or made available to SFP by BNI in
accordance with Section 4.15(a). As of the most recent valuation
date of each BNI Pension Plan, the present value of all benefits
accrued under each BNI Pension Plan, determined on a termination
basis using the assumptions established by the PBGC as in effect
on such date was exceeded by the fair market value of the assets
of such BNI Pension Plan, (excluding for these purposes any
accrued but unpaid contributions). No "accumulated funding
deficiency", as defined in Section 412 of the Code, has been
incurred with respect to any BNI Pension Plan, whether or not

-26-

<PAGE>
waived. BNI knows of no "reportable event", within the meaning
of Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, and no event described in Sections 4041 (other than a
standard termination), 4042, 4062 or 4063 of ERISA has occurred
in connection with any BNI Pension Plan, other than a "reportable
event" that will not have a Material Adverse Effect on BNI. No
condition exists and no event has occurred that could constitute
grounds for termination of or the appointment of a trustee to
administer any BNI Pension Plan under Section 4042 of ERISA and,
to BNI's knowledge, neither BNI nor any of its ERISA Affiliates
has engaged in, or is a successor parent corporation to an entity
that has engaged in, a transaction for which BNI or any of its
ERISA Affiliates would have liability under Sections 4069 or
4212(c) of ERISA. To BNI's knowledge nothing done or omitted to
be done and no transaction or holding of any asset under or in
connection with any BNI Employee Plan has or will make BNI or any
of its ERISA Affiliates, any officer or director of BNI or any of
its ERISA Affiliates subject to any liability under Title I or
Section 4071 of ERISA or liable for any tax pursuant to Section
4975 or Chapters 43, 47 or 68 of the Code that could have a
Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Each BNI Employee Plan which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and
has been so qualified during the period from its adoption to
date, and each trust forming a part thereof is exempt from tax
pursuant to Section 501(a) of the Code. BNI has furnished or
made available to SFP copies of the most recent Internal Revenue
Service determination letters with respect to each such BNI
Employee Plan. Each BNI Employee Plan has been maintained in
substantial compliance with its terms and with the requirements
prescribed by any and all statutes, orders, rules and
regulations, including but not limited to ERISA and the Code,
which are applicable to such BNI Plan.

(d) None of the payments contemplated by the
contracts, plans or arrangements covering any employee or former
employee of BNI or any of its ERISA Affiliates and arising solely
as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby would, in the
aggregate, constitute excess parachute payments as defined in
Section 280G of the Code (without regard to subsection (b)(4)
thereof).

(e) Except for obligations arising pursuant to any
collective bargaining agreements, no condition exists that would
prevent BNI or any of its Subsidiaries from amending or
terminating any BNI Employee Plan providing health or medical
benefits in respect of any active or former employees of BNI and
its Subsidiaries.

-27-

<PAGE>
(f) There has been no amendment to, written
interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) by BNI or
any of its ERISA Affiliates relating to, or change in employee
participation or coverage under, any BNI Employee Plan which
would increase materially the expense of maintaining such BNI
Employee Plan above the level of the expense incurred in respect
thereof for the fiscal year ended on the Balance Sheet Date.

(g) To the extent applicable, each BNI Employee Plan
which constitutes a "group health plan" (as defined in Section
607(1) of ERISA or Section 4980B(g)(2) of the Code), including
any plans of current or former affiliates which must be taken
into account under Sections 4980B and 414(t) of the Code or
Section 601 of ERISA, has been operated in substantial compliance
with applicable law, including the group health plan continuation
coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and Section
601 of ERISA.

(h) There are no actions, suits or claims (other than
routine claims for benefits) pending or, to BNI's knowledge,
threatened involving any BNI Employee Plan or the assets thereof
and no facts exist with could give rise to any such actions,
suits or claims (other than routine claims for benefits).

(i) BNI has provided or will promptly provide SFP with
a list of each employee pension benefit plan (as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA) which is a multiemployer plan with respect
to which BNI or any of its ERISA Affiliates may have any
liability (including any liability attributable to a current or
former member of BNI's or any of its ERISA Affiliates'
"controlled group" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(14) of ERISA))
and the maximum amount of such liability (determined as if a
complete withdrawal occurred with respect to each such plan
immediately after the Effective Time). With respect to each such
plan, (i) all contributions have been made as required by the
terms of the plans, the terms of any collective bargaining
agreements and applicable law, (ii) neither BNI nor any of its
ERISA Affiliates has withdrawn, partially withdrawn or received
any notice of any claim or demand for withdrawal liability or
partial withdrawal liability that would have a Material Adverse
Effect, and (iii) neither BNI nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has
received any notice that any such plan is in reorganization, that
increased contributions may be required to avoid a reduction in
plan benefits or the imposition of any excise tax, that any such
plan is or has been funded at a rate less than that required
under Section 412 of the Code or that any plan is or may become
insolvent.

(j) As of the Balance Sheet Date, the Expected
Postretirement Benefit Obligation (as defined in Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 106) in respect of

-28-

<PAGE>
postretirement life, health and medical insurance benefits for
current and former employees of BNI or any of its Subsidiaries
calculated by BNI's actuary using reasonable actuarial
assumptions was $17,000,000.

SECTION 4.16. Finders' Fees. Except for Lazard Fr res
& Co., a copy of whose engagement agreement has been or will be
provided to SFP and whose fees will be paid by BNI, there is no
investment banker, broker, finder or other intermediary which has
been retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of BNI, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of BNI who might be
entitled to any fee or commission from BNI, the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary of BNI upon consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 4.17. Environmental Matters. Except as set
forth in the BNI Form 10-K or otherwise previously disclosed in
writing by BNI to SFP, there are no Environmental Liabilities of
BNI that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on BNI.

SECTION 4.18. Takeover Statutes. No Takeover Statute,
including, without limitation, Section 203 of the DGCL,
applicable to BNI or any of its Subsidiaries is applicable to the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

SECTION 4.19. Compliance with Laws. Except as
publicly disclosed, and except for any matter that would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on BNI,
neither BNI nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of, or
has violated, any applicable provisions of any laws, statutes,
ordinances or regulations.

SECTION 4.20. BNI Rights Agreement. Under the Rights
Agreement between BNI and The First National Bank of Boston,
dated as of July 14, 1986 (the "BNI Rights Agreement"), SFP will
not become an "Acquiring Person", no "Stock Acquisition Date" or
"Distribution Date" (as such terms are defined in the BNI Rights
Agreement) will occur, and BNI's shareholders will not be
entitled to receive any benefits under the BNI Rights Agreement
as a result of the approval, execution or delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger.

will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that its officers,
directors, employees or other agents of SFP do not, directly or
indirectly: initiate, solicit or encourage, or take any action

Proposal of SFP, or, in the event of an unsolicited Takeover
Proposal of SFP, except to the extent required by their fiduciary
duties under applicable law if so advised by outside counsel,
engage in negotiations or provide any confidential information or

making it), within 48 hours of the receipt thereof and shall give

with or any information to be supplied to any Person making such
inquiry, offer or proposal. SFP shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions and negotiations,
if any, with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Takeover Proposal of SFP. As used in this Agreement, "Takeover
Proposal" when used in connection with any Person shall mean any
tender or exchange offer, proposal for a merger, consolidation or
other business combination involving such Person or any
Subsidiary of such Person, or any proposal or offer to acquire in
any manner a substantial equity interest in, or a substantial
portion of the assets of such Person or any Subsidiary of such

governmental or regulatory agency or authority in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(iii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or
proceedings commenced or, to the best of its knowledge
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting BNI or any BNI Material Subsidiary which, if

required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 4.13 or

laws; (ii) BNI and its Subsidiaries will timely pay all taxes
shown as due and payable on the BNI Post-Signing Returns that are
so filed and as of the time of filing, the BNI Post-Signing
Returns will correctly reflect the facts regarding the income,
business, assets, operations, activities and the status of BNI

-38-

Subsidiaries will make provision for all taxes payable by BNI and

notify SFP of any action, suit, proceeding, investigation, audit
or claim pending against or with respect to BNI or any of its

would reasonably be expected to have a significant adverse effect
on BNI's tax liabilities or tax attributes.

SECTION 6.6. Director and Officer Liability. (a) BNI
shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who is, or has been
at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, an officer or director of SFP, in respect of acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time (the
"Indemnified Parties") (including but not limited to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the extent
provided under SFP's certificate of incorporation, bylaws and (A)
indemnity agreements between SFP and any of its officers or
directors ("Indemnity Agreements") in effect on the date hereof
or (B) Indemnity Agreements that may be entered into by SFP from
and after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time so long
as such Agreements shall contain terms and provisions
substantially similar to Indemnity Agreements in effect as of the
date hereof; provided that such indemnification shall be subject
to any limitation imposed from time to time under applicable law. 
For six years after the Effective Time, BNI shall provide, if
available, officers' and directors' liability insurance in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective
Time, including but not limited to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, covering each such Person currently covered by
SFP's officers' and directors' liability insurance policy, or who
becomes covered by such policy prior to the Effective Time, on
terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than
those of such policy in effect on the date hereof, provided that
in satisfying its obligation under this Section, BNI shall not be
obligated to pay premiums in excess of two-hundred percent (200%)
of the amount per annum SFP paid in its last full fiscal year,
which amount has been disclosed to BNI but provided further that
BNI shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as
may be obtained for such amount.

(b) Any determination to be made as to whether any
Indemnified Party has met any standard of conduct imposed by law
shall be made by legal counsel reasonably acceptable to such
Indemnified Party and BNI, retained at BNI's expense.

(c) This Section 6.6 is intended to benefit the
Indemnified Parties, their heirs, executors and personal

-39-

<PAGE>
representatives and shall be binding on successors and assigns of
BNI.

SECTION 6.7. No Solicitations. BNI will not, and BNI
will use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that its officers,
directors, employees or other agents of BNI do not, directly or
indirectly: initiate, solicit or encourage, or take any action
to facilitate the making of, any offer or proposal which
constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to any Takeover
Proposal of BNI, or, in the event of an unsolicited Takeover
Proposal of BNI, except to the extent required by their fiduciary
duties under applicable law if so advised by outside counsel,
engage in negotiations or provide any confidential information or
data to any Person relating to any such Takeover Proposal. BNI
shall notify SFP orally and in writing of any such inquiries,
offers or proposals (including, without limitation, the terms and
conditions of any such proposal and the identity of the person
making it), within 48 hours of the receipt thereof and shall give
SFP five days' advance notice of any agreement to be entered into
with or any information to be supplied to any Person making such
inquiry, offer or proposal. BNI shall immediately cease and
cause to be terminated all existing discussions and negotiations,
if any, with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Takeover Proposal of BNI.

EXHIBIT A

FORM OF AFFILIATE LETTER

Burlington Northern Inc.
3800 Continental Plaza
777 Main Street
Ft. Worth, Texas 76102

Ladies and Gentlemen:

I have been advised that as of the date of this
letter I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Santa Fe
Pacific Corporation, a Delaware Corporation ("SFP"), as the
term "affiliate" is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c)
and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations (the "Rules
and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "Commission") under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Act"). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated as of June 29, 1994 (the
"Agreement"), between Burlington Northern Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("BN"), and SFP, SFP will be merged with and
into BN, with BN to be the survivor in the merger (the
"Merger").

As a result of the Merger, I may receive shares of
Common Stock, no par value, of BN (the "BN Securities") in
exchange for shares owned by me of Common Stock, par value
$1.00 per share, of SFP.

I represent, warrant and covenant to BN that in the
event I receive any BN Securities as a result of the Merger:

A. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other
disposition of the BN Securities in violation of the Act or
the Rules and Regulations.

B. I have carefully read this letter and the
Agreement and discussed the requirements of such documents
and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell,
transfer or otherwise dispose of the BN Securities to the
extent I felt necessary with my counsel or counsel for SFP.

C. I have been advised that the issuance of BN
Securities to me pursuant to the Merger has been registered
with the Commission under the Act on a Registration
Statement on Form S-4. However, I have also been advised
that, since at the time the Merger was submitted for a vote

A-1

<PAGE>
of the stockholders of SFP, I may be deemed to have been an
affiliate of SFP and the distribution by me of the BN
Securities has not been registered under the Act, I may not
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the BN Securities
issued to me in the Merger unless (i) such sale, transfer or
other disposition has been registered under the Act, (ii)
such sale, transfer or under other disposition is made in 
conformity with Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under
the Act, or (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably
acceptable to BN, or a "no action" letter obtained by the
undersigned from the staff of the Commission, such sale,
transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from
registration under the Act.

D. I understand that BN is under no obligation to
register the sale, transfer or other disposition of the BN
Securities by me or on my behalf under the Act or to take
any other action necessary in order to make compliance with
an exemption from such registration available.

E. I also understand that there will be placed on
the certificates for the BN Securities issued to me, or any
substitutions therefor, a legend stating in substance:

"TEN SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE
ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145
PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
APPLIES. THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS 
CERTIFICATE MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE TERMS OF AN AGREEMENT DATED 
BETWEEN THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF AND
BURLINGTON NORTHERN INC., A COPY OF WHICH
AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF 
BURLINGTON NORTHERN INC."

F. I also understand that unless the transfer by
me of my BN Securities has been registered under the Act or
is a sale made in conformity with the provisions of Rule
145, BN reserves the right to put the following legend on
the certificates issued to my transferee:

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE
NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933 AND WERE ACQUIRED FROM A PERSON WHO RECEIVED
SUCH SHARES IN A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145
PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
APPLIES. THE SHARES HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE
HOLDER NOT WITH A VIEW TO, OR FOR RESALE IN
CONNECTION WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION THEREOF WITHIN
THE MEANING OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND MAY 
NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED

A-2

<PAGE>
EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN EXEMPTION FROM THE
REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF
1933."

It is understood and agreed that the legends set
forth in paragraphs E and F above shall be removed by
delivery of substitute certificates without such legend if,
in the judgment of BN, such legend is not required for
purposes of the Act or this Agreement.

Execution of this letter should not be considered an
admission on my part that I am an "affiliate" of SFP as
described in the first paragraph of this letter or as a
waiver of any rights I may have to object to any claim that
I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

Very truly yours,

Dear Sirs:

This letter will confirm our mutual agreement
regarding the disclosure schedules contemplated by the
Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of June 29, 1994 (the
"Merger Agreement") between Burlington Northern Inc. ("BNI")
and Santa Fe Pacific Corporation ("SFP").

Each of BNI and SFP shall deliver to the other its
disclosure schedules not later than July 15, 1994. For the
purposes of this letter, (i) the term "Providing Party"
means the party delivering disclosure schedules and (ii) the
term "Recipient Party" means the party receiving such
materials.

In the event that a Recipient Party shall conclude
in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment that, on
the basis of the information included in the disclosure
schedules, the business of the Providing Party is materially
and adversely different from such Recipient Party's
reasonable understanding of the Providing Party's business
based upon information provided to the Recipient Party prior
to the date hereof, the Recipient Party may elect to
terminate the Merger Agreement in the manner set forth
below. A party seeking to terminate the Merger Agreement
pursuant to this paragraph must so notify the Providing
Party in writing within five days after receipt of the
disclosure schedules from the Providing Party. A failure to
deliver any such notice within such five-day period shall be
deemed a waiver by the Recipient Party of the right to
terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to this letter.

BNI and SFP represent and warrant to the other
that since the Balance Sheet Date (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) there has not been any event, occurrence or
development of a state of circumstances or facts which has
had or reasonably could be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) on BNI
or SFP, as the case may be.

<PAGE>
BNI and SFP acknowledge that this is an agreement
contemplated by the Merger Agreement between the respective
companies.

Sincerely yours,

BURLINGTON NORTHERN INC.

SFP DIRECTORS APPROVE SPIN-OFF

SCHAUMBURG, ILLINOIS, JUNE 30, 1994 -- The board of

directors of Santa Fe Pacific Corporation (NYSE: SFX) has

approved a special dividend to its common shareholders consisting

of the company's remaining 85.4% interest in its gold company

subsidiary, Santa Fe Pacific Gold Corporation (NYSE: GLD). As a

result, SFP Gold will become a separate, independent entity

effective September 30, 1994. On June 15, 1994, an initial

public offering representing 14.6% of SFP Gold was completed at a

price to the public of $14 per share. 

Holders of record of SFP common stock as of September 12,

1994, will receive one share of common stock of Santa Fe Pacific

Gold Corporation for every approximately 1.7 shares of SFP common

stock held. Shareholders entitled to receive fractional shares

will receive cash from the sale on their behalf of such

fractional shares. Santa Fe Pacific Corporation will continue to

own The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway Company and its

interest in Santa Fe Pacific Pipeline Partners, L.P.

As previously announced on April 15, 1994, the company has

received a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the

distribution will be tax free to SFP shareholders and the

company.

Robert D. Krebs, chairman, president and chief executive

officer of SFP, said, "This separation will allow management and

the boards of the two companies to more effectively develop and

finance their assets. We are convinced that this will ultimately

lead to higher values for our owners."
