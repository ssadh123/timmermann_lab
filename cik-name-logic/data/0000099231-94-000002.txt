Ladies & Gentlemen:

TEXAS GAS TRANSMISSION CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), proposes to issue and sell to the underwriters named in
Schedule A (the "Underwriters"), for whom you are acting as
representative (the "Representative"), $150,000,000 aggregate principal
amount of its 8 5/8% Notes due 2004 (the "Notes"). The Notes are to be
sold to each Underwriter, acting severally and not jointly, in the
respective principal amounts set forth in Schedule A opposite the name
of such Underwriter. The Notes are to be issued pursuant to an
indenture dated as of April 11, 1994 (the "Indenture") between the
Company and Chase Manhattan Bank, National Association (the "Trustee").
The Notes and the Indenture are more fully described in the Prospectus
referred to below.

You have advised us that you and the other Underwriters, acting
severally and not jointly, desire to purchase the Notes and that you
have been authorized by the other Underwriters to execute this Agreement
on their behalf.

The Company has prepared and filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form
S-2 (File No. 33-52707) covering the registration of the Notes under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), including the
related preliminary prospectus, or prospectuses, and either (A) has
prepared and proposes to file, prior to the effective date of such
registration statement, an amendment to such registration statement,
including a final prospectus or (B) if the Company has elected to rely
upon Rule 430A of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the
1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations"), will prepare and file a
prospectus in accordance with the provisions of Rule 430A and Rule
424(b) of the 1933 Act Regulations. The information, if any, included
in such prospectus that was omitted from the prospectus included in such
registration statement at the time it becomes effective but that is
deemed, pursuant to Rule 430A(b), to be part of the registration
statement at the time it becomes effective is referred to herein as the
"Rule 430A Information". Each prospectus before the time such
registration statement becomes effective, and any prospectus that omits
the Rule 430A Information that is used after such effectiveness and
prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, is hereinafter
referred to as the "Preliminary Prospectus". Such registration
statement, including the exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated
by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-2 under the 1933 Act,
as amended at the time it becomes effective and including, if
applicable, the Rule 430A Information, is herein called the
"Registration Statement", and the prospectus, including the documents
incorporated by reference therein pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-2 under
the 1933 Act, included in the Registration Statement at the time it
becomes effective, is hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus",
except that, if the final prospectus furnished to the Underwriters after
the execution of this Agreement for use in connection with the offering
of the Notes differs from the prospectus included in the Registration
Statement at the time it becomes effective (whether or not such
prospectus is required to be filed pursuant to Rule 424(b)), the term
"Prospectus" shall refer to the final prospectus furnished to the
Underwriters for such use.

The Company understands that the Underwriters propose to make a
public offering of the Notes as soon as you deem advisable after the
Registration Statement becomes effective, this Agreement has been
executed and delivered and the Indenture has been qualified under the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "1939 Act").

SECTION 1. Representations and Warranties. (a) The Company
represents and warrants to and agrees with each of the Underwriters
that:

(i) The Company meets the requirements for use of Form
S-2 under the 1933 Act.

(ii) When the Registration Statement shall become
effective and at all times subsequent thereto up to the Closing
Time referred to below: (A) the Registration Statement and any
amendments and supplements thereto will comply in all material
respects with the requirements of the 1933 Act and the 1933 Act
Regulations and the Indenture will comply in all material
respects with the requirements of the 1939 Act and the rules and
regulations of the Commission under the 1939 Act (the "1939 Act
Regulations"); (B) neither the Registration Statement nor any
amendment nor supplement thereto will contain an untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading; and (C) neither the Prospectus nor any amendment or
supplement thereto will include an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that this
representation and warranty does not apply to statements or
omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf
of any Underwriter through you expressly for use in the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus.

(iii) The documents incorporated by reference in the
Prospectus pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-2 under the 1933 Act, at
the time they were filed with the Commission, complied in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "1934 Act"), and the rules
and regulations of the Commission thereunder (the "1934 Act
Regulations") and, when read together and with the other
information in the Prospectus, at the time the Registration
Statement becomes effective and at all times subsequent thereto
up to the Closing Time, will not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein not misleading.

(iv) This Agreement has been duly authorized,
executed and delivered by the Company.

(v) Arthur Andersen & Co., who are reporting upon
the audited financial statements and schedules included or
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, are
independent public accountants as required by the 1933 Act
and the 1933 Act Regulations.

(vi) The consolidated financial statements included
or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement
present fairly the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its subsidiary as of the dates indicated and the
consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the
Company and its subsidiary for the periods specified. Such
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved. The
financial statement schedules, if any, included in the
Registration Statement present fairly the information
required to be stated therein. The selected financial data
included in the Prospectus present fairly the information
shown therein and have been compiled on a basis consistent
with that of the audited consolidated financial statements
included or incorporated by reference in the Registration
Statement. The pro forma financial statements, if any, and
other pro forma financial information included or
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement, if
any, present fairly the information shown therein, have been
prepared in accordance with the Commission's rules and
guidelines with respect to pro form financial statements,
have been properly compiled on the pro forma basis described
therein, and, in the opinion of the Company, the assumptions
used in the preparation thereof are reasonable and the
adjustments used therein are appropriate to give effect to
the transactions or circumstances referred to therein. Since
the respective dates of such financial statement, there has
been no material adverse change in the condition (financial
or otherwise), earnings, business affairs or business
prospects of the Company, other than as disclosed in the
Prospectus.

(vii) The Company is a corporation validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware
with corporate power and authority under such laws to own,
lease and operate its properties and conduct its business as
described in the Prospectus; and the Company is duly
qualified to transact business as a foreign corporation and
is in good standing in each other jurisdiction in which it
owns or leases property of a nature, or transacts business of
a type, that would make such qualification necessary, except
to the extent that the failure to so qualify or be in good
standing would not have a material adverse effect on the
Company.

(viii) The Company has no subsidiaries.

(ix) Transco Energy Company, a Delaware corporation
("Transco"), is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware with corporate power and authority under such laws
to own, lease and operate its properties and conduct its
business as described in the Prospectus; and Transco is duly
qualified to transact business as a foreign corporation and
is in good standing in each other jurisdiction in which it
owns or leases property of a nature, or transacts business of
a type, that would make such qualification necessary, except
to the extent that the failure to so qualify or be in good
standing would not have a material adverse effect on Transco
and its subsidiaries, considered as one enterprise.

(x) The Indenture has been duly authorized by the
Company. The Indenture as executed is or will be
substantially in the form filed as an exhibit to the
Registration Statement. The Indenture, when duly executed
and delivered (to the extent required by the Indenture) by
the Company and the Trustee, will constitute a valid and
binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, except as enforcement
thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization or other similar laws affecting
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except as
enforcement thereof is subject to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law); and the Indenture conforms
to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus.

(xi) The Notes have been duly authorized by the
Company. When executed, authenticated, issued and delivered
in the manner provided for in the Indenture and sold and paid
for as provided herein, the Notes will constitute valid and
binding obligations of the Company entitled to the benefits
of the Indenture and enforceable against the Company in
accordance with their terms, except as enforcement thereof
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
conveyance, reorganization or other similar laws affecting
enforcement of creditors' rights generally and except as
enforcement thereof is subject to general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a
proceeding in equity or at law). The Notes conform to the
description thereof contained or incorporated by reference in
the Prospectus and such description conforms to the rights
set forth in the instruments defining the same.

(xii) The Company had at the date indicated a duly
authorized and outstanding capitalization as set forth in the
Prospectus under the caption "Capitalization".

(xiii) All of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company have been duly authorized and validly
issued and are fully paid and nonassessable; no holder
thereof is or will be subject to personal liability by reason
of being such a holder; and none of the outstanding shares of
common stock of the Company ("Common Stock") was issued in
violation of the preemptive rights of any stockholder of the
Company.

(xiv) Since the respective dates as of which
information is given in the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus, except as otherwise stated therein or
contemplated thereby, there has not been (A) any material
adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise),
earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the
Company, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of
business, or (B) any transaction entered into by the Company,
other than in the ordinary course of business, that is
material to the Company.

(xv) Neither Transco or a subsidiary of Transco
which is a significant subsidiary (each a "Significant
Subsidiary") as defined in Rule 405 of Regulation C of the
1933 Act Regulations, nor the Company is in default in the
performance or observance of any obligation, agreement,
covenant or condition contained in any contract, indenture,
mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or other agreement or
instrument to which it is a party or by which it may be bound
or to which any of its properties may be subject, except for
such defaults that would not have a material adverse effect
on the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business
affairs or business prospects of Transco and its
subsidiaries, considered as one enterprise, or the Company.
The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement
and the Indenture, the issuance and delivery of the Notes,
the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement and in the Registration
Statement and compliance by the Company with the terms of
this Agreement and the Indenture have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and
do not and will not result in any violation of the charter or
by-laws of Transco, its Significant Subsidiaries or the
Company and do not and will not conflict with, or result in a
breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a
default under, or result in the creation or imposition of any

(A) any indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or
other agreement or instrument to which Transco, its
Significant Subsidiaries or the Company is a party or by
which they may be bound or to which any of their respective
properties may be subject (except for such conflicts,
breaches or defaults or liens, charges or encumbrances that
would not have a material adverse effect on the condition
(financial or otherwise), earnings, business affairs or
business prospects of Transco and its subsidiaries,
considered as one enterprise, or the Company) or (B) any
existing applicable law, rule, regulation, judgment, order or
decree of any government, governmental instrumentality or
court, domestic or foreign, having jurisdiction over Transco,
its Significant Subsidiaries or the Company or any of their
respective properties.

(xvi) Except as disclosed in the Prospectus, there
is no action, suit or proceeding before or by any government,
governmental instrumentality or court, domestic or foreign,
now pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
against or affecting the Company that is required to be
disclosed in the Prospectus or that reasonably could be

condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business
affairs or business prospects of the Company, or that

contemplated in this Agreement; the aggregate of all pending
legal or governmental proceedings to which the Company is a
party or which affect any of its properties that are not

material adverse effect on the condition (financial or
otherwise), earnings, business affairs or business prospects
of the Company.

Statement or the Prospectus or to be filed or incorporated as

of the Company; except as described in the Prospectus, all of
the leases and subleases material to the business of the
Company, and under which the Company holds properties
described in the Prospectus, are in full force and effect,
and the Company does not have any notice of any material
claim of any sort that has been asserted by anyone adverse to
the rights of the Company under any of the leases or
subleases mentioned above, or affecting or questioning the
rights of such corporation to the continued possession of the
leased or subleased premises under any such lease or
sublease.

(xix) The Company owns, possesses or has obtained
all material governmental licenses, permits, certificates,
consents, orders, approvals and other authorizations
necessary to own or lease, as the case may be, and to operate

licenses, trademarks, service marks or trade names that in
the aggregate, if the subject of an unfavorable decision,
ruling or finding, could materially adversely affect the

affairs or business prospects of the Company.

(xxi) To the best knowledge of the Company, no labor
problem exists with its employees or is imminent that could

affect the condition (financial or otherwise), earnings,
business affairs or business prospects of the Company.

directly or indirectly, any action designed to, or that might
be reasonably expected to, cause or result in stabilization

(xxiii) The Company is not a "holding company" as
defined in Section 2(a)(7) of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935.

(xxiv) No authorization, approval, consent, permit
or license of any government, governmental instrumentality or
court, domestic or foreign (other than under the 1933 Act,
the 1939 Act or the securities or Blue Sky laws of the
various states) is required for the valid authorization,
issuance, sale and delivery of the Notes or for the
execution, delivery or performance of the Indenture by the
Company.

(b) Any certificate signed by any officer of the Company or
its subsidiary and delivered to you or to counsel for the

deemed a representation and warranty by the Company to each
Underwriter as to the matters covered thereby.

SECTION 2. Purchase, Sale and Delivery to the Underwriters;

Time.

(d) It is understood that each Underwriter has authorized
you, for its account, to accept delivery of, receipt for, and make

the Notes to be purchased by any Underwriter whose check or checks
shall not have been received by the Closing Time.

SECTION 3. Certain Covenants of the Company. The Company
covenants with each Underwriter as follows:

(a) The Company will use its best efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to become effective (and, if the Company
elects to rely upon Rule 430A and subject to Section 3(b)hereof, will
comply with the requirements of Rule 430A) and will notify you
immediately, and confirm the notice in writing, (i) when the
Registration Statement, or any post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement, shall have become effective, or any
supplement to the Prospectus, or any amended Prospectus, shall have
been filed, (ii) of the receipt of any comments from the Commission,
(iii) of any request of the Commission to amend the Registration
Statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus or for additional
information and (iv) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or
of any order preventing or suspending the use of any preliminary
prospectus, or of the suspension of the qualification of the Notes
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the institution or
threatening of any proceedings for any of such purposes. The Company
will use every reasonable effort to prevent the issuance of any such
stop order or of any order preventing or suspending such use and, if
any such order is issued, to obtain the lifting thereof at the
earliest possible moment.

(b) The Company will not at any time file or make any
amendment to the Registration Statement, or any amendment of or
supplement (i) if the Company has not elected to rely upon Rule 430A,
to the Prospectus or (ii) if the Company has elected to rely upon
Rule 430A, to the prospectus included in the Registration Statement
at the time it becomes effective (including, in each case, amendments
of the documents incorporated by reference therein), of which you
shall not have previously been advised and furnished a copy or to
which you or counsel for the Underwriters shall object.

(c) The Company has furnished or will furnish to you as many
signed copies of the Registration Statement as originally filed and
of all amendments thereto, whether filed before or after the
Registration Statement becomes effective, copies of all exhibits and
documents filed therewith (including documents incorporated by
reference into the Prospectus pursuant to Item 12 of Form S-2 under
the 1933 Act) and signed copies of all consents and certificates of
experts as you may reasonably request and has furnished or will
furnish to you, for each other Underwriter, one conformed copy of the
Registration Statement as originally filed and of each amendment
thereto (including documents incorporated by reference into the
Prospectus but without exhibits).

(d) The Company will deliver to each Underwriter, without
charge, from time to time until the effective date of the
Registration Statement (or, if the Company has elected to rely upon
Rule 430A, until the time this Agreement is executed and delivered),
as many copies of each preliminary prospectus as such Underwriter may
reasonably request, and the Company hereby consents to the use of
such copies for purposes permitted by the 1933 Act. The Company will
deliver to each Underwriter, without charge, as soon as the
Registration shall have become effective (or, if the Company has
elected to rely upon Rule 430A, as soon as practicable after this
Agreement has been executed and delivered) and thereafter from time
to time as requested during the period when the Prospectus is
required to be delivered under the 1933 Act, such number of copies of
the Prospectus (as supplemented or amended) as such Underwriter may
reasonably request.

(e) The Company will comply to the best of its ability with
the 1933 Act Regulations and the 1939 Act and the 1939 Act
Regulations so as to permit the completion of the distribution of the
Notes as contemplated herein and in the Prospectus. If at any time
when a prospectus is required by the 1933 Act to be delivered in
connection with sales of the Notes any event shall occur or condition
exist as a result of which it is necessary, in the opinion of counsel
for the Underwriters or counsel for the Company, to amend the
Registration Statement or amend or supplement the Prospectus in order
that the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to
make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the
circumstances existing at the time it is delivered to a purchaser, or
if it shall be necessary, in the opinion of either such counsel, at
any such time to amend the Registration Statement or amend or
supplement the Prospectus in order to comply with the requirements of
the 1933 Act or the 1933 Act Regulations, the Company will promptly
prepare and file with the Commission, subject to Section 3(b), such
amendment or supplement as may be necessary to correct such untrue
statement or omission or to make the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus comply with such requirements. Neither the Underwriters'
consent to, nor the Underwriters' delivery of, any such amendment or
supplement shall constitute a waiver of any of the conditions set
forth in Section 5.

(f) The Company will use its best efforts, in cooperation with
the Underwriters, to qualify the Notes for offering and sale under
the applicable securities laws of such states and other jurisdictions
as you may reasonably request and to maintain such qualifications in
effect for a period of not less than one year from the effective date
of the Registration Statement; provided, however, that the Company
shall not be obligated to file any general consent to service of
process or to qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in
securities in any jurisdiction in which it is not so qualified or to
subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in any
jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject. The Company
will file such statements and reports as may be required by the laws
of each jurisdiction in which the Notes have been qualified as above
provided. The Company will also supply you with such information as
is necessary for the determination of the legality of the Notes for
investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as you may request.

(g) The Company will make generally available to its security
holders as soon as practicable, but not later than 45 days after the
close of the period covered thereby, an earnings statement of the
Company (in form complying with the provisions of Rule 158 of the
1933 Act Regulations) covering a period of 12 months beginning after
the effective date of the Registration Statement but not later than
the first day of the Company's fiscal quarter next following such
effective date.

(h) The Company will use the net proceeds received by it from
the sale of the Notes in the manner specified in the Prospectus under
the caption "Use of Proceeds".

(i) For a period of five years after the Closing Time, the

information is given in the Registration Statement, any material

the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable accounting requirements of the 1933 Act and the
1934 Act and the respective published rules and regulations

have been furnished with all such documents, certificates and
opinions as they may request for the purpose of enabling them to pass

accuracy and completeness of any of the representations, warranties
or statements of the Company, the performance of any of the covenants

there shall not have occurred any downgrading in the rating of any of
Transco's, its Significant Subsidiaries' or the Company's debt
securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating
organization" (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act),
or any public announcement that any such organization has under
surveillance or review its rating of any debt securities of Transco,
its Significant Subsidiaries or the Company (other than an
announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and

If any of the conditions specified in this Section 5 shall not
have been fulfilled when and as required by this Agreement or the
Indenture to be fulfilled, this Agreement may be terminated by you, on
notice to the Company at any time at or prior to the Closing Time, and
such termination shall be without liability of any party to any other
party, except as provided in Section 4. Notwithstanding any such

SECTION 6. Indemnification. (a) The Company agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter and each person, if any,
who controls any Underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the
1933 Act as follows:

(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage
and expense whatsoever, as incurred; arising out of an untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in the Registration Statement (or any amendment
thereto), including the Rule 430A Information, if applicable, and
all documents incorporated therein by reference, or the omission
or alleged omission therefrom of a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading or arising out of an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any preliminary
prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom of a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading;

(ii) against any and all loss, liability, claim,
damage and expense whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of
the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any litigation, or
investigation or proceeding by any governmental agency or
body, commenced or threatened, or any claim whatsoever based
upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any such
alleged untrue statement or omission, if such settlement is
effected with the written consent of the Company; and

(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever, as
incurred (including fees and disbursements of counsel chosen
by you), reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or
defending against any litigation, or investigation or
proceeding by any governmental agency or body, commenced or
threatened, or any claim whatsoever based upon any such
untrue statement or omission, or any such alleged untrue
statement or omission, to the extent that any such expense is
not paid under subparagraph (i) or (ii) above;

provided, however, that this indemnity agreement does not apply to
any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense to the extent arising
out of an untrue statement or omissionor alleged untrue statement
or omission made in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter through you
expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment
thereto), including the Rule 430A Information, if applicable, or any
preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto).

(b) Each Underwriter severally agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its directors, each of its officers who
signed the Registration Statement, and each person, if any, who
controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 of the 1933
Act, against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and
expense described in the indemnity contained in Section 6(a), as
incurred, but only with respect to untrue statements or omissions,
or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made in the
Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto), including the
Rule 430A Information, if applicable, or any preliminary
prospectus or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through
you expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any
amendment thereto), including the Rule 430A Information, if
applicable, or such preliminary prospectus or the Prospectus (or
any amendment or supplement thereto).

(c) Each indemnified party shall give prompt notice to each
indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect
of which indemnity may be sought hereunder, but failure to so
notify an indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any
liability which it may have otherwise than on account of this
indemnity agreement. An indemnifying party may participate at its
own expense in the defense of such action. In no event shall the
indemnifying parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more
than one counsel for all indemnified parties in connection with
any one action or separate but similar or related actions in the
same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or
circumstances.

SECTION 7. Contribution. In order to provide for just and
equitable contributions in circumstances under which the indemnity
provided for in Section 6 is for any reason held to be unenforceable by
the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its
terms, the Company and the Underwriters shall contribute to the
aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the
nature contemplated by such indemnity agreement incurred by the Company
and one or more of the Underwriters, as incurred, in such proportions
that the Underwriters are responsible for that portion represented by
the percentage that the underwriting discount bears to the initial
public offering price of the Notes and the Company is responsible for
the balance; provided, however, that no person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the provisions of
this Section 7, no Underwriter shall be required to contribute any
amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the
Notes underwritten by it and distributed to the public were offered to
the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Underwriter has
otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. For purposes of this
Section, each person, if any, who controls an Underwriter within the
meaning of Section 15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to
contribution as such Underwriter, and each director of the Company, each
officer of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and each
person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section
15 of the 1933 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the
Company.

SECTION 8. Representations, Warranties and Agreements to Survive
Delivery. The representations, warranties, indemnities, agreements and
other statements of the Company or its officers set forth in or made
pursuant to this Agreement will remain operative and in full force and
effect regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of the
Company or any Underwriter or controlling person and will survive
delivery of and payment for the Notes.

SECTION 9. Termination of Agreement. (a) You may also
terminate this Agreement, by notice to the Company, at any time at or
prior to the Closing Time (i) if there has been, since the respective
dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement,
any material adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise),
earnings, business affairs or business prospects of the Company, whether
or not arising in the ordinary course of business or (ii) if there has
occurred any new outbreak of hostilities or the escalation of
hostilities or other calamity or crisis the effect of which on the
financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, in your
judgment, impracticable to market the Notes or enforce contracts for the
sale of the Notes or (iii) if trading in any securities of the Company
has been suspended by the Commission or the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc., or if trading generally on the New York Stock
Exchange or in the over-the-counter market has been suspended, or
minimum or maximum prices for trading have been fixed, or maximum ranges

order of the Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc. or any other governmental authority or (iv) if a banking moratorium

to any other party, except to the extent provided in Section 4.
Notwithstanding any such termination, the provisions of Sections
6, 7 and 8 shall remain in effect.

(c) This Agreement may also terminate pursuant to the
provisions of Section 2 or Section 10 hereof, with the effect
stated in each such Section.

SECTION 10. Default by One or More of the Underwriters. If one
or more of the Underwriters shall fail at the Closing Time to purchase
the Notes that it or they are obligated to purchase hereunder (the
"Defaulted Notes"), you shall have the right, within 24 hours
thereafter, to make arrangements for one or more of the non-defaulting
Underwriters, or any other underwriters, to purchase all, but not less
than all, of the Defaulted Notes in such amounts as may be agreed upon
and upon the terms herein set forth; if, however, you have not completed
such arrangements within such 24-hour period, then:

(a) if the number of Defaulted Notes does not exceed 10% of
the aggregate principal of Notes, the non-defaulting Underwriters
shall be obligated to purchase the full amount thereof in the
proportions that their respective Notes underwriting obligation
proportions bear to the underwriting obligations of all non-
defaulting Underwriters; or

(b) if the number of Defaulted Notes exceeds 10% of the
aggregate principal of Notes, this Agreement shall terminate without
liability on the part of any non-defaulting Underwriter.

No action taken pursuant to this Section shall relieve any
defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of its default.

In the event of any such default that does not result in a
termination of this Agreement, either you or the Company shall have the
right to postpone the Closing Time for a period not exceeding seven days
in order to effect any required changes in the Registration Statement or
Prospectus or in any other documents or arrangements. As used herein,
the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an
Underwriter under this Section 10.

the singular;

(2) all other terms used herein which are defined in the
Trust Indenture Act, either directly or by reference therein, have

the meanings assigned to them in accordance with GAAP; and

(4) the words "herein", "hereof" and "hereunder" and other
words of similar import refer to this Indenture as a whole and not to
any particular Article, Section or other subdivision.

"Act", when used with respect to any Holder, has the meaning
specified in Section 104.

"Affiliate" of any specified Person means any other Person

accordance with GAAP, discounted from the last date of such initial term

amount of rent payable by the lessee with respect to such period after
excluding amounts required to be paid on account of insurance, taxes,
assessments, utility, operating and labor costs and similar charges. In
the case of any lease which is terminable by the lessee upon the payment

penalty, but no rent shall be considered as required to be paid under
such lease subsequent to the first date upon which it may be so
terminated. "Attributable Value" means, as to a Capital Lease
Obligation under which any person is at the time liable and at any date
as of which the amount thereof is to be determined, the capitalized
amount thereof that would appear on the face of a balance sheet of such

and Friday which is not a day on which banking institutions in The City
of New York, New York, are authorized or obligated by law or executive
order to close.

"Capital Lease Obligation" of any Person means the obligation
to pay rent or other payment amounts under a lease of (or other Debt
arrangements conveying the right to use) real or personal property of
such Person which is required to be classified and accounted for as a
capital lease or a liability on the face of a balance sheet of such
Person in accordance with GAAP. The stated maturity of such obligation
shall be the date of the last payment of rent or any other amount due
under such lease prior to the first date upon which such lease may be
terminated by the lessee without payment of a penalty.

"Capital Stock" of any Person means any and all shares,
interests, participations or other equivalents (however designated) of
corporate stock of such Person.

"Commission" means the Securities and Exchange Commission, as
from time to time constituted, created under the Exchange Act, or, if at
any time after the execution of this instrument such Commission is not
existing and performing the duties now assigned to it under the Trust
Indenture Act, then the body performing such duties at such time.

"Company" means the Person named as the "Company" in the first

stockholders' equity of such Person and its Consolidated Subsidiaries,
as determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, less
amounts attributable to Redeemable Stock of such person.

"Consolidated Subsidiaries" of any person means all other

instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in
person or by agent duly appointed in writing; and, except as herein
otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when
such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where
it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or
instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are
herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such
instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or
of a writing appointing any such agent shall be sufficient for any
purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 601) conclusive in
favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the manner provided in
this Section.

(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any
such instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness
of such execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other
officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying
that the individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to
him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting
in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or
affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The
fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing, or the
authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved in any
other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.

(c) The Company may, in the circumstances permitted by the
Trust Indenture Act, fix any day as the record date for the purpose of
determining the Holders of Notes entitled to give or take any request,
demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other
action, or to vote on any action, authorized or permitted to be given or
taken by Holders of Notes. If not set by the Company prior to the first
solicitation of a Holder of Notes made by any Person in respect of any
such action, or, in the case of any such vote, prior to such vote, the
record date for any such action or vote shall be the 30th day (or, if
later, the date of the most recent list of Holders required to be
provided pursuant to Section 701) prior to such first solicitation or
vote, as the case may be. With regard to any record date for action to
be taken by the Holders of Notes, only the Holders of Notes on such date
(or their duly designated proxies) shall be entitled to give or take, or
vote on, the relevant action.

(d) The ownership of Notes shall be proved by the Note
Register.

(e) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Note shall bind every
future Holder of the same Note and the Holder of every Note issued upon
the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu
thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by
the Trustee or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation
of such action is made upon such Note.

in writing to the Trustee by the Company.

Section 106. Notice to Holders; Waiver.

Where this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of any
event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein
expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class postage
prepaid, to each Holder affected by such event, at his address as it
appears in the Note Register, not later than the latest date (if any),
and not earlier than the earliest date (if any), prescribed for the
giving of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders is given by
mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any
notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency
of such notice with respect to other Holders. Where this Indenture
provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing
by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before or after
the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice.
Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed with the Trustee, but such
filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action
taken in reliance upon such waiver.

In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or
by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such
notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the
approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for
every purpose hereunder.

Section 107. Conflict with Trust Indenture Act.

If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with a
provision of the Trust Indenture Act that is required under such Act to
be a part of and govern this Indenture, the latter provision shall
control. If any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any
provision of the Trust Indenture Act that may be so modified or
excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to apply to this
Indenture as so modified or to be excluded, as the case may be.

Section 108. Effect of Headings and Table of Contents.

The Article and Section headings herein and the Table of
Contents are for convenience only and shall not affect the construction
hereof.

Section 109. Successors and Assigns.

All covenants and agreements in this Indenture by the Company
shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.

Section 110. Separability Clause.

In case any provision in this Indenture or in the Notes shall
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby.

Section 111. Benefits of Indenture.

Nothing in this Indenture or in the Notes, express or implied,
shall give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and their
successors hereunder and the Holders, any benefit or any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.

Section 112. Governing Law.

This Indenture and the Notes shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

Section 113. Legal Holidays.

In any case where any Interest Payment Date or Stated Maturity
of any Note shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then
(notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of the Notes)
payment of interest or principal (and premium, if any) need not be made
at such Place of Payment on such date, but may be made on the next
succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment with the same force and
effect as if made on the Interest Payment Date or at the Stated
Maturity, provided that no interest shall accrue for the period from and
after such Interest Payment Date or Stated Maturity, as the case may be,

hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon
this Note.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this
Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the
Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of

transferee or transferees.

The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of

THE NOTES

Section 301. Title and Terms.

The aggregate principal amount of Notes which may be
authenticated and delivered under this Indenture is limited to
$150,000,000, except for Notes authenticated and delivered upon
registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, other
Notes.

The Notes shall be known as the "8 5/8% Notes due 2004" of the
Company. The Stated Maturity of the principal thereof shall be April 1,
1994 and they shall bear interest at the rate of 8 5/8% per annum from
April 1, 1994, or the most recent Interest Payment Date to which
interest has been paid or duly provided for, payable on October 1, 1994
and semiannually thereafter on April 1 and October 1 in each year and at
the Stated Maturity, until the principal thereof is paid or duly
provided for.

The principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the
Notes shall be payable at the office or agency of the Company maintained
for such purpose in The City of New York, or at such other office or
agency of the Company as may be maintained for such purpose; provided,
however, that at the option of the Company, interest may be paid by
check mailed to addresses of the Persons entitled thereto as such
addresses shall appear on the Note Register.

Section 302. Denominations.

The Notes shall be issuable in registered form without coupons
in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.

Section 303. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and
Dating.

The Notes shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its
Chairman of the Board, its Vice Chairman of the Board, its President or
one of its Vice Presidents, under its corporate seal reproduced thereon
attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries. The
signature of any of these officers on the Notes may be manual or
facsimile.

Notes bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals
who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the
Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have
ceased to hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of
such Notes or did not hold such offices at the date of such Notes.

The Trustee shall, upon Company Order, authenticate and deliver
Notes for original issue in an aggregate principal amount of up to
$150,000,000.

Each Note shall be dated the date of its authentication.

No Note shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture
or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such
Note a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided
for herein executed by the Trustee by manual signature, and such
certificate upon any Note shall be conclusive evidence, and the only
evidence, that such Note has been duly authenticated and delivered
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Note shall have been
authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the
Company, and the Company shall deliver such Note to the Trustee for
cancellation as provided in Section 309, for all purposes of this
Indenture such Note shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and
delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled to the benefits of this
Indenture.

Section 304. Temporary Notes.

Pending the preparation of definitive Notes, the Company may
execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, temporary Notes which are printed, lithographed, typewritten,
mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination,
substantially of the tenor of the definitive Notes in lieu of which they
are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions,
substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Notes
may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Notes.

If temporary Notes are issued, the Company will cause
definitive Notes to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the
preparation of definitive Notes, the temporary Notes shall be
exchangeable for definitive Notes upon surrender of the temporary Notes
at the office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment, without
charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or
more temporary Notes, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor one or more definitive
Notes of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal
amount and tenor. Until so exchanged the temporary Notes shall in all
respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as
definitive Notes.

Section 305. Registration, Registration of Transfer and
Exchange.

The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust
Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office
and in any other office or agency of the Company in a Place of Payment
being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Note Register")
in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe,
the Company shall provide for the registration of Notes and of transfers
of Notes. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Note Registrar" for the
purpose of registering Notes and transfers of Notes as herein provided.

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Note at the
office or agency in a Place of Payment, the Company shall execute, and
the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of the
designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Notes of any
authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and
tenor.

At the option of the Holder, Notes may be exchanged for other
Notes of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal
amount and tenor, upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at such
office or agency. Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for exchange,
the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, the Notes which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to
receive.

All Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange
of Notes shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the
same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as
the Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

Every Note presented or surrendered for registration of
transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the
Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Note Registrar duly
executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in
writing.

No service charge shall be made for any registration of
transfer or exchange of Notes, but the Company may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of
Notes, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 304 or 906.

Section 306. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Notes.

If any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Trustee, the
Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in
exchange therefor a new Note of like tenor and principal amount and
bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee
(i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of
any Note and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them
to save each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in
the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Note has
been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and
the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such
destroyed, lost or stolen Note, a new Note of like tenor and principal
amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note has
become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its
discretion may, instead of issuing a new Note, pay such Note.

Upon the issuance of any new Note under this Section, the
Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or
other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and
any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee)
connected therewith.

Every new Note issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall constitute an original
additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note shall be at any time
enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this
Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Notes duly
issued hereunder.

The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude
(to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the
replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes.

Section 307. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights
Preserved.

Interest on any Note which is payable, and is punctually paid
or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the
Person in whose name that Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) is
registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such
interest.

Any interest on any Note which is payable, but is not
punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date
(herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable
to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having
been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the
Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or
clause (2) below:

(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted
Interest to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or their respective
Predecessor Notes) are registered at the close of business on a
Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which
shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify the
Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be
paid on each Note and the date of the proposed payment, and at the
same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of
money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of
such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to
the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed
payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the
benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this
clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record
Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not
more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the
proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the
Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall
promptly notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the
name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the
proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record
Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each
Holder of Notes at his address as it appears in the Note Register,
not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of
the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special
Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted Interest
shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Notes (or their
respective Predecessor Notes) are registered at the close of business
on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant
to the following Clause (2).

(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on
the Notes in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the
requirements of any securities exchange on which such Notes may be
listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if,
after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed
payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be
deemed practicable by the Trustee.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, each Note
delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in
exchange for or in lieu of any other Note shall carry the rights to
interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such
other Note.

Section 308. Persons Deemed Owners.

Prior to due presentment of a Note for registration of
transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the
Trustee may treat the Person in whose name such Note is registered as
the owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal
of and any premium and (subject to Section 307) any interest on such
Note and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Note be
overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the
Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

Section 309. Cancellation.

All Notes surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of
transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment
shall, if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered
to the Trustee and shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may
at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Notes previously
authenticated and delivered hereunder which the Company may have
acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to
any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation any Notes
previously authenticated hereunder which the Company has not issued and
sold, and all Notes so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the
Trustee. No Notes shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for
any Notes cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly
permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled Notes held by the Trustee
shall be disposed of as directed by a Company Order.

Section 310. Computation of Interest.

Interest on the Notes shall be computed on the basis of a
360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

Section 311. CUSIP Numbers.

The Company in issuing the Notes may use "CUSIP" numbers (if
then generally in use).

thereof in accordance with their terms, will provide, not later than
one day before the due date of any payment referred to in this clause
(a), money in an amount or (3) a combination thereof in an amount
sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of
independent public accountants expressed in a written certification

Indenture or any other agreement or instrument to which the Company

(c) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing
(1) on the date of such deposit or (2) insofar as certain events of

satisfied until the expiration of such period);

(d) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee (1)
either (i) a ruling directed to the Trustee received from the
Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the Holders will not
recognize income, gains or loss for federal income tax purposes as a
result of the Company's exercise of its option under this Section 402
and will be subject to federal income tax on the same amount and in
the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
such option had not been exercised or (ii) an Opinion of Counsel to
the same effect as the ruling described in clause (i) above
accompanied by a ruling to that effect published by the Internal
Revenue Service, unless there has been a change in the applicable
federal income tax law since the date of this Indenture such that a
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service is no longer required, and
(2) an Opinion of Counsel, subject to such qualifications,
exceptions, assumptions and limitations as are reasonably deemed
necessary by such counsel and are reasonably satisfactory to counsel
for the Trustee, to the effect that (i) the creation of the
defeasance trust will not result in the trust arising from such
deposit constituting an investment company as defined in the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended and (ii) after the passage
of 123 days following the deposit (except, with respect to any trust
funds for the benefit of any Person who may be deemed to be an

to the effect of Section 547 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or
Section 15.6-A of the New York Debtor and Creditor Law in a case
commenced by or against the Company under either such statute, and

Company (and therefore will not be subject to the effect of any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws
affecting creditors' rights generally) or (II) if a court were to
rule under any such law in any case or proceeding that the trust
funds remained property of the Company, (a) assuming such trust funds
remained in the possession of the Trustee prior to such court ruling
to the extent not paid to the Holders, the Trustee will hold, for the
benefit of the Holders, a valid and perfected security interest in
such trust funds that is not avoidable in bankruptcy or otherwise
except for the effect of Section 552(b) of the United States

entitled to receive adequate protection of their interests in such
trust funds if such trust funds are used in such case or proceeding;
and

(e) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, in each case stating that all
conditions precedent provided for herein relating to the defeasance
contemplated by this Section 402 have been complied with.

Notwithstanding the foregoing subsection (a), prior to the end
of the 123-day (or one-year) period referred to in subsection (d)(2)(ii)
above, none of the Company's obligations under this Indenture shall be
discharged. Subsequent to the end of such 123-day (or one-year) period

303, 304, 305, 306, 607, 610, 1001 and 1002 of this Indenture shall
survive until there are no Notes Outstanding. Thereafter, only the
Company's obligations in Section 607 of this Indenture shall survive.

Counsel referred to in subsection (d)(1) above is able to be provided
specifically without regard to, and not in reliance upon, the
continuance of the Company's obligations under Section 1001 of this
Indenture, then the Company's obligations under such Section 1001 of
this Indenture shall cease upon delivery to the Trustee of such ruling
or Opinion of Counsel and compliance with the other conditions precedent
provided for herein relating to the defeasance contemplated by this
Section 402.

(6), (7) and (8) of Section 501 of this Indenture shall be deemed not to
be Events of Default, in each case with respect to the Outstanding Notes
if:

irrevocably deposited or caused to be irrevocably deposited with the
Trustee (or another trustee satisfying the requirements of Section
609 of this Indenture) and conveyed all right, title and interest to
the Trustee for the benefit of the Holders, under the terms of an
irrevocable trust agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the
Trustee, as trust funds in trust, specifically pledged to the Trustee

amount sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of
independent public accountants expressed in a written certification
thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, without
consideration of the reinvestment of such interest and after payment
of all federal, state and local taxes or other charges and
assessments in respect thereof payable by the Trustee, the principal
of, premium, if any, and interest on the outstanding Notes on the
Stated Maturity of such principal or interest; provided that the
Trustee shall have been irrevocably instructed to apply such money or
the proceeds of such U.S. Government Obligations to the payment of
such principal, premium, if any, and interest with respect to the
Notes;

(b) such deposit will not, if the Notes are then listed on

a breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, this
Indenture or any other agreement or instrument to which the Company
is a party or by which it is bound;

(c) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing (1) on the date of such deposit or (2) insofar as certain
events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization are concerned, at
any time during the period ending on the 91st day after the date of

deemed satisfied until the expiration of such period);

(d) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel, subject to such qualifications, exceptions, assumptions and
limitations as are reasonably deemed necessary by such counsel and
are reasonably satisfactory to counsel for the Trustee, to the effect

trust arising constituting an investment company as defined in the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, (2) the Holders have a
valid first-priority security interest in the trust funds, (3) the
Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income

respect to any trust funds for the benefit of any Person who may be
deemed to be an "insider" for purposes of the United States
Bankruptcy Code, after one year following the deposit), the trust
funds will not be subject to the effect of Section 547 of the United
States Bankruptcy Code or Section 15.6-A of the New York Debtor and
Creditor Law in a case commenced by or against the Company under
either such statute, and either (i) the trust funds will no longer
remain the property of the Company (and therefore will not be subject

proceeding that the trust funds remained property of the Company, (x)

perfected security interest in such trust funds that is not avoidable
in bankruptcy or otherwise except for the effect of Section 552(b) of
the United States Bankruptcy Code on interest on the trust funds
accruing after the commencement of a case under such statute and (y)
the Holders will be entitled to receive adequate protection of their
interests in such trust funds if such trust funds are used in such
case or proceeding; and

(e) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, in each case stating that all
conditions precedent provided for herein relating to the defeasance
contemplated by this Section 403 have been complied with.

Section 404. Application of Trust Money.

Subject to the last paragraph of Section 1003 of this
Indenture, the Trustee or Paying Agent shall hold in trust money or U.S.
Government Obligations deposited with it pursuant to Section 401, 402 or
403 of this Indenture, as the case may be, and shall apply the deposited
money and the money from U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with
the Notes and this Indenture to the payment of principal of and interest

If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any money or
U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section 401, 402 or 403
of this Indenture, as the case may be, by reason of any legal proceeding
or by reason of any order or judgment of any court or governmental
authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such
application, the Company's obligations under this Indenture and the
Notes shall be revived and reinstated as though no deposit had occurred
pursuant to Section 401, 402 or 403 of this Indenture, as the case may
be, until such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply
all such money or U.S. Government Obligations in accordance with Section
401, 402 or 403 of this Indenture, as the case may be; provided that, if
the Company has made any payment of principal of or interest on any
Notes because of the reinstatement of its obligations, then the Company
shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to
receive such payment from the money or U.S. Government Obligations held
by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

and payable after the expiration of any applicable grace period with
respect thereto or shall have resulted in such Debt becoming or being
declared due and payable prior to the date on which it would
otherwise have become due and payable, without such indebtedness
having been discharged, or such acceleration having been rescinded or
annulled, within a period of 30 days after there shall have been
given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by the Trustee
or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Notes a written notice
specifying such default and requiring the Company to cause such Debt

annulled and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default"
hereunder; or

(6) the entering of a final judgment or final judgments for
the payment of money against the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company in an aggregate amount in excess of $5 million by a court or

of 60 consecutive days; or

(8) the commencement by the Company of a voluntary case or
proceeding under any applicable Federal or state bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or other similar law or of any other case
or proceeding to be adjudicated a bankrupt or insolvent, or the

of creditors, or the admission by it in writing of its inability to
pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of
corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any such action; or

Section 502. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and
Annulment.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default
described in clause (7) or clause (8) of Section 501) occurs and is
continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not
less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes may declare
the principal amount of all of the Notes to be due and payable
immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee
if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal
amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable.
If an Event of Default of the type set forth in clause (7) or clause (8)
of Section 501 occurs and is continuing, the principal of and any
interest on the Notes then Outstanding shall become immediately due and
payable.

At any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to
Notes has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the
money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this
Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Notes, by written notice to the Company and the Trustee, may
rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences, other than an
Event of Default in respect of the nonpayment of accelerated principal,
if:

(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum
sufficient to pay

(A) all overdue interest on all Notes,

(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any
Notes which have become due otherwise than by such declaration
of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates
prescribed therefor in such Notes,

(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is
lawful, interest upon overdue interest at the rate or rates
prescribed therefor in such Notes, and

(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder
and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel;

and

(2) all Events of Default with respect to Notes, other than
the non-payment of the principal of Notes which have become due
solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived
as provided in Section 513.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any
right consequent thereon.

Section 503. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for
Enforcement by Trustee.

The Company covenants that if:

(1) default is made in the payment of any interest on any
Note when such interest becomes due and payable and such default
continues for a period of 30 days; or

(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or
premium, if any, on) any Note at the Maturity thereof;

the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit
of the Holders of such Notes, the whole amount then due and payable on
such Notes for principal and any premium and interest and, to the extent
that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on
any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue interest, at the
rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Notes, and, in addition
thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs
and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and
counsel.

If an Event of Default with respect to Notes occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and
enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Notes by such
appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most
effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the
specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or
in aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any
other proper remedy.

Section 504. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.

In case of any judicial proceeding relative to the Company (or
any other obligor upon the Notes), its property or its creditors, the
Trustee shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such
proceeding or otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under
the Trust Indenture Act in order to have claims of the Holders and the
Trustee allowed in any such proceeding. In particular, the Trustee
shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property
payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same
after reduction of the Trustee's reasonable fees and expenses (including
counsel fees and expenses) and any other amounts due under Section 607;
and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator
or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby
authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in
the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee
under Section 607.

No provision of this Indenture shall be deemed to authorize the
Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any
Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or
composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder thereof or
to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder
in any such proceeding.

Section 505. Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession
of Notes.

All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the
Notes may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the
possession of any of the Notes or the production thereof in any
proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the
Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust,
and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the
Holders of the Notes in respect of which such judgment has been
recovered.

Section 506. Application of Money Collected.

Any money or other property collected by the Trustee pursuant
to this Article shall be applied in the following order, at the date or
dates fixed by the Trustee and, in case of the distribution of such
money on account of principal or any premium or interest, upon
presentation of the Notes and the notation thereon of the payment if
only partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee under
Section 607; and

SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for
principal of and any premium and interest on the Notes in respect of
which or for the benefit of which such money has been collected,
ratably, without preference or priority of any kind, according to the
amounts due and payable on such Notes for principal and any premium
and interest, respectively.

Section 507. Limitation on Suits.

No Holder of any Note shall have any right to institute any
proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or
for the appointment of a receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy
hereunder, unless

(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the
Trustee of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Notes;

(2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of
the Outstanding Notes shall have made written request to the Trustee
to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in its
own name as Trustee hereunder;

(3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee
reasonable indemnity against the costs, expenses and liabilities to
be incurred in compliance with such request;

(4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice,
request and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such
proceeding; and

(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has
been given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of
a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes;

it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders
shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing
of, any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the
rights of any other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain
priority or preference over any other of such Holders or to enforce any
right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for
the equal and ratable benefit of all of such Holders.

Section 508. Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive
Principal, Premium and Interest.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the
Holder of any Note shall have the right, which is absolute and
unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of and any premium
and (subject to Section 307) any interest on such Note on the Stated
Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Note (or, in the case of
redemption, on the Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the
enforcement of any such payment, and such rights shall not be impaired
without the consent of such Holder.

Section 509. Restoration of Rights and Remedies.

If the Trustee or any Holder has instituted any proceeding to
enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has
been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been determined
adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such case,
subject to any determination in such proceeding, the Company, the
Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally and respectively to
their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies
of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such
proceeding had been instituted.

Section 510. Rights and Remedies Cumulative.

Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or
payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes in the last
paragraph of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or
reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders is intended to be exclusive of
any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall, to the
extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other
right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or
in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or
remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent
assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

Section 511. Delay or Omission Not Waiver.

No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any
Notes to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default
shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such
Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy
given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be
exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by
the Trustee or by the Holders, as the case may be.

Section 512. Control by Holders.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Notes shall have the right to direct the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with
respect to the Notes, provided that

(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of
law or with this Indenture, and

(2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by
the Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.

Section 513. Waiver of Past Defaults.

The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Outstanding Notes may on behalf of the Holders of all the
Notes waive any past default hereunder and its consequences, except a
default

(1) in the payment of the principal of, or any premium, if
any, or interest on, any Note, or

(2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under
Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the
Holder of each Outstanding Note affected.

Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and
any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been
cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall
extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent
thereon.

Section 514. Undertaking for Costs.

In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under
this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken,
suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, a court may require any party
litigant in such suit to file an undertaking to pay the costs of such
suit, and may assess costs against any such party litigant, in the
manner and to the extent provided in the Trust Indenture Act; provided
that neither this Section nor the Trust Indenture Act shall be deemed to
authorize any court to require such an undertaking or to make such an
assessment in any suit instituted by the Company.

Section 515. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.

The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do
so) that it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner
whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or
extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force,
which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and
the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly
waives all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it
will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein
granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of
every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk
its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the

of the Notes. The Trustee or any Authenticating Agent shall not be
accountable for the use or application by the Company of Notes or the
proceeds thereof.

with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee,
Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Note Registrar or such other agent.

Section 606. Money Held in Trust.

Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be
segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law. The
Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any money received
by it hereunder except as otherwise agreed with the Company.

reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in

claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of
any of its powers or duties hereunder.

Section 608. Disqualification; Conflicting Interests.

If the Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest
within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either
eliminate such interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner
provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act
and this Indenture.

Section 609. Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.

There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be
a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as
such and has a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and
its Corporate Trust Office in The City of New York. If such Person
publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to
the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for
the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such
Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set
forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any
time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner
and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.

effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee
in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611.

(b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the
Notes by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the
instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 611
shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the
giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition
any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor
Trustee with respect to the Notes.

(c) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to
the Notes by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Notes, delivered to the Trustee and to the Company.

written request therefor by the Company or by any Holder who
has been a bona fide Holder of a Note for at least six months,
or

(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 609
and shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the
Company or by any such Holder, or

(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be
adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee
or of its property shall be appointed or any public officer
shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property
or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or
liquidation,

then, in any such case, (i) the Company by a Board Resolution may remove
the Trustee with respect to all Notes, or (ii) subject to Section 514,
any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Note for at least six
months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the
Trustee with respect to all Notes and the appointment of a successor
Trustee or Trustees.

(e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become
incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of
Trustee for any cause, the Company, by a Board Resolution, shall
promptly appoint a successor Trustee and shall comply with the

resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy,
a successor Trustee shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Notes delivered to the
Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed
shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance
with the applicable requirements of Section 611, become the successor
Trustee and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by
the Company. If no successor Trustee shall have been so appointed by
the Company or the Holders and accepted appointment in the manner
required by Section 611, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a
Note for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others
similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the

each removal of the Trustee and each appointment of a successor Trustee

Section 611. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.

(a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor
Trustee, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute,
acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an
instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or
removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such
successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall
become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the
retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Company or the successor
Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges,
execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee
all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly
assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and
money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.

(b) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company
shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly
vesting in and confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights,
powers and trusts referred to in paragraph (a) of this Section.

(c) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless
at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified
and eligible under this Article.

Section 612. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or
Succession to Business.

Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation
resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the
Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to all or
substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be
the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall
be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article, without the
execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any
of the parties hereto. In case any Notes shall have been authenticated,
but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by
merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may
adopt such authentication and deliver the Notes so authenticated with
the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated
such Notes.

Section 613. Preferential Collection of Claims Against
Company.

If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the
Company (or any other obligor upon the Notes), the Trustee shall be
subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the
collection of claims against the Company (or any such other obligor).

Section 614. Appointment of Authenticating Agent.

The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with
respect to the Notes which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the
Trustee to authenticate Notes issued upon original issue and upon
exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or
pursuant to Section 306, and Notes so authenticated shall be entitled to
the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all
purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever
reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery
of Notes by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication,
such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on
behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of
authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating
Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and
shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under
the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or the
District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as
Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less
than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or
state authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports of
condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of
said supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this
Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent

punctually pay the principal of and any premium and interest on the
Notes in accordance with the terms of the Notes and this Indenture.

Section 1002. Maintenance of Office or Agency.

The Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for Notes an
office or agency where Notes may be presented or surrendered for
payment, where Notes may be surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect
of the Notes and this Indenture may be served. The Company will give
prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in
the location, of such office or agency. If at any time the Company
shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail
to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations,
surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate
Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee
as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and
demands.

The Company may also from time to time designate one or more
other offices or agencies where the Notes may be presented or
surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time
rescind such designations; provided, however, that no such designation
or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation
to maintain an office or agency in each Place of Payment for Notes for
such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the
Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the
location of any such other office or agency.

Section 1003. Money for Notes Payments to Be Held in Trust.

If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent
with respect to the Notes, it will, on or before each due date of the
principal of or any premium or interest on any of the Notes, segregate
and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum
sufficient to pay the principal and any premium and interest so becoming
due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed
of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action
or failure so to act.

Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents with
respect to the Notes, it will, prior to each due date of the principal
of or any premium or interest on any Notes, deposit with a Paying Agent
a sum sufficient to pay such amount, such sum to be held as provided by
the Trust Indenture Act, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee)
the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so
to act.

The Company will cause each Paying Agent for the Notes other
than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in
which such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the
provisions of this Section, that such Paying Agent will (i) comply with
the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applicable to it as a Paying
Agent and (ii) during the continuance of any default by the Company (or
any other obligor upon the Notes) in the making of any payment in
respect of the Notes, and upon the written request of the Trustee,
forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums held in trust by such Paying Agent
for payment in respect of the Notes.

The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose,
pay, or by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee
all sums held in trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to
be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those upon which such
sums were held by the Company or such Paying Agent; and, upon such
payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying Agent shall be
released from all further liability with respect to such money.

Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or
then held by the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of
or any premium or interest on any Note and remaining unclaimed for two
years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and
payable shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then
held by the Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder
of such Note shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look
only to the Company for payment thereof, and all liability of the
Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all
liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease;
provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being
required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the Company
cause to be published once, in a newspaper published in the English
language, customarily published on each Business Day and of general
circulation in The Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, notice that
such money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein,

any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the
Company.

chief accounting officer, stating whether or not to the best knowledge
of the signer thereof the Company is in default in the performance and
observance of any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this

done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect

however, that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such
right or franchise if the Company shall determine that the preservation
thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the
Company and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material
respect to the Holders.

Section 1006. Maintenance of Properties.

The Company will cause all properties used or useful in the
conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary to be
maintained and kept in good condition, repair and working order and
supplied with all necessary equipment and will cause to be made all
necessary repairs, renewals, replacements, betterments and improvements
thereof, all as in the judgment of the Company may be necessary so that
the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly and
advantageously conducted at all times; provided, however, that nothing
in this Section shall prevent the Company from discontinuing the
operation or maintenance of any of such properties if such
discontinuance is, in the judgment of the Company, desirable in the
conduct of its business or the business of any Subsidiary and not
disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.

Section 1007. Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.

The Company will pay or discharge or cause to be paid or

supplies which, if unpaid, might by law become a lien upon the property
of the Company or any Subsidiary; provided, however, that the Company
shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to be paid or
discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim whose amount,
applicability or validity is being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings.

other distributions in respect of its Capital Stock or pay any Debt or
other obligation owed to the Company or any other Subsidiary of the
Company; (ii) to make loans or advances to the Company or any Subsidiary

extensions, refinancings or refundings) of Debt Incurred pursuant to an

a Subsidiary of the Company, in each case as determined in good faith by

Subsidiary to make, effective provision for securing the Notes (and, if
the Company may so determine, any other Debt of the Company or of such
Subsidiary which is not subordinate to the Notes) equally and ratably
with such Debt as to such property for so long as such Debt will be so
