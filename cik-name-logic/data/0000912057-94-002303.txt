ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On June 30, 1994, Charter Medical Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of 18
psychiatric hospitals, seven chemical-dependency treatment facilities, one
residential treatment facility and one physician outpatient practice from
National Medical Enterprises, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("NME"). The Company
presently intends to use or operate the assets acquired from NME for the
purposes NME operated such assets. The purchase price for the assets was
approximately $88.7 million in cash, plus $2 million in cash for a covenant not
to complete, plus an additional amount of cash equal to the net working capital
of the facilities acquired, amounting to approximately $38.4 million. The amount
paid for the net working capital of the facilities acquired is subject to
adjustment. In addition, the Company assumed certain liabilities related to the
acquired assets. The purchase price for the facilities acquired was determined
by NME following its solicitation of bids for the facilities and arm's-length
negotiations with the Company. NME and the Company are not related to each
other.

Approximately $98.5 million of the purchase price of the facilities acquired
was financed by the Company from the proceeds of the Company's issuance on May
2, 1994, of $375 million aggregate principal amount of 11 1/4% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2004. Approximately $11.1 of the purchase price was
financed by the Company from borrowings pursuant to the Second Amended and
Restated Subsidiary Credit Agreement, dated May 2, 1994, among certain
subsidiaries of the Company, Bankers Trust Company, as Agent, First Union
National Bank of North Carolina, as Co-Agent, and the financial institutions
participating therein. The remaining approximately $19.5 million of the purchase
price was provided by cash on hand.
