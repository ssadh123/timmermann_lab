investors in Metropolitan's common and preferred stock, including
members of Mr. Sandifur's immediate family acquired 30,224 shares
of Summit's Preferred Stock Series S-1 for $100 per share in

value of approximately $3 million dollars.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED
BALANCE SHEET AND STATEMENTS OF INCOME
------------

NOTE 1:

The pro forma condensed balance sheet assumes the redemption of all of the
Company's outstanding common stock as of June 30, 1994 through the payment of
cash and the reduction of an outstanding receivable due from Metropolitan
aggregating $3,555,000. Additionally, National Summit Corp., a Delaware
corporation wholly owned by C. Paul Sandifur, Jr. will acquire 100% of the
newly issued common shares of the Company for $100,000. Contemporaneously,
various investors in Metropolitan common and preferred stock, including members
of Mr. Sandifur's immediate family, will acquire 30,224 of the Company's
preferred stock for $100 per share in exchange for preferred and common shares
of Metropolitan with a value of $3,022,425.

NOTE 2:

The pro forma condensed statements of income reflect the above described
transactions assuming they occurred at the beginning of the periods presented. 
The statements have been adjusted to reflect dividend income that would have
been received from the Metropolitan preferred stock and dividends that would
have been paid to the Company's preferred shareholders at dividend rates that
were in effect during the periods. The income tax provisions have been
adjusted assuming that dividend income received by the Company from
Metropolitan will be taxable and subject to the 70% dividends received
deduction. At various times, Metropolitan's preferred stock dividends have
been, for tax purposes, a return of capital, which would have a different tax
treatment from that presented in these statements. The pro forma condensed
statements of operations have no adjustments to eliminate intercompany
transactions previously charged by Metropolitan for services provided to the
Company. In future periods, Metropolitan may charge an additional fee for real
estate contract acquisition services provided for the Company's benefit that
has not been previously charged. Earnings per common share data has not been
presented as all of the outstanding common shares will be wholly-owned by
National Summit Corp.

NOTE 3:

The adjustments to the pro forma condensed financial statements are as
follows:

(a) Adjustments to reflect the redemption of all Company outstanding common
shares through the payment of $411,413 and the reduction of an
outstanding receivable from Metropolitan for $3,143,587.

(b) Adjustments to reflect the issuance of 30,224 shares of Company preferred
stock in exchange for preferred and common stock of Metropolitan valued
at $2,606,252 and $416,173, respectively.

(c) Adjustments to reflect the sale of 10,000 newly issued common shares
purchased by National Summit Corp. for $100,000.

(d) Adjustments to reflect dividend income from Metropolitan preferred stock
and the related income tax effect.

(e) Adjustments to reflect preferred stock dividends on the Company's newly
issued preferred stock.
