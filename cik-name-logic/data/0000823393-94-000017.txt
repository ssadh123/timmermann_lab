SHAWMUT NATIONAL CORPORATION TO ACQUIRE NORTHEAST FEDERAL
CORP. FOR $172.1 MILLION

HARTFORD, Conn. and BOSTON, Mass., June 13, 1994 -- Shawmut 
National Corporation (NYSE:SNC) today announced a 
definitive agreement to purchase the $3.6 billion-asset 
Northeast Federal Corp. (NYSE: NSB), parent of Northeast 
Savings F.A. , for $172.1 million, or $10.875 per fully 
diluted share.

Today's acquisition announcement is separate from the cash 
transaction announced February 10, 1994 in which Shawmut 
agreed to purchase 10 Northeast branches located in 
Massachusetts and Rhode Island. That earlier 10-branch 
transaction closed on Saturday, June 11.

As a result of the transaction announced today, Shawmut will 
acquire 17 offices in New York, eight offices in 
Massachusetts, and eight offices in Connecticut.

This latest transaction is structured as a tax-free merger, 
with Northeast Federal shareholders to receive .456 shares 
of Shawmut National stock for each Northeast Federal share. 
The exchange ratio of Shawmut shares will be adjusted to 
preserve a value of $10.875

per Northeast Federal share, up to a maximum exchange ratio 
of .507 and a minimum exchange ratio of .415 to reflect the 
average closing price of Shawmut stock for the 15 trading 
days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the day 
on which the last regulatory approval has been obtained and 
all statutory waiting periods have expired. The transaction 
is expected to be accounted for using purchase accounting.

Shawmut expects to close this latest transaction in the 
fourth quarter of this year.

"The acquisition of Northeast Federal gives Shawmut its 
first branches outside of New England," said Joel B. Alvord, 
chairman and chief executive officer of Shawmut National 
Corporation. "By establishing an attractive presence in New 
York, where more than half of these branches are located, 
this acquisition advances Shawmut's strategy of diversifying 
our business profile beyond New England. In the greater 
Albany market, Shawmut will have the number one or two 
market share in five of the eight towns served by Northeast. 
The acquisition is expected to be accretive to Shawmut's 
1995 earnings, making the deal attractive to both Shawmut 
and Northeast shareholders."

"We are pleased to join forces with a premier New England 
financial institution," said Kirk W. Walters, chairman, 
president, and chief executive officer of Northeast Federal 
Corp. "Our board of directors believes this transaction 
provides an excellent return to our stockholders. Our 
customers will benefit from the added convenience of 
Shawmut's substantial retail network and broad product 
line."

The transaction does not include four California branches 
Northeast agreed to sell to Home Savings of America in 
Irwindale, California. Nor does the transaction include the 
sale of a single Cape Cod branch Northeast agreed to sell to 
Sandwich Cooperative several months ago.

The agreement is subject to the approval of Northeast 
shareholders and to the approval of regulatory agencies.

With assets of $30 billion, Shawmut National Corporation is 
a superregional bank holding company with a franchise of 
over 300 branches and nearly 500 ATMs in four New England 
states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and 
Rhode Island. It is a leading provider of financial 
services to consumers and small- to medium-sized businesses. 
It also

provides financial services to corporate customers, 
correspondent banks, and government units throughout New 
England and in select national markets.

Northeast Federal Corp., with approximately $3.6 billion in 
assets, $2.5 billion in deposits, and $1.0 billion in loans, 
is one of the largest thrifts in New England.
