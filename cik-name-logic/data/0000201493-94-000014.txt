herein shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Registration Rights
Agreement.

Reference is also made to the distribution in kind by MSLEF of
14,898,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $.01 per share ("Common Stock"),

Stanley Leveraged Equity Holdings, Inc., Morgan
Stanley Equity Investors Inc., First Plaza, Leeway and
the Individual Shareholders";

(d) The phrase "Upon the written request of the

prior to June 6, 1996, of the Holders";

(e) Section 4.1(d) is amended in its entirety to read
as follows:

"(d) Expenses. The Holders (other than Individual
Shareholders) of Registrable Securities included in any
registration that is requested pursuant to Section 4.1 and

such Holders based on the number of Registrable Securities
of such Holders included in such registration) a portion of

Percentage" means 62.4%, with respect to any registration
requested pursuant to Section 4.1 prior to June 6, 1995, and

Section 4.1 thereafter. The Company shall pay all
Registration Expenses in connection with any such
registration, other than the portion of the Registration
Expenses required to be paid by the Holders as set forth
above. In connection with a registration that shall not
have become effective due to a revocation by the Holders
requesting such registration under this Section 4.1, the
obligation to pay the Registration Expenses in connection
with such revoked registration shall be due and payable (on
a pro rata basis) by the Holders who initially requested and
revoked such registration. Each Holder shall pay all
underwriting discounts and commissions and transfer taxes,
if any, relating to the sale or disposition of such Holder's
Registrable Securities pursuant to a registration statement
