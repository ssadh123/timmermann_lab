FCC Sets Aside TDS's Cellular License
in Wisconsin RSA Number 8 Pending Result of Hearing

February 4, 1994, Chicago, Illinois -- In a Memorandum Opinion
and Order and Hearing Designation Order issued by the Federal
Communications Commission ("FCC") on February 1, 1994, the FCC
ordered a hearing to determine whether in a proceeding
involving the application of La Star Cellular Telephone
Company for an initial cellular license in a portion of the
New Orleans Metropolitan Statistical Area, Telephone and Data
Systems Inc.'s ("TDS's") 85.1%-owned subsidiary, United States
Cellular Corporation, misrepresented facts to, lacked candor
in its dealings with, or attempted to mislead the FCC. The
hearing will also determine, based on the evidence presented
under that issue, whether TDS possesses the requisite
character qualifications to retain its cellular license for
the Wisconsin Rural Service Area ("RSA") Number 8. TDS was
granted interim authority to continue to operate the Wisconsin
8 cellular system pending completion of the hearing. In the
event of an adverse finding, a monetary forfeiture is a
possible alternative. The Company's policy is not to discuss
pending litigation matters. The Company stated it is
confident that it will prevail in the forthcoming hearing and
will dispel any doubts the FCC may have as to these issues.

TDS is a Chicago-based telecommunications company with
established local telephone, cellular telephone and radio
paging operations. TDS strives to build value for its
shareholders by providing excellent communications services in
attractive, closely related segments of the telecommunications
industry. For additional information, please call Murray L.
