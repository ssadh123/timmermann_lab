KREG COMPLETES $36.5 MILLION IN FINANCINGS

NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. -- Koll Real Estate Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: KREG)
announced that it recently completed two previously announced financings with
major financial institutions which will provide KREG with an aggregate of up to
$36.5 million over the next two years. Both credit facilities mature in
December 1996, with optional extensions to December 1997, subject to certain
conditions.

Management explained that one of the financings provides up to $25 million
for the posting of an appeal bond, or payment of any final judgment or
settlement in excess of $7.5 million which would be funded by KREG, related to
the $20.8 million decision, plus prejudgment interest and attorney's fees,
issued against KREG on December 22, 1994 by the Delaware Chancery Court in
connection with a previously announced lawsuit filed by Wheelabrator
Technologies Inc. and Abex Inc. involving amounts claimed to be owed under
various tax sharing agreements. This credit facility also provides a $5 million
construction loan for the Company's Eagle Crest residential project in
Escondido, California. The construction loan component provides KREG the ability
to reborrow $5 million after repayment, subject to certain restrictions. The
Eagle Crest project is approved for 580 homes surrounding an 18-hole
championship golf course which opened in May 1993. KREG plans to utilize the $5
million construction loan, along with available cash, to fund completion of
infrastructure construction at Eagle Crest in anticipation of selling
residential lots to

homebuilders in 1995.

The second credit facility provides KREG with up to a $6.5 million
construction loan for its Wentworth By The Sea project on the coastline of New
Hampshire. The Wentworth project is approved for 150 homes adjacent to a 170-
slip marina and a nearby 18-hole golf course which the Company sold in September
1994. KREG plans to utilize this construction loan to fund completion of
infrastructure improvements and construction of homes. This credit facility
includes a $3.0 million revolver for the construction of homes at Wentworth By
The Sea.

KREG provides commercial and residential real estate development services
nationwide. It holds a large residential land inventory in Southern California
and on the New Hampshire coastline, including the Bolsa Chica property located
on the Pacific Coast adjacent to Huntington Beach, California, which recently
received County approval, and owns Kathryn G. Thompson Company, a prominent
Southern California homebuilder.
