Liberty Reports 9.5% Increase in Net Income

LOUISVILLE, Ky.--Liberty National Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ:LNBC)
announced today net income of $28.7 million for the first six
months of 1994, a 9.5% increase over the $26.2 million reported for
the same period in 1993. Net income per share for the first half
of 1994 increased 7.7% to $1.12, compared to $1.04 for the same
period in 1993. Excluding the after-tax effect of securities gains
and expenses relating to the pending merger with BANC ONE
CORPORATION from both periods, net income would have been up 14.3%
for the first six months of 1994.
For the second quarter of 1994, net income was $14.6 million,
up 8.4% compared to $13.5 million for the same period in 1993. Net
income per share for the second quarter of 1994 increased 7.5% to
$0.57, from $0.53 in the second quarter of 1993.
Liberty's Board of Directors also declared a cash dividend of
$0.195 per share, payable September 30, 1994, to all shareholders
of record at the close of business on September 15, 1994.
In November 1993, Liberty announced its plans to join BANC ONE
CORPORATION, a regional bank holding company based in Columbus,
Ohio. The merger, which has received all the required regulatory
approvals, is subject to Liberty shareholder approval. A meeting of
shareholders to vote on the proposed merger is scheduled for August
3, 1994. Assuming shareholder approval, the merger is expected to
be completed by the first week of September 1994. The pending
merger agreement with BANC ONE CORPORATION provides that the
dividend (referenced above) will not be paid if the merger is
completed on or before the record date for BANC ONE's quarterly
dividend to be declared during the third quarter of 1994; if that
occurs, Liberty shareholders would be shareholders of record of
BANC ONE CORPORATION and would instead receive the BANC ONE
CORPORATION dividend.
"Our second quarter earnings reflect a continued positive
trend fueled in particular by increased loan demand, " said Malcolm
B. Chancey, Jr., Liberty Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.
As of June 30, 1994, Liberty's total assets were $5.3 billion
and stockholders' equity exceeded $417 million. Averages for
selected balance sheet totals for the six months ended June 30,
1994, and the percentage increases compared to the same period in
1993, were as follows: total assets, $5.0 billion, up 7.9%; total
deposits, $4.0 billion, up 6.5%; loans, $3.7 billion, up 11.7%; and
stockholders' equity, $406 million, up 10.9%.
Liberty is a regional bank holding company headquartered in
Louisville, Kentucky. Liberty conducts a wide range of commercial
and personal banking activities through its 104 banking offices
located throughout Kentucky and southern Indiana. In addition,
Liberty provides leasing, credit life insurance, brokerage services
and retail loan services through various non-banking subsidiaries.
