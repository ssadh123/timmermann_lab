The fiscal year end for Union Bancshares, Inc. (UBI) falls on
December 31 and First Community's occurred on September 30. 
Because First Community's fiscal year end falls within 93 days of
UBI's no adjustments were made to First Community's statements of
income to conform them to UBI's fiscal year end statements. Based
upon this information, the following pro forma condensed combined
balance sheet as of March 31, 1994, and the pro forma condensed
consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31,
1993 for UBI and September 30, 1993 for First Community and the
three months ended March 31, 1994 for UBI and December 31, 1993 for
First Community, give effect to the acquisition of First Community
by UBI.

The pro forma statements have been prepared by UBI's
management based upon the financial statements of First Community
included elsewhere herein. These pro forma statements may not be
indicative of the results that actually would have occurred if the
combination had been in effect on the dates indicated or which may
be obtained in the future. The pro forma financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements
and notes of UBI and First Community.

Independent Accountants' Report

Board of Directors
First Community Federal Savings and Loan Association
Winfield, Kansas

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of
income, stockholders' equity and cash flows of FIRST COMMUNITY
FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION for the year ended September
30, 1991. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Association's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the 1991 consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
results of operations and cash flows of FIRST COMMUNITY FEDERAL
SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION for the year ended September 30, 1991
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

FIRST COMMUNITY FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

September 30, 1993, 1992 and 1991

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
(a) Principles of Consolidation
First Community Federal Savings and Loan Association (the
Association) is a federally-chartered stock savings and
loan association. The consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of the Association and First Financial
Services, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary). All
significant intercompany transactions and balances have
been eliminated in consolidation.

(b) Investment Securities and Mortgage-Backed Securities
Investments in investment securities and mortgage-backed
securities intended to be held to maturity are carried at
amortized cost. Premiums and discounts on investment
securities and mortgage-backed securities are amortized to
income over the term of the security using a method that
approximates the interest method.

In determining whether securities can be held until
maturity, management considers whether there are
conditions, such as liquidity or regulatory requirements
which would impair its ability to hold such securities
until maturity. Based on the Association's current
financial condition, management intends to and believes
that it has the ability to hold the investments and
mortgage-backed securities until maturity.

(c) Marketable Equity Securities
Marketable equity securities are carried at the lower of
aggregate cost or market. In the event carrying amount is
reduced below cost, a valuation account is established by
a charge to equity representing the net unrealized loss.

(d) Mortgage Loans Held for Sale
Mortgage loans held for sale are valued at the lower of
cost or market as determined by outstanding commitments
from investors or current investor yield requirements
calculated on a loan-by-loan basis.

(e) Loan Origination and Commitment Fees
The Association follows Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 91 ("SFAS 91") whereby loan origination fees
and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred and
recognized over the lives of the related loans as an
adjustment of the loans' yield using the interest method on
a loan-by-loan basis. The net deferred fees or costs
relating to loans held for sale are recognized as a
component of the gain (loss) on sale of loans when the
loans are sold.

(e) Loan Origination and Commitment Fees, Continued
Under SFAS 91, commitment fees received in connection with
the purchase of loans are deferred and recognized over the
lives of the resulting loans as an adjustment of yield, or
if the commitment expires unexercised, recognized in income
upon expiration of the commitment.

(f) Real Estate Owned and in Judgment
Real estate owned and in judgment includes real estate
acquired by foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure,
properties in the process of foreclosure subject to the
statutory redemption period (in judgment) and properties
classified as in substance foreclosures. Real estate owned
is recorded at the lower of cost or estimated fair value at
the date the property is classified as real estate owned. 
Provisions for loss are recorded if, subsequent to the date
of acquisition, the estimated fair value less selling costs
(estimated net realizable value in 1992 and 1991) of the
property is less than its recorded value. The effect on
the consolidated financial statements of changing in 1993
from utilizing net realizable value to fair value less
selling costs for determining provision for loss on real
estate owned was not material.

(g) Depreciation
Depreciation on premises and equipment is provided using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of
the related assets.

(h) Income Taxes
In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
Accounting For Income Taxes (SFAS 109). SFAS 109 requires
a change from the deferred method of accounting for income
taxes of APB Opinion 11 to the asset and liability method
of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and
liability method of SFAS 109, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future income tax
consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. Under SFAS 109, the effect on deferred tax assets
and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date.

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued
(h) Income Taxes, Continued
Effective October 1, 1992, the Association adopted SFAS 109
and has reported the cumulative effect of that change in
the method of accounting for income taxes in the 1993
consolidated statement of operations.

Pursuant to the deferred method under APB 11, which was
applied in 1992 and prior years, deferred income taxes are
recognized for income and expense items that are reported
in different years for financial reporting purposes and
income tax purposes using the tax rate applicable for the
year of the calculation. Under the deferred method,
deferred taxes are not adjusted for subsequent changes in
tax rates.

(i) Deferred Premium on Sales of Loans and Loan Servicing Fees
The Association sells loans with servicing retained. At
the time of the sale, an evaluation is made of the
contractual servicing fee which is represented by the
differential between the contractual interest rate of the
loan and the interest rate payable to the investor. The
present value of the amount by which the contractual
servicing fee exceeds or is less than a normal servicing
fee, after evaluation of estimated prepayments on such
loans, is considered to be an adjustment of the sales
proceeds which in turn increases or reduces the gain or
loss recognized at the time of sale. The resultant amount
of deferred premiums is recorded in the consolidated
balance sheet as other assets and is amortized using the
interest method over the estimated remaining lives of such
loans. The contractual servicing fee is recognized as
income over the lives of the related loans, net of the
estimated normal amortization of the deferred premium on
sales of loans which was the projected amortization
inherent in the original present value calculation. Loan
servicing costs are charged to expense as incurred. When
actual loan repayment experience exceeds original
estimates, supplemental amortization is charged to
operations so that the original rate of return will be
provided over the estimated lives of the remaining loans as
revised.

(j) Allowance for Delinquent Interest
The Association provides an allowance for accrued interest
receivable when the collection of such interest is not
reasonably assured. The allowance is netted against
accrued interest receivable for financial statement
purposes.

(k) Provision for Loan Losses
Provisions for estimated losses are charged to operations
to maintain an allowance for losses which is available to
absorb future loan losses. The allowance is charged and
loans are reduced by a corresponding amount at the time the
Association determines that a portion of a loan will be
uncollectible. Losses arising from writing down property
acquired from foreclosures or in substance foreclosures to
estimated fair value are also charged to the allowance for
losses.

In determining the adequacy of the allowance for losses on
loans management considers, among other things, the
Association's historical loss experience, delinquency
levels and its assessment of the risk in the loan portfolio
based upon its internal loan review procedures.

While management uses available information to recognize
losses on loans, future additions to the allowance may be
necessary based on changes in economic conditions. The
Association is subject to the regulations of certain
Federal agencies and undergoes periodic examinations by
those regulatory authorities. As an integral part of those
examinations, the various regulatory agencies periodically
review the Association's allowances for losses on loans. 
Such agencies may require the Association to recognize
additions to the allowance based on their judgments about
information available to them at the time of their
examination.

(l) Gain on Sale of Loans
Gains or losses on sales of mortgage loans are recognized
at the time of settlement.

(m) Financial Options and Hedging Activities
In 1991 and certain prior years, the Association was
involved in the hedging of certain of its investment
securities, mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities
for the purpose of reducing its exposure to the risk of
changes in interest rates.

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Continued
(m) Financial Options and Hedging Activities, Continued
Gains and losses from financial futures transactions that
qualified as effective hedges were deferred and capitalized
as a component of the hedged asset or liability. These
gains and losses are amortized over the remaining
contractual life of the hedged asset or liability using a
method that approximates the interest method as an
adjustment to the related interest income or expense.

Deferred gains totaled $7,718 and $19,221 at September 30,
1993 and 1992, respectively. Deferred losses totaled
$100,729 and $131,179 at September 30, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

(n) Income Per Share
Income per share has been computed by dividing the net
income for the year by the weighted average number of
shares of common stock and, except where anti-dilutive,
common stock equivalents outstanding during the year. The
weighted average number of common stock and common stock
equivalents were 333,872; 333,872 and 326,619 for the years
ended September 30, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. 
Outstanding employee stock options are common stock
equivalents.

(o) Statements of Cash Flows
For purposes of the statements of cash flows, cash
equivalents include cash on hand, withdrawable cash on
deposit in other institutions and interest-bearing deposits
in other financial institutions with an original maturity
of less than ninety days.

During 1993, 1992 and 1991, the Association paid cash for
interest expense of $7,997,855; $10,186,109 and
$13,030,476, respectively. During 1993, 1992 and 1991, the
Association made income tax payments of $455,813; $402,376
and $237,979, respectively.

Noncash investing activities included the following for the
years ended September 30, 1993, 1992 and 1991:

The Association has issued mortgaged-backed securities
guaranteed by GNMA under the provisions of the National
Housing Act. At September 30, 1993 and 1992, the principal
amount of these securities outstanding was approximately
$4,908,000 and $5,217,000, respectively, which also represents
the approximate principal amount of the related mortgages that
serve as collateral for the securities that are being serviced
under this program.

Loans to directors, executive officers and principal holders
of equity securities totaled $729,527 and $709,987 at
September 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively. Management
believes that such loans are made in the ordinary course of
business with normal credit terms including interest rate and
collateral and do not represent more than a normal risk of
collection. An analysis of loans to officers, directors and
principal stockholders is as follows:

amount of $15,500,000 which expires in September 1994. The
amount borrowed under this line of credit at September 30,
1993 was $4,400,000 which bears interest at the FHLB daily
rate (3.48% at September 30, 1993).

(9) Short-Term Borrowings
The Association periodically enters into sales of securities
under agreements to repurchase (reverse repurchase
agreements). Fixed-coupon reverse repurchase agreements are
treated as financings, and the obligations to repurchase
securities sold are reflected as a liability in the
consolidated balance sheet. The dollar amount of securities
underlying the agreements remains in the asset accounts. 
There were no such borrowings outstanding at or during the
years ended September 30, 1993 or 1992.

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase averaged
$5,499,310 for the year ended September 30, 1991. The maximum
amounts outstanding at any month-end was $17,901,598 during
the year ended September 30, 1991.

(10) Income Taxes
As discussed in note 1(h), the Association adopted SFAS 109 as
of October 1, 1992. The cumulative effect of this change in
accounting for income taxes of $125,000 is determined as of
October 1, 1992 and is reported separately in the consolidated
statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 1993.

(11) Pension Plan
The Association has a defined benefit pension plan covering
substantially all of its employees. The benefits are based on
years of service and the employee's highest average
compensation received for five consecutive years. The
Association's funding policy is to contribute annually the
maximum amount that can be deducted for federal income tax
purposes.

(11) Pension Plan, Continued
The weighted-average discount rates used in determining the
actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation
were 7.5% and 8.0%, respectively, in 1993 and 1992. The rate
of increase in future compensation levels was 5.0% in 1993 and
1992. The expected long-term rate of return on assets in 1993
and 1992 was 8%.

(12) Employee Stock Ownership Trust
In 1989, the Association established an Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (ESOP) covering substantially all employees. 
It is anticipated that a major portion of the plan assets will
be invested in common stock of the Association. The ESOP is
to be funded by contributions made by the Association in cash
or common stock which will be determined annually by the Board
of Directors. The ESOP may also borrow funds from a third
party to finance the purchase of stock of the Association.

Shares purchased with such proceeds will be held in a suspense
account for allocation among members as the loan is paid. 
Contributions to the ESOP and shares released from the
suspense account will be allocated among participants on the
basis of compensation in the year of allocation. Benefits
become 100% vested after five years of credited service. 
Forfeitures will be reallocated among remaining participating
employees. Benefits are payable upon retirement, early
retirement, disability or separation from service. 
Distributions may be paid in shares of common stock or in
cash.

The ESOP Trustee must vote all allocated shares held in the
ESOP in accordance with the instructions of the participating
employees. Unallocated shares and shares held in the suspense
account will be voted pro rata based on the shares voted by
the participating employees.

The Association contributed $14,600 to the ESOP in fiscal year
1993 of which $7,845 was distributed to retiring and
terminating employees. No contributions were made during
fiscal 1992 or 1991. During fiscal 1992, the Association had
to fund $5,943 to the ESOP to cover the deficit in cash
incurred upon payment of distributions to retiring and
terminating employees. As of September 30, 1993, the ESOP had
not incurred any indebtedness. As of September 30, 1993, 1992
and 1991, the ESOP owned 5,650, 5,400 and 3,400 shares,
respectively, of the Association's common stock.

(13) Deferred Compensation Payable
During fiscal years 1991 and 1989, the Association entered
into deferred compensation agreements for the benefit of
senior executive officers and directors. One additional
deferred compensation agreement was entered into during 1992. 
Additional cash value in insurance policies were purchased
totaling $-0-, $440,100 and $367,000 during the years ended
September 30, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. Benefits are
partially vested for executives at early retirement age and
fully vested for executives and directors at normal retirement
age. Compensation expense in an amount necessary to accrue
the present value of the deferred compensation liability,
calculated on the interest method, began in fiscal 1991 (see
note 19). The deferred compensation expense accrued was
$45,264, $43,923 and $20,091 for the years ended September 30,
1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

During the year ended September 30, 1991, Chairman of the
Board, Kenneth Brown, passed away. Mr. Brown was covered by
deferred compensation agreements. The present value of the
death benefit, which is recorded in accounts payable and
accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet, was $855,873 (balance of $767,974 at September 30,
1993) and is payable in 180 monthly installments at an 8%
discount rate beginning February 15, 1991, to his named
beneficiary. The Association had purchased life insurance to
fund this death benefit. Life insurance proceeds of
$1,662,315 were received by the Association. Of this amount
$757,376 was policy cash surrender value resulting in a net
gain from policy proceeds of $904,939. During the year ended
September 30, 1991, two other policies were cashed by the
Association resulting in an additional gain of $18,355.

(14) Stock Option Plan
In connection with the conversion of the Association from
mutual to stock form, the Board of Directors adopted a Stock
Option and Incentive Plan. Options granted under the plan
expire five years from the date of grant for any employee who
owns stock representing more than 10% of the common stock
outstanding at the time the option is granted. For all other
options, the expiration date is ten years from the date of the
grant.

(14) Stock Option Plan, Continued
Options for 64,201 shares have been approved by the Board of
Directors, of which 50,000 shares have been granted and 14,201
shares remain available at September 30, 1993. Of the options
to acquire 42,500 shares outstanding at September 30, 1993,
20,300 of the options are at a price per share of $8 and
22,200 of the options are at a price per share of $10. Option
prices were set by the Board of Directors at estimated fair
market value as of the date of grant. Changes in stock
options are shown below:

At September 30, 1993, all of the above options were
exercisable (see note 19).

(15) Stockholders' Equity
As a result of the Association meeting certain definitional
tests under the Internal Revenue Code, at September 30, 1993,
the Association had accumulated income of approximately
$3,100,000 for which no provision for Federal income tax has
been made. Such amount represents an allocation of income to
bad debt deduction for tax purposes only. Reduction of the
amount so allocated for purposes other than bad debt losses,
including a dividend distribution or a distribution in
liquidation, will create income for tax purposes which will be
subject to the then current corporate income tax rate.

In 1983, the Association completed the sale of 322,012 shares
of common stock pursuant to a Plan of Conversion to convert
the Association to a federally-chartered capital stock
association. In the event of a complete liquidation (and only
in such an event) depositors who continued to maintain their
deposits since the conversion will be entitled to receive a
liquidation distribution before such distribution may be made
to the stockholders.

(16) Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
(FDICIA) and Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and
Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA)
FDICIA was signed into law on December 19, 1991. Regulations
implementing the prompt corrective action provisions of FDICIA
became effective on December 19, 1992. In addition to the
prompt corrective action requirements, FDICIA includes
significant changes to the legal and regulatory environment
for insured depository institutions, including reductions in
insurance coverage for certain kinds of deposits, increased
supervision by the federal regulatory agencies, increased
reporting requirements for insured institutions, and new
regulations concerning internal controls, accounting and
operations.

The prompt corrective action regulations define specific
capital categories based on an institution's capital ratios. 
The capital categories, in declining order, are "well
capitalized," "adequately capitalized," "undercapitalized,"
"significantly undercapitalized," and "critically
undercapitalized." Institutions categorized as
"undercapitalized" or worse are subject to certain
restrictions, including the requirement to file a capital plan
with their primary federal regulator, prohibitions on the
payment of dividends and management fees, restrictions on
executive compensation, and increased supervisory monitoring,
among other things. Other restrictions may be imposed on the
institution either by its primary federal regulator or by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), including
requirements to raise additional capital, sell assets, or sell
the entire institution. Once an institution becomes
"critically undercapitalized" it must generally be placed in
receivership or conservatorship within 90 days.

FIRREA was signed into law on August 9, 1989; regulations for
savings institutions' minimum capital requirements went into
effect on December 7, 1989. In addition to its capital
requirements, FIRREA includes provisions for changes in the
Federal regulatory structure for institutions including a new
deposit insurance system, increased deposit insurance premiums
and restricted investment activities with respect to
noninvestment grade corporate debt and certain other
investments. FIRREA also increases the required ratio of
housing related assets in order to qualify as a savings
institution.

The regulations require institutions to have a minimum
regulatory tangible capital equal to 1.5% of adjusted total
assets, a minimum 4% core/leverage capital ratio, a minimum 4%
tier 1 risk-based ratio and a minimum 8% total risk-based
capital ratio to be considered "adequately capitalized."

An institution is deemed to be "critically undercapitalized"
if it has a tangible equity ratio of 2% or less.

At September 30, 1993, the Association's tangible capital
ratio was 6.4%, tangible equity ratio was 6.4%, core/leverage
ratio was 6.4%, tier 1 risk-based ratio was 17.0% and total

(17) Financial Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk
The Association is a party to financial instruments with
off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to
meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial
instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby
letters of credit and lines of credit. These instruments
involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess
of the amount recognized in the balance sheet.

The Association had outstanding commitments to originate
mortgage loans aggregating approximately $1,969,000 at
September 30, 1993. All of these commitments were for fixed
rate mortgages with interest rates ranging from 6.125% to
7.625%. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend
to a customer as long as there is no violation of any
condition established in the contract. Commitments generally
have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses. 
Since some of the commitments may expire without being drawn
upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent future cash requirements.

At September 30, 1993, the Association had two outstanding
letters of credit amounting to $10,000. Letters of credit are
conditional commitments issued by the Association to guarantee
the performance of a customer to a third party. The credit
risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the
same as that involved in extending loan facilities to
customers.

At September 30, 1993, the Association had granted unused
lines of credit to borrowers aggregating approximately
$282,000 for commercial lines and $443,000 for open-end
consumer lines. Lines of credit are agreements to lend to a
customer as long as there is no violation of any condition
established in the contract. Lines of credit generally have
fixed expiration dates. Since a portion of the line may
expire without being drawn upon, the total unused lines do not
necessarily represent future cash requirements. The
Association evaluates each customer's credit worthiness on a
case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if
deemed necessary by the Association upon extension of credit,
is based on management's credit evaluation of the counter
party. Collateral held varies but may include accounts
receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment,
commercial real estate and residential real estate. The
Association uses the same credit policies in granting lines of
credit as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.
<PAGE>

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(17) Financial Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk, Continued
The Association had outstanding commitments to sell fixed rate
mortgages aggregating approximately $2,183,000 at September
30, 1993. These commitments relate to mortgage loans held for
sale or mortgage loans to be originated and sold and have been
considered in determining the carrying value of mortgage loans
held for sale as discussed in note 1(d).

(18) Business and Credit Concentrations
The Association grants commercial, real estate and consumer
loans to customers in south central Kansas. A significant
portion of the Association's loan portfolio is secured by
single and multi-family residential real estate. Credit risk
with respect to these loans is therefore largely dependent
upon economic conditions in south central Kansas, however,
loans granted within the Association's trade area have been
granted to a wide variety of borrowers. At September 30,
1993, the Association had approximately $10.8 million of FHA
Title 1 Loans of which approximately $3,200,000 is secured by
collateral in California. Management does not believe that
any significant concentrations of credit risk exist with
respect to individual borrowers or groups of borrowers which
are engaged in similar activities that would be similarly
affected by changes in economic or other conditions.

(19) Sale of Association
In October 1993, the Association entered into an agreement
with Union Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiary Union National
Bank of Wichita (UNB) under which UNB would acquire all the
outstanding common stock of the Association. In
consideration, the Association's stockholders would receive
$35 in cash for each outstanding share of the Association's
common stock and the excess of $35 over the exercise price for
each common stock option outstanding. Consummation of the
agreement is subject to certain conditions including obtaining
regulatory approval and approval of the Association's
stockholders. The agreement specifies that the merger must be
consummated within 30 days of receipt of final regulatory
approval, but not later than July 31, 1994.

The deferred compensation agreements with the former chairman
of the board and with two senior executive officers (see note
13) contain "change in control" clauses. Under these clauses
upon a change in control (such as the above described sale),
the covered individuals will receive lump sum payments equal
to the total payment called for under such agreements adjusted
for present value using the current Federal Reserve discount
rate (approximately 3% at September 30, 1993) which is a
different discount rate than the rate used by the Association
for the normal periodic accrual of compensation under these
agreements.

(19) Sale of Association, Continued
Such amounts are payable only upon consummation of the
qualifying transaction and, accordingly, such amounts are not
recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
at September 30, 1993. If a qualifying transaction were
consummated as of September 30, 1993, additional liabilities
pertaining to the deferred compensation agreements of
approximately $625,000 (before consideration of applicable
income tax benefit) over the amounts reflected in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 1993
would be incurred.

(20) Fair Value of Financial Instruments
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107,
Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments,
requires that the Association disclose estimated fair values
for its financial instruments. The Association has made fair
value estimates for financial instruments, which includes
financial assets and liabilities and commitments to extend
credit. Fair value estimates have been made as of September
30, 1993 based on current economic conditions, risk
characteristics of the various financial instruments and other
subjective factors. Fair value estimates have not been
changed to reflect events or circumstances occurring
subsequent to September 30, 1993.

Fair value estimates are based on existing financial
instruments and do not represent an aggregate net fair value
of the Association. For example, the fair value estimates do
not include the value of depositor relationships. In
addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of
the gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair
value estimates and have not been considered in these
estimates.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate
the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which
it is practicable to estimate that value:

Cash and Cash Equivalents
The balance sheet carrying amount is a reasonable estimate
of fair value.

Loans Receivable and Mortgage Loans Held for Sale
The Association's loan portfolio has been segregated into
categories of loans with reasonably similar characteristics
in order to estimate the fair value. Mortgage loans were
divided into fixed rate and adjustable rate (treasury based
and non-treasury based), with further segmentation into
residential, residential construction and commercial loans.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
FIRST COMMUNITY FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN ASSOCIATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(20) Fair Value of Financial Instruments, Continued
Loans Receivable and Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, Continued
The fair value estimate of loans was calculated by the
discounted cash flow method. Monthly interest and principal
cash flows adjusted for estimates of prepayments were
discounted by a rate which approximates loan rates offered
by the Association on new loans of the same type, credit
quality and maturity or in combination with secondary
mortgage market rates for similar types of loans. The
effect of non-performing loans on the fair value estimate
was determined to be insignificant.

Adjustable rate loans were evaluated based on adjustment
characteristics of repricing period, margin, period caps and
lifetime caps. The fair value of adjustable rate loans in
excess of carrying value is due to the lag in repricing.

Fixed rate mortgage and consumer loans were evaluated based
on the factors of weighted average maturity, weighted
average balloon date, weighted average rate, government
guarantee or insurance.

Mortgage-Backed Securities
Fair value of mortgage-backed securities is based on quoted
market prices.

Investment Securities
Fair value of investment securities is based on quoted
market price. For stock in FHLB, the balance sheet carrying
amount is a reasonable estimate of the fair value based on
book value per share being equal to current redemption
price.

Accrued Interest Receivable
The balance sheet carrying amount is a reasonable estimate
of the fair value.

Deposits
The estimated fair value of non-interest-bearing deposits,
NOW accounts, passbook deposits and money market accounts is
the amount payable on demand as of September 30, 1993. The
estimated fair value of monthly variable rate certificates
of deposit is the balance sheet carrying amount. The
estimated fair values of fixed-rate certificates of deposit
are based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows
with the discount rate approximating the September 30, 1993
rate offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.

Advances from FHLB
The estimated fair value of variable rate FHLB advances is
the balance sheet carrying amount. The estimated fair value
of fixed rate advances has been determined using rates
currently available to the Association for debt with similar
terms and remaining maturities.

Accrued Interest Payable
The estimated fair value of accrued interest payable is the
balance sheet carrying amount.

Deferred Compensation
The estimated fair value of deferred compensation was
calculated by the discounted cash flow method using a
discount rate that approximates current interest rates on
obligations with similar maturities.

Commitments to Extend Credit
The estimated fair value of commitments to extend credit,
letters of credit and lines of credit were based on fees
currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking
into account the remaining terms of the agreement and the
counterparties' credit standings. The carrying value and
related fair value of such agreements is nominal.

The carrying value and estimated fair value of the
Association's financial instruments are as follows:

Description of Transaction

On April 4, 1994, First Community Federal Savings and Loan
Association (First Community) of Winfield, Kansas, was merged into
Union National Bank of Wichita (UNB) in accordance with the merger
agreement between Union Bancshares, Inc. (UBI), UNB and First
Community dated October 13, 1993. Under the merger agreement, each
outstanding share of First Community common stock was converted
into $35.00 in cash. Stock options of First Community were
converted into $35.00 in cash less the strike price of the options.

The total cost of the transaction was $12,646,520. The
purchase price was determined by assessing the worth in dollars of
the ongoing income stream generation from First Community, taking
into consideration market value of assets and liabilities. The
transaction, which will be accounted for as a purchase, was
financed with a $7,000,000 loan from Harris Bank and Trust in
Chicago and the remaining $5,646,520 from internal funds. The
merger passed all regulatory approvals and the approval of First
Community shareholders.

First Community was a savings and loan institution with total
assets as of April 4, 1994 of $148,000,000, and offered full
service banking from three branches. These facilities are located
one each in Winfield, Arkansas City and Derby, Kansas. All three
of these offices were part of the merger and will be ran as
branches of UNB.
