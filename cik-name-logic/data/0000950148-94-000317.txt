FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE NEWS RELEASE

LITTON COMPLETES DEFEASANCE OF
$436 MILLION IN SUBORDINATED NOTES

BEVERLY HILLS, CA, July 11 -- Litton Industries, Inc. today announced
that it has effected an in-substance defeasance, as of July 11, 1994, of the
entire issue of $436 million principal of 12-5/8% Subordinated Debentures due
July 1, 2005. The company has deposited U.S. Government Obligations in an
irrevocable trust with The Bank of New York in an amount sufficient to provide
for the redemption of the subordinated debentures on July 1, 1995, according to
their terms, at 104.20% of their principal amount, plus accrued interest. As a
result of the defeasance, Litton will recognize an extraordinary charge on debt
redemption of approximately $31 million, net of taxes in the fiscal quarter
ending July 31, 1994.

John M. Leonis, president and chief executive officer of Litton, said,
"The extinguishment of this debt will remove a significant amount of net
interest costs from our fiscal 1995 financial results, a savings that otherwise
would not have been achieved until fiscal 1996 under the terms of the
debentures. We do not expect the debt defeasance to hinder our participation
through acquisitions in the consolidation of the defense industry."

Litton is a leader in worldwide technology markets for advanced electronic
and defense systems and a major designer and builder of surface combat ships
for the U.S. Navy and allied nations.
