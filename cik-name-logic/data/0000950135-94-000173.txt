REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of UST Corp.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of UST Corp.
(a Massachusetts corporation) and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992,
and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders'
investment and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1993. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
consolidated financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of UST Corp.
and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their
operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As explained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes and investments by
adopting Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes" and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," effective
January 1, 1993 and December 31, 1993, respectively.

UST CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1993

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting and reporting policies of UST Corp. and Subsidiaries conform
with generally accepted accounting principles and general practice in the
banking industry. The significant policies are summarized below.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. The parent company only financial statements
contained in Note 17 reflect investments in Subsidiaries using the equity method
of accounting.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year balances to conform
with the current year presentation. Assets owned by others held in a fiduciary
or agency capacity are not included in the consolidated balance sheets.

SECURITIES

On December 31, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 115 (SFAS 115), "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities." This statement addresses the accounting and reporting for
investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and
for all investments in debt securities. Under this statement securities are
classified as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading. Debt securities
which management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are
classified as held-to-maturity, and are carried at cost adjusted for the
amortization of premium or the accretion of discount. At December 31, 1993 the
Company had no securities classified as held-to-maturity.

Debt and equity securities with readily determinable market values that are
bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are
classified as trading securities and are carried at fair value, with unrealized
gains and losses included in current earnings. At December 31, 1993 and 1992,
the Company had no securities classified as trading.

Debt and equity securities not classified as either held-to-maturity or
trading are classified as available-for-sale and carried at fair value, with
unrealized after-tax gains and losses reported as a separate component of
stockholders' investment. The cumulative effect of adopting SFAS 115 was
$5,749,000 before reduction for the income tax effect of $2,414,000.

Prior to December 31, 1993, debt securities were designated at the time
they were purchased as either held-for-sale or held to maturity, based on
management intent at the time. Securities which management had the ability and
intent to hold on a long-term basis or until maturity were classified as
investment portfolio. Securities which were to be held for indefinite periods of
time and not intended to be held to maturity or on a long-term basis were
classified as securities held for sale and carried at the lower of aggregate
cost or market value.

Prior to the adoption of FASB 115 trading account securities were valued at
market.

For mortgage-backed securities, the Company recalculates the effective
yield on the investment to reflect the actual prepayment results and anticipated
future payments. The net investment in these securities is adjusted to the
amount that would have existed had the new estimated average life and effective
yield been applied since the acquisition of the securities. Such adjustments are
charged or credited to interest income in the current period.

UST CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

The Company determined the securities sold by the specific identification
method. The amount of taxes paid on gains is dependent upon the overall results
of operations of the subsidiary incurring the gain.

PREMISES, FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT

Premises, furniture and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. The Company provides for depreciation using the
straight-line method by charges to expense in amounts estimated to amortize the
cost over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Buildings and building improvements........................ 10-40 years
Furniture and equipment.................................... 3-10 years
</TABLE>

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease agreements.

LOAN INCOME AND FEES

Certain installment loans and commercial time loans are made on a
discounted basis. The unearned discount applicable to such installment loans is
taken into income monthly by use of the actuarial method. Interest income on
nondiscounted loans is accrued based on the principal amount of loans
outstanding.

Loans are placed on nonaccrual, with the reversal of all accrued interest
receivable, when there is doubt as to the collectibility of interest or
principal or if loans are 90 days or more past due unless they are both well
secured and in the process of collection. In every case, a loan reaching 180
days past due is placed on nonaccrual. Interest received on nonaccrual loans is
applied to principal if collection of principal is doubtful; otherwise, it is
reflected in interest income on a cash basis.

In May 1993, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 114 (SFAS No. 114), "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan,"
which is to become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994.
SFAS No. 114 addresses the accounting by creditors for impairment of certain
loans by requiring that the carrying value of impaired loans, as defined, be
measured based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted
at the loan's effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the
loan is collateral dependent. Management is currently evaluating the effect that
this new standard will have on the Company's reported consolidated financial
position and results of operations.

RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES

The reserve for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate by
management to provide for possible losses from loans, leases and commitments to
extend credit. Adequacy of the reserve is determined by management using a
consistent methodology which analyzes the size and risk of the loan portfolio on
a monthly basis. Factors in this analysis include past loan loss experience and
asset quality, as reflected by trends of delinquent, nonaccrual and restructured
loans and the Company's credit risk rating profile. Consideration is also given
to the current and expected economic conditions and, in particular, how such
conditions affect the types of credits in the portfolio and the market area in
general. The reserve is based on estimates, and ultimate losses may vary from
current estimates. These estimates are reviewed periodically and, as adjustments
become necessary, they are reported in earnings in the current period.

OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED

Other real estate owned includes both actual and in-substance
repossessions. In December 1992 the Company adopted Statement of Position No.
92-3 ("SOP 92-3") issued by the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants. This SOP states that foreclosed assets are presumed to be held for
sale. Therefore, they should be carried at the lower of cost or fair value,
minus estimated costs to sell. In 1992 the pretax charge to income resulting
from implementation was $750,000.

INCOME TAXES

The Company provides for income taxes in accordance with the comprehensive
income tax allocation method. This method recognizes the tax effects of all
income and expense transactions in each year's statement of income regardless of
the year in which the transactions are reported for tax purposes.

The Company follows the deferral method of accounting for investment tax
credits. Under the deferral method, the credit is reflected as a reduction of
tax expense ratably over the period during which the asset is depreciated for
financial reporting purposes.

FASB has issued SFAS No. 109 "Accounting for Income Taxes," a modification
of SFAS No. 96, effective January 1, 1993. While the FASB retained the existing
requirement to record deferred taxes for transactions that are reported in
different years for financial reporting and tax purposes, it revised the
computation of deferred taxes so that the amount of deferred taxes on the
balance sheet is adjusted whenever tax rates or other provisions of the income
tax law are changed. This is known as the "liability method" of providing
deferred income taxes. This change in accounting principle increased net income
$750,000 in January 1993, representing the cumulative effect of the new standard
on the balance sheet at the date of adoption.

EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE

Earnings per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares
of common stock and common stock equivalents outstanding. Common stock
equivalents consist primarily of dilutive outstanding stock options computed
under the treasury stock method. Loss per share computations do not include
antidilutive common stock equivalents.

GOODWILL

Cost of purchased businesses in excess of net assets acquired includes
amount being amortized over twenty-and forty-year periods. Amortization expense
was $122,500 in 1993, 1992 and 1991.

RETIREMENT BENEFITS

The Company's policy is to fund pension costs accrued.

In December 1990, the FASB issued SFAS No. 106, "Employer's Accounting for
Post Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." SFAS No. 106 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1992. This statement did not have any
impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

In November 1992, the FASB issued SFAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits." SFAS No. 112 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 1993. It is not expected that this statement will have any
impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS

For purpose of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents include cash
on hand, amounts due from banks and interest-bearing deposits.

(2) HOME OWNERS PURCHASE AND ASSUMPTION

On September 7, 1990, United States Trust Company ("USTC"), the Company's
principal banking subsidiary at the time, assumed approximately $2 billion in
deposits and acquired certain assets and branches located in the greater Boston
area of the former Home Owners Savings Bank F.S.B. ("Home Owners") in a
transaction with the Resolution Trust Corporation ("RTC"), an arm of the Federal
Government. The Company paid the RTC cash of $6.1 million, approximately the
amount allocated to core deposit intangible which is being amortized over seven
years. As part of the approval process, the Company agreed with the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation to restore

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

the Company's and USTC's consolidated capital ratios to the levels at which they
stood prior to the Home Owners transaction. Management developed a plan to
achieve these objectives which included putting the $513.6 million loans held
for sale back to the RTC in 1991 and continuing to reduce assets as the high
rate Home Owners certificates of deposit rolled off. This plan is complete.

(3) RESTRICTIONS ON CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS

At December 31, 1993 and 1992, cash and due from banks included $42,072,000
and $23,659,000, respectively, to satisfy the reserve requirements of the
Federal Reserve Bank.

(4) SECURITIES

Data presented for 1993 includes only securities available-for-sale. Data
presented for 1992 in this footnote includes both the investment portfolio,
consisting primarily of securities of states and municipalities, and other
equity securities, with an amortized cost of $8,122,000, and securities
held-for-sale, consisting primarily of U.S. Treasuries, mortgage-backed and

and 6%, respectively, for 1992. The expected long-term rate of return on assets
used was 9.5% and 12%, respectively, for 1993 and 1992.

The Company has a qualified profit-sharing plan covering substantially all
employees. Under the plan, up to six percent of net income before income taxes,
as defined, may be contributed to the profit-sharing trust. The Company did not
make a contribution to the profit-sharing trust in 1993, 1992 or 1991.

In January 1994, the Company added an Employee's Savings feature to the
existing Profit-Sharing Plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement
under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The revised plan was renamed
the UST Corp. Employee Savings Plan. Under the Savings Plan, participating
employees may defer a portion up to 4% of their pretax earnings not to exceed
the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limits. The Company matches 25%
of each employee's contributions up to 4% of the employee's earnings. Since the
Savings Plan started in 1994, the Company did not make a contribution in 1993.

The Company also has an employee stock ownership plan for substantially all
salaried employees. Under the plan, the Company shall contribute either a fixed
amount or a percentage of compensation of all participants as determined by the
Board of Directors.

(13) CAPITAL AND REGULATORY AGREEMENTS

On June 2, 1993 the Company sold 500,000 shares of its unregistered common
stock in a private placement for a cash price of $3,750,000. Substantially all
of the net proceeds of that placement were used to repay principal on the
Company's long-term debt. On August 12, 1993, the Company sold 2.87 million
shares of its common stock in a European offering. These shares were placed with
more than sixty institutional investors and the offering was made under
Regulation S of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Net
proceeds of this placement were approximately $21 million after expenses.

The Company and its banking subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends is
subject to certain limitations imposed by statutes of the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts and the State of Connecticut, and limitations imposed by bank and
bank holding company regulators. Massachusetts statutes restrict the amount of
dividends payable by banks to be the balance of their undivided profits, net of
any amount transferred to capital in excess of par value. In the case of
Connecticut law, the limit is undivided profits plus reserve for loan losses. In
any event, it is not likely that bank and bank holding company regulators would
allow an institution to dividend any amounts which would reduce that
institution's capital to below the minimum capital requirement in effect at that
time.

The Company and its two Massachusetts-based banking subsidiaries, United
States Trust Company ("USTC") and USTrust, have signed written agreements with
the FRB, FDIC and the Banking Commis-

19

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

sioner of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts ("Massachusetts Commissioner"). In
accordance with the agreements the Company has agreed not to pay any dividends
to stockholders, nor take any dividends from its banking subsidiaries, without
prior regulatory approval. Similarly, the banking subsidiaries have agreed to
refrain from transferring funds in the form of dividends to the Company without
prior regulatory approval. In 1993, the Company and USTC received approval from
the appropriate regulators such that USTC was allowed to transfer $5,250,000 in
dividends to the Company. These proceeds were then contributed as equity to
USTrust and the Company's Connecticut banking subsidiary, UST Bank/Connecticut
("UST/Conn"). The banks also agreed to, among other matters, maintain a Tier 1
leverage capital ratio at or in excess of 6% beginning in February 1993. Tier 1
leverage capital ratio is defined by the Company's Federal regulators to be
essentially stockholders' equity, less intangible assets, divided by total
average assets, less intangible assets. In February 1994, the FDIC and the
Massachusetts Commissioner terminated and lifted the Consent Agreement and Order
with USTC. Despite the termination of its Regulatory Agreement, USTC has agreed
to continue to request regulatory consent prior to the payment of dividends.

UST/Conn is under a Stipulation and Agreement with the Banking Commissioner
of the State of Connecticut. In accordance with the agreement, the bank, among
other matters, must maintain a Tier 1 leverage capital ratio of 6%. Based on
average total assets, at December 31, 1993, the Tier 1 leverage capital ratio
was 23.75% for United States Trust Company, 6.49% for USTrust, and 6.21% for UST
Bank/Connecticut.

Additionally, the Company agreed to maintain its capital at levels
consistent with the FRB's Capital Adequacy Guidelines. At December 31, 1993,
based on period-end assets the Company's consolidated Tier 1 leverage capital
ratio was 6.96% compared with 6.21% at December 31, 1992. Based on average total
assets, this ratio was 7.06% at December 31, 1993.

(14) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

In the ordinary course of business, the Company's banking subsidiaries have
granted loans to certain of the Company's directors and executive officers. All
such transactions are made on substantially the same terms as those prevailing
at the same time for individuals not affiliated with the Company and its
subsidiaries and do not involve more than the normal risk of collectibility. At
December 31, 1993, none of these transactions were on nonaccrual status, nor did
they involve delinquent or restructured loans. However, at December 31, 1993
loans to a Director of the Company or to his affiliated companies in the amount
of approximately $25 million were characterized as Substandard, in the Company's
internal risk rating profile. Under the Company's definition, Substandard assets
are characterized by the distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained
if the credit deficiencies are not corrected. However, the Substandard
classification does not imply ultimate loss for each individual asset so
classified. Subsequent to December 31, 1993, $6.4 million of these loans were
repaid. See Footnote 15 hereunder.

An analysis of loans outstanding in excess of $60,000 to directors and
officers related to the foregoing entities at december 31, 1993 is as follows:

Rent expense for the years ended December 1993, 1992 and 1991 was
$3,932,074, $4,432,156 and $4,179,740, respectively.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries become
defendants in a variety of judicial and administrative proceedings. In the
opinion of management there is no proceeding pending, or to the knowledge of
management threatened, which in the event of an adverse decision, would be
likely to result in a material adverse change in the financial condition or
results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries.

POTENTIAL REGULATORY SANCTIONS

Certain apparent and inadvertent violations of the insider lending
provisions (and related lending limit provisions) of Regulation O of the FRB
related to extensions of credit by USTrust to Director Francis X. Messina have
led the FDIC to require that corrective action be taken and to advise USTrust
orally that the FDIC may consider the imposition of civil money penalties with
respect to such matters. No FDIC representative has suggested to USTrust or the
Company that there was any willful or intentional misconduct on the part of
USTrust, Director Messina or USTrust's other institution-affiliated parties in
connection with these matters. See Note 14 to Consolidated Financial Statements.

To address these issues, USTrust and Director Messina have undertaken a
program to reduce the aggregate balance of Mr. Messina's outstanding loans from
USTrust and to improve the collateral support for the remaining outstanding loan
balance. The elements of this program have been communicated to and reviewed by
the FDIC. In furtherance of the program since late 1993, the outstanding
principal of the aggregate loans to Director Messina and his related interests
has been reduced by more than $11 million from approximately $30 million to less
than $19 million, and such loans are now below all applicable lending limits. To
date, the Company has incurred no losses with respect to any of these loans,
although they are characterized as "Substandard" in the Company's internal risk
rating profile, and all such loans are current as to both principal and
interest.

There has been no further action taken by any bank regulatory agency to
date. The FDIC has the authority to levy civil money penalties of various
amounts for violations of law or regulations, orders and written conditions and
agreements, which, depending upon the nature and severity of the violations, may
be, in situations where conduct has been egregious, as high as $1 million per
day for the period during which such violation continues. In connection with the
apparent violations described above, the FDIC has the authority to impose
penalties on any of USTrust, its Board of Directors, officers of the Bank,
Director Messina personally, "institution-affiliated parties" of USTrust or any
combination thereof.

While it is not possible to predict with certainty the probability of
penalties being assessed, the person or persons upon whom any penalty would be
assessed or the amounts of any such penalties, were they to be assessed,
management of the Company believes that it is unlikely that this matter will
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of
operations. Consequently, no provision in respect of penalties has been made in
the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

(16) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH ON-AND OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK

The Company is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk
in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.
These financial instruments include commitments to extent credit, standby
letters of credit and financial guarantees. Those instruments involve, to
varying degrees, credit risk in excess of the amount contained in the balance
sheet. The contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent
of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments.

The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the
other party to the financial instrument or commitments to extend credit and
standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written is represented by the
contractual notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses the same
credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for
on-balance-sheet instruments.

The Company generally requires collateral or other security to support
financial instruments with credit risk.

<TABLE>

1993 1992

Financial instruments whose contract amount represents credit

Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees
written................................................ 63,000 71,000
Commercial letters of credit............................. 3,000 5,000
</TABLE>

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long
as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract during its
term. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination
clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are
expected to expire without being fully drawn upon and, in fact, have a maturity
of less than one year, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent
future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer's credit
worthiness on a case-by-case basis. Of the total commitments to extend credit,
approximately $31 million and $33 million were secured by real estate at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

The amount of collateral obtained is based on management's evaluation of
the credit risk. Collateral held on commitments and loans varies but may include
cash, accounts receivable, inventory, property, plant and equipment.

Standby and commercial letters of credit and financial guarantees written
are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance
of, or payment by, a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are primarily
issued to support private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in
issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending
loan facilities to customers. The Company holds various collateral to support
these commitments including (but not limited to) cash, accounts receivables,
inventory, property plant and equipment. The extent of collateral held for those
commitments varies from zero to one hundred percent. Of the total standby and
commercial letters of credit, approximately $4 million and $13 million were
secured by real estate at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

The Company's primary loan market is the New England region. Most of the
loans outstanding are from eastern Massachusetts and a substantial portion of
these loans are various types of real estate loans; still others have real
estate as additional collateral. Over 90% of the Company's outstanding
commercial and real estate loans are collateralized.

The Company's securities portfolio consists largely of mortgage-backed
securities. These securities carry prepayment risk due to the fact that
prevailing interest rates could continue to decline. Under such circumstances an
unusually high percentage of homeowners may choose to refinance their first
mortgages to take advantage of these lower rates with the result that, under the
Company's accounting policy, adjustments

the amount was $2,250,000. No cash dividends were paid to the Company by other
subsidiaries in these years.

(18) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

In December 1991, the FASB issued SFAS No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair
Value of Financial Instruments." SFAS No. 107 is effective for fiscal years
ending after December 15, 1992. SFAS 107 requires disclosure of the fair market
value of financial instruments, whether assets, liabilities or off-balance sheet
commitments, if practicable. The following methods and assumptions were used to
estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments. Fair value
estimates which were derived from discounted cash flows or broker quotes cannot
be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could
not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument.

24
<PAGE> 25

UST CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS, EXCESS FUNDS SOLD AND OTHER SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

For these short-term instruments the carrying amount is a reasonable
estimate of fair value.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND SECURITIES HELD FOR SALE

For marketable securities fair values are based on quoted market prices or
dealer quotes. Nonmarketable investment securities are valued at cost.

LOANS

For certain homogenous categories of loans, such as residential mortgages
and home equity loans, fair value is estimated based on broker quotes on sales
of similar loans. The fair value of fixed rate loans was estimated by
discounting anticipated future cash flows using current rates at which similar
loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same
remaining maturities. The fair value of performing variable rate loans is the
same as the book value at the reporting date because the loans reprice when the
market changes.

DEPOSIT LIABILITIES

The fair value of noncertificate deposit accounts is the amount payable on
demand at the reporting date. The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of
deposit is estimated by discounting the anticipated future cash payments using
the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

For these short-term instruments the carrying amount is a reasonable
estimate of fair value.

OTHER BORROWINGS

The fair value of other borrowings were determined by discounting the
anticipated future cash payments by using the rates currently available to the
Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.

COMMITMENTS TO EXTEND CREDIT/SELL LOANS

The great majority of commitments, standby letters of credit and commercial
letters of credit are short term in nature and therefore have been valued at
their carrying amount.

VALUES NOT DETERMINED

SFAS No. 107 excludes certain assets from its disclosure requirements
including real estate included in banking premises and equipment, and the
intangible value inherent in the Company's deposit relationships (i.e., core
deposits). Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented below do not
represent the underlying value of the Company.

</TABLE>

As shown above, the Company recorded high provisions for loan losses in the
second quarter of 1993 and third and fourth quarters of 1992. Provisions for
loan loss are recorded as necessary in order to maintain an adequate reserve for
loan loss based upon the Company's methodology for quantifying the risk inherent
in the loan portfolio.

Toward the end of the second quarter of 1993, management changed its
strategy regarding troubled credit situations. While the change would result in
the handling of these situations in an expeditious manner, it was recognized
that the up-front costs of these workouts would increase. As a result, the
reserve for loan losses was increased by $19.8 million during the second
quarter. To achieve the higher reserve level, the Company

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

recorded a $42.7 million provision for loan losses in the second quarter.
Included in that amount was a special provision of $30 million. This special
provision was management's estimate of the additional losses to be incurred from
the strategic change referred to above and the continued sluggish economic
climate and losses occurring during the remainder of 1993 on these and other
credits.

An increase in nonaccruals in the third quarter of 1992 was a major factor
in the increased provisions for the last two quarters of 1992. In the third
quarter of 1992, the Company achieved gains on sale of securities of $10.8
million, which was a significant factor in the results for that quarter.
Noninterest income decreased after the first quarter of 1993 due primarily to a
decrease in gains on sale of securities. Noninterest expense increased or
decreased over the quarters presented due primarily to increases or decreases in
the writedowns to fair value of foreclosed real estate properties.
