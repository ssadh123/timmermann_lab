Item 5. Other Events

On July 19, 1994 Citicorp reported net income of $877
million in the 1994 second quarter.

John S. Reed, Citicorp Chairman, commented: "The quarter was
highlighted by strong earnings and significant strengthening of
our balance sheet, with total capital and capital ratios
improving, loan loss reserves increasing by over $400 million and
commercial nonperforming assets dropping by $1.3 billion. 

"The company's core business is solid. Trading was better
than in the first quarter but still weak. Revenues from other
sources were up from a year ago and approximately even with the
first quarter. Costs are under control. And the general credit
picture is importantly improved.

"The solid operating results combined with the refinancing
agreement reached with Brazil, some asset gains, and tax benefits
flowing from FAS 109 to produce the strong quarter."

The 1994 second quarter net income of $877 million compared
with $446 million in the same 1993 quarter. Fully diluted net
income per common share of $1.64 compared with $0.82 in the year-
earlier quarter. Net income in the first half of 1994 was 
$1.4 billion, or $2.66 per share, compared with $1.1 billion, or
$2.06 per share, in the same 1993 half-year.

Mr. Reed noted that the company continued to build capital,
with total regulatory capital at June 30, 1994 at $24.5 billion,
estimated to be 11.6% of risk-adjusted assets, and the Tier 1
capital ratio increasing to an estimated 7.1% from 6.9% at the
1994 first quarter-end. A year earlier the total capital ratio
was 10.3% and the Tier 1 ratio was 5.7%.

Revenues in the quarter (adjusted for credit-related costs,
the effect of credit card securitization and net asset gains)
totaled $4.2 billion, up modestly from $4.1 billion in the 1994
first quarter but below the 1993 second quarter's $4.4 billion. 
Excluding securities and foreign exchange trading, revenues were
$4.1 billion in the 1994 second quarter, up 6% from $3.8 billion
in the same 1993 quarter. 

Trading in the second quarter amounted to $159 million, up
from $71 million in the 1994 first quarter but sharply down from
$572 million in the second quarter of last year. 

Operating expenses (excluding OREO costs) were $2.5 billion,
slightly higher than the $2.4 billion recorded in both the 1994
first quarter and the 1993 second quarter.

The second quarter net income included recognition of 
$150 million of deferred tax benefits and net pretax gains of 
$117 million ($74 million after tax) from net asset gains. These
included recognition as other revenue of $173 million
representing the fair value of interest bonds received in
connection with the Brazil refinancing agreement concluded in the
quarter, and recognition as investment securities gains of 
$71 million from the sale of Brazilian interest bonds received in
a previous restructuring, offset by writedowns of $157 million in
the value of Latin American investments. Such items in
comparative quarters amounted to a net gain of $23 million 
($14 million after tax) in the first quarter of 1994 and a net
loss of $25 million ($14 million after tax) in the second quarter
of 1993. 

As a result of the Brazil refinancing agreement, Citicorp
received approximately $1.4 billion in market value of Brazilian
bonds for Brazilian debt that was carried on Citicorp's books at
$818 million and a new money investment of $221 million. Upon
receipt of the bonds, Citicorp recorded a credit recovery of 
$318 million to its loan loss reserve in recognition of their
market value, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standard
No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities." (Citicorp's accounting treatment recognized the
economic effects of the Brazil refinancing agreement in the loan
loss reserve and other revenue.) 

Loan loss reserves increased to a total of $4.9 billion at
June 30, 1994, up from $4.5 billion at the end of the first
quarter. The increase included the recovery of $318 million
arising from receipt of Brazilian bonds noted above. In
addition, a $90 million provision in excess of net credit losses
was added to the reserves. Citicorp no longer reports a separate
portion of the reserves attributed to refinancing countries,
which is combined with the commercial reserve.

Commercial cash-basis loans and Other Real Estate Owned
together declined in the quarter by $1.3 billion to $4.7 billion. 
Of the reduction, $818 million resulted from Brazilian loans
having been exchanged for marketable securities. Commercial
credit costs were $73 million, up slightly from $60 million in
the 1994 first quarter, but sharply below $297 million in the
1993 second quarter. Consumer credit costs decreased in the
quarter, totaling $585 million, compared with $614 million in the
1994 first quarter and $708 million in the 1993 second quarter.

CORE BUSINESS RESULTS

Global Consumer

The Global Consumer businesses earned $411 million in the
second quarter, a 39% increase over the $296 million earned in
the comparable 1993 quarter. The consumer business in North
America continued to benefit from an improving credit profile in
the U.S. card portfolio, and the emerging economies displayed
solid revenue momentum in both the branch and cards businesses. 
The Global Consumer businesses earned $838 million in the first
half of 1994, an increase of $251 million or 43% from the 1993
first half.

Net income in the North America, Europe and Japan consumer
businesses was $250 million in the quarter, compared with
$168 million in last year's second quarter. Net income in the
emerging economies was $161 million, compared with $128 million
in the 1993 second quarter.

Adjusted revenues in the second quarter of $2.7 billion were
up 3% from last year on the strength of an 18% increase in the
emerging economies. Revenues in North America, Europe and Japan
declined slightly as good results in European branches were
overshadowed by the effect of competitive pricing strategies in
the U.S. credit card business.

Operating expenses rose 2% from the second quarter of last
year as cost containment efforts, particularly in the United
States and Europe, partially offset continued business expansion
in the emerging economies.

Total consumer credit costs (principally adjusted for the
effect of credit card securitization) declined by $123 million
from the 1993 second quarter, primarily reflecting continued
improvement in the U.S. credit card portfolio. Consumer loans on
the balance sheet that are delinquent 90 days or more fell to
$3.4 billion from $3.5 billion at the end of the 1994 first
quarter and from $3.8 billion at June 30, 1993. 

Global Finance

The Global Finance businesses reported net income of
$285 million in the second quarter, compared with $440 million in
the 1993 second quarter. Year-to-date earnings totaled
$549 million, down from $820 million reported for the first half
of 1993.

Trading-related activities were the principal factor in the
revenue decline from 1993. Customer demand continued, reflecting
positively on the derivatives business, but securities and
foreign exchange trading was hampered by difficult markets. 

Reflecting the lower trading results, the Global Finance
businesses in North America, Europe and Japan had net income of
$102 million in the second quarter and $194 million year-to-date,
compared with $235 million and $464 million in the respective
1993 periods.

The businesses in emerging economies reported net income of
$183 million in the second quarter, compared with $205 million in
the same 1993 quarter, reflecting lower trading revenues in Latin
America and Asia. Year-to-date earnings from emerging economies
were on par with last year's results, totaling $355 million and
$356 million in the six-month periods of 1994 and 1993,
respectively.

Global Finance adjusted revenues were $1.3 billion in the
second quarter and $2.5 billion in the first half-year, down 20%
and 19% from the respective 1993 periods. 

Second quarter operating expenses of $824 million rose 3%
from both the 1994 first quarter and the 1993 second quarter,
largely related to continued business expansion in the emerging
economies. 

Gains from the sale of OREO properties contributed to a
positive net credit amount of $8 million in the second quarter,
compared with a $46 million charge in the same 1993 period. In
the 1994 six-month period, positive net credit amounts totaled
$66 million, compared with net charges of $115 million in the
first six months of 1993. Cash-basis loans at June 30, 1994 of
$581 million compared with $699 million at the end of the 1994
first quarter and with $1.3 billion at the end of the year-ago
second quarter.

OTHER AREAS 

North America Commercial Real Estate

North America Commercial Real Estate reported continued
progress in dealing with its portfolio. Cash-basis loans and
OREO together declined to $3.4 billion, a decrease of $343
million from the end of the 1994 first quarter and $1.9 billion
from the end of the 1993 second quarter. This improvement
resulted from multiple initiatives, including restructurings,
sales, write-offs, writedowns and paydowns. 

Cash-basis loans of $1.5 billion were down from $1.7 billion
at the 1994 first quarter-end and from $2.5 billion at the end of
the same 1993 quarter. OREO totaled $1.9 billion at the close of
the 1994 second quarter, down from $2.1 billion at the end of the
first quarter and $2.8 billion at the end of the 1993 second
quarter. 

Total exposure was reduced by approximately $1.0 billion
during the quarter, to $11.7 billion, down $3.9 billion from the
1993 second quarter. 

North America Commercial Real Estate reported a second
quarter net loss of $72 million, a significant improvement from
the $182 million loss reported in the 1993 second quarter,
reflecting lower credit costs. Write-offs and writedowns were
$75 million, down from $104 million in the 1994 first quarter and
from $201 million in the 1993 second quarter. 

Cross-Border Refinancing Portfolio

The principal effects of the completion of the Brazil
financing agreement were noted earlier.

The cross-border refinancing portfolio reported net income
of $53 million in the second quarter, which included $47 million
of interest from Brazil and a $10 million release of reserves. 
Prior-year second quarter net income was $12 million, with
$6 million of Brazil interest payments and no release of
reserves.

Cash-basis loans totaled $165 million at the end of the
second quarter, compared with $991 million at the 1994 first
quarter-end and $1.1 billion at the end of the 1993 second
quarter. 

TAXES

Income tax expense of $245 million for the quarter included
$395 million related to current operations, less a $150 million
reduction of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance because
of reassessment of the expected level and mix of future earnings. 
The taxes related to current operations bring the effective rate
for the first six months to 37%, compared with 39% for the first
quarter of 1994 and 43% for the first six months of 1993.

Following are tables of financial highlights, an analysis of
operating margin and pretax earnings, business results and credit
indicators, along with financial statements. Further details
concerning the financial results will be available in Citicorp's
Form 10-Q to be published in August.

(B) Balances at June 30, 1994 include the effect of adopting
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities". Statement No. 115, which requires that
securities designated as "available for sale" be carried
at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in
stockholders' equity (net of applicable taxes), was adopted
effective January 1, 1994. Pursuant to the adoption of
SFAS No. 115, "Brady Bonds" previously included as Commercial
Loans are classified as Held to Maturity and Available for
Sale Securities.
(C) Trading Account Assets and Trading Account Liabilities
as of June 30, 1994 include approximately $24.1 billion
relating to the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards
Board Interpretation No. 39, "Offsetting of Amounts
Related to Certain Contracts". Interpretation No. 39
requires that unrealized trading gains and losses be
reported gross on the balance sheet except where there is
a qualifying netting agreement in place. On a pro-forma
basis, Trading Account Assets and Trading Account Liabilities
as of December 31, 1993 would have been $36.8 billion and
$18.5 billion, respectively, had the new rule been in effect
on that date. Amounts presented for Trading Account Assets
and Trading Account Liabilities as of December 31, 1993
include the reclassification of $5.7 billion and $3.1 
billion, respectively, to provide for consistent presentation
of amounts previously recorded in Other Assets and Other
Liabilities representing revaluation gains and losses and
other balances related to these contracts.
