ITEM 5 OTHER EVENTS

On March 10, 1994, the Registrant was advised that Selex International
B.V., a Netherlands corporation ("Selex"), which holds approximately 43.1% of 
the Registrant's outstanding Common Stock, filed Amendment No. 2 dated February
17, 1994 to its Schedule 13D (the "Amendment") with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission"). In the Amendment, Selex reported that it, 
together with Yasawa Holding N.V., a Netherland Antilles corporation ("Yasawa")
which holds approximately 4.4% of the Registrant's outstanding Common Stock, and
their affiliates are uncertain as to whether they will provide any further funds
to the Registrant. The Amendment further stated that Selex, Yasawa and their
affiliates are seeking third parties to provide finance for the Registrant and
that as part of any such transaction, they would be willing to sell or
restructure all or a portion of their loans and Common Stock in the Registrant.

The Registrant has stated in previous filings with the Commission that the
obtainment of additional funds to implement its marketing program and achieve 
the objectives of its business plan is essential to enable the Registrant to 
maintain operations and continue as a going concern. Since December, 1992, the 
Registrant has been dependent on loans and advances from Selex, Yasawa and their
affiliates in order to implement its marketing program and assist in meeting its
working capital requirements. During the last six months of 1993, Selex, Yasawa
and their affiliates loaned the Registrant an aggregate of $4,400,000 pursuant 
to a Loan Agreement dated July 14, 1993 and amendments thereto (the "Third Selex
Loan"). The Third Selex Loan is secured by substantially all of the property of
the Registrant. Funds advanced under the Third Selex Loan enabled the 
Registrant to commence implementation of the majority of its marketing program. 
As indicated in the Registrant's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter
ended September 24, 1993, however, implementation of the marketing program was 
delayed until the third quarter of 1993, such that the full benefits of the 
program could not be realized in 1993.

In March, 1994, an affiliate of Yasawa reimbursed the Registrant for
$265,000 of expenses previously incurred by the Registrant in operating a 
venture between the Registrant and an affiliate of Yasawa. Also, in February 
and March, 1994 Selex, Yasawa and their affiliates provided the Registrant with
approximately $697,500 in additional funds. Of these funds, $437,500 was in the
form of a loan from Yasawa and $260,000 resulted from the purchase by an
affiliate of Selex of certain multi-family property at the Registrant's St.
Augustine Shores, Florida community pursuant to an existing option agreement 
(the property was purchased at a price of $312,000, with $260,000 being paid to 
the Registrant in cash and $52,000 of debt due Selex being assumed by the 
affiliate).

The Registrant also stated in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarter ended September 24, 1993, that it was engaged in discussions with
external financing sources concerning its 1994 financing requirements. For a
variety of reasons, such negotiations have terminated.

Inasmuch as funding is not presently available from external sources and,
as stated in their Amendment, Selex, Yasawa and their affiliates have not
determined whether they will provide any further funds to the Registrant, the
Registrant is facing a severe cash shortfall. As a consequence of its liquidity
position, the Registrant has defaulted on certain obligations, including its
escrow obligations to the State of Florida, Department of Business Regulation,
Division of Florida Land Sales, Condominiums and Mobile Homes (the "Division")
pursuant to the Registrant's 1992 Consent Order with the Division, its 
obligation under its lease for its corporate offices and its obligation to make 
required interest payments under loans from Selex, Yasawa and their affiliates. 
Furthermore, the Registrant has not paid certain real estate taxes which
aggregate more than $1,100,000.

Because of the Registrant's default on its escrow account obligations, 
the Division is requiring the Registrant, in accordance with the terms of the 
1992 Consent Order, to deposit collections on all contracts and mortgages 
receivable in such escrow account until the deficiency has been satisfied. 
Since collections on receivables have, in the past, been used to meet the 
Registrant's working capital requirements, this recent action has caused a 
critical strain on the Registrant's liquidity situation.

The Registrant is also subject to certain pending litigation which may
adversely affect the financial condition of the Registrant, as follows:

On December 8, 1993, the landlord of the Registrant's headquarters
building in Miami, Florida filed a complaint against the Registrant
styled Five_Points_Limited_v._The_Deltona_Corporation, Case No. 93-
22877, in the Circuit Court for Dade County, Florida. In its
complaint, the plaintiff is seeking damages against the Registrant
for an alleged breach of the lease for the office building. The
complaint alleges that the Registrant has defaulted in its
obligation to make payments under the lease and seeks damages in
excess of $272,000 for additional past due rent, plus damages for
acceleration of lease payments in excess of $4,000,000. On February
17, 1994 the Court entered an Order requiring the Registrant to pay
uncontested back rent of approximately $240,000, plus uncontested
rent of approximately $48,000, commencing on March 1, 1994. To
date, the Registrant has not paid any amounts to the Court under
this Order.

On February 28, 1994, the Registrant was served with an action
styled Lee,_et.al._v._The_Deltona_Corporation, Case No. 94-3808,
filed in the Circuit Court for Dade County, Florida. In the
complaint, the plaintiff alleges that the liquidated damages
provision in the Registrant's contracts for the sale of its
properties is unenforceable under Florida law and contests the
method utilized by the Registrant to calculate actual damages in the
event of contract cancellations. As part of its complaint, the
plaintiff is seeking certification as a class action, as well as
unspecified compensatory damages, together with interest, costs and
fees. The lawsuit has only recently been filed. The Registrant
believes it has meritorious defenses to the plaintiff's claims and
intends to vigorously defend this action.

The Registrant is presently in default of all its loans to Selex, Yasawa
and their affiliates due to its failure to make required interest payments. In
its Amendment, Selex, Yasawa and their affiliates have reported that they are
currently reviewing their rights and options under such loans. They are
considering, among other actions, declaring defaults under the loans, seeking to
realize on their security interests in the assets of the Registrant through
mortgage foreclosures and other actions, and restructuring their loans (which
might involve, among other things, accepting certain assets of the Registrant in
exchange for reduction of their loans).

As previously stated, Selex, Yasawa and their affiliates are also seeking
to locate third parties to provide financing for the Registrant. As part of any
such transaction, Selex, Yasawa and their affiliates have indicated that they 
are willing to sell or restructure all or a portion of their loans and Common 
Stock in the Registrant. They have also indicated that they are willing to sell
their interests in the Registrant at a significant discount. Consummation of 
any such transaction may result in a change in control of the Registrant. 
There can be no assurance, however, that any such transaction will result or 
that any financing will be obtained. Accordingly, the Registrant's Board of 
Directors is also considering other appropriate action given the severity of the
Registrant's liquidity position.

DELTONA FACES CONTINUING CASH SHORTFALLS --
FUNDING NOT AVAILABLE FROM CONTROL GROUP OR ALTERNATIVE SOURCES 

MIAMI, FLORIDA -- The Deltona Corporation announced today that it is facing a
severe shortfall in working capital due to its failure to obtain additional
financing. The Company further announced that Selex International B.V., which
holds approximately 43.1% of Deltona's outstanding Common Stock, has stated in
a filing made with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it, as well as
Yasawa Holding N.V. (which holds approximately 4.4% of Deltona's Common Stock)
and their affiliates are uncertain as to whether they will provide any further
funds to Deltona. In their filing, Selex and its affiliates stated that they 
are seeking third parties to provide financing for the Company and that as part 
of any such transaction, they would be willing to sell or restructure all or a
portion of their loans and equity interest in the Company.

Deltona, the developer of nine planned communities in Florida, has stated on
numerous occasions that the obtainment of additional funds to implement its
marketing program and achieve the objectives of its business plan is essential
to enable the Company to continue as a going concern. The business plan was
designed to significantly increase Deltona's sales through a major marketing
effort so that future working capital could be obtained by selling or otherwise
financing newly generated contracts and mortgages receivable. Selex provided
$4,400,000 in loans to the Company during the last half of 1993 to commence
implementation of the marketing program and assist Deltona in meeting its 
working capital requirements. Selex and its affiliates also provided Deltona 
with $1,000,000 in additional funds in February and March, 1994 in the form of a
loan, purchase of property and reimbursement of expenses.

Deltona stated in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended
September 24, 1993, that the Company was engaged in discussions with external
financing sources concerning its 1994 financing requirements. For a variety of
reasons, such negotiations have terminated.

As a consequence of Deltona's working capital problems, Deltona is in default of
several major obligations, including its obligation to the Division of Florida
Land Sales under its existing escrow agreement, its obligation under its lease
for its corporate offices and its obligation to make required interest payments
under loans from Selex and its affiliates. Furthermore, the Company has not 
paid certain real estate taxes which total more than $1,100,000.

Due to the Company's default on its escrow obligations, the Division is 
requiring the Company, in accordance with the existing Consent Order between the
Company and the Division, to deposit in escrow all funds received from contracts
and mortgages receivable. Since collections on receivables have, in the past, 
been used to help meet Deltona's working capital requirements, this recent 
action has caused a significant strain on the Company's liquidity position.

Deltona is also subject to certain pending litigation which may adversely affect
the financial condition of the Company, as follows:

On December 8, 1993, the landlord of the Company's headquarters
building in Miami, Florida filed a complaint against the Company in
the Circuit Court for Dade County, Florida (Case No. 93-22877). In
its complaint, the plaintiff is seeking damages against the Company
for an alleged breach of the lease for the office building. The
complaint alleges that Deltona has defaulted in its obligation to
make payments under the lease and seeks damages in excess of
$272,000 for additional past due rent, plus damages for acceleration
of lease payments in excess of $4,000,000. The Court has entered an
Order requiring the Company to pay uncontested back rent of
approximately $240,000, plus uncontested rent of approximately
$48,000, commencing on March 1, 1994. To date, the Company has not
paid any amounts to the Court under this Order.

On February 28, 1994, the Company was served with an action styled
Lee,_et.al._v._The_Deltona_Corporation, Case No. 94-3808, filed in
the Circuit Court for Dade County, Florida. In the complaint, the
plaintiff alleges that the liquidated damages provision in Deltona's
contracts for the sale of its properties is unenforceable under
Florida law and contests the method utilized by the Company to
calculate actual damages in the event of contract cancellations. As
part of its complaint, the plaintiff is seeking certification as a
class action, as well as unspecified compensatory damages, together
with interest, costs and fees. The lawsuit has only recently been
filed. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the
plaintiff's claims and intends to vigorously defend this action.

Deltona is presently in default of all its loans to Selex and its affiliates due
to its failure to make required interest payments. Selex and its affiliates 
have reported to the SEC that they are currently reviewing their rights and 
options under such loans. They are considering, among other actions, declaring 
defaults under the loans, seeking to realize on their security interests in the 
assets of Deltona through mortgage foreclosures and other actions, and 
restructuring their loans (which might involve, among other things, accepting 
certain assets of Deltona in exchange for reduction of their loans).

Selex and its affiliates are also seeking to locate third parties to provide
financing for the Company. As part of any such transaction, Selex and its
affiliates have indicated that they are willing to sell or restructure all or a
portion of their loans and equity interest in the Company. They have also
indicated that they are willing to sell their interests in the Company at a
significant discount. Consummation of any such transaction might result in a
change in control of Deltona.

In light of the foregoing factors, the Board of Directors is reviewing the
alternatives available to the Company to address its liquidity and working
capital problems.
