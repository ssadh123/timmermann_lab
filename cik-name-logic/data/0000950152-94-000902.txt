Independent Auditors' Report
----------------------------

The Board of Directors
Rust-Oleum Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Rust-Oleum
Corporation and subsidiaries as of October 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of income, shareholders' investment, and cash flows for
the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Rust-Oleum
Corporation and subsidiaries as of October 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 11 to the financial statements, the Company adopted the
provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard No. 106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits 
Other Than Pensions in 1993.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
- - --------------------
OCTOBER 31, 1993 AND 1992
- - -------------------------

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:
-------------------------------------------

Principles of Consolidation
---------------------------

The accompanying financial statements include the accounts of
Rust-Oleum Corporation and its subsidiaries (the Company). All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Reclassifications
-----------------

Certain amounts in the 1992 financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the 1993 financial statement presentation.
These reclassifications have no effect on previously reported
shareholders' investment or net income during the period involved.

Inventories
-----------

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The
last-in, first-out (LIFO) method is used to determine the cost of all
domestic inventories.

Property, Plant and Equipment
-----------------------------

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost and are
depreciated over estimated useful lives using the straight-line method
for financial reporting purposes.

Employee Retirement Plans
-------------------------

The Company has a noncontributory employee retirement plan to
provide retirement, death, and disability benefits to substantially
all full-time employees. Costs are provided for and funded in
accordance with actuarial estimates as described in Footnote 10.

The Company also offers a supplemental savings plan. This
program enables employees to defer up to 8% of compensation per year
to be invested in the plan, and for the Company to make a matching
contribution on a percentage basis that varies with the Company's
profitability. The provision for matching contributions was $646,000
in 1993 and $630,000 in 1992.

The Company also sponsors a defined benefit healthcare plan
as described in Footnote II.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OCTOBER 31, 1993 AND 1992
- - -------------------------

Income Taxes
------------

Income taxes are provided based upon income recognized for
financial statement purposes, with appropriate recognition being given
to timing differences in the reporting of items for tax purposes.
Deferred income taxes arise primarily from the use of accelerated
depreciation methods for tax purposes, and currently non-deductible
accruals. The Company does not provide for income taxes on
undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, amounting to
$252,347 in 1993 and $2,292,000 in 1992, which are considered to be
permanently reinvested.

Foreign Currency Translation
----------------------------

In computing the foreign currency translation, the local
currency is used as the functional currency with resulting adjustments
accumulated as a separate component of shareholders' investment.
Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are
included in other expenses, and amount to $108,000 of expense in 1993
and $64,000 of expense in 1992.

Cash Equivalents
----------------

Cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid investments
with original maturities of three months or less.

of property held for sale. This vacant piece of property located in
Evanston, Illinois was sold during 1993 at a price in excess of book
value.

On August 2, 1993, Rust-Oleum Corporation issued and sold
$12,000,000 aggregate principal amount 6.75% Senior Notes due August
2, 2003 in a private placement. Interest is payable semi-annually on
the second day of each February and August in each year (commencing
February 2, 1994) and at maturity. The Senior Notes are unsecured,
and at Rust-Oleum's option, the remaining Notes may be prepaid, in
whole or in part, on any date prior to maturity. Such optional
prepayments will include accrued interest to the date of prepayment
and a premium paid to the holders of the Notes.

In July, 1993, the Company retired Massachusetts Mutual debt
in the amount of $8,571,000 at a rate of 10.16%. The Company
recognized a loss on the early extinguishment of debt, net of tax
credits, of $811,000 reported as an extraordinary item on the
Consolidated Statement of Income.

On October 25, 1991 the Company entered into an $8,000,000
unsecured "Evergreen" revolving loan agreement with Marshall and
Ilsley Bank. Interest payments are determined by the method of
borrowing. The interest rate was 4.12% at October 31, 1993.

Maintenance of specified net worth levels, debt to equity
ratios and interest coverage ratios are required on the debt.
Furthermore, certain loan agreement clauses contain limitations
restricting additional long-term debt.

Long-term debt maturities for the four years succeeding
October 31, 1993 are $8,000,000 in 1995, and $1,714,286 in 1997.

(6) COMMON STOCK:
-------------
The Class B common stock is of equal rank with Class A common
stock which is the senior security; however, holders of Class B common
stock have no voting power or preemptive rights to purchase any
additional stock of the Company. The shares of Class B common stock
are automatically converted into an equal number of Class A common
stock upon the filing of a Registration Statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, or two-thirds approval of the shareholders of
outstanding Class A common stock. In conjunction therewith, 1,000,000
shares of Class A common stock have been reserved for conversions of
the Class B common stock. The Class B common stock may be issued only
to employees of the Company and may not be sold, transferred,
assigned, or otherwise disposed of except by tender to the Company.

Effective June 23, 1982, the Company adopted an incentive stock option
plan which is available to officers and key employees. Options are granted, at
the discretion of the Board of Directors, at an option price that will be no
less than the fair market value of the corporate common stock on the date of

appreciation of stock value have resulted in expense recorded by the Company of
$247,000 and $586,000 in 1993 and 1992 respectively. The plan expires in June,
1995.

Total rent expense for operating leases, including short-term rentals,
was $1,740,000 and $1,912,000 in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

(10) PENSION PLAN:
------------
To provide a uniform retirement income for its employees, the Company
has a defined benefit retirement plan in which substantially all employees
participate. The Retirement Plan is a non-contributory plan fully paid for by
the Company, with accrued benefits vesting after five years of service. This
plan provides benefits that are based on years of service and average
compensation. The Company's funding policy is to contribute annually an amount
that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes using a different
actuarial cost method and different assumptions from these used for financial
reporting.

Effective November 1, 1987, the Company adopted the Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 87, "Employers' Accounting for
Pensions." The Statement provided for the computation of a transition gain as
of November 1, 1987 which is the amount by which the plan's net assets plus
unfunded accrued pension cost exceeded the actuarial present value of the
projected benefit obligation. The transition gain of $3.6 million is being
amortized over 15 years as a reduction of pension expense.

Effective January 27, 1993, the Company established a

lost under the qualified pension plan due to the Section 402(a)(17)

- - -------------------------

The weighted average discount rate and rate of increase in
future compensation levels used in determining the actuarial present
value of the projected benefit obligation were 7.75% and 5.0%
respectively. The expected long-term rate of return on assets was
B.5%. As of the most recent valuation report, there is no unfunded
prior service cost for the qualified plan. The company contribution
in 1993 was $655,000. The plan's assets consist primarily of stocks,
bonds and fixed income securities.

(11) POST RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS:
-----------------------------

In addition to the Company's defined pension plans, the
Company sponsors a defined benefit healthcare plan that provides
postretirement medical benefits to full-time employees who meet
minimum age and service requirements. The plan is contributory, with
retiree contributions adjusted annually, and contains other
cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance. The
accounting for the plan anticipates future cost-sharing changes to the
written plan that are consistent with the Company's expressed intent
to limit the Company's exposure to increases in medical inflation to a
10 percent maximum. The Company's policy is to fund the cost of
medical benefits in the amount determined at the discretion of
management.

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions," as of November 1, 1992. The effect, net of
taxes, of adopting Statement 106 on income before extraordinary items,
net income and the net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the
year ended October 31, 1993 was an increase of $363,000 and a decrease
of $4,362,000 and $145,000, respectively. Postretirement benefit cost
of $465,000 for the year ended October 31, 1992, which was recorded on
a cash basis, has not been restated.

Net postretirement benefit costs for 1993 include
the following components:

Service Cost $ 300,000

Interest Cost 513,000
-----------
Net periodic postretirement benefit cost $ 813,000
===========

</TABLE>

For measurement purposes, a 15 percent annual rate of
increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits (i.e., health care
cost trend rate) was assumed for 1993; the rate was assumed to
decrease gradually to 8 percent by the year 2006 and remain at that
level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate assumption has a
significant effect on the amounts reported. For example, increasing
the assumed health care cost trend rates by one percentage point in
each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation as of October 31, 1993 by $555,000 and the aggregate of the
service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement
benefit cost for the year ended October 31, 1993 by $77,000.

The weighted-average discount rate used in determining the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.75 percent at
October 31, 1993.

(12) ACQUISITION:
-----------

Certain assets of FlorLine Corporation were acquired on
January 15, 1993. Rust-Oleum purchased these FlorLine Corporation
assets for $424,000 including $200,000 for a covenant not to compete.

(13) CONTINGENCY:
-----------

Rust-Oleum Corporation has been named as a defendant in two
civil actions regarding generation of hazardous wastes which were
shipped to three waste sites. In the first action, a settlement was
made with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. EPA regarding
cleanup procedures. It is estimated that the remaining cleanup
procedures for two sites will be $22,000,000 of which Rust-Oleum's
remaining allocation is approximately $4,000,000. The cash will be
paid into a trust fund for the site cleanup over the next 30 years.
1994 payment is expected to be approximately $1,000,000. A final
settlement has not been reached in the second civil action nor have
specific cleanup costs been determined. Rust-Oleum management
believes it has adequately provided for these actions after
considering reserves already recorded and coverage of Rust-Oleum's
general comprehensive liability insurance.
