TWO NEW DIRECTORS JOIN PETROLITE BOARD
- --------------------------------------

ST. LOUIS, March 7, 1994 -- Paul H. Hatfield of
St. Louis and Richard L. O'Shields of Colorado Springs,
Colo., have joined the board of directors of Petrolite
Corporation following their election today at the company's
annual meeting of stockholders. Additionally, Michael V.
Janes, a director of the company since 1988, declined to
stand for reelection, citing increased requirements and
demands of managing the estate of his late mother, Mrs.
Genevieve B. Janes.
"The company certainly regrets Mike Janes'
resignation," said William E. Nasser, Petrolite chairman,
president and chief executive officer. "I know all of the
directors join me in expressing our gratitude for his past
service as a member of the board."
The executive explained that because of the lateness of
Mr. Janes' resignation, the board elected to reduce the
authorized number of directors from 10 to nine, all of whom
stood for election today.
"Both Paul Hatfield and Richard O'Shields bring a
wealth of business experience that will make them invaluable

based in St. Louis.
O'Shields is the former chairman of the board of
Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company. He retired from the
company in 1993 after 33 years of service.
