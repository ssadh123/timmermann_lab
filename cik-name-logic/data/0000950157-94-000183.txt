$1.00 per share (the "Common Stock");

WHEREAS, the Company intends to enter into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with
The Chase Manhattan Corporation ("CMC") pursuant to which,
following the distribution on a pro rata basis to the

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, neither The Chase Manhattan
Corporation (the "CMC"), nor any of its Affiliates
or Associates shall be deemed to be an "Acquiring
Person", and no Share Acquisition Date,
Distribution Date, Affiliate Merger or Triggering
Event shall occur, as a result of (i) the
distribution on a pro rata basis to the Company's
stockholders of all the shares of New Holdings, a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (the "New

delivery of the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of November 18, 1994, by and among CMC
and the Company (the "Merger Agreement");
(iii) any action taken by CMC or any of its
Affiliates or Associates in accordance with the
provisions of the Merger Agreement; or (iv) the
consummation of the Merger (as such term is
defined in the Merger Agreement) in accordance
with the provisions of the Merger Agreement;
provided, however, that nothing contained in the
foregoing shall prevent CMC or any of its
Affiliates or Associates from becoming an
"Acquiring Person", or a Share Acquisition Date,
Distribution Date, Affiliate Merger or Triggering
Event from occurring as a result of any action

taken by CMC or any of its Affiliates or
