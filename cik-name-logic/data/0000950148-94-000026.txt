Item 5. Other Events 

As previously reported in the Registrant's Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended July 31, 1993, as a result of the "Operation Ill Wind"
investigation of defense contractor marketing practices, two employees of the
Data Systems Division of Litton Systems, Inc. ("LSI"), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Registrant, were convicted in March, 1991, on charges of unlawful
conveyance of governmental property (i.e., certain Government procurement-
related information), conspiracy to perform such acts, and the use
of the U.S. mails in these alleged activities. Following affirmation of such
convictions by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in
August, 1992, the Registrant was informed by the Government that it intended to
proceed against LSI under the legal doctrine of respondeat superior, i.e., that
the employer is responsible for the acts of its employees.

On January 14, 1994, LSI agreed to settle all charges and claims of the
Government in connection with this matter by paying $1.5 million in fines, $1.1
million as reimbursement of costs of the Government's investigation, and $1.3
million in settlement of the Government's civil claims. In an agreement filed in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia and
approved by the Court, LSI agreed to plead guilty to the three-count information
previously filed by the Government with the Court, which was based upon the
evidence presented by the Government at the trial of the two employees of LSI's
division who were convicted. The fine referred to above represents the maximum
penalty of $500,000 for each of such three violations.

LSI received no contracts as a result of the alleged wrongdoing and no
allegations were made by the Government that bribes or improper gratuities were
offered or taken. The Registrant believes that the suspension or debarment of
any of its operating units from receiving further Government contracts as a
result of the plea agreement is unlikely.

The agreement approved by the Court terminates both the civil and criminal
aspects of the legal proceeding previously reported.

shall be separately accounted for by LITTON SYSTEMS, INC.. The matters covered 
by this Plea Agreement include both civil and criminal matters relating to the
Illwind investigation of Litton Systems, Inc., and its subsidiaries, and their
officers, directors, agents and employees.

7. Subject to the entry of judgment and payment of the sums stipulated in
this Agreement, the United States releases and discharges LITTON SYSTEMS, INC.,
its divisions, subsidiaries, successors, assigns, affiliates or parent thereof,
from any civil claim or cause of action the United States has or may have under
the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. sections 3729-3733; the Program Fraud Civil
Remedies Act, 31 U.S.C. sections 3801-3812; the common law; or, for costs
incurred from 1982 through June 14, 1988, for any liability, damages, civil
penalties, or assessments in lieu of damages, or for any claim that contracts

that this paragraph does not constitute a release from any liability under the
contracts at issue in this Agreement for delivery of any deficient or defective
products, or from liability under any express or implied warranties pertinent to
these contracts; and provided further that this release does not constitute a
defense to, or release from, any liability or the amount of damages or civil
penalties in United States v. Litton Systems, Inc., CV-99-02276 MRP (C.D. Cal.).

8. The United States Attorney recognizes that before the Illwind
investigation became public, officers of LITTON SYSTEMS, INC. met with officials
of the Departments of Defense and Justice, and sought to clarify and change the
rules regarding the non-disclosure of certain types of government procurement
information, but not the information which the two Litton officials, knowing
that they were not authorized to receive it, were convicted of obtaining and
attempting to obtain.

9. The United States Attorney agrees to advise the Department of Defense of
this Agreement as well as the nature and extent of LITTON SYSTEMS, INC.'s,
activities with respect to this case. By this Agreement, the United States makes
no representation regarding suspension and debarment which are within the sole
authority of the Department of Defense.

10. It is agreed that if the Court refuses to accept any provision of this
Plea Agreement neither party is bound by any of the provisions of the Plea
Agreement, and no statement in this Plea Agreement or its attachments will be
admissible against either party in any proceeding.

11. No additional promises, agreements, or conditions other than those
referenced in this Plea Agreement have been entered into and none will be
entered unless in writing and signed by all parties.
