ITEM 8. CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR

On March 28, 1994, the Board of Directors of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. ("Lehman Brothers"), the parent of Lehman Brothers Inc. (the
"Registrant"), and the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Registrant approved a change in Lehman Brothers' and the Registrant's
respective fiscal year-ends from December 31 to November 30. Such change was
subject to the completion of the distribution (the "Distribution") by American
Express Company ("American Express") to its common shareholders of record on
May 20, 1994, of all of the common stock, par value $.10 per share, of Lehman
Brothers held by American Express on the date of the Distribution. The change
in Lehman Brothers' and the Registrant's fiscal year-ends became effective on
May 31, 1994, the date on which the Distribution was effected.

The Registrant expects to file a Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarterly period ending June 30, 1994 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") on or about August 14, 1994; and, in conjunction
with its decision to change its fiscal year, the Registrant anticipates that
its financial statements for the transition period ending November 30, 1994, 
will be contained in a Report on Form 10-K which it expects to file with the
Commission on or about February 28, 1995.
