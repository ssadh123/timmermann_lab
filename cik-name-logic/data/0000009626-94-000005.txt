THE BANK OF NEW YORK COMPANY, INC. REPORTS
------------------------------------------
RECORD FIRST QUARTER NET INCOME AND E.P.S.
------------------------------------------

First Quarter Net Income $178 Million; E.P.S. $1.75 up 35%
1.50% ROA and 18.55% ROE Also Records
Common Stock Dividend Increased 22%, Stock Split 2-for-1
2.5 Million Common Share Buyback Announced

NEW YORK, N.Y., April 12, 1994 -- The Bank of New York Company, Inc. 
reported record first quarter net income of $178 million, which compares
with net income of $134 million in the first quarter of 1993. Fully
diluted earnings per share in the first quarter of 1994 were a record
$1.75 compared with $1.30 per share in the same period last year, an
increase of 35%. The gain on the sale of a portion of the Company's
interest in Wing Hang Bank, Ltd. in Hong Kong, which was partially offset
by a restructuring charge related to National Community Division, added
a net 12 cents to earnings per share this quarter.

<PAGE> 2.

Net interest income, on a taxable equivalent basis, increased $16
million or 4% to $396 million from the first quarter of 1993. The Company
noted widened spreads and increasing loan demand during the first quarter. 
Credit card growth remained especially strong. There was also growth in
other consumer loans, as well as in middle market and large corporate
lending.
Fee income was strong, especially from securities and other
processing, syndications and factoring. A lower provision for loan losses
and continued control of operating expenses contributed to higher
earnings. 
The Company's Board of Directors today declared a quarterly common
stock cash dividend of 55 cents per share, a 22% increase over the 45
cents previously paid. This increase will result in an annual rate of
$2.20 per share, the highest in the Company's history, surpassing the
previous high of $2.12 per share paid in 1990. The new dividend is
payable on May 6, 1994 to holders of record as of the close of business
on April 22, 1994.
The Company's Board also declared a 2-for-1 common stock split, which
will be paid after the cash dividend. On May 13, 1994, holders of record
as of the close of business on April 22, 1994 will receive one additional
share for every share held.
The Company announced today a plan to buy back, throughout the
remainder of this year, up to 2.5 million of its pre-split common shares. 
All shares purchased will be used in connection with certain employee
benefit plans or will be held as treasury shares.

<PAGE> 3.

The Company's estimated Tier I capital and total capital ratios were 
8.25% and 12.85% at March 31, 1994 compared with 8.87% and 13.65% at
December 31, 1993 and 8.26% and 12.90% at March 31, 1993. The decline in
these ratios from December 31, 1993 is primarily attributable to the
redemption of $156 million of preferred stock in the first quarter of
1994. The absence of this preferred stock will add approximately 7 cents
to annual per share earnings. Tangible common equity as a percent of
total assets was 6.84% at March 31, 1994 compared with 7.00% at December
31, and 6.41% one year ago.
Return on average assets in the first quarter of 1994 was 1.50%
compared with 1.32% in the fourth quarter of 1993 and 1.17% in the first
quarter of 1993. Return on average common equity was 18.55% in the first
quarter of 1994 compared with 16.16% in the fourth quarter of 1993 and
15.06% in the first quarter of 1993. Both return on assets and return on
equity for this quarter were records for the Company.
Stockholders' equity was reduced by $3 million as a result of the
adoption of FAS 115, which relates to unrealized gains and losses on
securities available for sale.

31, 1994 compared with $970 million, or 3.17% of loans at December 31,
1993. 

NET INTEREST INCOME
- -------------------
On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest income amounted to $396 
million in the first quarter of 1994, compared with $380 million in the
same period of 1993, an increase of 4%. The net interest rate spread was
3.18% in the first quarter of 1994 compared with 3.12% in the fourth
quarter of 1993 and 3.11% one year ago. The net yield on interest earning
assets was 3.89% in the first quarter of 1994 compared with 3.83% in the
fourth quarter of 1993 and 3.82% in the same period last year. The spread

<PAGE> 6.

and yield benefitted modestly from the return of a portion of the
Company's credit card securitization to its balance sheet. 
There was continued strong performance in credit cards, as the number
of card accounts increased by 23% to 4.9 million and managed outstandings
were up by 21% to $6.3 billion from one year ago. Response rates to our
aggressive national direct-mail campaign have significantly exceeded
expectations so far this year. We will continue this program throughout
the remainder of 1994. The credit quality of our card portfolio continues
to be excellent. Delinquencies continue to decline. Net charge-offs as
a percentage of average outstandings were 3.13% in the first quarter of
1994, down significantly from 3.48% one year ago.

NONINTEREST INCOME
- ------------------
Noninterest income increased 6% to $350 million in the first quarter,
compared with $330 million in the same period last year. 
Securities processing fees were $88 million for the first quarter of
1994 and $76 million for the first quarter of 1993, an increase of 16%. 
Most areas contributed to the increase. Among the strongest were
corporate trust, government securities clearance, master trust and mutual
fund custody. Other processing fees, principally funds transfer, deposit
services, and trade finance, were $42 million for the first quarter of
1994, compared with $38 million in the same period last year, an increase
of 11%.
Service charges and fees were $119 million in the first quarter of
1994, compared with $114 million in the first quarter of last year. In
the first quarter, noninterest income attributable to the Company's credit
card securitization was $4 million less than the comparable period of last
year due to a portion of these assets returning to the balance sheet. 

<PAGE> 7.

Securities gains were $12 million in the first quarter of 1994
compared with $26 million in the same period last year.
Other noninterest income was $56 million and $44 million for the
first quarters of 1994 and 1993. Foreign exchange profits and trading
activities were $16 million and $23 million in the first quarters of 1994
and 1993. Also included in other noninterest income for 1994 is a pre-tax
gain of $22 million ($14 million after-tax) related to the sale of a
portion of the Company's interest in Wing Hang Bank, Ltd., which was
partially offset by a $3 million restructuring charge related to National
Community Division (NCD). 

NONINTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME TAXES
- ------------------------------------
Total noninterest expense increased 3% to $403 million in the first
quarter from $391 million in 1993. Other real estate expense decreased
to $2 million from $9 million in the first quarter of 1993. 
Salaries increased 5% in the first quarter to $153 million from $146
million in the same period last year. Excluding the $3 million
restructuring charge related to NCD, salaries increased 3%. Profit-
sharing increased to $16 million from $13 million in last year's first
quarter. Other employee benefits -- primarily incentive compensation and
health care expenses -- were up 4% from the first quarter of last year. 
The effective tax rate for the first quarter of 1994 was 37.5%
compared with 36.8% for the first quarter of 1993.
