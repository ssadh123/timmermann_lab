ITEM 2: ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

Note 11 of Item 1 of the Form 10-Q of Cadence Design Systems, Inc.
(the "Registrant") for the quarter ended June 30, 1994, and item 5 of the Form
10-Q/A, Amendment No. 1 to the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 1994
filed on November 14, 1994 (together, the "Second Quarter 1994 Form 10-Q") 
is incorporated herein by reference. The acquisition of Redwood Design 
Automation, Inc. ("Redwood") by the Registrant, as described therein, was 
closed on August 31, 1994.

ITEM 7: FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.

(a) Financial Statements of Businesses Acquired.

Pursuant to paragraph (a)(4) of Item 7 of Form 8-K, the following
financial statements were omitted from the disclosure contained in the Second
Quarter 1994 Form 10-Q but are filed herewith:

(i) Audited balance sheets of Redwood as of January 31, 1993 and
1994, the related audited statements of operations, stockholders' equity and
cash flows of Redwood for the years ended January 31, 1992, 1993 and 1994 and a
manually signed report of Arthur Andersen LLP with respect to the balance
sheets of Redwood as of January 31, 1993 and 1994 and the statements of
operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years ended January 31,
1992, 1993 and 1994, which are attached as Exhibit 99.01 hereto;

(ii) Unaudited balance sheet of Redwood as of July 31, 1994 and the
related unaudited statements of operations and cash flows of Redwood for the
six month periods ended July 31, 1993 and 1994, which are attached as Exhibit
99.02 hereto.

(b) Pro Forma Financial Information.

Pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of Item 7, the unaudited pro forma
condensed combined balance sheet of the Registrant and Redwood as of June 30,
1994 and the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statements of operations of
the Registrant and Redwood for the year ended December 31, 1993 and for the six
months ended June 30, 1994 are attached as Exhibit 99.03 hereto. The unaudited
pro forma condensed combined financial statements give effect to the merger of
the Registrant and Redwood on a purchase accounting basis. The pro forma
condensed combined balance sheet assumes the merger took place on June 30, 1994
and combines the June 30, 1994 balance sheet of the Registrant with the July
31, 1994 balance sheet of Redwood. The pro forma combined statements of income
assume that the merger took place as of the beginning of each company's most
recently completed fiscal year and combine the Registrant's historical results
for the year ended December 31, 1993 and the six months ended June 30, 1994
with the corresponding results for Redwood for its fiscal year ended January
31, 1994 and the six months ended July 31, 1994, respectively. The pro forma
information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily
indicative of the operating results or financial position that would have
occurred had the acquisition of Redwood by the Registrant been consummated at
the beginning of the periods presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of
future operating results or financial position. These pro forma financial
statements are based on and should be read in conjunction with the historical
consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto of the
Registrant and Redwood.

TOGETHER WITH AUDITORS' REPORT
<PAGE> 3

Report of Independent Public Accountants

To Redwood Design Automation, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Redwood Design
Automation, Inc. (a California corporation in the development stage) and
subsidiaries as of January 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended January 31, 1994, and for the period from
inception (January 2, 1991) to January 31, 1994. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Redwood Design Automation,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of January 31, 1994 and 1993, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
January 31, 1994, and for the period from inception to January 31, 1994, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

REDWOOD DESIGN AUTOMATION, INC.
(A development stage company)

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

JANUARY 31, 1994

1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY:

Redwood Design Automation, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated on January 2,
1991 for the purpose of designing, developing and marketing software for use in
Electronic System Design. The Company's products are software tools which
allow engineers to use visualization technologies to analyze and verify the
design of hardware and software for integrated circuits and printed circuit
boards. To date, the Company's efforts have been focused on raising capital of
approximately $10.5 million, developing its products and applications,
establishing marketing channels and recruiting personnel.

The Company is in the development stage and, consequently, is subject to risks
associated with a development stage company, including reliance on key
individuals, competition from larger, more established entities, continued need
for additional financing and rapid technological changes.

During fiscal 1993, the Company changed its fiscal year from December 31 to
January 31. Although the Company was incorporated on January 2, 1991, its
activities during the first month were limited; consequently, the financial
statements for the year ended January 31, 1992, are for the period from
inception.

In August 1994, all of the Company's outstanding stock was acquired by Cadence
Design Systems, Inc.(see Note 10).

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and
its two wholly-owned subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany
transactions and balances. Cumulative gains and losses from the translation of
the foreign subsidiaries' financial statements, which were insignificant, have
been included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of
operations.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all
investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. As of January 31, 1994 and 1993, all of the Company's cash was
deposited in checking, money market accounts and in short-term certificates of
deposit.

Supplemental Disclosure of Non-Cash Investing and Financing Activities

The Company acquired property and equipment by entering into capital lease
obligations in the amounts of approximately $480,000, $370,000 and $350,000 in
fiscal 1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Software Development Costs

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86, the
Company capitalizes eligible computer software development costs upon the
establishment of technological feasibility, which it has defined as completion
of a working model. As of January 31, 1994, the amount of eligible costs to be
capitalized has been minimal and, accordingly, the Company has not capitalized
any software development costs.

Depreciation and Amortization

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization is
provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets (two to three years) or the term of the lease.

Revenue Recognition

Revenues from software licenses are recognized upon shipment of the software if
there are no, or insignificant, post-delivery obligations and payment is due
within one year.

The Company's support agreements generally call for the Company to provide
technical support and certain updates to customers. Revenue on support and
software update rights is recognized ratably over the term of the support
agreement.

3. CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS:

The Company leases certain equipment, software, furniture and fixtures under
capital lease agreements with a net book value of approximately $615,000 at
January 31, 1994. Future minimum lease payments at January 31, 1994 are
summarized as follows:

In connection with the above leases, the Company has issued warrants to
purchase 74,728 and 71,739 shares of common stock at $.92 and $.836 per share,
respectively. These warrants may be exercised at any time and expire on the
earlier of the effective date of an initial public offering or ten years from
the execution of the warrant agreements (April 2002 and July 2001). No value
has been assigned to these warrants in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements.

4. COMMITMENTS:

The Company leases three office facilities under operating leases that extend
through August 1996. One lease agreement contains a provision that allows the
Company to terminate the lease by providing six months notice. However, in the
event the Company does terminate the lease before the full term of such lease,
the Company must pay the balance on certain leasehold improvements (at January
31, 1994, the balance was approximately $28,300). In addition, the lease
agreement provides for graduated rental payments. The Company has recorded
rent expense on a straight-line basis and, as a result, the Company has
recorded deferred rent in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
$6,042 and $15,506 as of January 31, 1994 and 1993, respectively. The minimum
future lease commitments are approximately:

</TABLE>

Rent expense for the years ended January 31, 1994, 1993 and 1992 and the period
from inception to January 31, 1994 was approximately $180,000, $88,000, $50,000
and $318,000, respectively.

5. CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK:

The relative rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions granted to or
imposed on the respective classes of the shares of capital stock or the holders
thereof are as follows:

Dividends

The holders of Series B and C preferred stock are entitled to receive 
dividends at a rate of $.092 and $.114 per share per annum, 
respectively payable in preference to any payment of dividends on 
Series A or common stock. In turn, holders of Series A preferred
stock are entitled to receive dividends at a rate of $.05 per share
per annum, payable in preference to any payment of dividends on
common stock. The dividends are not cumulative and do not accrue 
unless declared by the Board of Directors.

<PAGE> 11
- 4 -

Liquidation Preference

In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, or
any merger or sale of all or substantially all the assets of the Company,
holders of Series B and Series C preferred stock are entitled to receive, in
preference to holders of Series A and common stock, the amount of $.92 and
$1.14 per share, respectively. Such amounts will be adjusted for any
recapitalization as defined, plus all declared but unpaid dividends. In turn,
holders of Series A are entitled to receive, in preference to holders of common
stock, the amount of $.50 per share for each share of Series A, adjusted for
any recapitalization as defined, plus all declared but unpaid dividends. After
payment of the above amounts first to the Series B and C stockholders and then
to the Series A stockholders, any remaining assets would then be distributed
ratably between the Series A, B and C stockholders and the common stockholders
on an as-converted basis.

Voting Rights

The holders of the Series A, B and C preferred stock are entitled to the number
of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which such
preferred stock is convertible as of the record date.

Conversion

Each share of Series A, B and C preferred stock is convertible into 1.1, 1.1
and 1 share, respectively, of common stock, subject to adjustment for dilution,
at the option of the holder thereof, at any time after the date of issuance.
In addition, each share of preferred stock will automatically convert into
common stock at the then conversion price upon a majority vote by the holders
of each series of preferred stock or upon the closing of an initial public
offering of the Company's common stock at not less than $5.00 per share and an
aggregate offering price of not less than $10,000,000.

Right to Purchase Additional New Securities

The holders of Series B and C preferred stock are entitled to purchase a
portion of certain new securities, which the Company may propose to issue, in
order that the holders of Series B and C may maintain a pro rata ownership
interest in the Company.

Registration Rights

The Series B and C stockholders are entitled to certain demand registration
rights (if at least 40% of the Series B and Series C stockholders so request)
or to certain piggyback registration rights (in the event the Company elects to
register additional securities after the completion of an initial public
offering).

6. COMMON STOCK:

The Company has authorized 25,000,000 shares of common stock. In July 1991,
the Company effected a 1.1 for 1 stock split whereby each outstanding share of
common stock was split and converted into 1.1 shares of common stock. All
common stock shares and per share prices have been adjusted for this stock
split.

1991 Employee Stock Plan

In 1991, the Company adopted the 1991 Employee Stock Plan (the "Plan") to
provide additional incentives for employees and consultants and authorized the
issuance of 1,925,000 shares thereunder. During March 1993, the Board of
Directors authorized an increase of 500,000 shares to be issued under the Plan.
Under the Plan, the Board of Directors may grant incentive stock options,
nonstatutory stock options, or stock purchase rights to employees or
consultants. The price per share is to be determined by the Board of Directors
and may not be less than 85% of the fair market value on the date of grant for
nonstatutory stock options or stock purchase rights and not less than fair
value for incentive stock options. The options and stock purchase rights
generally vest ratably over a five-year period from the commencement date in
the case of new employees or from the grant date for existing employees or
consultants. The stock options or stock purchase rights expire after 10 years
if not exercised.

Below is a summary of activity under the above plan for the period from
inception to January 31, 1994:

the right of first refusal to repurchase any vested shares at the then fair
value, or repurchase unvested shares, at the original purchase price. In the
event the Company is unable to or elects not to exercise such rights, the
holders of the Series B and Series C preferred stock have a right of first
refusal, subordinate to the Company's right, to purchase on a pro rata basis
shares not repurchased by the Company. Of the 2,212,850 shares of common stock
outstanding as of January 31, 1994, 773,833 unvested shares are subject to
repurchase at the original purchase price.

events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. 

<PAGE> 14
- 7 -

A valuation allowance is recognized to the extent that deferred tax assets are

PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
reflect the acquisition by Cadence Design Systems, Inc. ("the Company") of
Redwood Design Automation, Inc. ("Redwood") in exchange for approximately
419,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The acquisition was accounted 
for using the purchase method of accounting. The pro forma condensed combined 
balance sheet assumes the merger took place on June 30, 1994 and combines the 
June 30, 1994 balance sheet of the Company with the July 31, 1994 balance sheet 
of Redwood. The pro forma combined statements of operations assume that the 
merger took place as of the beginning of each company's most recently completed 
fiscal year and combines the Company's statements of operations for the year 
ended December 31, 1993 and the six months ended June 30, 1994 with Redwood's 
statements of operations for the year ended January 31, 1994 and the six months
ended July 31, 1994, respectively. The pro forma statements of operations do 
not include the effect of any nonrecurring charges directly attributable to the 
acquisition.

The pro forma combined statements of operations are not necessarily indicative
of operating results which would have been achieved had the merger been
consummated as of the beginning of such periods and should not be construed as
representative of future operations.

The pro forma combined condensed financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and the
related notes thereto of the Company for the year ended December 31, 1993,

NOTES TO PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. In August 1994 the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Redwood
Design Automation, Inc. ("Redwood") for approximately 419,000 shares of the
Company's common stock. The purchase price also includes $2.5 million of
advances made to Redwood, prior to the acquisition, of which $.7 million was
offset against the cash of Redwood as of the closing date and the remaining
amount of $1.8 million was not repaid. Redwood was a development stage company
formed to design, develop and market software for use in electronic system
design. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase. In connection with
the acquisition, net intangibles of $6.8 million were acquired of which $4.7
million was allocated to research and development in process and will be
charged to operations as the technology had not achieved technological
feasibility and had no alternative future use. The remaining $2.1 million will
be amortized over a useful life of two years. The pro forma combined condensed
financial statements reflect the combined operations of the two companies.

The pro forma combined condensed statements of operations for the year ended
December 31, 1993 and six months ended June 30, 1994 exclude the impact of the
one-time charge associated with expensing in-process research and development
as it had not reached technological feasibility. The charge is included in the
Company's results of operations for the quarter in which the transaction closed
which was the third quarter of 1994.

2. The pro forma combined condensed financial statements included herein have
been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and
footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or
omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. However, the Company believes
that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not
misleading. These pro forma combined condensed financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto
included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 1993 and the financial statements of Redwood included in this
filing.

3. Net income per share for each period is calculated by dividing net 
income by the weighted average number of common stock and common stock 
equivalents out standing during the period plus approximately 419,000 shares 
of the Company's common stock which was exchanged for all outstanding shares 
of Redwood common and preferred stock. Common stock equivalents consist of
dilutive shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding common stock options 
and warrants. Net loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the 
weighted average number of shares of common stock. Fully diluted net income 
(loss) per share is substantially the same as primary net income (loss) per 
share.
