ITEM 2 ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On September 30, 1994, the Company entered into an agreement with American
Stores Company's subsidiaries, Acme Markets, Inc., American Stores Properties,
Inc. and American Stores Realty Corporation to acquire 45 supermarkets
("Acquired Supermarkets") currently operating under the Acme trade name in
north central and northeastern Pennsylvania and south central New York. The
purchase price for the stores is approximately $75 million plus the cost of
inventory (estimated to be approximately $19 million).

The 45 stores had aggregate revenues of approximately $358 million for the
year ended January 29, 1994. After an initial transition period, the
integration of a majority of these stores into the Company is expected to add
approximately 700,000 to 800,000 retail square feet to Penn Traffic's existing
operations and to generate annual revenues of approximately $260 million. During
the next 24 to 30 months, Penn Traffic plans to renovate or enlarge most of the
acquired stores at a total cost of $50 million.

The Company expects the acquisition, which is subject to various customary
conditions, to close by calendar year end.

Report of Independent Auditors

Board of Directors
Acme Markets, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of Acme
Markets, Inc. Supermarkets to be Acquired by The Penn Traffic Company (the
"Acquired Supermarkets") as of January 29, 1994 and January 30, 1993, and the
related statements of operating revenue and expenses for each of the two fiscal
years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
management of Acme Markets, Inc. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The accompanying statements of assets and liabilities and operating revenue and
expenses were prepared in connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement by and
between Acme Markets, Inc. and The Penn Traffic Company described in the Notes
to Financial Statements, and are not intended to be complete representations of
the operating revenue and expenses or the assets and liabilities of the Acquired
Supermarkets.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly the
assets and liabilities of the Acquired Supermarkets at January 29, 1994 and
January 30, 1993, and their operating revenue and expenses for each of the two
fiscal years then ended, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

Notes to Financial Statements

January 29, 1994

1. Basis of Presentation

On September 30, 1994, Acme Markets, Inc. and related entities entered into an
agreement (Asset Purchase Agreement) with The Penn Traffic Company to sell 45
grocery stores located in northeastern Pennsylvania and southern upstate New
York hereinafter referred to as the Acquired Supermarkets. Acme Markets, Inc.
is an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of American Stores Company. Acme
Markets, Inc. operated supermarkets in certain buildings which, in addition to
the related land, were owned or leased by related entities. For purposes of
these statements, cost, accumulated depreciation and depreciation expense or
rent expense related to these properties, as recorded by the related entities,
have been reflected as if the property were owned or leased by the Acquired
Supermarkets. The fiscal year of the Acquired Supermarkets ends on the Saturday
nearest to January 31.

The statements of operating revenue and expenses presented herein differ from a
complete statement of operations in that certain allocations of indirect
charges, including, but not limited to, income tax expense, interest expense and
overhead costs incurred by the American Stores Company and Acme Markets, Inc.
have been excluded (see unaudited Note 5). Accordingly, the statements of
operating revenue and expenses do not include any overhead expenses related to
corporate, region and district offices.

Certain amounts reflected in the accompanying statements, including, but not
limited to, cost of merchandise sold, advertising, occupancy, operations and
other store expenses include allocated charges from related entities which are
based on sales, usage, and/or wages. These allocated charges amounted to
$6,341,000 in fiscal 1993 and $5,311,000 in fiscal 1992. Such allocated costs
included in the accompanying statements are not representative of the actual
results that would have resulted had the Acquired Supermarkets been operated as
a stand-alone entity. The Statements of Assets and Liabilities differ from a
complete balance sheet in that only those assets to be acquired and liabilities
assumed in connection with the Asset Purchase Agreement are included.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The FIFO (first-in,
first-out) or average cost methods are used to determine the cost of the
inventories.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization
charged to operations for financial statement purposes, including amortization
of property under capital leases, are computed using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful life of the asset, or over the remaining lease term if
shorter.

3. Leases

Certain stores are leased from unrelated third parties. Remaining initial lease
terms range from one to five years not including renewal options, and may
provide for contingent rent based on sales volume in excess of specified levels.
These additional rentals amounted to $256,000 in fiscal 1993 and $247,000 in
fiscal 1992.

The summary below shows the aggregate future minimum rent commitments as of
January 29, 1994 for both operating and capital leases.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

3. Leases (continued)

Rent expense was $1,686,000 for fiscal 1993 and $1,646,000 for fiscal 1992.

4. Pensions

Substantially all employees of the Acquired Supermarkets are covered under
union-sponsored defined benefit multiemployer plans, contributions to which are
made in accordance with negotiated labor contracts. The passage of the
Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (the "Act") may, under certain
circumstances, cause the Acquired Supermarkets to become subject to liabilities
in excess of contributions made under collective bargaining agreements.
Generally, liabilities are contingent upon the termination, withdrawal, or
partial withdrawal from the plans. Acme Markets, Inc. has not undertaken to
terminate, withdraw, or partially withdraw from any of these plans that could
result in a significant liability. Under the Act, liabilities would be based
upon employers' proportional share of each plan's unfunded vested benefits. The
Acquired Supermarkets contributed approximately $1,380,000 in 1993 and
$1,379,000 in 1992 to these plans.

5. Corporate, Region and District Overhead Allocations (Unaudited)

Various administrative and operational services to the Acquired Supermarkets are
provided directly by Acme Markets, Inc. or related entities. These
administrative services represent non-store functions including, but not limited
to, operational supervision, legal assistance, employee benefit administration,
human resources, treasury, accounting, audit, tax, real estate, buying,
information systems and management training. The costs are allocated based on
usage, wages, and/or sales, and are not necessarily indicative of costs that
would be incurred to run a stand-alone company. The allocations to the Acquired
Supermarkets for fiscal 1993 and 1992 were $6,279,000 and $6,860,000,
respectively. As discussed in the Basis of Presentation footnote above, none of
these costs are included in the statements of operating revenue and expenses.

Notes to Financial Statements (Unaudited)

July 30, 1994

1. General

The accompanying unaudited statements of assets and liabilities and operating
revenue and expenses have been prepared by Acme Markets, Inc. (Acme) and, in the
opinion of the management of Acme, include all adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation of net assets and store
operations (also see "Basis of Presentation" below). The statements of
operating revenue and expenses are not necessarily indicative of the results to
be expected for the full year. These financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the January 29, 1994 audited financial statements and notes
thereto included elsewhere in this filing.

2. Basis of Presentation

On September 30, 1994, Acme Markets, Inc. and related entities entered into an
agreement (Asset Purchase Agreement) with The Penn Traffic Company to sell 45
grocery stores located in northeastern Pennsylvania and southern upstate New
York hereinafter referred to as the Acquired Supermarkets. Acme Markets, Inc.
is an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of American Stores Company. Acme
Markets, Inc. operated supermarkets in certain buildings which, in addition to
the related land, were owned or leased by related entities. For purposes of
these statements, cost, accumulated depreciation, and depreciation expense or
rent expense related to these properties, as recorded by the related entities,
have been reflected as if the property were owned or leased by the Acquired
Supermarkets.

The accompanying financial statements relate solely to the assets to be acquired
by The Penn Traffic Company and are not intended to represent the complete
financial position and results of operations of the Acquired Supermarkets.

The statements of operating revenue and expenses presented herein differ from a
complete statement of operations in that certain allocations of indirect
charges, including, but not limited to, income tax expense, interest expense and
overhead costs incurred by American Stores Company and Acme Markets, Inc. have
been excluded. Accordingly, the statements of operating revenue and expenses do
not include any expenses for, but not limited to, corporate,

region and district offices. The statements of operating revenue and expenses
contain the results of those stores that are to be acquired. Certain amounts,
including, but not limited to, cost of merchandise sold, advertising, occupancy,
operations and other store expenses include allocated charges which are based on
sales, usage, and/or wages. These allocated charges amounted to $4,743,000 and
$3,713,000 for the twenty-six weeks ended July 30, 1994 and July 31, 1993,
respectively. The allocated costs included in the accompanying statements are
not representative of the actual results that would have resulted had the
Acquired Supermarkets been operated as a stand-alone entity. The statements of
assets and liabilities differ from a complete balance sheet in that only those
assets to be acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with the Asset
Purchase Agreement are included.

ITEM 7 (B) PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR PURCHASE OF ACQUIRED SUPERMARKETS

THE PENN TRAFFIC COMPANY
PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Introduction

The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet and
unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of operations for The Penn Traffic
Company and subsidiaries ("Penn Traffic") gives effect to the following events
as though they had occurred at July 30, 1994, in the case of the unaudited pro
forma condensed consolidated balance sheet, and as of the beginning of the
applicable period, in the case of the unaudited pro forma consolidated
statements of operations:

a) The acquisition ("Acquisition") of 45 supermarkets expected to be
purchased from Acme Markets, Inc. and related entities ("Acme") for
$75 million plus inventory;

b) The issuance of $100 million in principal amount of Senior Notes at an
assumed interest rate of 10.5%;

c) The payment of expenses related to the foregoing; and

d) In the case of the unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of
operations for the year ended January 29, 1994 and the 26 weeks ended
July 31, 1993, the acquisition ("Insalaco Acquisition") of 12
supermarkets purchased from Insalaco Markets, Inc. ("Insalaco") in
September 1993.

The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet and unaudited
pro forma consolidated statements of operations are based on certain assumptions
that may not prove to be accurate and are not necessarily indicative of the
actual financial position or results of operations which would have existed or
been realized if the foregoing events had taken place at the dates indicated
above or which may exist or be realized in the future. For each 1/8 of 1%
change in assumed interest rate on the Senior Notes, pro forma interest expense
and pro forma net income would change by $125,000 and $75,000 per year or
$62,500 and $37,500 per twenty-six week period, respectively.

Under purchase accounting, tangible and identifiable intangible assets
acquired will be recorded at their respective fair values. Complete information
regarding the fair values of assets to be acquired is not available. As such,
the allocation of the excess of purchase cost over net assets acquired has been
estimated for purposes of this pro forma presentation. The valuations and other
studies which will provide the basis for such an allocation have not progressed
to a stage where there is sufficient information to make a final allocation in
the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information presented.
Accordingly, the purchase accounting adjustments made in connection with the
development of the unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information are
preliminary and have been made solely for purposes of developing the unaudited
pro forma consolidated financial information.

NOTES TO THE PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS

The combined statements of operations for the 26 weeks ended July 30, 1994 and
July 31, 1993, and the 52 weeks ended January 29, 1994, adjusted to give effect
to the following pro forma adjustments:

(1) Presents the unaudited statements of operations of The Penn Traffic
Company and consolidated subsidiaries for the 26 weeks ended
July 31, 1993 and the 52 weeks ended January 29, 1994, adjusted to give
effect to the acquisition of the 12 stores acquired from Insalaco by Penn
Traffic in September 1993 as though it had occurred at the beginning of
the applicable period. See Item 7(c) included herein for the combined
unaudited pro forma statement of operations for the 26 weeks ended
July 31, 1993 and the 52 weeks ended January 29, 1994.

(2) To eliminate the operating results of certain of the Acquired Supermarkets
expected to be closed by Penn Traffic.

(3) To reclassify certain of the Acquired Supermarkets expenses to be
consistent with Penn Traffic.

(4) To reclassify a non-recurring item related to a voluntary employee
separation program at the Acquired Supermarkets as an unusual item.
Adjustment made to achieve consistency with Penn Traffic presentation.

(5) To adjust depreciation and amortization expense to be consistent with the
adjusted bases of fixed assets and leases acquired and goodwill recorded.

(6) To record interest expense on the proposed senior debt offering at an
assumed interest rate of 10.5%. For each 1/8 of 1% change in assumed
interest rate on the Senior Notes, pro forma interest expense and pro forma
net income would change by $125,000 and $75,000 per year or $62,500 and
$37,500 per twenty-six week period, respectively.

(7) To adjust the provision for income taxes for the impact of the acquisition.

NOTE: Penn Traffic anticipates that it will incur certain non-store expenses
as a result of the acquisition of these stores. However, the Company
expects these expenses will be more than offset by savings in
distribution and other expenses. Neither the non-store expenses nor
the savings are included in the pro forma adjustments.

The Supplemental Pro Forma Financial Information presented below was derived
from the audited financial statements of the Acquired Supermarkets for the 52
weeks ended January 29, 1994, and from the unaudited financial statements
of the Acquired Supermarkets for the 26 weeks ended July 30, 1994 and July 31,
1993 adjusted to give effect to the pro forma adjustments outlined above.

transfer of immediately available funds in such amount to the bank account
or accounts designated by Seller (or by such other means as are agreed upon
by Buyer and Seller);

(ii) assumption agreements, leases or subleases with respect to
the Contracts and Leases substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit 2.4A or in such other form (including indemnities consistent with
this Agreement) as shall be reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller;

(iii) a certificate of Buyer (signed on behalf of Buyer by its
President or a Vice President) that the condition set forth in Section 9.1
has been satisfied (except as waived by Seller);

(iv) the opinion of counsel described in Section 9.6;

(v) incumbency certificates with respect to the officers of
Buyer who execute this Agreement and any other agreements, certificates or
other documents in connection with the Asset Purchase;

(vi) the insurance certificates required by Section 5.13; and

(vii) the agreement attached as Exhibit 2.4B hereto.

Section 2.5 ENCUMBRANCES; LEASES. (a) If any party whose
consent is required to assign the Leases to Buyer refuses or fails to give its
written consent to an assignment of any Lease, or conditions its consent on
terms unacceptable to Seller or Buyer, then in lieu of assigning such Lease to
Buyer, and with no adjustment in the Purchase Price, Seller and Buyer shall, to
the extent permitted under such Lease, enter into a sublease of the premises
demised pursuant to such Lease on the Primary Closing Date on a fully-net basis
and on such terms as will generally confer and impose upon Buyer, as sublessee,
during the term of such sublease (including all renewal periods available under
the Lease), all of Seller's rights and obligations with respect to such premises
(exclusive of Seller's leasehold estate therein) on the terms set forth in
Exhibit 2.5. If either (i) any party whose consent is required to sublease to
Buyer the premises demised pursuant to such Lease as contemplated by the
preceding sentence refuses or fails to give its written consent to such
sublease, or conditions its consent on terms

- 16 -
<PAGE>

unacceptable to Seller or Buyer, or (ii) immediately prior to the consummation
of the Asset Purchase there exists a default (or an event which, with the giving
of notice or lapse of time, would become a default) on Seller's part under such
Lease which permits the landlord to terminate such Lease prior to the scheduled
expiration of its term (which default has not been cured or permanently waived)
and Seller does not agree to indemnify Buyer against early termination of such
Lease up to the product of .21 multiplied by the 1993 Sales for such property,
then, subject to Sections 8.4 and 9.4, the absence of any such required consent
or the existence of such default or potential default shall not be a basis for
failing to consummate the Asset Purchase on the Primary Closing Date and, at
Buyer's option, either (i) Buyer shall accept the assignment of such Lease (or
sublease such Property) notwithstanding the absence of such consent or the
existence of such default or (ii) Buyer shall, by written notice to Seller not
less than 5 business days prior to the Primary Closing Date, designate such
Property as an Excepted Property and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an
amount equal to the sum of (i) the product of (x) .21 multiplied by (y) the 1993
Sales for such Excepted Property and (ii) to the extent Seller has not exercised
its rights pursuant to the first sentence of Section 2.5(b), the purchase price
for the related Inventory, Supplies and Prepaid Expenses calculated in
accordance with Section 2.3 with respect to such Excepted Property and the
related Assets thereon. In the event Buyer accepts the assignment of the Lease
(or sublease such Property) notwithstanding the absence of any such required
consent or the existence of any such default or potential default, Buyer shall
indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties against any Covered Liabilities
relating to the absence of such consent or the existence of such default. In
the event such Property becomes an Excepted Property, and at any time during the
Consent Period, Seller obtains any required consent to assignment or sublease,
or cures, or obtains a waiver to, any such default, Seller shall so notify Buyer
in writing and, as promptly as practicable and in any event within 30 days after
Buyer has received such notice from Seller, Buyer shall assume such Lease (or
enter into such sublease, as the case may be) and purchase the related Assets
thereon at the purchase price equal to the sum of (i) the product of (x) .21
multiplied by (y) the 1993 Sales for such Excepted Property and (ii) to the
extent Seller has not exercised its rights pursuant to the first sentence of
Section 2.5(b), the purchase price for the related Inventory, Supplies and
Prepaid Expenses calculated pursuant to Section 2.3 as of the Delayed Closing
Date.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.5 to the
contrary, with respect to any Stores that become Excepted Properties under this
Agreement, Seller shall have the right to

- 17 -
<PAGE>

close such Stores and sell the Inventory and the Supplies located thereon to
Buyer on the Primary Closing Date at the purchase price therefor calculated in
accordance with Section 2.3 less all reasonable costs incurred by Buyer in
transferring such Inventory and Supplies to its stores and warehouses in
Pennsylvania. Seller shall be entitled, if during the Consent Period it shall
cure such defect as shall have caused any such Stores to become an Excepted
Property as provided in this Agreement, to convey or lease (as the case may be)
such closed Stores to Buyer, and Buyer shall pay a purchase price for such
Property equal to the sum of (i) the product of (x) .21 multiplied by (y) the
1993 Sales for such Excepted Property and (ii) to the extent Seller has not
exercised its rights pursuant to the first sentence of Section 2.5(b), the
purchase price for the related Inventory, Supplies and Prepaid Expenses
calculated pursuant to Section 2.3 as of the Delayed Closing Date. If Seller
elects to continue to operate any Stores that become Excepted Properties, at
Seller's request, Buyer shall enter into a commercially reasonable supply
agreement to supply to such Excepted Properties at the invoice cost Buyer
charges to its own stores (including freight) the same merchandise supplied to
Buyer's own stores for a period not exceeding the Consent Period.

Section 2.6 INVENTORIES; COMPUTATION OF THE INVENTORY PURCHASE
PRICE. (a) The purchase price for the Inventory and the Supplies in the Stores
shall be determined as follows:

or Store Cost
--------------------

*General Merchandise 59.52%

*Cigarettes 59.52%
Seafood Store Cost
Floral Store Cost

presence of a representative of Buyer and in accordance with instructions
consistent with

- 18 -
<PAGE>

Seller's standard inventory policy (or, in the case of Supplies, according
to a procedure reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller).

"Store Cost" shall mean the delivered cost of an item being
inventoried from the vendor to the Stores directly or to Seller's or its
Affiliates' distribution centers (inclusive of vendor freight and delivery
costs imposed on Seller and its Affiliates), net of warehousing costs and
net of transportation costs from Seller's or its Affiliates' distribution
centers to the Stores.

"Retail" shall mean the price for an item defined in Seller's standard
inventory policy.

"Out-of-Date Seasonal" means items that are sold only at a time of the
year relating to a specific holiday or season (other than Thanksgiving and
Christmas, the items relating to which shall be valued at the same
percentage of Retail Cost reduction factor as general merchandise).

(b) A physical count of the Inventory and the Supplies shall be
made by Seller (with Buyer's representatives present) and, to the extent set
forth below, Washington Inventory Service, or to the extent Washington Inventory
Service is not able to perform such functions at all locations, an inventory
counting service jointly selected by Seller and Buyer (collectively, the
"Inventory Service"). The Inventory Service will inventory the general
merchandise, grocery, cigarettes and liquor at the Stores. A physical count of
the Inventory located at the Stores will be made beginning 2 days prior to the
Primary Closing Date, on the Primary Closing Date and ending 1 day after the
Primary Closing Date in accordance with a schedule mutually agreeable to Buyer
and Seller, in each case in accordance with instructions consistent with
Seller's standard inventory policy (or, in the case of Supplies, according to a
procedure reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Seller); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no
items shall be deemed "unsaleable" and no reduction shall be made in the amounts
specified in paragraph (a) above based upon the condition or salability of such
merchandise, except that date-coded merchandise which is out of date on the day
such inventory is counted and damaged and spoiled merchandise (which is not
returnable to the supplier for credit) shall not be counted or valued.
Consigned inventory shall be counted but not valued for purposes of calculating
the purchase price for the Inventory pursuant to this Section 2.6. Seller shall
have the right to sell Inventory at a discount prior to the Primary Closing
Date. Supplies in broken units shall be inventoried with the value provided in
paragraph (a) provided the inventory representatives

- 19 -
<PAGE>

reasonably believe such Supplies have some value. In connection with the
inventory of the Stores, a reconciliation shall be conducted that will reflect
the Inventory delivered to the Stores, or sold by the Stores, before or after
the Primary Closing Date and prior to or after such inventory counting, as the
case may be. Buyer assumes all liability and risk with respect to the sale, use
or non-use of the Inventory and the Supplies after Closing, and hereby reaffirms
that Seller is making no representation or warranty of any kind regarding the
condition, usefulness or fitness for any purpose of the Inventory or the
Supplies. Both parties shall have representatives present during the inventory
who shall ensure that all items have been inventoried and who shall approve in
writing all computations prior to leaving the premises. The parties agree to be
cooperative and reasonable in connection therewith. Buyer and Seller shall each
pay one-half of the cost of the Inventory Service.

Section 2.7 MERCHANDISE AND SUPPLIES IN TRANSIT. Merchandise and
Supplies ordered in the ordinary course of business, delivery of which is not
received on or prior to the Primary Closing Date by Seller, shall become the
property of Buyer. Buyer shall pay the vendor for the merchandise and supplies
in accordance with the invoice terms and conditions including any applicable
transportation charges, and Buyer shall not be entitled to reimbursement of all
or any portion of such payment from Seller. Seller shall reasonably cooperate
with Buyer with respect to Seller's orders for seasonal merchandise or other
orders which would be delivered to the Stores after the Primary Closing Date.
If Seller reasonably believes that all conditions to the Closing will be
satisfied, one week prior to the Primary Closing Date, Buyer shall have the
right at Buyer's expense to inspect all open order files for the Stores and
shall have the right at Buyer's expense to cancel orders for merchandise and
Supplies which would be delivered to the Stores after the Primary Closing Date,
if such orders can be cancelled without charge to Seller or if Buyer pays such
cancellation charge.

Section 2.8 PRORATIONS. (a) All rent (excluding percentage rent),
common area charges, utility charges (including, without limitation, those
related to Permits or Contracts), and other obligations, under the Contracts and
Leases assigned to Buyer hereunder shall be prorated on a daily basis as of
11:59 p.m on the day immediately preceding the Primary Closing Date
(collectively, the "Prorated Charges"). The Prorated Charges relating to the
period prior to the Primary Closing Date shall be allocated to and be the
obligation of Seller. The Prorated Charges relating to the period including and
subsequent

- 20 -
<PAGE>

to the Primary Closing Date shall be allocated to and be the obligation of
Buyer. On the Primary Closing Date, such prorations shall be based on actual,
current payments by Seller wherever possible and, to the extent such actual
amounts are not available, such prorations shall be estimated as of the Primary
Closing Date based on actual amounts for the most recent comparable billing
period; and Buyer and Seller shall settle and pay all amounts owing to each
other based thereon at the Closing. When the actual amounts become known, such
prorations shall be recalculated promptly thereafter by Buyer and Seller, and
Buyer and Seller shall make any additional payment or refund, as the case may
be, so that the corrected prorated amount shall have been paid by each of Buyer
or Seller, as the case may be, promptly, but in no event later than five
business days after calculation. For Excepted Properties conveyed to Buyer
after the Primary Closing Date, the Prorated Charges with respect to such
Excepted Property shall be prorated as of the Delayed Closing Date for such
Excepted Property.

(b) With respect to each of the Leases assigned to Buyer at the
Closing, Seller shall pay to Buyer, not later than ten days prior to the date
Buyer is obligated to pay percentage rent (if any) under such Lease, Seller's
prorated share of any percentage rent due for the lease year in which the
Primary Closing Date occurs. Seller's prorated share of percentage rent for any
Store shall be calculated by multiplying (i) a fraction, the numerator of which
is the amount of the relevant gross sales (or other relevant criterion) at such
Store from the first day of such lease year to but not including the Primary
Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the sum of Buyer's and Seller's
relevant gross sales (or other relevant criterion) at such Stores for the entire
lease year, by (ii) the amount of percentage rent due under the Lease for such
Store. Seller shall, not later than forty-five days prior to the date Buyer is
obligated to pay percentage rent for any Store, provide such information as
Buyer shall be required to submit to landlords under the Leases in connection
with the payment of percentage rent. Buyer shall promptly provide Seller with
copies of all percentage rent computations made pursuant to this Section, but in
no event shall such computation be provided to Seller later than ten days prior
to the date Seller is obligated to pay Buyer for its portion of such percentage
rent. For Excepted Properties conveyed to Buyer after the Primary Closing Date,
the prorated shares of any percentage rent with respect to such Excepted
Property shall be prorated as of the Delayed Closing Date for such Excepted
Property.

(c) Personal property taxes and real estate taxes and
assessments on the Assets for the tax year in which the

- 21 -
<PAGE>

Primary Closing Date falls (excluding any interest and penalties on, in lieu of
or for non-collection of or additions to any such taxes or assessments) shall be
prorated as of 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately preceding the Primary Closing
Date and Seller shall bear the portion thereof allocable to the portion of such
tax year ending at 11:59 p.m. on the day immediately preceding the Primary
Closing Date and Buyer shall bear the remainder. Any interest and penalties on,
in lieu of or for non-collection of or additions to any such taxes or
assessments shall be paid by the Person holding such Asset at the time such
interest or penalty accrues. If the tax statement for such tax year is in the
possession of the parties on the Primary Closing Date, payment of the prorated
Taxes shall be accomplished on such date. If the tax statement for the
applicable tax year is not in the possession of the parties on the Primary
Closing Date, the tax proration payment shall be based on the prior year's
Taxes. When the applicable tax statement is received, such prorations shall be
recalculated promptly thereafter by Buyer and Seller, and Buyer and Seller shall
make any additional payment or refund, as the case may be, so that the corrected
prorated amount shall have been paid by each of Buyer and Seller, as the case
may be, promptly, but in no event later than five business days after such
calculation. If the Seller or its Affiliates receive any tax bills relating to
the Assets after the Primary Closing Date, such tax bills shall be forwarded to
the Buyer within 20 days of receipt. For Excepted Properties conveyed to Buyer
after the Primary Closing Date, prorations with respect to any payments to be
made pursuant to this Section 2.8(c) with respect to such Excepted Property
shall be prorated as of the Delayed Closing Date for such Excepted Property.

Section 2.9 CONDEMNATION; DAMAGE OR DESTRUCTION. (a) In the event
of a loss, damage or destruction of any of the Stores or any of the other Assets
by fire or other casualty, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of such loss,
damage or destruction (the repair or replacement of which has not been completed
prior to Closing), this Agreement shall not be terminated, and the Closing shall
proceed as herein provided (with no reduction in the Purchase Price with respect
to such loss, damage or destruction except as provided below). If the loss,
damage or destruction can be repaired or replaced, Seller shall have the option
either to (i) pay Buyer at Closing an amount equal to the good faith estimate by
a qualified contractor selected by Seller (subject to the consent of Buyer,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) (the "Contractor") of the cost
of repair or replacement of such loss, damage or destruction (the "Estimate"),
and in such event Seller shall retain all insurance proceeds relating to such
casualty; or (ii) assign or pay to Buyer at Closing insurance proceeds payable
in

- 22 -
<PAGE>

respect of such loss, damage or destruction (including the amount of any
deductible or self-insurance) (the "Insurance Proceeds") equal to the Estimate,
or, if not equal to the Estimate, all Insurance Proceeds together with an amount
equal to (x) the Estimate MINUS (b) the Insurance Proceeds. If the loss, damage
or destruction cannot be repaired or replaced, such Property shall become an
Excepted Property.

(b) Seller shall promptly inform Buyer of a taking (or the
receipt of written notice regarding a threatened taking) of any of the Stores or
other Assets by condemnation or transfer in lieu thereof prior to the Primary
Closing Date. With respect to any condemnation proceedings pertaining to any of
the Stores, Seller shall assign Seller's claim under such condemnation
proceeding to Buyer if the condemnation award has not yet been made at the
Closing, and, if the condemnation award has been made to Seller after the date
of this Agreement, either (A) pay such "net award" to Buyer or (B) reduce the
purchase price payable for such Property by an amount equal to the "net award".
Seller agrees to keep Buyer informed of the existence and nature of any such
condemnation proceedings, and Seller shall not take any action materially
affecting the status of the same (including, without limitation, the amount of
the award) without the prior consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. As used in this paragraph (b), the phrase
"net award" shall mean all amounts paid by the condemning authority to Seller
after the date of this Agreement in connection with any condemnation proceeding
affecting a Property, less (A) the expense incurred by Seller in collecting such
amounts to the extent such amounts are not reimbursed by the condemning
authority, (B) that portion of any such award attributable to Seller's business
damages (as opposed to the value of such Property) incurred prior to the Primary
Closing Date and (C) that portion of any such award attributable to a temporary
taking which occurs prior to the Primary Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this paragraph (b) in the event Seller is obligated
to pay any portion of any such condemnation award to any third party pursuant to
any Monetary Encumbrances (or any agreement related thereto), Buyer shall not
receive such portion of such condemnation award, but the purchase price for the
applicable Property shall be reduced by an amount equal to the "net award" paid
by Seller to such third party pursuant to a Monetary Encumbrance in connection
with condemnation and, with respect to any remaining portion of such "net
award", Seller shall either (A) pay such portion of the "net award" to Buyer or
(B) reduce the purchase price payable for such Property by an amount equal to
such remaining portion of the "net award".

Section 2.10 STORE CASH; PREPAID EXPENSES. Not less than five
business days prior to the Primary Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a
written notice specifying the aggregate amount of Cash that Buyer requests be
retained at the Primary Closing Date at the Stores, and Seller shall use its
reasonable efforts to cause such amounts to be so retained. Not less than
fifteen days prior to the Primary Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a
schedule of Prepaid Expenses relating to the Assets, in reasonable detail as is
available to Seller, showing the amortized amount of such Prepaid Expenses as of
the Primary Closing Date. On the Primary Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to
Buyer a certificate setting forth the aggregate amount of (i) the Cash at all of
the Stores, which amount shall be based upon a counting of such Cash performed
by Seller as of the close of business on the date prior to the Primary Closing
Date (with Buyer having the right to be present), and (ii) the Prepaid Expenses
relating to the Assets.

Section 2.11 LIKE-KIND EXCHANGE. The parties hereto agree that, no
later than two days prior to the Closing Date, Seller may elect, for the purpose
of treating all or part of the sale of Assets hereunder as a like-kind exchange
of property ("Section 1031 Treatment") under Section 1031 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), that all or part of the cash
consideration payable to Seller hereunder shall be paid, in lieu thereof, by
Buyer to one or more qualified intermediaries, as defined in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4), to enable such qualified intermediary or
intermediaries designated by Seller to acquire property that is identified by
Seller on or before the day that is 45 days following the Closing Date and that
is transferred to Seller or an Affiliate on or before the day that is 180 days
following the Closing Date. Upon such election by Seller, Buyer agrees to
reasonably cooperate with Seller in taking such further actions that Seller
shall determine are reasonable and necessary in securing Section 1031 Treatment
for all or part of the Assets, including the further amendment to this
Agreement. Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer and hold Buyer harmless from any
cost, expense or liability arising from its cooperation. Seller and its
Affiliates shall be permitted to assign all or part of their rights under this
Agreement to one or more qualified intermediaries for the purpose of securing
Section 1031 Treatment hereunder, provided that such assignment shall in no way
release Seller from any of its agreements, representations, warranties and
indemnifications under this Agreement. The allocation agreed to by Buyer and
Seller pursuant to Section 7.5 hereof shall include a good faith estimate of the
fair market value of the Assets consisting of real property fee interests and
leasehold interests in reasonable detail, allocated among the Seller and its
Affiliates in

- 24 -
<PAGE>

accordance with their ownership of such interests. Seller's allocation of the
consideration pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code shall be appropriately
adjusted, in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.1060-1T(b)(4), to
reflect Section 1031 Treatment available to Seller hereunder. In no event shall
the use of a qualified intermediary hereunder delay the Closing of the sale of
Assets under this Agreement, and in the event Seller does not arrange for the
use of a qualified intermediary, the Closing shall occur pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement.

Section 3.2 AUTHORIZATION. All requisite corporate action has been
taken by Seller and its Affiliates to authorize the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby by
Seller. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Seller and
constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Seller (assuming this Agreement
is a valid and binding obligation of Buyer), enforceable in accordance with its
terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar
laws affecting creditors' rights and general equitable principles (whether
enforcement is sought in equity or at law). Except for consents required to
assign the Leases or as disclosed in Schedule 3.2, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Seller

- 25 -
<PAGE>

nor the consummation by Seller or any of its Affiliates of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will (i) violate any provision of the articles or
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of Seller or any of its Affiliates, (ii)
to Seller's knowledge, conflict with or result in a breach of any terms and
provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, contract
or other agreement to which Seller or its Affiliates is a party or by which
Seller or any of its Affiliates are bound that would materially interfere with
the consummation of the Asset Purchase or (iii) violate the terms of any option
to purchase, right of first refusal or other similar contractual right to
purchase any or all of the Stores in favor of any third party (other than an
Affiliate of ASC or Seller).

Section 3.3 TITLE. Subject only to the Permitted Exceptions and
the Monetary Encumbrances, Seller or one or more of its Affiliates have, or will
on the Primary Closing Date have, fee simple title to, or valid leasehold
interests in, as the case may be, all of the Stores, free and clear of all
mortgages, pledges, liens, encumbrances or security interests. Except as set
forth on Schedule 3.3 or in Seller's property and lease files, to the knowledge
of Seller neither Seller, nor any of its Affiliates, nor the landlord, is in
material default in the performance of any of its obligations under the Leases
or the Monetary Encumbrances nor has Seller received any notice of such default;
PROVIDED, however, that this representation shall not survive the Primary
Closing Date with respect to any Lease if Seller shall have delivered to Buyer
on the Primary Closing Date an estoppel certificate from the landlord that no
defaults exist with respect to such lease. To the knowledge of the officer of
Seller or any of its Affiliates responsible for the maintenance of such
corporation's property files, (i) Seller has delivered to Buyer, or otherwise
made available, originals or true copies of all deeds, leases and subleases
relating to the Stores and (ii) subject to Section 2.9, except as shown on
Schedule 3.3, there are no pending or threatened condemnation proceedings
relating to any Stores. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
amendments to any lease of a Property to which Seller or its Affiliates is a
party that are binding on Seller or its Affiliates and that are not included in
the property and lease files made available to Buyer or listed on Schedule 2.2B,
and as of the Primary Closing Date there will be no such amendments that are not
included in such files, of public record or in Buyer's title reports, except in
each case for any amendments which would not materially adversely affect Buyer
as lessee or as to which Seller has agreed to indemnify Buyer; PROVIDED,
however, that this representation shall not survive the Primary Closing Date (or
such later date the certificate hereinafter described is delivered to Buyer)
with respect to any lease if Seller shall

- 26 -
<PAGE>

have delivered to Buyer on the Primary Closing Date (or such later date the
certificate hereinafter described is delivered to Buyer) certificate from the
landlord for such Property identifying all amendments to such lease and all such
amendments identified with respect to such lease correspond with the amendments
provided to Buyer in Seller's property and lease files pursuant to this Section
3.3 except for such amendments that do not materially adversely affect Buyer as
lessee or as to which Seller has agreed to indemnify Buyer. If on or prior to
the Primary Closing Date, Buyer or Seller shall discover an amendment to any
lease of a Property to which Seller or its Affiliates is a party that (i) is not
a Permitted Exception and (ii) would materially adversely affect Buyer as lessee
thereunder, such Property shall not be designated an Excepted Property, but
Seller shall indemnify Buyer against the direct costs of such previously
undisclosed amendment, subject to the provisions of Article XI hereof. Each
party hereto shall give written notice to the other party promptly after the
discovery of any such amendment. One or more of Seller and Seller's Affiliates
have good title to the Inventory, the Supplies, and the Equipment to be
transferred hereunder on the Primary Closing Date free and clear of all liens
and encumbrances except for property taxes not yet due and payable. For Stores
5410 (Elmira), 5524 (Ashland) and 5531 (Berwick), Seller will in each case
either (i) provide evidence that the lease's terms have been duly renewed,
(ii) obtain an acknowledgement from Seller's landlord, in form reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer, that the subject lease term has been renewed, or
(iii) indemnify Buyer against any failure to renew.

Section 3.4 CONTRACTS. Except for the Monetary Encumbrances, the
Leases, the Collective Bargaining Agreements, purchase orders or similar
agreements for merchandise, or Contracts that Seller agrees to remove prior to
the Primary Closing Date or agrees to indemnify Buyer against any Covered
Liabilities with respect thereto, or as disclosed in Schedule 3.4, and except
for any Contracts entered into after the date hereof with Buyer's consent, there
are no Contracts to which Seller is a party with respect to the Stores that (i)
involve payments in excess of $50,000 in any one year that cannot be terminated
prior to an expenditure of $50,000 or less, (ii) that cannot be terminated
without penalty prior to December 31, 1994, or (iii) are continuity agreements
or consignment agreements, in each case which apply to more than one Store. To
Seller's knowledge, Seller has provided Buyer true and complete copies of all
written Contracts reflected on Schedule 3.4, except for any such items (i) the
failure to so provide would not materially change the contract to the detriment
of Buyer, (ii) as to which Seller cures or removes the obligation prior to
Closing, or (iii) as to which Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer.

<PAGE>

Section 3.5 LITIGATION. To Seller's knowledge, except as set forth
in Schedule 3.5, there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending, and Seller
has not received written notice of any threatened actions, suits or proceedings,
which could reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect Seller's or
Seller's Affiliates' ownership or title to the Assets, result in any material
adverse change in the condition or value of the Assets taken as a whole or
prevent the Closing.

Section 3.6 LABOR UNIONS. Except as is set forth on Schedule 3.6,
no labor union has been certified or designated by the National Labor Relations
Board as bargaining agent for any of the employees of Seller at any of the
Stores. Seller has delivered to Buyer true, correct and complete copies of the
collective bargaining agreements (together with any and all amendments thereto)
set forth on Schedule 3.6 as in effect on the date hereof.

Section 3.7 STORAGE TANKS AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. Except as set
forth in Schedule 3.7 or as disclosed in the Phase I Inspection conducted by
Buyer pursuant to Section 5.11, to the knowledge of the President and Controller
of Acme, Barbara Russell and Phil Pichulo (collectively, the "Responsible
Individuals"), there are no underground storage tanks (exclusive of septic tanks
and drainage retention tanks) beneath any of the Stores. To the knowledge of
the Responsible Individuals as of the date of this Agreement, except as set
forth in Schedule 3.7, (A) there is no contamination from Hazardous Materials
located upon any of the Stores that requires remediation based on the Least
Stringent Remediation Standard under all Environmental Laws; and (B) neither
Seller nor its Affiliates have received any written notice of violation of
Environmental Laws from any governmental authority with respect to any violation
at any of the Stores that has not been fully complied with. Except as set forth
on Schedule 3.7, there are no liabilities and obligations under Environmental
Laws actually caused prior to the Primary Closing Date by Seller, its employees,
agents, licensees operating in the Stores, contractors or subcontractors for
releases of Hazardous Materials at the Stores (other than the Owned Properties).

Section 3.8 SCHEDULES AND EXHIBITS. Disclosure of any fact or item
in any Schedule or Exhibit or Seller's property and lease files furnished to
Buyer hereto referenced by a particular paragraph or section in this Agreement
shall, should the existence of the fact or item or its contents be relevant to
any other paragraph or section, be deemed to be disclosed with respect to that
other paragraph or section whether or not an explicit cross-reference appears.
Matters reflected in the

- 28 -
<PAGE>

schedules and exhibits hereto are not necessarily limited to matters required by
the Agreement to be disclosed herein or therein. Such additional matters are
provided for information purposes only.

Section 3.9 SALES AND PAYROLL INFORMATION. The 1993 Sales figures
for each Store attached as Schedule 1.1A and the historical payroll information
for selected Stores provided to Buyer by letters of Messrs. Walt Rubel and Greg
Spencer, respectively, were compiled by Seller in the ordinary course of
business for internal use consistent with Seller's past practice. The 1993
sales figures for each Store attached as Schedule 1.1A are accurate in all
material respects (which, for purposes of this representation only, means a
margin of error of plus or minus 5% per Store). Since March 31, 1994, except in
the ordinary course of Seller's business, there has not been any increase in the
salaries, wages or benefits paid or payable under Seller's employee benefit
plans, policies and programs to those Seller's Employees not covered by the
Collective Bargaining Agreements.

Section 3.10 ERISA.

(a) ABSENCE OF LIENS. No asset of the Seller or any Affiliate,
which is to be acquired by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, is now or will, as
of the Closing Date, be subject to any lien or security interest under Code
Section 401(a)(29), ERISA Section 302(f) or Code Section 412(n), Code Section
412(f), ERISA Section 4068 or arising out of any action filed under ERISA
Section 4301(b).

(b) MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN WITHDRAWAL LIABILITIES. Based solely on
the most recent actuarial reports furnished to Seller by any multiemployer plan,
within the meaning of ERISA Section 4001(a)(3), covering any of Seller's
Employees employed at, or with respect to, the Stores, no withdrawal liability
under ERISA Section 4201 would result from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement if the transactions had occurred between October 1, 1993 and September
30, 1994.

Section 3.11 LIMITATIONS ON SELLER'S REPRESENTATIONS. Buyer hereby
affirms and acknowledges that it has completed to its complete satisfaction its
due diligence investigation and review of the Assets. All of the Assets are
purchased by Buyer and sold by Seller and its Affiliates in an "AS IS"
CONDITION, "WITH ALL FAULTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BOTH LATENT AND PATENT
DEFECTS". EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, NO
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE BY SELLER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES
CONCERNING SUCH ITEMS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR

- 29 -

A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Buyer hereby affirms that Seller, its Affiliates, and the
agents, employees and/or attorneys of each thereof have not made, nor has Buyer
relied upon, any representation, warranty or promise with respect to the Assets
or any other subject matter of this Agreement except as expressly set forth in
this Agreement. Without limitation, Buyer acknowledges that, except as
expressly set forth to the contrary in this Agreement, no warranties or
representations, expressed or implied, have been made by Seller, its Affiliates,
and the agents, employees and/or attorneys of each thereof, or will be relied
upon, and Buyer agrees to release Seller for any claims with respect to the
general plan designation, zoning, value, use, tax status or physical condition
of the Assets, or any part thereof, including, without limitation, the flood
elevations, drainage patterns and soil and subsoils composition and compaction
level, existence of Hazardous Materials, asbestos and other conditions at the
Stores, or with respect to the accuracy of any boundary survey or other survey,
title report or commitment, soil report or any other plans or reports.

is understood and agreed that neither Buyer nor its representatives shall

mutually agreed upon by Seller and Buyer, Seller will cause its appropriate
management information systems representatives to meet with the appropriate
management information systems representatives of Buyer to discuss the software
portfolio of Seller's point-of-sale and other Store equipment; provided,
however, that, for purposes of such discussions, Seller shall either (i) provide
a representative(s) to demonstrate to Buyer the point-of-sale systems in the
Stores or (ii) make other comparable arrangements to demonstrate to Buyer the
point-of-sale systems in the Stores. Seller also agrees to arrange, at times
mutually convenient to Buyer and Seller, meetings with Seller's Employees who
may become Continuing Employees where representatives of Seller and Buyer may

efforts to make its merchandising/marketing personnel available to Buyer for
purposes of discussing transition arrangements with respect to continuity

this Agreement, Buyer's interest in purchasing the Assets and any information
provided to Buyer or its representatives or developed pursuant to this Agreement
shall be held by Buyer and its representatives in accordance with, and shall be

incorporated in this Agreement as though fully set forth herein and in
accordance with such other terms and conditions as may otherwise be agreed upon
by the parties; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the provisions of this Section 5.1(c)
shall expire following the Closing except with respect to Information (as such
term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) relating to the Excluded

<PAGE>

(d) Buyer shall hold all of the Books and Records existing on
the Primary Closing Date in accordance with Buyer's normal record retention
policy from time to time in effect (copies of which will be provided to Seller),
and Buyer shall not destroy or dispose of any thereof except in accordance with
such policy and then only after having given Seller ten (10) days advance notice
and the opportunity to take possession of such Books and Records. Following the
Primary Closing Date, Buyer shall afford ASC, Seller, their accountants, counsel
and other representatives, during normal business hours, upon at least 48 hours'
notice, full access to the Books and Records (including the right to copy such
materials at Seller's expense) and to the Buyer's employees to the extent that
such access may be requested (without unreasonably disrupting Buyer's personnel
and operations) for any legitimate purpose without charge to ASC or Seller
(other than for Buyer's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses); PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that nothing herein shall limit or waive any of ASC's or Seller's rights of
discovery.

Section 5.2 REASONABLE EFFORTS; OBTAINING CONSENTS. (a) Subject to
the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Seller and Buyer agrees to use
all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to cooperate with the others in connection with the foregoing,
including using all reasonable efforts (i) to obtain all necessary Consents and
the estoppel certificates requested by Seller (provided that neither Seller nor
Buyer shall be obligated to pay any consideration therefor or assume any
liability in connection therewith except as expressly provided in this
Agreement), (ii) to obtain all Consents that are required to be obtained under
any federal, state or local law or regulation, (iii) to lift or rescind any
injunction or restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability
of the parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv)
to effect all necessary registrations and filings including, but not limited to,
filings under the HSR Act and submissions of information requested by
governmental authorities, and (v) to fulfill all conditions to this Agreement.
Each of Seller and Buyer further covenants and agrees to use all reasonable
efforts to prevent the entry, enactment or promulgation of any threatened or
pending preliminary or permanent injunction or other order, decree or ruling or
statute, rule, regulation or executive order that would adversely affect the
ability of the parties hereto to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. Except as otherwise specified herein, and except for the New York Real
Property Transfer Gains Tax Buyer shall pay all registration, filing, license,
permit or similar

- 33 -
<PAGE>

fees and charges in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (other than those related to Monetary Encumbrances) and the cost of
all title insurance, title reports, engineering and building inspections and
property surveys and other tests or reports obtained by Buyer.

(b) Subject to Section 2.2(a)(ix), each of Buyer and Seller
agrees to use its reasonable efforts to bring about the transfer to Buyer of all
Permits so that such transfer may be accomplished on or before the Primary
Closing Date. Buyer shall use its reasonable efforts to file all necessary
documentation with the appropriate authorities as soon as practicable to obtain,
prior to the Closing, all permits, licenses, authorizations and approvals
required by all governmental agencies with respect to the Assets and necessary
to conduct the operation of the Stores without any guaranty or liability of
Seller or any of its Affiliates with respect thereto. In the event that said
licenses and permits shall not have been issued by Closing, Seller agrees to
permit, to the extent permitted and allowed by law, Buyer to operate at each of
the Stores under those permits of Seller for a period of up to thirty days from
the Primary Closing Date until the licenses and/or permits for which Buyer has
applied are issued (which period shall be extended up to ninety days by Seller
at the request of Buyer so long as Buyer is diligently pursuing the issuances of
such licenses and permits); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Buyer agrees to indemnify
and hold Seller harmless from and against any and all Covered Liabilities
arising out of or resulting from Buyer's use of the applicable permits of
Seller; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that Buyer agrees to use only qualified and
licensed personnel as may be required by federal, state and local laws or as may
be required by the relevant licensing agency.

Section 5.3 REGULATORY MATTERS. (a) Seller and Buyer shall
promptly file or cause to be filed with the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission pursuant to the
HSR Act all requisite documents and notifications in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer shall pay the filing fee
incurred in connection with such filings under the HSR Act. Each of Seller and
Buyer shall promptly inform the other of any material communication from the
Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or any other governmental
authority regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby. If either
Seller or Buyer or any Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional
information or documentary material from any such government or authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, then such party will endeavor
in good faith to comply as soon as reasonably practicable and after

- 34 -
<PAGE>

consultation with the other party, with such request. Buyer and Seller will
each promptly advise and consult with the other in advance in respect of any
offers, proposals, understandings, undertakings or agreements (oral or written)
which Buyer or Seller proposes to make or enter into with or has received from,
and Buyer and Seller shall each have the right to accompany the other to any
meetings with any of, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Justice or
any other government or governmental authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Buyer shall use its reasonable efforts to resolve such
objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Laws. If any suit is instituted (or
threatened) challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative
of any Antitrust Law or if Buyer is required or given the opportunity to resolve
objections of any government or governmental authority under the Antitrust Laws,
Buyer shall use its reasonable efforts to take action in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining
order or other order that has the effect of preventing the consummation of any
of such transactions. "Reasonable efforts" as used in the immediately preceding
sentence shall include (without limitation) (i) Buyer agreeing to acquire the
Stores from Seller and thereafter divest stores owned by Buyer or hold separate
stores owned by Buyer, pending required divestitures, as may be required (A) by
the applicable government or governmental authority (including, without
limitation, the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice,
the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general) in order to resolve
objections that such government or authority may have to such transactions under
the Antitrust Laws, or (B) by any court or similar tribunal and (ii) entering
into such other agreements, orders or decrees with such government or
governmental authority ancillary to such divestitures which are acceptable in
Buyer's reasonable judgment. The entry by a court, in any suit brought by a
private party or governmental authority challenging the transactions
contemplated hereby as violative of any Antitrust Law, of an order or decree
permitting the transactions contemplated hereby shall not be deemed a failure to
satisfy the conditions specified in Sections 8.2, 8.3, 9.2 or 9.3.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.3(b) to the contrary, however,
neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated under this Agreement
to divest or hold separate or, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
to otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits Seller's or any of
its Affiliates' freedom of action with respect to any of the Assets, or any of
its other assets or businesses. After the Primary Closing Date, Buyer shall
indemnify Seller and

- 35 -
<PAGE>

its Affiliates for any Covered Liabilities arising from any alleged violation of
the Antitrust Laws in connection with Buyer's acquisition of the Assets.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in Section 5.3(b), the Purchase
Price shall not be adjusted for any actions taken by Buyer pursuant to Section
5.3(b) including the divesting of any stores owned by Buyer or Seller (all such
divested stores, the "Divested Stores") unless, to comply with Section 5.3(b)
hereof, Buyer is required to divest five or more Divested Stores. If Buyer is
required to divest five or more Divested Stores, the Purchase Price shall be
reduced as follows: (i) for the first four Divested Stores, by zero ($0); (ii)
for the fifth Divested Store, the product of (x) the Average 1993 Sales Per
Divested Store (as defined below) multiplied by (y) .11; (iii) for each of the
sixth and seventh Divested Stores, the product of (x) the Average 1993 Sales Per
Divested Store multiplied by (y) .21; (iv) for each of the eighth, ninth, tenth
and eleventh Divested Stores, the product of (x) the Average 1993 Sales Per
Divested Store multiplied by (y) .31; and (v) for each Divested Store
thereafter, the product of (x) the Average 1993 Sales Per Divested Store
multiplied by (y) .21. For purposes of this Section 5.3(c), "Average 1993 Sales
Per Divested Store" shall mean the quotient of (a) the aggregate 1993 Sales for
all Divested Stores divided by (b) the total number of Divested Stores.
Examples of how such Purchase Price reduction would operate is set forth on
Schedule 5.3 hereto. For the purposes of this Section 5.3(c), (a) the 1993
Sales for a Divested Store which is owned by the Buyer shall equal the 1993
Sales for the Store owned by Seller (whether or not it is a Divested Store)
which is located closest to the Divested Store owned by Buyer, and (b) in the
event actual 1993 Sales for any individual Divested Store exceeds $12 million,
1993 sales for such Divested Store shall be deemed to equal $12 million.

(d) Buyer shall have the right to retain all proceeds from the
sale of Stores required to be divested.

Section 5.4 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each of Seller and Buyer agrees
that, from time to time, whether before, at or after the Closing, it shall
execute, deliver and record such further instruments of conveyance and transfer
and take such other action as may be necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes and intents of this Agreement.

Section 5.5 CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. (a) Buyer acknowledges that the
transaction contemplated hereby is a sale of assets and does not include the
sale of any goodwill. Buyer acknowledges that, in anticipation of the proposed
sale of the

- 36 -
<PAGE>

Stores to Buyer, Seller is not obligated to operate the Stores in its or their
customary fashion, and may make operational changes to its business in the
Stores, including, without limitation, changes in check cashing policies, the
minimization of capital expenditures, the discontinuance of the sale of gift
certificates, the discontinuance of circular and other advertising after October
31, 1994 and the failure to replace equipment. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Seller agrees (i) to maintain reasonably comparable hours of operation in the
Stores except as a result of security concerns, material changes in sales volume
or as required by law; (ii) to maintain a level of newspaper advertising
pertaining to the Stores reasonably comparable to that maintained by Seller
during the thirty-day period immediately preceding the date of this Agreement;
(iii) to exercise good faith in pricing merchandise between the date of this
Agreement and the Primary Closing Date, including not to increase such prices
other than in Seller's ordinary course of business and consistent with Seller's
normal pricing strategy; (iv) subject to Section 2.7, maintain reasonably
comparable overall levels of Inventory located on the Store shelves; (v) to
perform customary maintenance on Stores and Equipment in accordance with
Seller's past practices; (vi) without the consent of Buyer (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld), not to (A) enter into any material amendment to any of
the Leases or any of the agreements affecting Owned Properties, or (B) enter
into any Contract (excluding the purchase of merchandise in the ordinary course
of business) that provides for payments in excess of $25,000 per obligation,
except such agreements, contracts or commitments as Buyer will have no
obligations with respect to after the Closing; (vii) not to increase the
compensation or benefits payable to Seller's Employees at the Stores except in
the ordinary course of business, consistent with Seller's past practice and
(viii) not to remove or transfer Equipment (it being acknowledged and agreed
that Seller shall not be obligated to replace any Equipment). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that 2 days prior to the Closing,
Seller shall discontinue shipment of Private Label Items to the Stores and 2
days prior to the Primary Closing Date Seller may discontinue all shipments to
the Stores.

(b) In the event Buyer believes Seller is not in compliance with
the terms set forth in this Section 5.5, Buyer shall provide Seller with written
notice of such non-compliance, whereupon Seller shall have ten days from the
date of receipt of such notice to comply. If the Closing shall occur, Buyer
shall be deemed to have waived any and all claims it may have against Seller
pursuant to this Section 5.5, irrespective of whether Buyer shall have given
Seller notice (and whether or not Seller shall have cured) pursuant to the
preceding sentence, and whether

- 37 -
<PAGE>

or not Buyer has actual knowledge of such claims or facts giving rise to such
claims.

(c) Buyer acknowledges that Seller shall not be obligated to
deal with anyone other than Buyer as the Buyer of the Stores in connection with
the sale thereof, including, but not limited to, any operators, subtenants or
assignees of Buyer who might acquire an interest in the Stores from Buyer. In
no event shall Seller be liable to such third parties in connection with any
aspect of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, nor shall any third
party be or become a beneficiary of such rights, nor shall Buyer act or hold
itself out as, nor is Buyer, Seller's agent, in any activity, including, but not
limited to, dealings with any such third parties.

Section 5.6 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. From the date hereof until the
Primary Closing Date, Seller and Buyer shall obtain the prior consent of the
other party before issuing, or permitting any agent or Affiliate to issue, any
press releases or otherwise making or permitting any agent or Affiliate to make,
any public statements with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) either party may issue
a press release or make a public statement required to be issued or made under
applicable law without the prior consent of the other party, provided that such
party shall consult with the other party concerning the contents of such release
or statement prior to issuing any such press release or making any such public
statement and (ii) the foregoing shall not prevent Buyer from having discussions
regarding the transactions contemplated hereby with securities analysts or
representatives of institutional financing sources; provided, however, that in
no event shall Buyer make disclosures pursuant to the foregoing clause (ii) that
expand upon in any material respect or are inconsistent with any statement
required by law to be made in (A) any amendment to the Registration Statement on
Form S-3, Registration Number 33-51213 or (B) the Form 8-K filed in respect of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.7 GUARANTIES. Buyer shall cooperate with Seller to cause
Buyer to be substituted in all respects for Seller or any of its Affiliates,
effective as of the Primary Closing Date (or, with respect to any Excepted
Property, the conveyance date for such Excepted Property), in respect of all
obligations of Seller and any such Affiliate under each of the lease guaranties,
equipment leases and other guaranties obtained by Seller or any of such
Affiliates relating to the Assets, which lease guaranties, equipment leases and
other guaranties are set forth in Schedule 5.7 (collectively, the "Guaranties")
and to

- 38 -
<PAGE>

cooperate with Seller (without being required to incur expenses) in seeking
releases from third parties of the obligations of Seller and its Affiliates
under the Leases or other Assets.

Section 5.8 BULK TRANSFER LAWS. Buyer waives the requirements of
any laws with respect to bulk transfers. In consideration thereof, Seller
agrees to and shall indemnify, defend and hold Buyer harmless from any and all
liabilities resulting from the claims of creditors of Seller or its Affiliates
arising out of or connected with Seller's or its Affiliates' failure to comply
with the requirements of any laws relating to bulk transfers.

Section 5.9 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE; CONTRACTS. Buyer shall use all
reasonable efforts on behalf of Seller to collect accounts receivable for the
Stores which are owed to Seller or its Affiliates at the Primary Closing Date in
accordance with Buyer's practices and procedures with respect to Buyer's
accounts receivable (without instituting legal proceedings or incurring out-of-
pocket expenses). Seller shall furnish Buyer with information relating to such
accounts receivable that is in Seller's possession after the Primary Closing
Date. Buyer shall promptly forward to Seller within 10 days of receipt any
monies paid to Buyer on all accounts receivables, or claims not constituting
accounts receivable, which are owned by Seller. Buyer shall furnish information
that Seller may reasonably request from time to time with respect to such
accounts or claims. Buyer shall fully and promptly perform all of the
obligations of Seller under the Leases and Contracts relating to the period from
and after the Primary Closing Date (or, with respect to any Excepted Property,
the Delayed Closing Date for such Excepted Property).

Section 5.10 USE OF NAMES. (a) Except as provided in Section
5.10(b) from and after the earlier of (i) six months from the Primary Closing
Date or (ii) exhaustion of supplies thereof existing on the Primary Closing
Date, Buyer shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Affiliates to, use any
name, phrase or logo incorporating "American Stores", "Acme", "Skaggs", "Jewel
Osco", "Osco", "Alpha Beta", "Skaggs Alpha Beta", or the name of any Affiliate
of Seller or any names or logos used exclusively by Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including, without limitation, "Econo Buy", "Skaggs", "Skaggs
Brand", "Skaggs Drug Store" and "Sav-On") in or on any labels on products sold
by it or on any of its shopping bags or other supplies (collectively "Private
Label Supplies"). Buyer agrees that it will not denigrate any of such foregoing
names in a manner that could have an adverse effect on the goodwill associated
with Seller's or its Affiliates' use of such names. Buyer shall not use any
preprinted forms, including,

- 39 -
<PAGE>

without limitation, printed purchase orders and sales, maintenance and license
agreements, containing the foregoing names and shall dispose of such materials
promptly after the Primary Closing Date to the extent not removed by Seller.

(b) Buyer shall have the right to continue to sell Private Label
Items for a period not to exceed six months after the Primary Closing Date.
Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from and against any Covered
Liabilities attributable to any alleged trademark infringement with respect to
such Private Label Items. Buyer shall have a nonassignable, limited license
until the date on which all such Private Label Items have been sold to use names
featured on Private Label Items, but only for the purpose of advertising,
displaying and selling such Private Label Items at the Stores. Such Private
Label Items shall be sold only to retail customers at the Stores or to Seller or
its Affiliates (but nothing in this Agreement is intended to impose any
obligation on the part of Seller or its Affiliates to purchase such Private
Label Items), and shall not be sold to any other party, including retailers or
other merchants.

Section 5.11 ENVIRONMENTAL INSPECTIONS. Buyer has heretofore
engaged RUST Environment & Intrastructure, Inc. (the "Phase I Consultant") to
conduct a Phase I Environmental Investigation of the Owned Properties for the
possible presence of Hazardous Materials and friable asbestos (the "Phase I
Inspection"). Seller shall reimburse Buyer for 50% of the fees and costs of the
Phase I Consultant paid by Buyer. Buyer shall cause Seller to have full and
complete access to the Phase I Consultant and all reports, documents, data,
findings, conclusions, recommendations and other information relating to the
Phase I Inspection, whether oral or written, and, in the event Closing shall not
occur under this Agreement for any reason, all such reports, documents, data,
findings, conclusions, recommendations and other information shall become and
remain the sole property of Seller. All information (whether in written or oral
form) in connection with the Phase I Inspection and all documents or reports,
including without limitation, the findings, conclusions or recommendations
contained therein, shall be treated as Information under the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. Buyer has determined that no further environmental
investigations (or other environmental due diligence) of the Stores are
necessary.

Section 5.12 GIFT CERTIFICATES. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for
all of Seller's or its Affiliates' gift certificates which are used at the
Stores after the Primary

- 40 -
<PAGE>

Closing Date within 10 days of Seller's receipt of such gift certificates from
Buyer.

Section 5.13 INSURANCE REQUIRED AFTER CLOSING.

(a) Buyer covenants and agrees that, from and after the Closing
Date, and for so long as Seller or any of its Affiliates remain primarily or
contingently liable under any applicable Lease for the repair or restoration of
Real Property after a real property loss or for indemnification to a landlord or
mortgagee for loss suffered as a result of personal injury or property damage
(it being understood that this Section 5.13 shall survive the Closing), for the
duration and term of each such Lease, Buyer shall maintain all such public
liability and property insurance set forth under all such Leases, regardless of
whether such requirement has been waived or modified, in not less than such
amounts and subject to no greater deductibles as are permitted therein, or if
none set forth, then with a "Combined Single Limit" (covering bodily injury
liability and property damage liability) of not less than Five Million Dollars
($5,000,000) for total claims for any one occurrence and not less than Ten
Million Dollars ($10,000,000) for total claims in the aggregate during any one
policy year with regard to liability insurance; and property insurance shall
include fire and extended coverage on a replacement cost basis. Such insurance
policies shall also each:

(i) name Seller, and/or its designee or designees, as
named insured(s);

(ii) be carried by an insurance company or companies which
is, or are, reasonably acceptable to Seller;

(iii) if available, provide that a notice of cancellation of
any such insurance policy shall be given to Seller at least thirty (30) days
prior to cancellation of such policy;

(iv) be evidenced, at Closing, and thereafter annually and
upon request of Seller from time to time, by certificates of insurance coverage

pay the fees and expenses of Ernst & Young, Seller's public accountants,
incurred in preparing such information. Seller shall make available members of
its financial staff to discuss the financial information provided pursuant to
this Section 5.14. Buyer affirms and acknowledges to Seller and its Affiliates
that although it has requested the financial information to be provided pursuant
to this Section 5.14, (i) Buyer is not in any manner relying on this information
in its decision to enter into this Agreement, (ii) the substance of such
information shall not affect Buyer's obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (iii) Seller is not making any representation or
warranty, express or implied, regarding the financial information provided

limiting Buyer's rights under any other Section of this Agreement, Buyer hereby
releases the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against any and all liability
(including, without limitation, liability arising under federal and state

- 42 -
<PAGE>

combination food supermarket and drugstore; provided, however, that in no event
shall the foregoing restrictive covenant apply to the geographic area described
on Schedule 5.15 hereto. This Section 5.15 shall not prohibit either (i) the
acquisition by Seller or any of its Affiliates of any chain of five (5) or more
food supermarkets and/or combination food supermarkets and drugstores, or (ii)
the acquisition of Seller or any of its Affiliates by any other entity.

Section 5.16 SELLER'S REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS.
Concurrent with Buyer's execution of this Agreement and immediately prior to
Closing on the Primary Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller a schedule
setting forth any misrepresentation by, or breach of any warranty or covenant

ARTICLE VI

EMPLOYEES

Section 6.1 EMPLOYEES; BENEFIT PLANS; MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS.

(a) EMPLOYEES. Buyer agrees to offer to employ all of Seller's
Employees immediately as of the Closing Date, with salaries, wages and other
benefits that are substantially comparable to those existing immediately prior
to the Closing Date, and at a work location within 35 miles of the work location
at which those Seller's Employees were employed immediately before the Closing
Date. Each of Seller's Employees who accepts such an offer of continuing
employment shall be a "Continuing Employee." Set forth on Schedule 6.1 is a
description of the benefits referred to in the first sentence of this paragraph
6.1(a) to which those of Seller's Employees eligible to become Continuing
Employees are entitled under plans maintained by Seller or its Affiliates. To
the extent that any employee listed as an Excluded Employee on Schedule 1.1B
does not accept Seller's offer of employment, such employee shall be deemed to
no longer be an Excluded Employee but shall be deemed a Seller's Employee.

(b) UNION AGREEMENTS. Buyer shall assume all of Seller's or its
Affiliates' right and obligations as "Employer" from and after the Closing Date
under all collective bargaining agreements between Seller or its Affiliates and
any union parties thereto, relating to any of Seller's Employees entitled to
become Continuing Employees (the "Collective Bargaining Agreements"),
specifically including those set forth on Schedule 3.6 hereto.

- 43 -
<PAGE>

(c) BENEFIT PLAN LIABILITIES. Except for such plans maintained or
contributed to pursuant to the collective bargaining agreements referred to in
(b) above, or as specifically set forth herein, Buyer assumes no obligation with
respect to any employee benefit plan, as that term is defined by Section 3(3) of
ERISA, maintained or contributed to by Seller or any Affiliate. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Buyer agrees that it will:

(i) for a period of no less than six months provide the
Continuing Employees with severance or termination benefits that are comparable
to the severance and termination benefits provided by Seller or its Affiliates
to those Employees immediately before the Closing Date, as set forth on
Schedule 6.1; and

(ii) if Buyer otherwise maintains a qualified (under Code Section
401(a)) defined contribution profit sharing plan (Buyer's Plan"), direct such
plan to accept a direct rollover of the immediately distributable portion of the
account balances under the American Stores Retirement Estates and the Jewel
Companies Retirement Estates (Seller's Plans") attributable to each of those of
the Continuing Employees who (1) remains employed with Buyer for at least 90
days, (2) elects such rollovers and (3) is employed by Buyer at the time his or
her rollover would otherwise be received by Buyer's Plan. Buyer may condition
acceptance of such direct rollovers on delivery to Buyer of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer that Sellers' Plans are "qualified" under Code section
401(a) at the time of such rollovers and that such rollovers will not otherwise
adversely affect Buyer's Plan in any material respect. Any portion of the
Continuing Employees' account balances in Sellers' Plans that is not immediately
distributable will continue to be held by Seller's Plans, subject to the terms
and conditions of those Plans.

(d) BUYER'S PLANS. Buyer agrees to provide each Continuing Employee
who was eligible for such coverage under any plan maintained by Seller or its
Affiliates immediate coverage under one or more group health plans, including
dental coverage, maintained by Buyer, without any exclusion or limitation with
respect to any preexisting condition of the Continuing Employee or any dependent
of any Continuing Employee. In addition, Buyer agrees that any Continuing
Employee shall be given credit for all service with the Seller which service
would be credited for similar purposes under Seller's plans, programs, policies
and arrangements for purposes of determining eligibility for, and vesting under,
any employee benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement of Buyer, or
maintained pursuant to any collective bargaining agreement assumed or entered
into by Buyer with

- 44 -
<PAGE>

respect to any Continuing Employee. Except as otherwise required under any of
the Collective Bargaining Agreements, such credit shall not, however, extend to
calculation of benefits under any plan, program, policy or arrangement
maintained by Buyer, which shall depend entirely on service with Buyer.

(e) INDEMNIFICATION. Except as otherwise provided in this Section
6.1:

(i) Seller and its Affiliates shall be responsible for, and shall
indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from and against, any claim or liability
relating to (A) compensation and/or benefits earned or accrued under any
benefits plan, policy or arrangement, written or oral, maintained or contributed
to by Seller or any Affiliate, payable on account of any Seller's Employee with
respect to periods before the Closing Date, provided, however, that this
indemnity shall exclude accrued vacation pay, (B) worker's compensation and
disability benefits arising in connection with any injury or other event
entitling any Seller's Employee to workers' compensation and/or disability
benefits, which injury or event occurred before the Closing Date and (C)
contributions, liabilities or obligations to any employee benefit plan, policy,
program or arrangement maintained pursuant to any Collective Bargaining
Agreement ("CBA Plan") which Seller or any Affiliate is obligated to make with
respect to services performed by Seller's Employees before the Closing Date; and

(ii) Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify or hold Buyer
harmless against any claim or liability, whether statutory or contractual,
arising out of Buyer's withdrawal from, or failure to make contributions to, any
CBA Plan on or after the Closing Date; further Buyer and Seller agree that this
Agreement shall not be construed to impose upon Seller any liability or
obligation that Seller would not have but for this Agreement with respect to any
benefits asserted to be payable under any CBA Plan; and

(iii) Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and
hold Seller harmless from and against, any claim or liability relating to
compensation and/or benefits earned or accrued under any benefits plan, policy
or arrangement, written or oral maintained or contributed to by Buyer or any
Affiliate, payable on account of any Continuing Employee with respect to periods
on and after the Closing Date.

(f) RIGHT TO REHIRE. Seller agrees that for a period of one year
after the Closing Date, Seller shall not seek to employ any Continuing Employee
who is employed by Buyer. Seller shall, however, be free to hire any such
individual who either

- 45 -
<PAGE>

does not accept Buyer's offer of employment, or to offer employment to any of
such employees who leave the employment of Buyer or its Affiliates. Buyer
agrees that it shall not for a period of one year after the Primary Closing Date
seek to employ any of Seller's or its Affiliates' employees (other than
Continuing Employees) as long as such employees are employed by Seller or its
Affiliates, but in the event that any of such employees shall leave the
employment of Seller or its Affiliates, Buyer shall have the right to offer
employment to such employees.

(g) VACATION PAY. Within a reasonable period, not to exceed 14 days
after the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer (i) a schedule showing the
amount of accrued but unpaid vacation days, and the amount of vacation pay
attributable thereto, for each Continuing Employee as of the Closing Date and
(ii) a cash payment in an amount equal to the total of the amounts set forth on
the schedule described in clause (i). Buyer will give those Continuing
Employees the number of days of paid vacation shown on the schedule delivered by
Seller and shall, to the extent of the payment made to Buyer by Seller,
indemnify and hold Seller harmless from any claim or liability with respect to
vacation days or pay to which any Continuing Employee is entitled as of the
Closing Date.

Section 6.2 WARN ACT. The parties acknowledge and agree that
Seller shall have no obligation with respect to obligations under the Workers
Adjustment and Retraining Act with respect to any of the Stores that may be
closed after the Closing Date and that Buyer shall be solely responsible for
complying with such statute if and to the extent applicable to any such
Closings.

other in connection with any tax investigation, audit or other proceeding.
Buyer and Seller and their subsidiaries shall preserve all information, returns,

penalties thereon or additions thereto) that could affect Seller, or if Seller
receives notice of any such matter that could affect Buyer, the party receiving

days thereof. The failure of any party to give the notice required by this
Section 7.4 shall not impair that party's rights under this Agreement except to
the extent that the other party demonstrates that it has been damaged thereby.

Each of Seller and Buyer shall have the right to control any audit or

amended return, contest, resolve and defend against any assessment, notice of

Indemnified Party), and if such party intends to seek indemnity with respect
thereto under this Article XI, such indemnified party shall promptly notify the
indemnifying party in writing of such claims setting forth such claims in
reasonable detail. The indemnifying party shall have twenty (20) days after
receipt of such notice to undertake, through counsel of its own choosing and at
its own expense, the settlement or defense thereof, and the indemnified party
shall cooperate with it in connection therewith; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
indemnified party may participate in such settlement or defense through counsel
chosen by such indemnified party,

provided the fees and expenses of such counsel are borne by such indemnified
party. So long as the indemnifying party is reasonably contesting any such
claim in good faith, the indemnified party shall not pay or settle any such
claim unless it shall waive any right to indemnity therefor by the indemnifying
party. If the indemnifying party does not notify the indemnified party within
twenty (20) days after the receipt of the indemnified party's notice of a claim
of indemnity hereunder that it elects to undertake the defense thereof, the
indemnified party shall have the right to contest, settle or compromise the
claim but shall not thereby waive any right to indemnity therefor pursuant to
this Agreement.

Section 11.4 SOLE REMEDY. The remedies provided by this Article XI
shall be the parties' sole and exclusive remedies against each other and each
other's Affiliates for the recovery of any Covered Liabilities resulting from or
arising out of (i) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty made under this
Agreement or any certificate, document, deed, schedule, bill of sale,
endorsement, assignment or other instrument delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Transaction Documents"), (ii) any
nonfulfillment of any agreement or covenant under this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents (iii) the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
furtherance of the foregoing, each of Buyer and Seller hereby waive, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law, any and all rights, claims and
causes of action (including rights of contribution, if any), known or unknown,
foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may have
against the Seller or any of its Affiliates or Buyer and its Affiliates, as the
case may be, arising under or based upon the Environmental Laws except for the
liabilities the other party has expressly agreed to assume or retain herein and
in no event shall this waiver constitute a waiver of Buyer's rights against
Seller with respect to the Excluded Environmental Liabilities.
