Item 5. Other Events

On June 14, 1994, a subsidiary of BRT Realty Trust ("BRT")
indirectly sold for cash the fee interest of a property
located in midtown Manhattan ("Property") to One Liberty
Properties Inc. ("One Liberty"), a related party, for a
consideration of $5,250,000. The transaction and sales
price were approved by the Board of Trustees of BRT,
including the independent trustees, subject to receipt of an
independent real estate appraisal. After receipt of an
independent real estate appraisal from Cushman & Wakefield
substantiating the purchase price of $5,250,000, the
transaction was completed, resulting in a gain to BRT of
approximately $687,000.

The Property was sold subject to a long term net lease with
a current annual rent of $550,000, which annual rent
increases by $50,000 every five years (the next increase in
1999). The lease is commonly referred to as a triple net
lease, with the tenant being responsible for taxes,
utilities, insurance and repairs (structural and non-
structural). The Property consists of a thirteen-story plus
penthouse elevator building and a seven-story elevator
building containing a total of 126 apartments, 11 stores and
one office. For a period of ten years from the closing, BRT
will receive fifty (50%) percent of any premium which One
Liberty receives under the lease as a result of the
conversion of the leasehold position to cooperative
ownership.

The transaction, including the price, was recommended to the
Board of Trustees by Fredric H. Gould, the Chairman of the
Board of Trustees, Israel Rosenzweig, President and Jeffrey
Gould, Executive Vice President. It was recommended by
these officers after the asset was valued, taking into
consideration the rental stream to be paid to the fee
position during the remaining term of the lease and the type
and location of the property, subject to receipt of an
independent appraisal. The entire consideration was paid in
cash, thereby affording BRT the ability to pay off a prior
lien of $2,654,960 against this asset and to reduce its bank
debt by approximately $1,600,000.

Fredric H. Gould, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of BRT
is also Chairman of the Board of One Liberty, Marshall Rose,
Vice Chairman of BRT, is Vice Chairman of One Liberty and
Matthew Gould, Vice President of BRT, is President of One
Liberty. In addition, Arthur Hurand, a member of the Board
of Trustees of BRT, is a director of One Liberty, Israel
Rosenzweig and Nathan Kupin, Trustees of BRT are Vice
Presidents of One Liberty and Simeon Brinberg, David W.
