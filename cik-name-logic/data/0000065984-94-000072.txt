Item 5. Other Materially Important Events

Entergy Corporation, Gulf States Utilities Company

On December 21, 1994, Cajun Electric Power Cooperative,
Inc. ("Cajun") filed a petition in the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Middle District of Louisiana seeking bankruptcy
relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. As
previously disclosed, Gulf States Utilities Company ("GSU") has
significant business relationships with Cajun, including co-
ownership in the River Bend Steam Electric Generating Station
(nuclear) ("River Bend") and Big Cajun 2 Unit 3. GSU and Cajun
own 70% and 30% undivided interests, respectively, in River Bend
and 42% and 58% undivided interests, respectively, in Big Cajun 2
Unit 3.

The precise consequences to GSU of Cajun's bankruptcy
filing cannot be predicted at this time. However, GSU will take
appropriate steps to protect its interests and its claims against
Cajun arising from the co-ownership in River Bend and Big Cajun 2
Unit 3. GSU intends to seek enforcement in the bankruptcy
proceedings of an injunction granted by the United States
District Court on December 19, 1994, pursuant to which GSU
currently is receiving its 42% share of power from the Big Cajun
2 Unit 3 coal plant. GSU intends to continue making payments
for the power into an account under the registry of the United
States District Court pursuant to the injunctive order, until
otherwise ordered by the Court. Such payments are held in escrow
by the Court.
