period of validity of the MTJA Agreement, whichever is the earlier,
commencing from the Effective Date.

2.2 The Contract Area shall, on the Effective Date, encompass Block A-18 in
the Joint Development Area under the MTJA Act 1990, an area bounded on
the east by the eastern boundary of the Joint Development Area under the
MTJA Act 1990, on the west by the western boundary of the Joint
Development Area under the MTJA Act 1990, on the north by the 7 DEG. 18'
N latitude, and on the south by the 7 DEG. 00' N latitude, and shall be
divided into nine (9) Sub-blocks as shown on the map of Block A-18 as
appears in Appendix A.

2.3 The exploration activities in respect of Petroleum Operations shall
commence not later than one (1) month from the date of approval by MTJA
of the first Work Programme and Budget referred to in Article 3.1.

Each Sub-block shall cease to be part of the Contract Area if no Crude
Oil in a Commercial Quantity is found therein within five (5) years from
the Effective Date with the exception of any area defined as a Gas Field
in accordance with Article 8.1.

<PAGE>

-17-

The Contractors may apply to MTJA for permission to retain such
Sub-block for further exploration for an agreed time period, provided
that additional work commitment for that Sub-block is proposed by
Contractors and agreed upon by MTJA.

2.4 When Crude Oil is discovered in a Commercial Quantity in a Sub-block,
that Sub-block is automatically converted into and forms part of a
Development Area to which shall be added other Sub-block or Sub-blocks
as and when Crude Oil is discovered in a Commercial Quantity in the
Sub-block or Sub-blocks; and wherever it is established that the Crude
Oil so discovered is from an Oil Field which straddles over two (2) or
more Sub-blocks within the Contract Area those Sub-blocks in which the
Oil Field is located are also automatically converted into and form part
of the Development Area. Contractors shall submit a Development Plan for
Oil Field(s) to MTJA for its consideration at least sixty (60) days
prior to submission of the relevant Work Programme and Budget or any
revisions thereof.

MTJA shall consider such Development Plan without delay. MTJA shall not
unreasonably require any changes to such Development Plan, and in
particular will not require changes which, in Contractors' opinion,
materially increase the cost of development of an Oil Field. If a
Development Plan has not received MTJA's approval within ninety (90)
days of submittal, the period of time from the expiration of said ninety
(90) days until MTJA's approval is received shall be added to the five
(5) years referred to below.

<PAGE>

-18-

If Contractors fail to produce Crude Oil commercially, directly or
indirectly, from any Sub-block or Sub-blocks in which an Oil Field is
located in the Development Area within five (5) years from the date when
the Sub-block or Sub-blocks were converted into a Development Area, that
Sub-block or Sub-blocks shall be deemed to be relinquished to MTJA and
cease to be part of the Contract Area unless Contractors can reasonably
demonstrate to MTJA that the delays are due to circumstances beyond
Contractors' control or that the delay is at MTJA's request.

Any Sub-block which is not defined as a Development Area and any area
which is not a Gas Field as defined in accordance with Article 8.1 at
the end of five (5) years from the Effective Date shall be deemed to be
relinquished to MTJA and cease to be part of the Contract Area.

2.5 The First Commercial Production Of Crude Oil from any Oil Field in a
Development Area automatically converts the Sub-block or Sub-blocks in
which the Oil Field is located into a Production Area to which shall be
added other Sub-block or Sub-blocks as and when the First Commercial
Production of Crude Oil from new Oil Fields takes place and if such Oil
Field straddles over two (2) or more Sub-blocks within the Contract Area
those Sub-blocks are automatically converted into and form part of the
Production Area.

2.6 Production of Crude Oil and Associated Gas may be carried out from the
Production Area:

<PAGE>

-19-

(a) for a period of twenty-five (25) years commencing from the date
of the First Commercial Production of Crude Oil from the
Sub-block or Sub-blocks in which an Oil Field is located; or

(b) till the expiry of the term of this Contract,

whichever is the earlier. Provided however in the event Contractors
effect the First Commercial Production of Crude Oil from the Sub-block
or Sub-blocks before the expiry of the relevant development period for
such Sub-block or Sub-blocks the balance of that development period
shall be added to the above production period. Upon the termination of
the production period for any Sub-block or Sub-blocks as hereinabove
described, such Sub-block or Sub-blocks shall be deemed to have been
relinquished forthwith to MTJA.

It shall be agreed between the Parties that any production of Crude Oil
and Associated Gas beyond the above production period, as the case may
be, shall be on terms and conditions to be agreed by MTJA.

2.7 Contractors may after consulting MTJA surrender any Sub-block of the
Contract Area provided that written notice is given to MTJA six (6)
months before the date of the intended surrender without stipulating any
condition in relation to such surrender. Such surrender shall not in any
way operate to relieve Contractors from any liabilities which arise on
surrender thereof or subsisting prior to such surrender.

<PAGE>

-20-

2.8 If Contractors fail to produce Crude Oil commercially from any Oil Field
within the Production Area for a continuous period exceeding one (1)
year unless such failure is excused by Article 22 or otherwise allowed
to do so by MTJA in writing, then such Oil Field within the Production
Area shall be deemed to be relinquished forthwith to MTJA.

Details of each Work Programme and Budget shall be in such form as
required by MTJA. Each Work Programme and Budget shall include forecast
of yearly activity and expenditure for the four (4) year period
following the end of the relevant Calendar Year or the period up to
termination of this Contract, whichever is shorter.

3.3 No Petroleum Operations shall be carried out unless and until the
relevant Work Programme and Budget have been approved in writing by
MTJA. MTJA shall notify Contractors of its approval (whether or not
conditional) or otherwise, of a proposed Work Programme and Budget:

(a) within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the first Work
Programme and Budget;

(b) by 15th December of the previous year, in respect of each
subsequent Work Programme and Budget.

MTJA may give notice to Contractors that a proposed Work Programme and
Budget submitted by Contractors is approved subject to such conditions
as MTJA may specify in such notice and may give Contractors notice that
a proposed Work Programme is to be revised either in whole or in part.
If Contractors consider that any revision required by MTJA renders the
Work Programme and Budget non-commercial, or is in excess of the minimum
work expenditure as set forth in Article 3.5 during the exploration
period, Contractors shall within thirty (30) days notify and
substantiate to MTJA its reasons for coming to such a decision.
Thereupon, MTJA and Contractors shall meet and discuss the revision
required by MTJA with a view to resolving any differences. If the
Parties fail to resolve their differences within sixty (60) days from
the date of the

<PAGE>

-23-

first of such meeting then, notwithstanding the foregoing, Contractors
shall incorporate the revisions required by MTJA into the proposed Work
Programme and Budget submitted by Contractors under this Article 3.3,
provided, however, that such change shall not increase or decrease the
Budget as proposed by Contractors of any affected expenditure item by
more than ten per cent (10%) and does not substantially alter the
general objectives of the Work Programme as submitted by Contractors.

All costs relating to exploration activity, including appraisal, of
Petroleum Operations shall be recoverable as Cost Oil or Cost Gas, or
both, in a manner as specified in Article 5.1(b) or Article 8.5(b),
provided that such costs are part of the Work Programme and Budget which
have been approved by MTJA in accordance with paragraph one of Article
3.3.

Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provisions, MTJA
shall have the right to review the proposed level of production in
respect of any proposed or approved annual Work Programme and may, upon
written notification, request Contractors to increase or decrease the
rate of production from any Oil Field or Fields located in a Production
Area for any of the following reasons:

(i) to optimise oil and gas recovery;

(ii) to minimise wastage of Associated Gas and to prevent wastage of
Non-associated Gas;

(iii) for safety considerations;

<PAGE>

-24-

(iv) for operational considerations; and

(v) for Malaysian and/or Thai national interest considerations.

Upon receipt of such written notification, Contractors shall forthwith
comply with such requests.

It is hereby agreed that for any decrease in the rate of production for
reasons under (v) above, arrangements will be made for Contractors to
recover at a later date from the Oil Field or Fields within the Contract
Area the quantity of Crude Oil equal to the decreased production.

It is recognised by MTJA and Contractors that the details of a Work
Programme may require changes in the light of changing circumstances;
thus Contractors may without the prior approval of MTJA make minor
changes, provided that such changes shall not increase or decrease the
approved Budget for any affected expenditure items by more than ten per
cent (10%) and do not substantially alter the general objectives of the
Work Programme. MTJA shall be notified of such changes as soon as
possible. Any other changes shall require the prior written approval of
MTJA. Any decision by MTJA on such application shall be communicated to
Contractors within sixty (60) days of receipt of the same.

3.4 To satisfy Malaysian and/or Thai national interest MTJA may, within a
Work Programme and Budget or separately, give notice in writing to
Contractors requiring them:

<PAGE>

-25-

(a) to develop a petroleum deposit (except during the exploration
period) considered by Contractors to be non-commercial and lying
outside the proven, probable and possible areal extent of any
Oil Field or Gas Field reviewed and agreed to by MTJA and
developed by Contractors and not otherwise subject to an
on-going appraisal programme or any pending appraisal programme
of Contractors which has been approved by MTJA; or

(b) to execute specific works or build specific facilities.

Within sixty (60) days after receiving such notice, Contractors shall
amend the Work Programme and Budget appropriately. Expenditure incurred
as a result of MTJA's requirement under this Article 3.4 shall be fully
borne by MTJA. MTJA shall be entitled to receive the benefits therefrom
including the whole benefits of any production arising under (a). If
Contractors are unwilling to undertake such specified work MTJA or any
third party duly appointed by MTJA shall have the right to carry out
such specified work provided that no undue interference with Petroleum
Operations of Contractors shall be caused by reason thereof.

3.5 The amount to be expended by Contractors in carrying out its exploration
activities in the Contract Area shall in the aggregate be not less than
twenty-five million United States Dollars (US$ 25,000,000).

If at the end of the fifth year from the Effective Date or by the date
of total relinquishment or surrender of the Contract Area (whichever is
earlier) the total amount expended on exploration falls short of that
required, Contractors shall pay to MTJA within three (3) months from
the end of such fifth year or the date of total relinquishment or
surrender

<PAGE>

-26-

of the Contract Area, as appropriate a sum representing the difference
between its total liability under this Article 3.5 and its actual total
expenditure on exploration.

The expenditure commitment specified in this Article 3.5 shall include a
commitment to carry out by the end of the fifth year (or earlier date in
case of voluntary surrender by Contractors) the following:

(i) acquisition and processing of five thousand five hundred (5,500)
line-kilometres of new high quality 2D seismic data over the
Contract Area;

3.6 In the event that Contractors fail by end of the fifth year (or earlier
date in case of voluntary surrender by Contractors) to complete the
drilling to the aggregate depth of not less than seven thousand (7,000)
metres as required, Contractors shall pay to MTJA a sum of one thousand
United States Dollars (US$1,000) for every metre not drilled or for
every metre short of the aggregate drilling depth required above.

In the event that Contractors fail by end of the fifth year (or earlier
date in case of voluntary surrender by Contractors) to complete
acquisition and processing seismic lines to the aggregate
line-kilometres of not less than five thousand five hundred (5,500)
line-kilometres as required, Contractors shall pay to MTJA a sum of five
hundred United States

<PAGE>

-27-

Dollars (US$500) for every line-kilometre not acquired and processed or
for every line-kilometre short of the aggregate line-kilometres required
above. Any appraisal work conducted by the Contractors in the
Development Area shall not be considered as part of the exploration
commitment specified in Article 3.5.

3.7 Contractors shall be solely responsible for the provision of all funds
required directly or indirectly for the implementation of the Work

emergency or extraordinary circumstances requiring immediate action,
Contractors shall take all actions they deem proper or advisable to
protect life, assets, equipment and interest of MTJA and Contractors,

<PAGE>

-29-

provided that any costs so incurred shall be recoverable only if
Contractors can prove to the satisfaction of MTJA that such actions were
reasonably warranted by the circumstances.

3.10 No borehole or well shall be abandoned and no cemented string or other
permanent form of casing shall be withdrawn from any borehole or well
which is proposed to be abandoned without the prior written consent of
MTJA. Consent shall not be unreasonably withheld in respect of boreholes
or wells which have become or are unproductive and in such cases shall
be given promptly with due regard to the cost of any delay. MTJA may in
any case require that no borehole or well shall be plugged or any works
be executed for that purpose save in the presence of its officials,
provided such requirement does not unduly delay the agreed operations.

recovery of such costs, shall take Crude Oil in kind in such
quantity as when valued in accordance with Article 7 is equal to
either the amount of such allowable costs expended in relation
to Petroleum Operations in respect of Crude Oil in the Contract
Area for that Quarter or the said maximum of fifty per cent
(50%) of Gross Production of Crude Oil for that Quarter
whichever is the lesser.

<PAGE>

-39-

If, in any Quarter, all allowable costs expended relating to
Petroleum Operations in respect of Crude Oil including amounts
accumulated or carried forward from a previous Quarter or
Quarters exceed the value of fifty per cent (50%) of the Gross
Production of Crude Oil from the Production Area, then the
unrecovered excess may be carried forward to the next succeeding
Quarter and added to all allowable costs expended relating to
Petroleum Operations in respect of Crude Oil for that Quarter
provided that such costs can only be recovered for any Quarter
up to a maximum of fifty per cent (50%) of the Gross Production
of Crude Oil for that Quarter;

(c) MTJA upon giving forty-five (45) days prior notice in writing,
shall have the right to purchase front Contractors up to a
maximum of fifty per cent (50%) of the Cost Oil to which
Contractors are entitled in any Quarter pursuant to Article 5.1
(b), at the price determined for that Quarter in accordance with

5.3 Where in a Quarter the value of Crude Oil as determined in accordance
with Article 7 exceeds the base price, Contractors shall make a cash
payment to MTJA for every Kilolitre of Contractors' Portion of Profit
Oil for that Quarter of an amount equivalent to fifty per cent (50%) of
the amount by which such value exceeds the base price less any amount
equal in value to any export duty Contractors are required to pay on
such fifty per cent (50%).

For the purpose of this Article the base price shall be United States
Dollars twenty-five (US$25.00) per barrel. On the first day of the
Quarter next following the first anniversary of the Effective Date and
on each anniversary of such date, the base price shall be increased by
five per cent (5%) over the last prevailing base price.

5.4 (a) Subject to Article 5.1(c), Article 5.10 and Article 15,
Contractors are authorised to market, lift and export
Contractors' portion of Cost Oil under Article 5.1(b) and

Crude Oil won and saved caused by reason of Contractors' proven
negligence or wilful misconduct, and without prejudice to MTJA's other
rights and remedies MTJA may give notice to Contractors that any such
loss shall be applied first in reducing Contractors' Portion of Profit
Oil. Any loss occasioned by any cause other than Contractors' proven
negligence or wilful misconduct during transfer of the Gross Production
of Crude Oil to the Point of Export or Point of Sale shall be shared by
MTJA and Contractors in proportion to their respective aggregate
entitlements to Cost Oil and Profit Oil from time to time (and such
deemed entitlements shall not be affected by the purchase (if any) by
MTJA of such Cost Oil pursuant to Article 5.1(c)).

5.6 Pending completion of the necessary calculations and determinations MTJA
shall:

(a) fix the quantity of Crude Oil referred to in Article 5.1(a);

transaction, such quarterly weighted average price shall
substitute for the price actually realised or value of other
consideration received, for the purpose of this Article;

(d) where in any Quarter there are no transactions within paragraph
(a) above, for the purpose of applying paragraph (c) above,
references to the quarterly weighted price of transactions
falling within paragraph (a) shall be substituted by references
to the average f.o.b. price at which other Malaysian and/or Thai
Crude Oil has been sold on arm's length terms to buyers in the
export markets to which Malaysian and/or Thai Crude Oil is
commonly sold in the relevant Quarter, taking due account of any
differences in quality and cost of transport;

(c) the value of Crude Oil for each Quarter shall be the weighted
average of the prices realised (or value received) in respect of

ARTICLE 8
NATURAL GAS

8.1 Where Non-associated Gas is discovered and such discovery is, in the
reasonable opinion of Contractors, substantial, Contractors and MTJA
shall, by agreement between them, define the extent of the Gas Field
from which such discovery was made plus a reserve area sufficient to
cover the probable and possible areal extent of the Gas Field (as
defined by the extent of structural closure based upon existing
engineering, geophysical, and geological data); and Contractors, upon
making written application within forty-five (45) days of such
discovery, shall, subject to agreement on the extent of such Gas Field
and its reserve area, be allowed to hold the Gas Field plus such reserve
area for a period not exceeding five (5) years commencing on the fifth
anniversary of the Effective Date. The purpose of this holding period is
for Contractors to submit for the approval of MTJA a comprehensive
Development Plan for the implementation of a viable gas supply project
based on normally acceptable commercial considerations. The Development
Plan for the Gas Field or Fields, notwithstanding the provisions of
Article 1, shall also include a realistic gas demand forecast
corresponding to specific outlets, sequence and timing of field
development, the proposed project structure, gas pricing mechanism and
other fiscal terms for the project.

Contractors shall before the expiry of the 5-year holding period submit
a Development Plan for the Gas Field or Fields for the approval of MTJA.
Failure to submit a Development Plan within the 5-year holding period
shall render the Gas Field or Fields relinquished to MTJA.

<PAGE>

-51-

Contractors shall develop the Gas Field or Fields within five (5) years
from the date of MTJA's approval of the Development Plan or within any
longer period as MTJA may approve.

Failure to develop the Gas Field or Fields within the approved period
shall render the Gas Field or Fields relinquished to MTJA unless
Contractors can reasonably demonstrate that such failure is due to force
majeure circumstances pursuant to Article 22.

In the event that Contractors, after full investigation during a holding
period of a Gas Field or Fields, consider that the development,
production and delivery of Natural Gas to any outlet cannot be justified
commercially, the relevant Gas Field or Fields shall be relinquished and
no longer form part of the Contract Area and MTJA may thereafter
undertake at its own expense the development of the Gas Field or Fields
and the production arising therefrom shall, notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Contract, accrue wholly to MTJA.

Upon relinquishment of any Gas Field under any provision of this
Contract, MTJA and its authorised representatives shall have the
absolute right to move freely within the Contract Area for doing all
that are necessary for the purpose of evaluation, developing and
producing Natural Gas from any Gas Field so relinquished to MTJA
provided that no undue interference with Petroleum Operations of
Contractors shall be caused by reason thereof.

Notwithstanding the above, any Gas Field not developed within the period
of this contract shall be considered relinquished to MTJA.

<PAGE>

-52-

8.2 Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Article, Contractors shall
obtain MTJA's approval for using Non- associated Gas produced in the
Contract Area for all Petroleum Operations in Crude Oil production
including re-injection for pressure maintenance or re-cycling operations
to effect maximum economic recovery of Crude Oil.

8.3 The production of Non-associated Gas under this Contract may be carried
out:

(a) for a period of twenty (20) years from the date of the First
Commercial Production; or

(b) until the expiry of the term of this Contract,

whichever is the earlier. Provided however in the event Contractors
effect the First Commercial Production before the expiry of the holding
period (for the identification and nomination of the gas market) or the
development period, the balance of either or both of those periods shall
be added to the above production period.

8.4 Contractors' entitlement to Associated Gas from any Oil Field shall be
governed by the duration as allowed for the production of Crude Oil
under Article 2.6 from the relevant Oil Field.

Subject to MTJA's approval, Contractors shall be given priority to use
Associated Gas produced in the Contract Area for Petroleum Operations
including re-injection for pressure maintenance or re-cycling operations
to effect maximum economic recovery of Crude Oil and the cost of such
operations shall be regarded as an allowable cost for the calculation of

<PAGE>

-53-

Cost Oil in accordance with Article 5.1(b). Subject to the preceding
sentence, Contractors shall collect all Associated Gas that is produced
in association with Crude Oil and which is agreed with MTJA to be
capable of being exploited commercially by Contractors.

It is hereby recognised by the Parties that Contractors shall minimise
flaring of Associated Gas by re-injecting Associated Gas not needed in
the conduct of Petroleum Operations and Associated Gas not capable of
being exploited commercially into suitable strata or underground storage
in accordance with good oilfield practice. Contractors shall seek
MTJA's permission to flare Associated Gas which cannot be re-injected
due to specific reservoir considerations or for other reasons that are
accepted internationally and in line with good oilfield practice.
Before flaring, Contractors shall take all reasonable measures to ensure
the extraction of natural gasoline and other liquids contained in
Associated Gas if economically justifiable in the opinion of MTJA and
Contractors.

8.5 For the purpose of division of Natural Gas under this Contract, there
shall first be deducted from Natural Gas, be it Associated Gas or
Non-associated Gas or both produced and saved and not used in Petroleum
Operations but available for commercial sale in the Contract Area in a
Quarter:

(a) ten per cent (10%) shall be taken by MTJA in kind to be disposed
in any manner it deems fit to settle royalty payments for that
Quarter to the respective Governments pursuant to the MTJA Act
1990;

<PAGE>

-54-

(b) up to a maximum of fifty per cent (50%) shall be applied in the
manner hereinafter provided for the purpose of recovery by
Contractors of allowable costs expended in that Quarter for the
Contract Area in relation to Petroleum Operations in respect of
Natural Gas.

Contractors are entitled to recover all such allowable costs
from the proceeds of Natural Gas sold equal to the amount of all
such allowable costs in the Contract Area (but subject to
Article 8.7).

If in any Quarter all such costs expended relating to Petroleum
Operations in respect of Natural Gas (including amounts
accumulated or carried forward from previous Quarters) exceed
the value of fifty per cent (50%) of such Natural Gas sold from
the Contract Area, the unrecovered excess may be carried forward
to the next succeeding Quarter and added to all such allowable
costs expended relating to Petroleum Operations in respect of
Natural Gas for that Quarter, but provided that such costs can
only be recovered for any Quarter up to a maximum of fifty per
cent (50%) of such Natural Gas sold.

The remaining proceeds from the Natural Gas sold shall be divided in
the manner provided in Article 8.6.

Notwithstanding the definition of Crude Oil in Article 1.1, costs
associated with the production of condensates and Natural Gas liquids
shall be considered as part of all such costs expended relating to
Petroleum Operations in respect of Natural Gas, and shall be recoverable
as provided above in this Article and/or Article 5.1(e).

<PAGE>

-55-

8.6 The total Profit Gas proceeds in a Quarter shall be divided between MTJA
and Contractors such that MTJA and Contractors shall take and receive
their respective entitlements in the ratio of fifty to fifty (50:50).

8.7 Contractors and MTJA shall negotiate for the sale of Natural Gas on a
joint-dedicated basis to an outlet or outlets for Natural Gas at prices
and upon terms common to both Parties which in the opinion of MTJA and
Contractors justify the development, production and delivery of Natural
Gas to such outlet having regard to Article 3.7 and a competitive price.
Contractors are not authorised to sell their share of Natural Gas
pursuant to Articles 8.5(b) and 8.6 on any other basis save on a
joint-dedicated basis. However, Contractors and MTJA may each take
necessary steps to identify a Natural Gas outlet or outlets at the
earliest opportunities.

8.8 Subject to Contractors agreeing to develop, produce and deliver Natural
Gas to an outlet or outlets referred to in Article 8.7 and subject
further to MTJA participating in the development of the said outlet or
outlets, MTJA may, by notice to Contractors and subject to such terms as
it may determine, invite Contractors to participate in the development
of the said outlet or outlets. Within three (3) months of receipt of
such notice Contractors shall notify MTJA in writing whether or not they
agree to participate in the development of the said outlet or outlets.

8.9 Contractors shall be responsible for all losses of Natural Gas produced
up to the relevant outlet as determined pursuant to this Article 8, by
reason of Contractors' proven negligence or wilful misconduct, and
without prejudice to MTJA's other rights and remedies MTJA may give
notice to Contractors that such loss shall be applied first in reducing
Contractors' Portion of Profit Gas. Any loss occasioned by any cause

<PAGE>

-56-

other than Contractors' proven negligence or wilful misconduct during
transfer of such Natural Gas to such outlet shall be shared between MTJA
and Contractors in proportion to their respective aggregate entitlements
to Cost Gas and Profit Gas pursuant to Articles 8.5 (b) and 8.6.

so reached or exceeded, and fluctuating production rates shall
not effect a tier of production once so reached or exceeded.
The amount shall be paid within thirty (30) days of the
calendar month following the end of the relevant Quarter when
the relevant tier of production of Crude Oil and Natural Gas is
first reached or exceeded. Reference to one (1) Kilolitre in
relation to Natural Gas shall be construed as reference to
measurement in one (1) Cubic Meter multiplied by a factor based
on the gross heat value of each unit of measurement. For this
purpose, the gross heat value of Crude Oil shall be taken as a
constant of nine million (9,000,000) Kilocalories per Kilolitre
and that of Natural Gas as a constant of nine thousand (9,000)
Kilocalories per Cubic Meter. For purpose of determining
