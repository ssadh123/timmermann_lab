REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and
Shareholders of H&C Communications, Inc. and
The Washington Post Company

In our opinion, the accompanying combined balance sheet and the related
combined statements of income and of cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of KPRC and KSAT Television Stations (business
units of H&C Communications, Inc.) at December 31, 1993, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for the year in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Companies' management; our responsibility is to express
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our
audit of these statements in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - THE COMPANIES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Combined Financial Statements

The financial statements combine the accounts of the following wholly-owned
unincorporated business units of H&C Communications, Inc.:

KPRC - NBC affiliated television station in Houston, Texas
KSAT - ABC affiliated television station in San Antonio, Texas

The above entities are herein referred to as "the Companies". All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Cash and cash equivalents - For purposes of the statement of cash flows, the
Companies consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original
maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents.

Advertising revenues and trade accounts receivable - Revenues are generated
principally from sales of commercial advertising and are recorded net of agency
and national representative commissions as the advertisements are broadcast.
Revenues applicable to commercial advertising availabilities "traded" to
advertisers in exchange for merchandise or services are recorded at the
estimated fair market value of the merchandise or services received.

Program rights - The Companies have entered into program rental contracts which
generally provide for rentals to be paid in installments. Payments made for
program rights which are currently available and the liability for future
payments under these contracts are included in the combined balance sheet.
Program rights are amortized primarily using the straight-line method over a
twelve month period. Certain program rights with lives greater than one year
are amortized using accelerated methods. Program rights expected to be
amortized in the succeeding year and amounts payable within one year are
classified as current assets and liabilities, respectively.

Property, plant and equipment - Property, plant and equipment are recorded at
cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; replacements
and major improvements are capitalized.

Depreciation expense is computed using the straight-line method for buildings
and accelerated methods for furniture, machinery and equipment. Leasehold
improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the lesser of
the term of the related lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets. The
useful lives of property, plant and equipment for purposes of computing
depreciation and amortization expense are:

Buildings 15 - 45 years
Leasehold improvements 7 - 15 years
Furniture, machinery and equipment 3 - 20 years

8
<PAGE> 9
Goodwill and other intangible assets - Goodwill and other intangibles represent
the unamortized excess of the cost of acquiring the Companies over the fair
values of such Companies' net tangible assets at the dates of acquisition.
Goodwill and other intangibles acquired are being amortized by use of the
straight-line method over various periods up to 40 years.

Income taxes - The Companies are business units of H&C Communications, Inc.,
which has elected to be taxed as an S Corporation. Accordingly, the
shareholders of H&C Communications, Inc. include their pro rata share of the
Companies' net income in their individual income tax returns and therefore the
accompanying financial statements do not include a provision for federal income
tax. The state income tax provision represents the Texas Earned Surplus Tax.

NOTE 2 - TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTY

Interunit Transactions

The Companies are charged directly for certain costs that H&C Communications,
Inc. incurs on behalf of its business units. These costs primarily relate to
employee benefits; audit and legal services; insurance coverage; and, payroll
and sales and use taxes. Such charges by H&C Communications, Inc. are based on
a direct cost pass-through and have been included in these combined financial
statements. Costs associated with executive management and corporate overhead
are not allocated, as management believes these amounts to be insignificant.
Net corporate expenses charged to the Companies in 1993 approximated
$8,258,000. In the opinion of management, all allocations have been made on a
reasonable basis.

H&C Communications, Inc. Investment

Since the Companies are business units and not distinct legal entities, there
are no customary equity and capital accounts. Instead H&C Communications, Inc.
investment is maintained by the Companies to account for all interunit
transactions, including those described above. H&C Communications, Inc.
investment is comprised of net income and other transactions with H&C
Communications, Inc. as shown below:

Balance, beginning of year $114,983,997
Net income 23,223,410
Cash transfers out 34,656,239
Net interunit transactions 8,257,842

determination will, if practicable in the circumstances, use reasonable efforts
to allow the other party reasonable time to comment on such release or
announcement in advance of its issuance.

6.3. Regulatory Approvals. (a) Seller and Purchasers will use their
respective reasonable efforts to obtain any authorizations, consents, orders
and approvals of any Governmental Entity necessary for the performance of their
respective obligations under this Agreement and the consummation of the
respective transactions to be consummated by each of them hereunder, and will

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the parties will use
their respective reasonable efforts to have such injunction dissolved or
otherwise eliminated as promptly as possible.

6.5. Limitations on Certain Obligations; Notices. (a)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither

Seller and Purchasers to obtain any authorization, consent, order or approval
of any Governmental Entity contemplated by Section 6.3 or to have any
injunction contemplated by Section 6.4 dissolved or eliminated.

6.10. Environmental Survey. (a) Purchasers will cause an
environmental assessment (the "Study"), addressed jointly to Purchasers and
Seller, of the Real Property listed on Schedule 5.1.7(a) to be prepared by SWL
Environmental Services (the "Engineer") no later than 30 calendar days after

Purchasers warrants further investigations of the Real Property (collectively,
"Follow On Studies"), Purchasers will have the right to procure Follow On
Studies, to be completed no later than 90 calendar days after the date hereof,
of such aspects of the Real Property and the estimated costs of remediation of
(i) any Hazardous Material upon, about or beneath the Real Property or
migrating or threatening to migrate to the Real Property, (ii) any violation of
Environmental Requirements pertaining to the Real Property, or (iii) any
Environmental Damages pertaining to the Real Property as Purchasers may
determine. Purchasers will instruct the Engineer to conduct the Study and the
Follow On Studies in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with or
disrupt the Businesses or cause reasonably avoidable damage to any of the
Purchased Assets, the Blue Ridge Assets or the HT Joint Venture Assets, taking
into account the nature of the Study or the Follow On Studies, as the case may
be, and the Engineer shall be required to obtain the prior consent of Seller
for any activity undertaken after the date of this Agreement on any tower site,
which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. The costs and expenses
associated with the preparation of the Study and any Follow On Study shall be
borne by the Purchasers. No damage caused by the negligence or willful
misconduct of Purchasers or the Engineer in performing the Study or any Follow
On Study will relieve Purchasers of their obligations to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) If the Study and/or any Follow On Study reveals the
existence of (i) any Hazardous Materials upon, about or beneath the Real
Property or migrating to the Real Property, (ii) any violation of Environmental
Requirements pertaining to the Real Property, or (iii) any Environmental
Damages pertaining to the Real Property (any of the foregoing, to the extent
identified with reasonable specificity in the Study and/or any Follow On Study,
being referred to herein as "Discovered Environmental Problems"), then such
Study or Follow On Study shall also specify whether the estimated cost of
remediation thereof to the levels and the extent then required under all
applicable Environmental Requirements, including subsequent oversight and
management

-57-
<PAGE> 67
("Remediation"), is estimated by the Engineer to be more than $5.0 million with
respect to the Houston Owned Real Property, the Houston Leased Real Property,
the Blue Ridge Owned Real Property, the Blue Ridge Leased Real Property, the HT
Joint Venture Owned Real Property, and the HT Joint Venture Leased Real
Property (collectively, the "Houston Real Property"), and whether the cost of
Remediation is estimated by the Engineer to be more than $5.0 million with
respect to the San Antonio Owned Real Property and the San Antonio Leased Real
Property (collectively, the "San Antonio Real Property"). In the event that
the Study or any Follow On Study estimates the costs of Remediation to be in
excess of the amounts specified above or states that the Engineer cannot
reasonably estimate whether such costs will be in excess of such amounts, then
either Seller or Purchasers may terminate this Agreement upon written notice to
the other(s) within 30 calendar days following the receipt by such party of the
Engineer's statement to that effect (but not later than the Closing Date).
However, if Seller elects to terminate this Agreement as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence, Purchasers will be entitled to nullify Seller's
election to terminate this Agreement by giving written notice (a "Continuation
Notice") to Seller, within 10 business days after the date of Seller's notice
to Purchasers terminating this Agreement, that Purchasers elect to proceed to
the Closing hereunder, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 insofar as they relate to matters other than
the Discovered Environmental Problems.

(c) Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Section 6.10(b), Seller will pay, and indemnify, defend and hold Purchasers,
their Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, representatives,
employees and agents harmless from and against, any and all costs of
Remediation of the Discovered Environmental Problems, up to a maximum amount of
$5.0 million with respect to the Houston Real Property and $5.0 million with
respect to the San Antonio Real Property (except as otherwise provided in
Section 6.10(d)), together, in each case, with (i) any fines or penalties
imposed by any Governmental Entity for violation of applicable Environmental
Requirements (except to the extent that such fines or penalties result from a
change, after the Closing, in the applicable Environmental Requirements), and
(ii) any Liabilities to third parties for personal injury arising out of any
Discovered Environmental Problems and occurring prior to Closing, or occurring
subsequent to Closing to the extent that such injury results from the failure
to effect Remediation (in each case provided, however, that Seller shall not be
responsible for any fines, penalties or Liabilities to third parties for
personal injury arising out of any unreasonable delay on the part of Purchasers
in completing Remediation for which they are responsible under Section
6.10(e)). After the Closing, except as provided in Section 6.10(d), Purchasers
will pay, and indemnify,

-58-
<PAGE> 68
defend and hold Seller, its affiliates and their respective directors,
officers, representatives, employees and agents harmless from and against, any
and all costs of Remediation of the Discovered Environmental Problems in excess
of the amounts specified in the immediately preceding sentence.

(d) If Seller has but declines to exercise the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.10(b), the $5.0 million caps on
Seller's Remediation obligations shall not apply, Seller shall pay all costs of
such Remediation, and Purchasers shall have no liability or obligation with
respect thereto.

(e) Remediation shall be conducted by and under the control of
Seller until such time, if any, as the responsibility for the costs thereof has
shifted to Purchasers; provided, however, that Seller shall regularly consult
with and advise Purchasers regarding the status of the Remediation efforts, and
shall conduct such Remediation in a manner reasonably calculated to minimize
interference with the ongoing operations of Purchasers.

6.11. Repairs. Prior to the Closing, Seller will, and will use its
best efforts to cause Blue Ridge and the HT Joint Venture, as applicable, to,
repair or replace the items and take the other actions described on Schedule
6.11. All of such repairs, replacements, additions, modifications and other
actions will be made or taken in a good and workmanlike manner and will be of a
quality that is reasonably acceptable to Purchasers.

6.12. Possession and Control of Station. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, from the date hereof through the
Closing Date, Purchasers will not directly or indirectly control, supervise or
direct, or attempt to control, supervise or direct, the operations of either of
the TV-Stations, and the conduct of such operations, including control and
supervision of programming, will be the sole responsibility of Seller, subject
to the sole and exclusive control of Seller.

6.13. Maintenance of Cash Balances. For a period of 30 months
following the Closing Date, and for so long thereafter as Seller has any
continuing obligations under Section 6.10 or 8.3 (but only to the extent and in
the amount of such continuing obligations), Seller will at all times maintain a
net worth and cash or cash equivalent balances each in an amount at least equal
to the sum of (a) $10.0 million (subject to reduction from time to time in
respect of amounts paid by Seller to or on behalf of Purchasers pursuant to
Section 8.3) and (b) Seller's maximum remaining obligations from time to time
under Section 6.10. Nothing in this Section 6.13 will be deemed to limit any
liability Seller may have under this Agreement or otherwise. Except to the
extent that this Section 6.13 defines the scope of

-59-
<PAGE> 69
the obligations of William P. Hobby and Jessica Hobby Catto under the
Undertaking, nothing in this Section 6.13 will be deemed to limit any
liability, at law or in equity, that the stockholders of Seller may have with
respect to this Agreement.

VIII. SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

8.1. Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. The
several representations and warranties of the parties contained in this
Agreement (or in any document delivered in connection herewith) will be deemed
to have been made on and as of the date of this Agreement and on and as of the
Closing Date, will survive the Closing Date and will remain operative and in
full force and effect until the date that is 30 months after the Closing Date
(the "Termination Date"). The covenants of the parties contained in this
Agreement (or in any document delivered in connection herewith) will remain
operative and in full force and effect without any time limitation, except to
the extent that any such covenant is limited in duration by the express terms
thereof. Any right of indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII with
respect to a claimed breach of a representation or warranty will expire at
11:59 p.m. on the Termination Date unless, on or prior to the Termination Date,
a Claim Notice has been given to the party from whom indemnification is sought.
Provided that a Claim Notice is timely so given, the right to indemnification
pursuant to this Article VIII with respect to a claimed breach to which such
Claim Notice relates will not be affected by the occurrence of the Termination
Date. For purposes of this Agreement, a "Claim Notice" means a written notice
asserting a breach of a representation or warranty contained in this Agreement
which reasonably sets forth, in light of the information then known to the
party giving such notice, a description of, and an estimate (if it is then
reasonable to make an estimate) of the amount involved in, such breach,
together with copies of all available documentation with respect thereto. The
representations, warranties and covenants of Purchasers contained in this
Agreement (or in any document delivered in connection herewith), will not be
diminished or otherwise affected as a result of any investigation or knowledge
of Seller. The representations, warranties and covenants of Seller contained
in this Agreement (or in any document delivered in connection herewith) will
not be diminished or otherwise affected as a result of any investigation or
knowledge of Purchasers.

8.2. Indemnification by Purchasers. Purchasers will, jointly and
severally, indemnify, defend and hold Seller, its Affiliates, and their
respective directors, officers, representatives, employees and agents harmless
from and against any Liabilities resulting or arising from, relating to or

-65-
<PAGE> 75
incurred in connection with: (a) any breach of any representation or warranty
of Purchasers contained herein or in any other document delivered by Purchasers
in connection herewith, (b) any breach of any covenant of either Purchaser
contained herein or in any other document delivered by such Purchaser in
connection herewith, including without limitation the covenants of such
Purchaser contained in Section 4.1, or (c) the conduct of the Businesses or the
ownership of the Purchased Assets at any time following the Closing Date,
except for and to the extent of the Retained Liabilities or any other Liability
from and against which Seller is obligated to indemnify Purchasers pursuant to
any provision of this Agreement.

8.3. Indemnification by Seller. Seller will indemnify, defend and
hold Purchasers, their Affiliates, and their respective directors, officers,
representatives, employees and agents harmless from and against any and all
Liabilities resulting or arising from, relating to or incurred in connection
with: (a) any failure of Seller to pay, perform and discharge any of the
Retained Liabilities, (b) any breach of any representation, warranty of Seller
contained herein or in any other document delivered by Seller in connection
herewith, (c) any breach of any covenant of Seller contained herein or in any
other document delivered by Seller in connection herewith, or (d) the conduct
of the Businesses or the ownership or use of the Purchased Assets or the HT
Joint Venture Assets at any time on or prior to the Closing Date, except for
and to the extent of the Assumed Liabilities (other than any liabilities and
obligations under Assumed Contracts to indemnify third parties in respect of
any such matters); provided, however, that clause (d) of this Section 8.3 will
not provide a basis for the assertion of any claim for indemnification by
Seller in respect of Liabilities resulting or arising from, relating to or
incurred in connection with (x) any Hazardous Materials upon, about or beneath
the Real Property or migrating or threatening to migrate to or from the Real
Property, (y) any violation of Environmental Requirements pertaining to the
Real Property, or (z) any Environmental Damages pertaining to the Real
Property.

8.4. Notice of Claim; Right to Participate in and Defend Third Party
Claim. (a) If any indemnified party receives notice of the assertion of any
claim, the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding, or the imposition of
any penalty or assessment by a third party in respect of which indemnity may be
sought hereunder (a "Third Party Claim"), and the indemnified party intends to
seek indemnity hereunder, then the indemnified party will promptly provide the
indemnifying party with written notice of the Third Party Claim, but in any
event not later than 30 calendar days after receipt of such notice of Third
Party Claim. The failure by an indemnified party to notify an indemnifying
party of a Third Party Claim will not relieve the indemnifying party of any
indemnification responsibility under

-66-
<PAGE> 76
this Article VIII, except to the extent, if any, that such failure materially
prejudices the ability of the indemnifying party to defend such Third Party
Claim.

(b) Without prejudice to the rights of the indemnified party
prior thereto, the indemnifying party will have the right to control the
defense, compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim with its own counsel
(reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party) if the indemnifying party
delivers written notice to the indemnified party within 30 calendar days
following the indemnifying party's receipt of notice of the Third Party Claim
from the indemnified party setting forth its undertaking to defend such Third
Party Claim in accordance with this Article VIII; provided, however, that the
indemnifying party will not enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim
which would impose or create any obligation or any financial or other liability
on the part of the indemnified party if such liability or obligation (i)
requires more than the payment of a liquidated sum or (ii) is not covered by
the indemnification provided to the indemnified party hereunder. In its
defense, compromise or settlement of any Third Party Claim, the indemnifying
party will timely provide the indemnified party with such information with
respect to such defense, compromise or settlement as the indemnified party may
reasonably request, and will not assume any position or take any action that
would impose an obligation of any kind on, or restrict the actions of, the
indemnified party. The indemnified party will be entitled (at the indemnified
party's expense) to participate in the defense by the indemnifying party of any
Third Party Claim with its own counsel.

(c) In the event that the indemnifying party does not
undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of a Third Party Claim in
accordance with subsection (b) of this Section 8.4, the indemnified party will
have the right to control the defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim
with counsel of its choosing; provided, however, that the indemnified party
will not settle or compromise any Third Party Claim without the indemnifying
party's prior written consent, unless (i) the terms of such settlement or
compromise release the indemnified party or the indemnifying party from any and
all liability with respect to the Third Party Claim or (ii) the indemnifying
party will not have acknowledged its obligations to indemnify the indemnified
party with respect to such Third Party Claim in accordance with this Article
VIII. The indemnifying party will be entitled (at the indemnifying party's
expense) to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim with its own
counsel.

(d) Any indemnifiable claim hereunder that is not a Third
Party Claim will be asserted by the indemnified party by promptly delivering
notice thereof to the indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party does not
respond to such notice within 60

-67-
<PAGE> 77
days after its receipt, it will have no further right to contest the validity
of such claim.

8.5. Basket. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
indemnified party will be entitled to assert a claim for indemnification
against an indemnifying party under any of Sections 8.2(a), 8.2(b) (insofar as
Section 8.2(b) relates to covenants that are to be performed or observed only
prior to the Closing), 8.3(b) or 8.3(c) (insofar as Section 8.3(c) relates to
covenants that are to be performed or observed only prior to the Closing)
unless and until the aggregate amount of the claims that such indemnified party
would otherwise be entitled to assert under Sections 8.2(a) and 8.2(b) (insofar
as Section 8.2(b) relates to covenants that are to be performed or observed
only prior to the Closing) or Sections 8.3(b) and 8.3(c) (insofar as Section
8.3(c) relates to covenants that are to be performed or observed only prior to
the Closing), whichever are applicable, exceeds $200,000 (provided, however,
that the amounts of claims of both Purchasers will be aggregated for purposes
of this Section 8.5), and then to the full extent of the aggregate amount of
such claims.

8.6. Real Property Claims. With respect to any breach by Seller of
any representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein that relates to a
matter in respect of which Purchasers would be entitled to assert a claim under
any of the Title Policies, Purchasers will not be entitled to assert any claim
against Seller for indemnification hereunder (other than to give a Claim Notice
with respect thereto) with respect to such breach or to pursue any other legal
action against Seller with respect to such breach, unless and until (i)
Purchasers shall have used reasonable efforts to pursue any remedies available
to them under the Title Policies with respect to such matter and (ii) such
efforts shall have not resulted in complete indemnification of Purchasers for
the applicable Liabilities within 12 months from the date of delivery of the
applicable Claim Notice to Seller. In the event such efforts have not resulted
in complete indemnification of Purchasers within such 12-month period, and
Purchasers assert a claim against Seller for indemnification under this Article
VIII, Purchasers will assign to Seller all of their rights under the Title
Policies with respect to such matter, to the extent permitted by such Title
Policy, and will reasonably cooperate with Seller in pursuing any claim under
such Title Policy. For purposes of Section 8.5, the amount of any claim
asserted by Purchasers against Seller with respect to such breach will be
reduced by an amount equal to any amount that is actually recovered by
Purchasers pursuant to the Title Policies.

4.2, except as expressly set forth in Section 4.1, Purchaser will have no
liability or obligation whatsoever under the Employee Plans.

(b) Actions by Seller. Seller will offer to all
employees of the Businesses at the time of the Closing the right to continue
their coverage under Seller's group health plan(s) (as defined in Section
5000(b)(1) of the Code), such offers to be made in accordance with the
continuation coverage requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA
and Section 4980B of the Code.

(c) Employee Communications. Prior to the Closing, upon
reasonable prior notice to Seller and subject to such limitations as Seller may
reasonably require, Purchasers may communicate with any of the Employees of
Seller currently employed in the Businesses.

(d) Employee Information. Except as otherwise prohibited by
Law, Seller will provide to Purchasers, in a timely manner, any information
that Purchasers may reasonably request with respect to any Employee, his or her

Businesses.

9.2. Certain Tax Matters. (a) Except to the extent specified in
Section 10.2, any sales, use, transfer, stamp, conveyance, value added or other
similar Taxes that may be imposed by any Governmental Entity with respect to
the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets, or otherwise on account of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, will be borne by Seller.
Seller will indemnify Purchasers against any Liability, direct or indirect, for
any Taxes imposed on Purchasers with respect to the Purchased Assets that are
attributable to any taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date or
with respect to the allocable portion of any taxable period that includes but
does not end on the Closing Date. Purchasers will jointly and severally
indemnify Seller against any Liability, direct or indirect, for any Taxes
imposed upon Seller with respect to the Purchased Assets that are attributable
to any taxable periods commencing following the

-69-
<PAGE> 79
Closing Date or with respect to the allocable portion of any taxable period
that ends following the Closing Date.

(b) Seller will cause to be included in its income Tax
Returns for all periods or portions thereof ending on or before or which
include the Closing Date, tax items relating to the operations of the
Businesses (other than the operations of Blue Ridge) during such periods or
portions thereof determined by an interim closing of the books as of the
Closing Date. Seller will prepare and file or cause to be prepared and filed
all such Tax Returns with the appropriate Governmental Entities. Seller will
make all payments shown thereon as owing with respect to such Tax Returns.

(c) Seller and Purchasers will (i) each provide the other
with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by any of them in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, audit or other examination
by any taxing authority or judicial or administrative proceedings relating to
liability for Taxes, (ii) each retain and provide the others with any records
or other information that may be relevant to such Tax Return, audit or
examination, proceeding or determination, and (iii) each provide the others
with any final determination of any such audit or examination, proceeding or
determination that affects any amount required to be shown on any Tax Return of
the others for any period. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Purchasers and Seller will retain until the applicable statutes of limitations
(including any extensions) have expired copies of all records or information
that may be relevant to returns filed by the other party for all tax periods or
portions thereof ending before or including the Closing Date.

9.3. Insurance. With respect to any loss, liability or damage
relating to, resulting from or arising out of the Purchased Assets, the Blue
Ridge Assets, the HT Joint Venture Assets or the conduct of the Businesses or
the business activities of Blue Ridge or the HT Joint Venture on or prior to
the Closing Date for which Seller would be entitled to assert, or cause any
other person or entity to assert, a claim for recovery under any policy of
Insurance, at the request of either Purchaser, Seller will use reasonable
efforts to assert, or to assist such Purchaser to assert, one or more claims
(unless such claims constitute an Excluded Asset) under such policy of
Insurance covering such loss, liability or damage if such Purchaser is not
itself entitled to assert such claim but Seller is so entitled.

9.4. Prorations. (a) Without limiting the generality or effect of
Sections 4.1 and 4.2, and in order to facilitate the implementation of the
provisions of such Sections and Section 9.7, the following principles of
allocation will be employed:

-70-
<PAGE> 80
(i) Items that accrue or are invoiced on a periodic
basis, such as utility payments, lease payments and receipts and ad
valorem tax obligations, will be allocated to Seller and Purchasers,
respectively, on a per diem basis over the relevant pre-Closing and
post-Closing periods;

(ii) Film contract payables that become due and payable on
or prior to the Closing Date will be allocated to Seller; film
contract payables that become due and payable after the Closing Date
will be allocated to Purchasers;

(iii) Amounts received or receivable for goods or services
provided or performed on or prior to the Closing Date will be
allocated to Seller; amounts received or receivable for goods or
services provided or performed after the Closing Date will be
allocated to Purchasers; and

(iv) Other items of expense and income, to the extent not
addressed by the foregoing principles or any other provision of this
Agreement, will be allocated equitably in order to provide Seller the
benefits and burdens of operating the TV Stations on or prior to the
Closing Date and provide Purchasers the benefits and burdens of
operating the TV Stations after the Closing Date.

(b) Deposits or prepayments made by Seller on or prior to the
Closing Date in respect of obligations to be satisfied after the Closing Date
will be allocated to Seller, and deposits or prepayments received by Seller on
or prior to the Closing Date for obligations to be satisfied after the Closing
Date will be allocated to Purchasers.

(c) To the extent that the foregoing allocations are not otherwise
effected pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.7, Seller and Purchasers will
cooperate in good faith with each other to determine and give effect to such
allocations as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date. All
undisputed amounts due to Seller from Purchasers or to Purchasers from Seller,
as the case may be, in accordance with the foregoing allocations which are not
otherwise taken into account in the collection and application of receivables
and payment of payables provided for in Section 9.7 will be paid to the party
entitled thereto promptly upon request. Seller and Purchasers will use good
faith efforts to resolve any disputes with respect to any such amounts, and to
effect the payment of any such amounts to the party or parties entitled thereto
in accordance with the foregoing allocations, as promptly as practicable.

9.5. Audited Financial Statements; Closing Date Balance Sheet. (a)
From and after the date hereof, Seller will provide Purchasers and their
accountants and other representatives reasonable access during normal business
hours to the facilities,

-71-
<PAGE> 81
personnel and accounting and other records of the Businesses to the extent
reasonably necessary to permit Purchasers and their accountants to prepare, at
the expense of Purchasers, audited financial statements for the Businesses in
accordance with the provisions of SEC Regulation S-X applicable to Current
Reports on Form 8-K, consisting of balance sheets as of December 31, 1992 and
1993 and statements of income and cash flows for the years ended December 31,
1991, 1992 and 1993. Seller will (i) cooperate with Purchasers and their
accountants and other representatives in connection with the preparation of
such audited financial statements, (ii) provide such management representation
letters in connection therewith as Purchasers' accountants may reasonably
request, and (iii) direct its accountants to cooperate with Purchasers and
their accountants and other representatives in connection with the preparation
of such audited financial statements.

(b) As promptly as practicable (and in no event more than 60
calendar days) after the Closing Date, Seller will prepare and deliver to
Purchasers an unaudited balance sheet of the Businesses as of the Closing Date
(the "Closing Date Balance Sheet"). In connection with the preparation of the
Closing Date Balance Sheet, (i) Seller will cause the accounting records of the
Businesses to be closed as of the close of business on the Closing Date and
(ii) the Closing Date Balance Sheet will be prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except for matters noted thereon that were noted on the Financial Statements
and except that the Closing Date Balance Sheet will not contain the notes that
would normally be included in financial statements prepared in accordance with
GAAP) and on a basis consistent with, and using the same accounting policies,
practices and procedures used in preparing, the Balance Sheet. Purchasers will
(A) provide Seller and its representatives access during normal business hours
to the facilities, personnel and accounting and other records of the Businesses
to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Seller to prepare the Closing Date
Balance Sheet; provided, however, that Seller will conduct any such review in a
manner that does not unreasonably interfere with Purchasers' conduct of the
Businesses after the Closing, and (B) take such actions as may be reasonably
requested by Seller to close, or to assist Seller in closing, as of the Closing
Date, the books and accounting records of the Businesses and otherwise
reasonably cooperate with Seller and its representatives in the preparation of
the Closing Date Balance Sheet.

9.6. Limitation on Competition. (a) As a material inducement to
Purchasers' entry into this Agreement, and as further consideration for the
covenants of Purchasers contained herein, during the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary thereof (the "Noncompete
Term"), none of Seller, Mrs. Jessica Catto, Mr. William P. Hobby, and Mr. James
E. Crowther will participate, directly or indirectly,

-72-
<PAGE> 82
in the day-to-day operations of (including without limitation the solicitation
of customers for) or invest in, own, lend to or otherwise financially assist
any broadcast television station business licensed to, or any cable television
business conducted in, Harris County, Texas, or Bexar County, Texas; provided,
however, that the foregoing restriction will not prevent the passive ownership
by any of the foregoing of not more than 2.5% of any class of securities of any
publicly held company engaged in such businesses.

(b) At all times following the Closing, Seller and its
Affiliates will keep confidential all proprietary and other business
information and trade secrets relating to the Businesses, including names or
lists of advertisers and customers, and will not use or permit any other person
or entity to use such information or trade secrets in any business that
competes with either the Houston Business or the San Antonio Business or the
business activities of Blue Ridge or the HT Joint Venture or in any other
manner detrimental to Purchasers or their respective Affiliates.

(c) During the Noncompete Term, neither Seller nor its
Affiliates shall directly or indirectly induce or attempt to induce any
employee of either Purchaser or of Blue Ridge or the HT Joint Venture or any
employee of Seller hired by either Purchaser to leave the employment of such
Purchaser or Blue Ridge or the HT Joint Venture, as the case may be, or to
accept any other employment or position unless (in each case prior to such
inducement or attempted inducement) such employee has been terminated as an
employee of such Purchaser or Blue Ridge or the HT Joint Venture, as the case
may be.

(d) Seller acknowledges and agrees that any breach of the
covenants set forth in paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this Section 9.6 will
result in irreparable damage to Purchasers for which Purchasers will have not
adequate remedy at law and, accordingly, that Purchasers will be entitled to an
injunction restraining Seller or any of its Affiliates from such breach;
provided, however, that resort to such injunctive relief will not be exclusive
of any other remedy at law, in equity or otherwise, and will not preclude the
recovery by Purchasers of monetary damages or other relief in addition thereto.
In the event that paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of this Section 9.6 shall be
determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable by reason
of its extending for too long a period of time or too large a geographic area
or by reason of being too extensive in any other respect or for any other
reason, such paragraphs will be interpreted to extend only for the maximum
period of time and/or geographic area as to which it may be enforceable and/or
to the maximum extent in all other respects as to which it may be enforceable,
all as determined by each court.

-73-
<PAGE> 83
9.7. Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable. (a) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Purchasers will, from and
after the Closing Date and until the later of (i) such time as all of the
accounts payable incurred in connection with the conduct of the Businesses on
or prior to the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Payables") shall have been paid
and (ii) six months after the Closing Date (the "Collection Period"), use their
reasonable efforts to collect for Seller's account the accounts receivable of
Seller included in the Excluded Assets (the "Pre-Closing Receivables") and
apply the proceeds of such collections (the "Proceeds") in the manner set forth
in this Section 9.7. Without limiting the generality or effect of the
immediately preceding sentence or any other provision of this Agreement, Seller
will maintain from the date hereof through the Closing Date all so-called
"lock-box" or similar arrangements with financial institutions in respect of
such collections, and Seller and Purchasers will enter into appropriate
arrangements with such financial institutions to continue such lock-box or
similar arrangements in effect for the benefit of Purchasers from and after the
Closing.

(b) All amounts received by Purchasers from obligors under the
Pre-Closing Receivables (including any such obligors that are also indebted to
Purchasers) will be applied by Purchasers in accordance with the obligors'
instructions; provided, however, that if such instructions are not obtained,
such amounts will be applied first to the oldest outstanding invoice in respect
of which such obligor is indebted to any of Seller or either Purchaser. Any
amounts received by Seller from obligors under the Pre- Closing Receivables
(including any such obligors that are also indebted to Purchasers) will be
applied by Seller in accordance with the obligor's instructions; provided,
however, that if such instructions are not obtained, such amounts will be
applied first to the oldest outstanding invoice in respect of which such
obligor is indebted to any of Seller or either Purchaser. Any amounts received
by Seller in respect of trade accounts receivable of Purchasers from persons or
entities that are not obligors under the Pre-Closing Receivables will promptly
be remitted by Seller to Purchasers.

(c) During the Collection Period, prior to the 15th day of each
calendar month, Purchasers will provide to Seller copies of all invoices in
respect of Pre-Closing Payables received by Purchasers during the immediately
preceding calendar month. Except to the extent that Seller objects in good
faith to the payment of any amount reflected in any such invoice with 10
calendar days of the delivery of the same to Seller by Purchasers, Purchasers
are hereby authorized to, and will, pay for Seller's benefit out of the
Proceeds all amounts reflected in all such invoices which are Pre-Closing
Payables; provided, however, if there are not sufficient Proceeds to make such
payments, Purchasers may (and, during the period of the first 15

-74-
<PAGE> 84
calendar days following the Closing Date, will) make such payments out of their
own funds and reimburse themselves out of future Proceeds or otherwise seek
reimbursement from Seller.

(d) During the Collection Period, prior to the 15th day of each
calendar month (commencing with the calendar month following the month in which
the Closing occurs), Purchasers will deliver to Seller a statement setting
forth in reasonable detail the amount of Proceeds collected by Purchasers
during the preceding calendar month and the amount thereof applied by
Purchasers to the payment of Pre-Closing Payables, and will concurrently remit
to Seller an amount equal to the amount, if any, by which such collections
exceeded such payments.

(e) Seller and Purchasers will cooperate in all matters necessary
or appropriate to carry out fully the purposes and intent of this Section 9.7.
Without limiting the generality or effect of the preceding sentence, (i) Seller
hereby authorizes Purchasers to collect and receive all payments in respect of
Pre-Closing Receivables during the Collection Period and to receive and open
all mail and other communications relating to the Businesses received by
Purchasers, (ii) prior to the expiration of the Collection Period, Seller will
use reasonable efforts to cause all payments, correspondence and other
communications in respect of or relating to the Pre-Closing Receivables and
Pre-Closing Payables to be delivered or directed to Purchasers, and (iii)
Seller hereby authorizes Purchasers, at all times during the Collection Period,
to endorse, without recourse, the name of Seller on any check or other evidence
of payment received by Purchasers on account of any Pre-Closing Receivables.

(f) From and after the expiration of the Collection Period,
Purchasers will (i) use reasonable efforts to cause all payments,
correspondence and other communications in respect of or relating to the
Pre-Closing Receivables to be delivered or directed to Seller and (ii) promptly
forward or remit to Seller, in the form received, such payments and
correspondence thereafter received by Purchasers.

X. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

10.1. Notices. All notices and other communications required or

10.5. Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Schedules and
Exhibits) supersedes any other agreement, whether written or oral, that may

or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement will

substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon any such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated to the extent possible.

10.13. Remedies. Except as set forth in this Section 10.13, no
remedy conferred by any of the specific provisions of this Agreement is
intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each remedy will be cumulative
and will be in addition to every other remedy provided for hereunder or
existing from time to time at law or in equity or by statute or otherwise. The
election of any one or more remedies will not constitute a waiver of the right
to pursue other available remedies. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein contained, from and after the Closing Date, the remedies provided for
in Section 6.10 (together with the remedies provided for in Article VIII in
respect of a breach of a covenant contained in Section 6.10) will constitute
the exclusive remedies with respect to any Discovered

5. Waivers. No delay by Purchasers in exercising any right,

such Shareholder is a party, except where such conflict, violation, default,
termination, cancellation or acceleration would not materially impair the
ability of such Shareholder to perform its obligations under this Undertaking.
