FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Tues., July 19, 1994

WELLS FARGO REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS OF $206 MILLION;
PER SHARE EARNINGS $3.57 VS. $2.46 A YEAR AGO

Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) today reported net income of $206 million for
the second quarter of 1994, compared with $149 million for the second quarter of
1993, an increase of 38 percent. Per share earnings for the second quarter of
1994 were $3.57, compared with $2.46 in the second quarter of 1993. Second
quarter 1994 results were higher than a year ago primarily due to a lower loan
loss provision.

Return on average assets (ROA) was 1.59 percent and return on average
common equity (ROE) was 21.67 percent in the second quarter of 1994. In the
year-ago period, ROA was 1.18 percent and ROE was 16.73 percent.

Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $656 million in the
second quarter of 1994, roughly flat with $658 million a year ago.

The company's net interest margin for the second quarter of 1994 was 5.56
percent, down from 5.71 percent in the same quarter of 1993. The decrease was
substantially due to lower yields on earning assets.

Loan balances declined 1 percent since the end of the second quarter of
1993, dropping from $34.353 billion to $34.172 billion. However, as Chairman
Carl E. Reichardt noted, "A weak recovery appears to have taken hold in the
California economy. Loan balances rose for the second consecutive quarter and
are up over 3% from the end of the year."

Noninterest income in the second quarter of 1994 was $299 million, compared
with $275 million in the same quarter of 1993, an increase of 9 percent. A
significant portion of this increase was due to a $14 million growth in service
charges on deposit accounts.

Noninterest expense in the second quarter of 1994 was $526 million, down 1
percent from $531 million in the same quarter of 1993. A decline in foreclosed
assets expense contributed to the drop.

The provision for loan losses in the second quarter of 1994 was $60
million, compared with $140 million in the second quarter of 1993. Continued
improvement in the company's loan portfolio resulted in the reduction of the
provision.

Net charge-offs in the second quarter of 1994 totaled $61 million, or .73
percent of average total loans (annualized). The largest categories of net
charge-offs were credit card loans ($28 million) and real estate mortgage loans
other than 1-4 family ($20 million). For the second quarter of 1993, net
charge-offs totaled $138 million, or 1.60 percent of average total loans
(annualized). The largest categories of net charge-offs were real estate
mortgage loans other than 1-4 family ($45 million) and credit card loans ($42
million).

At June 30, 1994, the allowance for loan losses equaled 6.20 percent of
total loans, compared with 6.34 percent at March 31, 1994 and 6.18 percent at
June 30, 1993.

At June 30, 1994, total nonaccrual and restructured loans decreased to $717
million (2.1 percent of total loans), of which an estimated 34 percent were
current as to payment of principal and interest. This compares with $900
million (2.7 percent of total loans) at March 31, 1994, of which an estimated 41
percent were current, and $1.905 billion (5.5 percent of total loans) at June
30, 1993, of which an estimated 53 percent were current. Foreclosed assets were
$344 million at June 30, 1994, compared with $354 million at March 31, 1994 and
$391 million at June 30, 1993.

During the second quarter of 1994, an estimated $18 million of cash
interest payments were received from all loans that were on nonaccrual during
the quarter. Of that amount, $7 million was recognized as interest income and
$11 million was used to reduce book loan balances. The average nonaccrual book
loan balance (net of charge-offs and interest applied to principal) was $830
million for the quarter. The estimated average cash yield was 8.7 percent.

During the first quarter of 1994, an estimated $23 million of cash interest
payments were received from all loans that were on nonaccrual during the
quarter. Of that amount, $6 million was recognized as interest income and $17
million was used to reduce book loan balances. The average nonaccrual book loan
balance (net of charge-offs and interest applied to principal) was $1.094
billion for the quarter. The estimated average cash yield was 8.5 percent.

At June 30, 1994, the company's preliminary risk-based capital ratios were
14.60 percent for total risk-based capital and 10.10 percent for Tier 1 risk-
based capital, exceeding the minimum regulatory guidelines of 8 percent and 4
percent, respectively. At March 31, 1994, these risk-based capital ratios were
14.83 percent and 10.23 percent, respectively. The decrease in total and Tier 1
risk-based capital ratios between March 31, 1994 and June 30, 1994 resulted
primarily from the repurchase of 1,082,061 shares of common stock during the
quarter (net of 42,795 shares issued under employee benefit and dividend
reinvestment programs). At June 30, 1993, the company's total risk-based
capital ratio was 14.33 percent and the Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio was
9.31 percent. The ratio of common equity to total assets at June 30, 1994
was 6.96 percent, compared with 7.09 percent at March 31, 1994 and 6.57
percent at June 30, 1993.

or more past due.
(3) Borrower has made no payments since being placed on nonaccrual.

The Board of Directors of Wells Fargo & Co. (NYSE:WFC) today authorized the

representing 10% of Wells Fargo's outstanding common shares as of June 30, 1994.
This action reflects the Company's strong capital position and will allow Wells
Fargo to effectively manage its overall capital position in the best interests
of its shareholders. The Company announced no date for completing the program

REICHARDT TO RETIRE FROM WELLS FARGO,
HAZEN WILL BE NAMED CHAIRMAN/CEO, ZUENDT PRESIDENT

Carl E. Reichardt, 63, chairman and chief executive officer of Wells Fargo
& Company, today announced that he will retire from the Company as of Dec. 31,
1994. He will remain on the board of directors.

As of Jan. 1, 1995, Paul Hazen, 52, will become chairman and chief
executive officer. William Zuendt, 47, will become the new president and chief
operating officer, and will join the Board of Directors at that time.

Reichardt's retirement brings to an end a 24-year career at Wells Fargo,
and a 12-year term as chairman and CEO. During his tenure, which began Jan. 1,
1983, Wells Fargo emerged as one of the most profitable and efficient major
banks in the country, known for its expense control and marketing innovations in
consumer products and services. The Company also developed a reputation as a
training ground for top-performing managers sought after for senior management
positions at other major banks.

While chairman and CEO, Reichardt has delivered - to date - a 1,781 percent
total return to investors, compared with an increase in the Standard & Poor's
500 index of 385 percent, and a stock price that increased from $13.44 per share
when he took over to $158.75 per share as of July 18, 1994.

"I've done what I set out to do in 1983, and it's been a remarkable
experience," said Reichardt. "But, having turned 63 this month and with
management in place, I'm ready to pass the reins to the next generation. I look
forward to a long and active retirement.

"Paul has been my partner in banking for the last 27 years, and I'm
confident that his intelligence, determination and talent as a manager will
carry this company forward into the next century," said Reichardt.

"Together, Paul and Bill bring a broad range of abilities to their new
roles, and as a shareholder, I am certain they and the rest of the Wells Fargo
team will be among the best in banking," he said.

Other shareholders commented positively on the succession.

Warren Buffett, whose company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., owns 12.6 percent
of the Company's stock, said, "When I decided to invest in Wells Fargo, I did
so because of the Reichardt-Hazen partnership and the senior management team
behind them. I'm more than comfortable with the new leadership. Carl and Paul
have created a culture in which the company is managed for shareholders. I know
this management emphasis will continue under the new team."

Walter Annenberg, the philanthropist and former ambassador to the Court of
St. James, who holds 7.9 percent of Wells Fargo's stock, said, "My family and I
believe in Wells Fargo. Carl has been the publicly visible leader of the
company, but Paul and the rest of senior management have wielded tremendous
influence on the direction the bank has gone over the last decade. Their vision
and their energy should keep the stagecoach rolling."
