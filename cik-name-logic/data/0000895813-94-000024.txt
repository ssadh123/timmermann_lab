SCOTSMAN INDUSTRIES REPORTS STRONG EARNINGS GAIN IN 1993;
NET INCOME UP 16 PERCENT -- EARNINGS PER SHARE $1.06

Vernon Hills, IL, February 18, 1994 -- Scotsman Industries, Inc.

(NYSE: SCT) today reported 1993 net income of $7.4 million, a record

$1.06 per share, up 16 percent from 1992 earnings, on sales of $164.0

million. The results compare to 1992 net income of $6.4 million, or

$.90 per share, on sales of $168.7 million.

For the fourth quarter of 1993, Scotsman reported net income of

$209,000, or $.03 per share, on sales of $32.1 million. For the same

quarter in 1992, the company lost $97,000, or $.01 per share, on sales

of $32.2 million. The fourth quarter is traditionally a down quarter

for Scotsman, primarily due to the seasonality of the company's ice

machine businesses.

Richard C. Osborne, Scotsman chairman, president and chief

executive officer, said, "1993 results reflect the initial benefits

from several recent strategic actions, including our acquisitions of

Crystal Tips and Simag, our exclusive marketing agreement for 

- 5 - <PAGE>

the Howe flaker product line, and the restructuring of European

operations during the year. We are pleased to report record earnings

per share despite the deep recession in Western European markets and

the effects of a substantial devaluation of the Italian lira."

He noted that full year sales of $164 million were impacted

approximately $12 million when compared to 1992 due to translation of

the sales of the Company's Italian businesses at weaker lira rates.

Fiscal year 1993 sales of continuing businesses (excluding the 1992

sales of the Glenco-Star operation which was divested in September,

1992), using constant foreign exchange rates, were up 12 percent

compared to 1992.

Worldwide ice machine sales for the year increased 6 percent, and

excluding changes in foreign exchange rates, were up 14 percent over

the prior year. Domestic ice machine sales increased strongly as a

result of the improving domestic market, the January, 1993 addition of

the Howe flaker product line and the full year effect of sales of the

products of Crystal Tips, which was acquired in April, 1992. Although

Western European markets remain very weak, the Company's European

operations posted increased sales, largely due to sales of the

products of Simag, the Italian ice machine 

- 6 - <PAGE>

business acquired in January, 1993, and, to a lesser extent, from

continuing growth in exports to the Far East. Sales of soft drink

dispensing equipment were equal to the record 1992 level. 

Operating profit margins increased significantly from the prior

year, reflecting ongoing cost reduction efforts and partial year

benefits from the restructuring of European operations. Reduced

interest expense, the result of lower average debt levels and

favorable rates, also contributed to the increase in net income.

Osborne continued, "The recently announced acquisitions of The

Delfield Company and Whitlenge Drink Equipment, Limited are scheduled

to be completed early in the second quarter of 1994. These two

companies provide an excellent fit with Scotsman's core businesses.

The two combined had in excess of $100 million in sales in 1993, and

we believe both have solid growth potential."

"We also expect to realize additional benefits from the previous

acquisitions we have made, including overhead cost reductions from the

consolidation of the Crystal Tips and Booth, Inc. operations,

scheduled to be completed in the first half of 

- 7 - <PAGE>

1994. Additionally, we believe we are extremely well positioned for

and expect to gain from a Western European market rebound when that

begins to materialize. We are excited about our opportunities for the

future and the potential for increased value we can bring to our

customers, shareholders and employees," Osborne concluded.

Scotsman Industries, Inc. is a leading manufacturer of

refrigeration products primarily serving the food service,

hospitality, beverage, bakery and health care industries, with a

secondary focus on luxury appliances for the consumer market.

(i) The effective income tax rate increased from 37% to 45% for the
fiscal year ended January 2, 1994 compared to the prior year.
This was due primarily to the implementation of a change in
accounting for income taxes in the first quarter of 1993.
Certain tax credits realized in the fiscal year ended January 3,
1993 arising from a prior reorganization of an Italian subsidiary
are now recognized as part of the one-time cumulative adjustment
to deferred taxes (see note ii) and are recorded separately as
such in the income statement for the fiscal year ended January 2,
1994.

(ii) Changes in accounting principles related to post-retirement
health care, post-employment expenses and income taxes were
implemented in the first quarter of 1993. The cumulative effect
of these accounting changes was as follows:

Unfavorable cumulative effect of accounting change due
to post-retirement health care benefits (in thousands)
of $(1,660) pre-tax and $(1,029) after-tax.

Unfavorable cumulative effect of accounting change due
to other post-employment benefits (in thousands) of
$(508) pre-tax and $(243) after-tax.

Favorable cumulative effect of accounting change
relating to income taxes (in thousands) of $1,301.

(iii) The calculation of net income per share was based on
7,000,651 weighted average shares of the Company's common
stock for the fiscal year ended January 2, 1994 and on
7,096,976 shares for the fiscal year ended January 3, 1993.
The net income per share calculation does not reflect the
dilutive effect of stock options outstanding as the dilutive
effect is immaterial. <PAGE>
