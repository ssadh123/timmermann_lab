BARD SETTLES LAWSUIT - TO TAKE FOURTH QUARTER CHARGE

MURRAY HILL, NJ - December 28, 1994 - C. R. Bard, Inc. (NYSE-BCR)
announced today that it plans to take an after-tax charge to 1994
fourth quarter earnings of $16.9 million or 33 cents per share for
the settlement of a lawsuit and for legal and related expenses.

The special charge will cover the settlement of a 1992 lawsuit by
the inventor of an atherectomy device which Bard is developing. 
The charge will also include a provision for the anticipated future
legal costs associated with the ongoing criminal prosecution of the
six individuals indicted as a result of the Justice Department's
prior investigation into Bard's USCI division, and for other costs
related to the USCI's division. On October 14, 1993, the Company
entered into a plea agreement resolving its portion of this matter,
but the trial of the individuals has not yet been scheduled.

Bard reported earnings of $68.9 million or $1.33 per share for the
nine months ended September 30, 1994. The Company expects to
report its fourth quarter and full year 1994 results on January 26,
1995.

C. R. Bard, Inc., headquartered in Murray Hill, NJ, is a leading
multinational developer, manufacturer and marketer of health care
products.
