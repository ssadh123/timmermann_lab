PENTAIR TO ACQUIRE EUROPEAN ENCLOSURE MANUFACTURER
Purchase makes Pentair the work's leading enclosure
manufacturer; furthers acquisition and international
expansion strategies

ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Pentair, Inc. (NASDAQ/NMS:PNTA), the
St. Paul-based manufacturer of industrial products and
paper, today announced it has reached a definitive
agreement to acquire the Schroff Group, Straubenhardt,
Germany, from Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp, subject to
the approval of appropriate governmental authorities. 
the transaction will include the net assets and business
of the Schroff Group, including its international
subsidiaries. The purchase price will be approximately
$150 million.

Schroff designs, manufactures and markets cabinets,
cases, subracks and accessories for the electronics
industry. The company has approximately 1,400 employees
with operations in Germany, France, England, the United
States, Japan, Sweden, Finland, Italy and Taiwan. 
Schroff is the largest manufacturer in Europe's
electronic enclosure market and a world technical leader. 
The company's estimated sales are approximately $160
million.

Pentair's Hoffman Engineering subsidiary is the leading
North American manufacturer of electrical enclosures and
related products. Pentair acquired the Hoffman business
in December, 1988.

"This friendly transaction furthers our dual strategy of
building the industrial side of our business through a
major acquisition and providing Pentair a more
significant global presence." said Pentair Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Winslow H. Buxton. "Pentair's
ownership of Schroff and Hoffman will represent
leadership in the world-wide enclosure market. The
combination of electronic enclosures from Schroff and
electrical enclosures from Hoffman provides the most
comprehensive product offering in the world."

Schroff and Hoffman will continue to operate as separate
businesses within Pentair, providing uninterrupted
service to their customers. Buxton said there are
significant opportunities to add value to both businesses
through joint efforts in specific product lines, markets
and geographic locations.

"We have been searching for a major acquisition for some
time, but I believe our patience and resolve over the
last three years have been rewarded in this opportunity
to acquire Schroff," Buxton said. "With its strong brand
name, leading market position and extensive product line,
Schroff is an ideal fit with Pentair's strategic
objectives. We are very enthusiastic about the growth
potential this acquisition offers Schroff, Hoffman
Engineering and Pentair."

Pentair, Inc. is a St. Paul, Minnesota-based company with
1992 sales of $1.23 billion and approximately 8,300
employees. The company is currently comprised of 10
businesses which manufacture electrical enclosures;
woodworking equipment; power tools; sporting ammunition;
automotive service equipment; industrial lubrication
systems and material dispensing equipment; pumps; and
paper. Pentair common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ
National Market System under the symbol: PNTA.
