ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS
- --------------------

On March 18, 1994, the Company advised its employees that, in order to
position the Company to meet the challenges of an increasingly competitive
electric utility industry, management is considering a program to offer
financial incentives to eligible employees who voluntarily retire or otherwise
elect to terminate employment during a specific period of time. Although
management is reviewing a number of alternatives, no recommendation has been
presented to the Board of Directors for its consideration. A recommendation
is expected to be made to the Board of Directors in April. If the Board of
Directors were to approve a voluntary incentive plan, the Company would expect
to incur a one-time charge against earnings to reflect the cost of that plan.
The amount and timing of such a charge would depend upon the plan approved by
the Board of Directors and the timing of such approval.
