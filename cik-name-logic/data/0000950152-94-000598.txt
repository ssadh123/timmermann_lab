Date to reflect any differences between the Estimated Total Net Investment as

Net Investment"). The Closing Total Net Investment will be determined from the
Closing Date Statement (as defined below).

(b) Seller shall prepare a balance sheet as of the close
of business on the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Statement"). The Closing
Date Statement shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Divisional
Balance Sheet and the adjustments made to the Divisional Balance Sheet to

(i) no adjustments shall be made by Seller on the Closing Date Statement from

Seller reflected on the Divisional Balance Sheet and (ii) accruals with respect

PW to deliver its report in the form of Schedule 3.2(b); provided that PW shall

contemplated by Section 3.3, and that PW shall complete its audit within 30
days of Buyer's receipt of the Closing Date Statement.

preparation of the Closing Date Statement. Seller will give Buyer and PW
access

-9-
<PAGE> 14
to the books and records of the Seller necessary for PW to audit the items
included in the Closing Date Statement.

3.3 REVIEW OF CLOSING DATE STATEMENT; RESOLUTION OF ANY
DISPUTE. Following receipt of the Proposed Adjustments, Seller will be
afforded a period of 15 days to review the Proposed Adjustments and to complete
any review that it wishes to conduct. At or before the end of the 15 day
review period, Seller will either (a) accept the Proposed Adjustments to the
Closing Date Statement in their entirety or (b) deliver to Buyer written notice
identifying the items in the Proposed Adjustments that Seller disputes and the
basis for Seller's objection. If Seller does not deliver any such written
notice within the 15 day review period, Seller will be deemed to have accepted
the Proposed Adjustments. Within a period of 14 days from the end of the 15
day review period, the parties will attempt in good faith to resolve any
disputed items. If they are unable to do so, the remaining disputed items will
be referred to a nationally recognized firm of certified public accountants
agreed to by Buyer and Seller for resolution. The parties will share equally
the cost of the certified public accountants. The resolution of the disputed
items, as determined by such certified public accountants will be binding on
the parties.

3.4 PAYMENT OF POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENT. If the Estimated
Total Net Investment is more than $100,000 greater than Closing Total Net
Investment (determined under Sections 3.2 and 3.3), then Seller shall pay to
Buyer an amount equal to 110% of the entire difference. If the Closing Total
Net Investment (determined under Sections 3.2 and 3.3) is more than $100,000
greater than the Estimated Total Net Investment, Buyer shall pay to Seller an
amount equal to 110% of the entire difference. If in either such case the
difference is less than $100,000, neither party will pay any additional amount
to the other. Payment of any amount due under this Section 3.4 shall be made
either by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by the recipient or, at the option of the recipient, by certified or bank
check. The amount due shall be paid with interest from the Closing Date to the
date of payment at a per annum rate equal to the "prime rate," from time to
time, of Society National Bank, Cleveland, Ohio, plus 2.5%. Payment due under
this Section 3.4 shall be made not more than 10 business days following the
determination of the Closing Total Net Investment under Sections 3.2 and 3.3.

Sheet made to create the Pricing Balance Sheet are those necessary to remove
from the Divisional Balance Sheet the Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities.
Subject to such adjustments in the case of the Pricing Balance Sheet, the
Divisional Balance Sheet and the Pricing Balance Sheet have each been prepared
in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles
("GAAP") (except for the omission of any potential FAS 5 Contingency and except
for the omission of footnotes) applied on a consistent basis with prior periods
(except as otherwise disclosed to Buyer in writing) and present fairly the
financial position of Midland Steel as at such date and fairly set forth the
information purported to be shown therein, subject to normal year-end
adjustments, which in the aggregate are not material.

5.4 UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. To Seller's knowledge, the
Business does not have any liabilities, fixed or contingent, pending or
threatened against Seller, the Business or the Transferred Assets
(collectively, "Liabilities") other than:

(a) Liabilities fully shown or reserved against in the 
Divisional Balance Sheet;

(b) Current liabilities, incurred in the ordinary course
of business consistent with prior practice by Seller since March 26, 
1994;

(c) Obligations to be performed under the Leases and the 
Transferred Contracts;

(d) Open purchase or sales orders or agreements for
delivery of goods and services in the ordinary course of business
consistent with prior practice which Seller is not in material default
thereunder;

-15-
<PAGE> 20
(e) Those described in other provisions of this 
Agreement; and

(f) Those that are Assumed Liabilities or Excluded
Liabilities.

5.5 NO ADVERSE CHANGE. Since March 26, 1994, except as
set forth on Schedule 5.5 hereof, there has not occurred:

(a) Any material adverse change in the assets,
liabilities, or financial position and results, or operating
performance, of the Business;

(b) Any damage, destruction, or casualty, to property
owned or used by Seller, whether or not covered by insurance, having a
material adverse effect on the Business; or

(c) Any labor dispute or employee action, materially and
adversely affecting the financial position or operations of the
Business.

5.6 REAL PROPERTY.

(a) Seller has fee simple title to the Cleveland Plant.
To the best of Seller's knowledge, Seller holds such title free and
clear of all mortgages, security interests, title defects, pledges,
liens (including, without limitation, mechanics' and/or materialmen's
liens), charges, encumbrances, easements, and rights-of-way
(collectively, "Title Defects") other than (i) taxes and assessments,
both general and special, which are a lien but not yet due and
payable, (ii) zoning ordinances of the City of Cleveland, and (iii)
the specific exceptions identified in the List of Permitted Exceptions
attached hereto as Schedule 5.6A (collectively, the "Permitted
Exceptions"). The Permitted Exceptions do not, individually or in the
aggregate, materially detract from the value of the Cleveland Plant or
materially impair the use of the Cleveland Plant in the Business as
presently and ordinarily conducted. No third parties have any rights
to use or occupy any of the Cleveland Plant, whether as tenants,
subtenants, holders of easements or licenses, or otherwise other than
any such rights arising under the Permitted Exceptions. There are no
easements, conditions, reservations, covenants, restrictions or any
other matters presently of record that adversely affect the use of the
Cleveland Plant in the Business as presently conducted. To the
knowledge of Seller, there is no proposed curtailment of any utility
service to the Cleveland Plant. To the knowledge of Seller, there are
no material latent defects in any of the structures located on the
Cleveland Plant. Seller has not received any written notice, and
otherwise has no

-16-
<PAGE> 21
knowledge, that the use of the Cleveland Plant by Seller in the
Business as presently conducted does not conform with all applicable
zoning laws, regulations, and permits. Seller has not received any
written notice, and otherwise has no knowledge, of any (x) zoning
changes pending or threatened that would prohibit the use of any of
the Cleveland Plant in the Business, (y) condemnation, eminent domain,
or other legal or equitable proceedings pending or threatened with
respect to the Cleveland Plant, or (z) plans by any public authority
to install any improvements the cost of which might, in full or in
part, be assessed against Seller.

(b) LEASED REAL PROPERTY. Seller is not the tenant under
any lease of real property in connection with the Business other than
the Leased Real Property. Seller has a valid and subsisting leasehold
interest as to the Leased Real Property. Such leasehold interest is,
to Seller's knowledge, free and clear of all Title Defects created by
Seller other than (i) taxes and assessments, both general and special,
which are a lien but not yet due and payable, (ii) zoning ordinances
of the City of Janesville, and (iii) the specific exceptions
identified in the List of Leasehold Permitted Exceptions attached
hereto as Schedule 5.6B (collectively, the "Leasehold Permitted
Exceptions"). The Leasehold Permitted Exceptions do not, individually
or in the aggregate, materially detract from the value of the Leased
Real Property or materially impair the use and operation thereof in
carrying on the Business as presently and ordinarily conducted. No
third parties have any rights to use or occupy any of the Leased Real
Property, whether as tenants, subtenants, holders of easements or
licenses, or otherwise other than any such rights arising under the
Leasehold Permitted Exceptions. There are no easements, conditions,
reservations, covenants, restrictions, or any other matters presently
of record or otherwise that adversely affect the use of the Leased
Real Property in the Business as presently conducted. To the
knowledge of Seller, there are no material latent defects in any of
the structures located on the Leased Real Property. Seller has not
received any written notice, and otherwise has no knowledge, that the
use of the Leased Real Property by Seller in the Business as presently
conducted does not conform with all applicable zoning laws,
regulations, and permits. Seller has not received any written notice,
and otherwise has no knowledge, of any (x) zoning changes pending or
threatened that would prohibit the use of any of the Leased Real
Property in the Business, (y) condemnation, eminent domain, or other
legal or equitable proceedings are pending or threatened with respect
to the Leased Real Property, or (z) plans by any public authority to
install, any improvements the

-17-
<PAGE> 22
cost of which might, in full or in part, be assessed against Seller.

(c) TERMS OF JANESVILLE LEASE. The Janesville Lease is
in full force and effect. Seller has heretofore provided to Buyer a
complete, true, and correct copy of the Janesville Lease, including
any and all modifications or amendments thereof and any supplements
thereto. All material terms, conditions, and provisions of the
Janesville Lease on the part of Seller and, to Seller's knowledge, of
the Janesville Lessor, to be performed have been performed. There is,
to Seller's knowledge, no default on the part of the Janesville Lessor
and no event has occurred or failed to occur which with the giving of
notice, the passage of time, or both, would constitute a material
default by Seller or, to Seller's knowledge, by the Janesville Lessor
under the Janesville Lease. The Janesville Lessor has not waived, or
extended the time for the performance of, any obligation of Seller
under the Janesville Lease. All rent due under the Janesville Lease
has been paid in full through the date of this Agreement. There are
no security deposits or prepaid rent (including last month's rent in
advance) with respect to the Leased Real Property.

5.7 TAX MATTERS. Seller has filed all tax returns and
tax reports required to be filed by Seller prior to the date of this Agreement
with respect to the Business, including, without limitation, any returns and
reports pertaining to income taxes, excise taxes, sales and use taxes, payroll
taxes, property taxes and franchise taxes, and all taxes, interest, and
penalties shown to be due thereon have been paid or shall be paid when required
by law.

5.8 TRANSFERRED ASSETS. On the Closing Date Seller will
convey to Buyer good title to the tangible Transferred Assets free and clear of
all mortgages, security interests, title defects, pledges, liens, charges and
encumbrances of any kind or description, including any conditional sale or
other title retention agreements, and will have full power and authority to
convey, assign and transfer such title to all the Transferred Assets to Buyer,
in each case except as otherwise described on the List of Encumbrances attached
hereto as Schedule 5.8 or included within the Permitted Exceptions or the
Leasehold Permitted Exceptions. To the best of Seller's knowledge, the
tangible Transferred Assets have been properly maintained and are, and on the
Closing Date will be, in sufficiently good condition and repair to permit the
operation of the Business after the Closing Date in the same manner in all
material respects as the Business was operated prior to the Closing Date. No
affiliate of Seller or other person or entity owns, or has any other interest
in, any of the Transferred Assets.

-18-
<PAGE> 23
5.9 PATENTS, TRADE NAMES, ETC. Schedule 1.1(h) contains
a complete list or description of all registered trademarks, trade names and
patents owned, applied for or used or otherwise held by Seller for use directly
in the Business. Seller owns or possesses and, as of the Closing Date, will
transfer to Buyer, all registered trademarks, trade names, patents, patent
applications, trade secrets, formulae, production outlines, computer programs,
product development records and other proprietary information used by Seller
directly in the Business. To the best of Seller's knowledge, neither the
operation of the Business nor the products sold by Seller infringe upon the
proprietary rights of others. Seller has not received any written notice
alleging that it has infringed on any other party's intellectual property
rights in the conduct of the Business nor challenging the validity in any
respect of its ownership or use of any such item or items of intellectual
property. To the best of Seller's knowledge, none of the Intellectual Property
which, individually or in the aggregate, is material to the Business, the value
of which to Seller is contingent upon maintenance of the confidentiality
thereof, has been disclosed by Seller to any person other than employees,
representatives and agents of Seller, except pursuant to written non-disclosure
agreements.

5.10 CONTRACTS AND COMMITMENTS. The Contracts List
attached as Schedule 5.10 is a complete and accurate list of all material
contracts, agreements, and commitments directly relating to the Business to
which Seller is a party or by which it is bound, including, without limitation,
all supplier contracts, rebate arrangements, and consignment or inventory
arrangements. Except for contracts, agreements, and commitments identified on
the Transferred Contracts List, Seller is not a party to or bound by any of the
following that relate directly to the Business, whether oral or written:

(a) Contract, agreement or commitment for employment or
personal services or any severance agreement or arrangement that is
not terminable, without liability or expense, by Seller on 30 days' or
less notice;

(b) Dealer's, distributor, sales agency, or brokerage
agreement;

(e) Rebate arrangement or other similar agreement given

-19-
<PAGE> 24
(f) Consignment, inventory, or similar contract with
either a supplier or a customer.

Except as disclosed on the Contracts List, Seller has in all material respects
performed and is performing all obligations required to be performed by it, and
neither Seller nor to the best of Seller's knowledge any other party thereto,
is in default in any material respect, under any contract, agreement, or
commitment relating to the Business to which any of them are parties. Seller
has not received any notice of default under any such contract, agreement, or
commitment, nor has any event occurred which with notice or lapse of time or
both would constitute a default by Seller thereunder. None of such contracts,
agreements, or commitments is subject to any impending cancellation or breach.
All contracts are fully assignable by Seller to Buyer without notice to or
consent of the other party except as specified in Contracts List attached
hereto as Schedule 5.10.

5.11 INVENTORY. All of the Inventory was acquired by
Seller in the ordinary course of the Business. The Inventory Location List
attached hereto as Schedule 5.11 identifies all of the locations of the
Inventory.

5.12 PERMITS AND LICENSES; COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Except
as identified on the Permit List attached hereto as Schedule 1.1(f), Seller
does not hold any permits, licenses, or other governmental authorizations
material to or, to Seller's knowledge, required for the operation of the
Business as presently conducted or to the ownership of the Transferred Assets.
To the best of Seller's knowledge, the ownership of the Transferred Assets by
Seller and the operation of the Business as presently conducted are in
compliance in all material respects with applicable orders, laws, ordinances,
codes, or regulations, including but not limited to those relating to
protection of the environment, civil rights, equal employment opportunity,
occupational health and safety, interstate commerce, antitrust, trading with
the enemy, and zoning, building, and use requirements, including, without
limitation, the Americans With Disabilities Act (the "ADA") and the OSHA Hazard
Communication Standard and related Material Safety Data Sheet Compliance. To
the best of Seller's knowledge, no investigation is pending concerning any such
matter, and Seller has not received any notice of any such violation.

5.13 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.

(a) Seller has heretofore provided to Buyer an Employee
Benefits List attached hereto as Schedule 5.13, which identifies each
agreement, plan, or arrangement for employee benefits, including any
bonus, deferred compensation, severance, disability, sick pay, salary
continuation, death benefit, vacation, stock purchase or stock option,
hospitalization or other medical, life, or other insurance,
supplemental unemployment benefit, profit-sharing, pension, or
retirement plan or

-20-
<PAGE> 25
arrangement maintained or contributed to by Seller in connection with
the Business (the "Benefit Plans"). Except as identified in the
Employee Benefit List, none of the Benefit Plans is an "employee
pension benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA.

(b) To the best of Seller's knowledge, all of the Benefit
Plans and related trusts are in form and have been administered in
compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws,
including ERISA and the Code; none of the Benefit Plans or related
trusts, or any administrator or trustee thereof, or party-in-interest
or disqualified person thereto has engaged in a transaction that could
subject Buyer to any liability for or with respect to a civil penalty
under Section 409 or 502(i) or other section of ERISA or a tax under
Section 4975 or 4976 or other section of Chapter 43 of Subtitle D of
the Code; all amounts required to be paid by Seller to or pursuant to
each of the Benefit Plans or related trusts on or before the date of
this Agreement have been paid; no employee pension benefit plan has
incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency," as defined in Section
412 of the Code; no "reportable event" within the meaning of Title IV
of ERISA which is required to be reported to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") has occurred with respect to any Benefit
Plan subject thereto. No employees of Seller employed directly in
connection with the Business participate in any "multi-employer
pension plan" within the meaning of the Multi-employer Pension Plan
Amendments Act of 1980, as amended. Neither Seller nor an ERISA
Affiliate, nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees,
or fiduciaries, has committed any breach of fiduciary responsibility
imposed by ERISA or any other applicable law that would subject Buyer
to liability under ERISA or any other applicable law, contract,
agreement, or commitment. The PBGC has not instituted proceedings to
terminate any Benefit Plan that covers employees of the Business, and
no condition exists that presents a material risk that such
proceedings will be instituted. Except as disclosed in the Employee
Benefit List, no Benefit Plan provides benefits, including without
limitation death or medical benefits (whether or not insured), with
respect to current or former employees of the Business beyond their
retirement or other termination of service (other than (i) coverage
mandated by applicable law, (ii) death benefits or retirement benefits
under any "employee pension benefit plan," as that term is defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA, (iii) deferred compensation accrued on the
books of Seller or (iv) benefits the full cost of which is borne by
the current or former employee (or his or her beneficiary)). If a
Benefit Plan is designed to satisfy the requirements of Section 125,
Section 401,

-21-
<PAGE> 26
Section 401(k), Section 409, Section 501(c)(9), Section 4975(e)(7),
and/or Section 4980B of the Code, the Benefit Plan satisfies such
section.

(c) Seller has heretofore made available to Buyer true
and correct copies of all of the Benefit Plans, the most recent
determination letters from the Internal Revenue Service with respect
thereto, the most recent annual reports (Form 5500 and the schedules
thereto), the most recent summary plan descriptions, and the most
recent actuarial valuations.

(d) The Employee Benefits List identifies (i) each
inactive or former employee of Midland Steel who is on layoff or
disability or any other leave, (ii) each former employee of Midland
Steel who has any right under the Local 486 Agreement (as defined in
Section 8.2) to return to work at Midland Steel, (iii) each former
employee of Midland Steel who has retired from Midland Steel since
January 1, 1993, and who was covered under the Local 486 Agreement at
the time of retirement, and (iv) each present salaried employee of
Midland Steel who is now eligible to retire.

5.14 LABOR MATTERS.

(a) The Labor Matters List attached hereto as Schedule
5.14 identifies each collective bargaining agreement to which Seller
is a party, each of which is on the date of the Agreement in full
force and effect and binding upon Seller and, to the best of Seller's
knowledge, the respective other parties thereto.

(b) Except as set forth on the Labor Matters List, in
connection with the operations of the Business, to the best of
Seller's knowledge, Seller is in full compliance with all Federal and
state laws respecting employment and employment practices (including
the ADA and the Family and Medical Leave Act), terms and conditions of
employment, wages and hours, and nondiscrimination in employment, and
is not engaged in any unfair labor practice. There are no pending
labor grievances, arbitration cases, or pending civil rights and equal
employment opportunity charges against Seller, or any settlements,
consent orders, or prior decrees of any court or governmental body
requiring any continued observance by Seller in connection with the
operations of the Business except as set forth and as described on the
Labor Matters List. There have not been any work stoppages, strikes,
or other significant labor troubles at the location or operations of
the Business other than as specified on the Labor Matters List.
Seller has no pending written labor grievances or arbitration cases
relating to the Business except as set forth and

-22-
<PAGE> 27
described on the Labor Matters List. To the best of Seller's
knowledge, and except as set forth on the Labor Matters List, no
complaint or charge has been filed with the National Labor Relations
Board with respect to Seller alleging any unfair labor practices,
there are no grievances, charges, complaints or arbitration cases
threatened against Seller or concerning the operations of the
Business, and Seller has not received any notice of any such
grievances, charges, complaints or arbitration cases.

(c) Seller is not a party to, or subject to any
obligation, liability, or commitment with respect to any written or
oral employment, compensation, bonus, consulting, severance pay, or
similar agreement relating directly to the Business other than the
agreements referred to and described on the Contracts List or the
Employee Benefits List.

5.15 NO LEGAL VIOLATIONS; GOVERNMENTAL CONSENTS.

Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby to be entered
into by Seller and the consummation by Seller of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (i) are not prohibited by, do not

party or is bound in a manner which would have a material adverse
effect on the Business, and (ii) have not resulted and will not result
in the creation or imposition by, through, or under Seller of any
lien, encroachment, easement, encumbrance, mortgage, hypothecation,
equity, charge, restriction, possibility of reversion, or other
similar conflicting ownership or security interest upon any of the
Transferred Assets.

(b) Except for the filing and expiration or earlier
termination of the applicable waiting periods prescribed by the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the
regulations promulgated thereunder (the "HSR Act"), no consent,
approval, authorization, notice or order of any governmental agency or

-23-
<PAGE> 28
required for the execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement
and the agreements contemplated hereby to be signed by Seller and the
consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, the absence of which would have a material adverse effect on
the Business.

5.16 NO PENDING OR THREATENED LITIGATION AND CLAIMS.
Except as disclosed on the Litigation and Claims List attached hereto as
Schedule 5.16, there is no litigation, suit, proceeding, action, claim,
counterclaim, charge, grievance or investigation pending or, to the best of

<PAGE> 34
which is not included within the Permitted Exceptions or Leasehold
Permitted Exceptions or which has not theretofore been waived or
approved by Buyer in accordance with the provisions of this Section
7.10 (individually, a "Defect" and collectively, the "Defects"), Buyer

within ten (10) days after Buyer receives the applicable Leasehold
Title Commitment or Survey disclosing the existence of such Defect, to
approve or disapprove the Defect. If Buyer shall fail to disapprove
the Defect within the ten (10)-day period, Buyer shall be deemed to

thirty (30) days from the date of Buyer's notice of disapproval in
which to seek to cause the disapproved Defect to be cured or removed

referred to in Section 7.10(e) below, or (B) to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 18. If Buyer shall fail to give
notice of its election to Seller within the ten (10)-day period, Buyer
shall be deemed to have elected (A) above. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.10, neither
of the parties hereto shall be liable to the other hereunder and this
Agreement shall be null and void.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 7.10 to
the contrary, Seller shall have the unconditional obligation, on or
prior to the Closing Date, to secure releases, discharges,
satisfactions or otherwise cure, at no cost to Buyer, any Defect which
is a lien for the payment of money only or any exception to title
which arose after the date of this Agreement solely as the result of
the act or volition of Seller.

-30-
<PAGE> 35
(e) It shall be a condition precedent to Buyer's
obligation to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby that the
Title Company can and will: (i) upon filing of the Cleveland Lease
and the Janesville Lease Assignment, or in either case, a memorandum
of lease or assignment of lease of record, issue its ALTA leasehold
policies (Form B - revised 10/17/70 as to the Cleveland Lease and ALTA
Form 1992 as to the Janesville Lease) of title insurance (the "Title
Policies") in the full amount set forth above, insuring Buyer as the
lessee of the Cleveland Plant and the Janesville Plant, respectively.
The Title Policies shall be subject only to the Permitted Exceptions
and Leasehold Permitted Exceptions, respectively, and any Defects
which Buyer approves or is deemed to have approved, waives, or accepts
or is deemed to have accepted pursuant to this Section 7.10, and shall
be without exception for the so-called standard printed exceptions
(rights or claims of parties in possession not shown by the public
records, encroachments, overlaps, boundary line disputes, or any other
matters which would be disclosed by an accurate survey or inspection
of the real property subject to the Cleveland Lease and the Janesville
Lease, easements or claims of easements not shown by the public
records, or any lien or right to a lien for services, labor, or
materials furnished to the Cleveland Plant or the Janesville Plant,
imposed by law, and not shown by the public records), unless and
except to the extent that any such matter included in the so-called
standard printed exceptions has been approved or waived by Buyer.
Seller agrees to execute and deliver to the Title Company such
affidavits and instruments as reasonably may be required to permit the
Title Company to issue Buyer's title evidence in the form required by
this subsection. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, Seller's representations and warranties with respect to
its title to the Cleveland Plant and to its leasehold interest as to
the Leased Real Property set forth in Section 5.6 shall terminate and
be of no further force and Buyer can make no claim for breach thereof
after the delivery to Buyer of the Title Policies.

7.11 SURVEY. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller, at
Buyer's cost and expense, shall cause McSteen & Associates, Inc. (with respect
to the Cleveland Plant) and R. H. Batterman & Co., Inc. (with respect to the
Janesville Plant) to prepare and deliver to Buyer, Seller and the Title Company
surveys of the real property subject to the Cleveland Lease and the Janesville
Lease (the "Surveys") in form sufficient to enable the Title Company to delete
from the Title Policies the so-called standard printed exception for matters
disclosed by an accurate survey. If Buyer so requests, a perimeter legal
description prepared by McSteen & Associates, Inc. shall be used to describe
the real property subject to the Cleveland Lease. In the event either of the
Surveys discloses any

-31-
<PAGE> 36
encroachments, overlaps, boundary line disputes or any other matters materially
and adversely affecting title to the real property subject to the Cleveland
Lease or the Janesville Lease or which violates any law, rule, or regulation,
such matters(s), to the extent not included within the Permitted Exceptions or
Leasehold Permitted Exceptions, shall be considered to be a Defect(s) and the
relative rights and obligations of the parties with respect thereto shall be
governed by the provisions of Section 7.10.

8. COVENANTS OF BUYER. From the date of this Agreement 
until the Closing Date, Buyer will:

8.1 COMPLIANCE WITH CONDITIONS; COOPERATION. Use its
best efforts to cause the conditions set forth in Section 9 to be satisfied on

reasonably requested by Seller to help secure the consents and approvals
referred to in Section 7.5.

8.2 TREATMENT OF EMPLOYEES AFTER CLOSING.

(a) COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS. Buyer shall assume
the Agreement dated November 28, 1992 between Seller and the UAW,
Local 486 (the "Local 486 Agreement"), and the current Agreement
between Seller and the UAW, Local 95 Unit #10 (the "Janesville
Agreement") (collectively, the "Collective Bargaining Agreements") on
the Closing Date by a written assumption of such Collective Bargaining
Agreements, and shall take all action with respect thereto as may be
required thereunder or by applicable law, provided that authorized
representatives of the UAW shall have executed and delivered to Buyer
on the Closing Date the agreement of the UAW to the Local 486
Agreement with Buyer as the successor to Seller thereunder.

(i) Buyer will establish a qualified pension plan (the "Buyer
Hourly Pension Plan") that, in conjunction with the
benefits accrued under the Midland Steel Products Co.
Pension Plan for Cleveland Hourly Rated Maintenance and
Production Employees (the "Seller Hourly Pension Plan") as
of the Closing Date, will provide the pension benefits
required under the Local 486 Agreement. Seller shall amend
the Seller Hourly Pension Plan effective as of the Closing
Date to provide that (A) no participant therein who is an
active employee as of the Closing Date and who becomes an
employee of Buyer may retire and begin to receive his
pension thereunder until his employment with Buyer has
terminated and (B) except to the

-32-
<PAGE> 37
extent described in the preceding clause (A), service of 
employees with Buyer following the Closing Date shall not 
be counted for any purpose under the Seller Hourly Pension 
Plan (including, without limitation, for purposes of 
determining any employee's eligibility for early retirement 
under the Seller Hourly Pension Plan).

(ii) In addition to the retiree medical and dental benefits
under The Midland Steel Products Co. Retiree Medical
Benefits Plan for Cleveland Plant Employees Represented by
Local No. 486 (the "Retiree Medical Benefits Plan"),
required by the Local 486 Agreement for employees who
retire after the Closing Date, Buyer will provide the
benefits required under the Retiree Medical Benefits Plan
for employees who shall have retired after December 31,
1992, and on or before the Closing Date ("Post-December 31,
1992 Retirees"), but only to the extent of premium
increases above the premium cost in effect on January 1,
1993, and only to the extent that funds are available from
the Midland Steel Products Co. Retiree Medical Benefit
Trust Agreement for Former Cleveland Plant Employees
Represented by Local No. 486 (the "Trust") to pay such
benefits. At the Closing, Buyer shall assume the Trust and
the obligation to make matching employer contributions to
the Trust. Buyer shall administer all benefits for the
Post-December 31, 1992 Retirees (including, without
limitation, by including the Post-December 31, 1992
Retirees in any applicable insurance coverages arranged by
the Buyer), but shall be entitled to receive the amounts
required from the Seller pursuant to Section 8.4(d) with
respect to Post-December 31, 1992 Retirees and shall have
no obligation to the Post-December 31, 1992 Retirees other
than the obligations described in this paragraph (ii) in
the event the Seller fails to perform its obligations with
respect to the Post-December 31, 1992 Retirees described in
Section 8.4(d).

(iii) Buyer shall assume as of the Closing Date Seller's 
obligation to provide health care

-33-
<PAGE> 38
continuation coverage under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title 
I of ERISA ("COBRA Coverage") for former employees of the 
Business who as of the Closing Date have the right under 
the Local 486 Agreement to return to work.

(b) OFFERS TO SALARIED EMPLOYEES. For a period of 90
days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall use its best efforts to
make continued employment available to substantially all salaried
employees of the Seller as of the Closing Date whose services are
provided or offices are located at the Plants, including, for such
employees of Seller then on disability or any other leave, a
continuation of such leave (all such employees who are employed by
Buyer or who are on any such leave being the "Continuing Employees"),
at salaries and initially with benefits which are reasonably
comparable, within market conditions, individually and in the
aggregate to the salaries and benefits provided for and on behalf of
the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date by
Seller in accordance with Seller's practices and programs as they then
exist, but not including any retiree medical benefits or severance
benefits, provided, however, that Buyer shall have no obligation to
provide any such comparable benefit at a cost to Buyer that is
materially different from the cost to Seller of providing its present
benefits to such employees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer
shall in all events establish a group health plan that provides
medical and dental coverage to Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents that does not exclude or limit coverage of any pre-existing
condition of any Continuing Employee or his or her dependents.

(c) As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall establish a qualified Section 401(k) savings plan (the "Buyer
Plan"), and as soon as practicable thereafter, the assets attributable
to the account of each employee of the Seller who becomes an employee
of Buyer, or the beneficiaries or alternate payees of such employees,
under The Lamson & Sessions Co. Deferred Savings Plan (the "Lamson
Plan") shall be transferred by the Trustee of the Lamson Plan to the
Buyer Plan. The value of each such account to be transferred shall be
equal to the value of such account determined by the Trustee on a
valuation date which shall be the effective date such accounts are
transferred. The Trustee shall effect such transfer as soon as
possible after such valuation date. Such transfer shall be made in
cash, unless liquidation of all or a portion of any guaranteed
investment or annuity contract or similar insurance contract would
result in a market value adjustment or other similar penalty, in which
case the portion of any

-34-
<PAGE> 39
such contract covering employees whose accounts are transferred shall
be segregated and transferred in kind. The transfer of funds shall in
no event be made on a valuation date before 30 days after the filing
with the Internal Revenue Service of Forms 5310 for the Lamson Plan
and the Buyer Plan, if necessary. Buyer and Seller agree to provide
each other with such information as is in their possession and
necessary for the other party to complete its Form 5310, if necessary.
Seller shall cause appropriate amendments to be made to the Lamson
Plan and Buyer shall cause appropriate provisions to be included in
the Buyer Plan to carry out the provisions of this Section 8.2(c).
Buyer's and Seller's obligations to effectuate the asset transfer
described in this Section 8.2(c) shall be conditioned on each
receiving evidence reasonably satisfactory to it that such transfer
will not adversely affect the qualified status of its 401(k) savings
plan under Section 401(a) or 401(k) of the Code.

(d) BENEFIT; ENFORCEABILITY. Nothing in this Agreement,
including, without limitation, this Section 8.2, shall be deemed to be
for the benefit of, or enforceable by or on behalf of, any labor union
or by any Continuing Employee or any other present or former employee
of Seller or any dependent or beneficiary of any such employee.

(e) SEVERANCE PAY. In the event Buyer (i) does not offer
employment immediately after the Closing Date to any salaried employee
of Seller (not including for this purpose any employees of Seller on
disability or any other leave on the Closing Date), or (ii) terminates
the employment of any Continuing Employee within 90 days after the
Closing Date, Seller shall pay severance benefits under Seller's
severance plan as in effect on the Closing Date for not more than a
total of four individuals including both such salaried employees not
offered employment by Buyer and Continuing Employees terminated by
Buyer during such period. In the event that more than four
individuals could be subject to the provisions of the preceding
sentence, such provisions shall apply to the four individuals to whom
the sentence applies in chronological order of the applicability of
such provision to such individuals.

(f) JANESVILLE WELFARE BENEFITS. If Blue Cross/Blue
Shield of Wisconsin consents thereto, Buyer shall assume as of the
Closing Date the contractual rights and obligations of Seller under
the "BeneMax Trust" with Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Wisconsin
(including, without limitation, the obligations of Seller thereunder
with respect to COBRA Coverage), under which the Seller provides
welfare benefits to hourly employees

-35-
<PAGE> 40
and former hourly employees of the Janesville Plant. If Blue
Cross/Blue Shield of Wisconsin does not consent to such assumption by
Buyer, Buyer shall otherwise discharge its obligations hereunder with
respect to welfare benefits for employees of the Janesville Plant.
Nothing in this provision shall override the obligation, set forth in
Section 8.4(d), of Seller to provide the retiree medical benefits
specified therein for salaried employees.

8.3 ACCESS FOR SELLER. Buyer will make available to
Seller and its representatives for inspection and copying such records
pertaining to the Business as may reasonably be requested by Seller in
connection with its rights or obligations as the former owner of the
Transferred Assets, including but not limited to cooperation: (a) in the
preparation of financial information about the Business for all periods for
which information in the possession of Buyer is relevant; (b) in the
preparation, and in the audit by taxing authorities, of Seller's tax returns
for all periods for which information in the possession of Buyer is relevant;
and (c) with respect to any pending or threatened litigation to which Seller is
party. Buyer's obligations under this Section 8.3 are subject to its right to
conduct its operations with minimal disturbance and to reimbursement by Seller
for the reasonable costs incurred in carrying out its obligations under this
Section 8.3.

8.4 COVENANTS AND OTHER PROVISIONS REGARDING GROUP HEALTH
PLANS.

(a) Subject to Sections 8.2(a)(iii) and 8.2(f), Seller
will maintain a group health plan that provides coverage or
continuation coverage rights, as applicable, to Seller's employees and
former employees, their spouses, former spouses, dependents, and
former dependents covered on the Closing Date ("Covered Persons")
under the group health plans maintained by Seller for the time period
and to the extent necessary under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of
ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code, as amended (herein collectively
referred to as "COBRA") and under applicable state law to provide
after the Closing Date any continuation coverage with respect to such
Covered Persons.

(b) Subject to Sections 8.2(a)(iii) and 8.2(f), Seller
has timely provided or will timely provide all notices and any
continuation of health benefit coverage (including but not limited to
medical and dental coverage) required to be provided to any of
Seller's employees and former employees, their spouses, former
spouses, dependents, and former dependents, under COBRA and under
applicable state law to the extent such notices are required to be
provided by any party under COBRA or

-36-
<PAGE> 41
under state law by reason of the events occurring prior to, on, or
after the Closing Date or by reason of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Seller also agrees to hold Buyer harmless from,
and to fully indemnify Buyer against any costs, expenses, losses,
damages, and liabilities incurred or suffered by Purchaser, directly
or indirectly, including, but not limited to, reasonable legal fees
and expenses, with respect to any failure of the Seller to comply with
the requirements of this Section or COBRA, provided that any such
costs, expenses, losses, damages or liabilities are not a result of
Buyer's breach of its obligations under Sections 8.2(a)(iii) or
8.2(f).

(c) For a period of 30 days following the Closing Date,
Seller will, on behalf of Buyer, continue to provide, on a claims
incurred basis, each employee of the Seller who becomes an employee of
the Buyer the medical and dental coverage in effect with respect to
such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall
reimburse Seller for the amount of the premium, claims, payments,
administrative and other costs incurred by Seller in providing such
coverage under Seller's group health plans described in this Section
8.4(c).

(d) Seller will continue to provide retiree medical and
dental benefits as required under the Retiree Medical Benefits Plan
for covered employees who retired before January 1, 1993. Seller will
remain obligated to pay for retiree medical and dental benefits as
required under the Retiree Medical Benefits Plan for Post-December 31,
1992 Retirees to the extent of the premium cost in effect for the
Post-December 31, 1992 Retirees on January 1, 1993, it being
understood by Buyer and Seller that such premium cost for
Post-December 31, 1992 Retirees is at one level for individuals not
eligible for Medicare and at a lower level for individuals eligible
for Medicare, and that Seller's obligation described in this Section
8.4(d) at any particular time is based on each individual's respective
Medicare eligibility (or non-eligibility) at such time. As provided
in Section 8.2(a)(ii), Buyer shall administer all benefits for
Post-December 31, 1992 Retirees. Seller shall pay to Buyer (or to
such other person as Buyer may designate from time to time) the amount
of the premium cost in effect from time to time for the Post-December
31, 1992 Retirees at such time or times and in such manner as shall be
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and Seller.

(e) Salaried employees of the Business who are eligible
to retire from Seller as of the Closing Date and to receive upon such
retirement retiree medical coverage under plans of Seller then in
effect shall, together with their eligible dependents, be entitled
after the Closing

-37-
<PAGE> 42
to such retiree medical coverage as Seller may provide from time to
time under the plans of Seller in effect from time to time, which
coverage shall be secondary to the medical coverage provided to such
salaried employees of Buyer while they are actively employed by Buyer,
and which coverage may be limited to the extent that Seller is unable
to maintain stop loss insurance coverage with respect to individuals
described in this Section 8.4(e) to protect Seller from claims in
excess of stop loss levels maintained by Seller for its other retirees
from time to time. Upon retirement of such salaried employees from
employment with Buyer, Seller's coverage (if any) shall become
primary.

Agreement will, prior to the Closing, make or cause to be made any public
announcement or release concerning this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby without consultation with the other party to this

necessary or appropriate in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

17. INDEMNIFICATION.

17.1 INDEMNIFICATIONS BY SELLER FOR GENERAL CLAIMS. From
and after the Closing, but subject to the conditions and limitations set forth
in this Article 17, Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless for any and
all loss, cost, damage, claim, fine, penalty, expense, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, amounts paid in
settlement, court costs, out-of-pocket costs of investigation, fees and
expenses of accountants, investment bankers and other experts, and other
expenses of litigation (collectively, "Damages"), actually incurred or suffered

or warranty of Seller contained in Article 5 of this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered at the Closing (other than reaffirmations of such
representations and

-41-
<PAGE> 46
warranties contained in any such certificate delivered at the Closing), (b) any
breach of any covenant or agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement, or
(c) any claim made or asserted against Buyer under any bulk sales law but (z)
excluding any claim relating to Excluded Liabilities or Continuing Employees
(clauses (a) through (c), but excluding (z), collectively, the "General
Claims").

17.2 LIMITATIONS ON GENERAL INDEMNIFICATION. (a) Buyer
shall not be entitled to indemnification for Damages incurred or suffered with
respect to General Claims, until, and then only to the extent that, the
aggregate Damages with respect to General Claims to which Buyer is otherwise
entitled to indemnification exceed $100,000 (the "General Deductible").

(b) Once Damages incurred or suffered with respect to
General Claims exceed the General Deductible, Buyer shall be entitled to
indemnification for two-thirds (66 2/3%) of Damages incurred or suffered with
respect to General Claims until the aggregate payments by Seller under this
paragraph equal $700,000.

(c) Any claim for indemnification with respect to General
Claims that is not asserted in accordance with Section 17.5 prior to 5:00 p.m.
(Cleveland, Ohio Time) on the date which is one year after the Closing Date may
not be pursued and shall be irrevocably waived.

17.3 INDEMNIFICATION BY SELLER FOR EXCLUDED LIABILITIES.
From and after the Closing, without any limitation as to amount or as to time
for the assertion of any claim, but subject to the conditions set forth
elsewhere in this Article 17, Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless
for Damages actually incurred or suffered by Buyer to the extent resulting from
any Excluded Liability.

17.4 INDEMNIFICATION BY SELLER FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEE
CLAIMS. From and after the Closing, but subject to the conditions and
limitations set forth in this Article 17, Seller shall indemnify and hold Buyer
harmless for Damages actually incurred or suffered by Buyer from:

(a) any claim made by any Continuing Employee by reason
of any provision of Section 8.2(b) or (c) of this Agreement (unless
and to the extent that any such damages arise out of violation of law
by Buyer or any covenant or representation of Buyer made to a
Continuing Employee which is different from the provisions of such
Section 8.2 ("Continuing Employee Claims").

(b) Buyer shall not be entitled to indemnification for
Damages incurred or suffered with respect to Continuing Employee
Claims to the extent that aggregate amounts paid by Seller would
exceed $750,000.

<PAGE> 47
(c) Any claim for indemnification with respect to
Continuing Employee Claims that is not asserted in accordance with
Section 17.6 prior to 5:00 p.m. (Cleveland, Ohio time) on the date
that is one year after the end of the 90 day period following the
Closing Date as provided in Section 8.2 may not be pursued and shall
be irrevocably waived.

17.5 NOTICE; OTHER PROCEDURES. (a) In the event that any
action, suit, proceeding, investigation, claim or demand is asserted against or
sought to be collected from Buyer (a "Third Party Claim") for which Buyer
intends to assert a right of indemnity under Sections 17.1, 17.3 or 17.4 and/or
a Third Party Claim is made that Buyer intends to count against the General
Deductible, Buyer shall notify Seller with reasonable promptness of such Third
Party Claim, specifying, to the extent known, the nature, circumstances and
amount of the Third Party Claim (a "Third Party Claim Notice"). The Seller
shall have 14 days from its receipt of a Third Party Claim Notice to notify
Buyer (i) whether Seller disputes Buyer's right of indemnity with respect to
such Third Party Claim and (ii) if Seller does not dispute such right, whether
or not Seller desires to defend Buyer against such Third Party Claim.

(b) If the Seller notifies Buyer within the 14-day period
that (i) except for the limitations of this Article 17, the Seller does not
dispute the Buyer's right of indemnity and (ii) the Seller desires to defend
against such Third Party Claim, then the Seller shall have the right to assume
and control, at its sole cost and expense, the defense of such Third Party
Claim by appropriate proceedings with counsel reasonably acceptable to Buyer.
Buyer may participate in, but not control, any such defense or settlement, at
its sole cost and expense.

(c) If the Seller (i) disputes the Buyer's right of
indemnity with respect to a Third Party Claim, or (ii) does not dispute such
right of indemnity but fails to promptly assume and prosecute the defense of
such Third Party Claim, then Buyer shall be entitled to assume and control the
defense of such Third Party Claim, and the Buyer shall be entitled to
indemnification for the cost of such defense, with counsel reasonably
acceptable to the Seller.

(d) The party responsible for the defense of any Third
Party Claim (the "Responsible Party") shall, to the extent reasonably requested
by the other party, keep such other party informed as to the status of any
Third Party Claim for which such party is not the Responsible Party, including,
without limitation, all settlement negotiations and offers. With respect to a
Third Party Claim for which the Seller is the Responsible Party, Buyer shall
make available to the Seller and its representatives all books and records of
Buyer relating to such Third Party Claim and shall render to the Seller such
assistance and access to records

-43-
<PAGE> 48
and the representatives of Buyers as the Seller as its representatives may
reasonably request.

(e) Neither the Seller, on the one hand, nor the Buyer,
on the other hand, shall enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the other party. The Responsible Party
shall promptly notify the other party of each settlement offer (including
whether or not the Responsible Party is willing to accept the proposed
settlement with respect to a Third Party Claim). Such other party agrees to
notify the Responsible Party with reasonable promptness whether or not such
party is willing to accept the proposed settlement offer. If the Buyer fails
to consent to any settlement offer of a Third Party Claim (whether or not Buyer
is the Responsible Party with respect to such Third Party Claim), Buyer may
continue to contest or defend such Third Party Claim and, in such event, the
maximum total indemnity with respect to such Third Party Claim (including the
reasonable costs and expenses of contesting or defending such Third Party Claim
incurred after Buyer fails to consent to such settlement offer) shall not
exceed the amount of such settlement offer.

(f) In the event that the Buyer has a claim for indemnity
or against the General Deductible that does not involve a Third Party Claim (a
"Direct Claim"), Buyer shall notify the Seller of such Direct Claim with
reasonable promptness, specifying, to the extent known, the nature,
circumstances and amount of such Direct Claim (a "Direct Claim Notice"). If
the Seller notifies Buyer that it disputes Buyer's claim for indemnity or claim
against the General Deductible or the Environmental Deductible with respect to
a Direct Claim set forth in a Direct Claim Notice, Buyer and Seller shall use
reasonable efforts to resolve such dispute.

17.6 LIMITATIONS ON SELLER'S INDEMNIFICATION. For
purposes of this Agreement, the amount of Damages with respect to General
Claims, Excluded Liability Claims and Continuing Employee Claims, shall be
reduced to the extent of any applicable net tax benefit, insurance proceeds or
other third party recovery received by the Buyer. Buyer shall timely file
claims for insurance proceeds and/or defense and pursue all other third party
reimbursement rights with respect to any Damages sustained by Buyer. Buyer
shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Damages (i) incurred by Buyer
in connection with resolving any dispute arising with respect to Buyer's right
to indemnification under this Agreement or (ii) resulting from any untrue or
incorrect representation or warranty, or breach of a covenant or agreement by
Seller contained in this Agreement and disclosed to Buyer in the certificate
delivered by Seller at the Closing. Except as provided in Sections 3.2 and
3.4, the indemnification rights provided in this Article 17 shall be Buyer's
sole and exclusive remedy for Damages resulting from any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Seller contained in this
Agreement or otherwise relating to this Agreement or in respect of this
Agreement, and the Buyer shall not assert any claim relating to

-44-
<PAGE> 49
this Agreement or based hereon except by exercising its rights under this
Article 17.

17.7 INDEMNIFICATION BY BUYER. From and after the
Closing, Buyer shall indemnify and hold Seller and its officers, directors and
affiliates harmless for any Damages actually incurred or suffered by any of
them to the extent resulting from (a) any inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty of Buyer contained in Section 6 of this Agreement (or in any
certificate delivered at the Closing), (b) any breach of any covenant or
agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement, (c) any claim against Seller
arising out of any violation of law by Buyer, or (d) the Assumed Liabilities.

18. TERMINATION. Anything herein or elsewhere to the
contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby abandoned at any time on or prior to the Closing Date --

(a) By the written consent of Buyer and Seller;

(b) By Buyer if any of the conditions set forth in
Section 9 of this Agreement have become incapable of fulfillment on or
before July 31, 1994, except in the case of an event described in
Section 1.5, in which case the Closing or termination of this
Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of Section 1.5;

(c) By Seller if any of the conditions set forth in
Section 10 of this Agreement have become incapable of fulfillment on
or before July 31, 1994, except in the case of an event described in
Section 1.5, in which case the Closing or termination of this
Agreement shall be subject to the provisions of Section 1.5; or

(d) By Seller or by Buyer if any action, suit, or
proceeding before any court or other governmental body or agency has
been instituted to restrain, modify, or prohibit the transactions
contemplated hereby, and either Seller or Buyer deems it inadvisable
for that reason to proceed with such transaction.

If this Agreement is terminated in a manner permitted by subsections (a)-(d) of
this Section 18 and the transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated as
described above, this Agreement will become void and of no further force and
effect, and neither of the parties hereto will have any liability to the other
party in respect of a termination of this Agreement.
