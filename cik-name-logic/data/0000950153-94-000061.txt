GFC FINANCIAL CORPORATION

REPORTS 33% INCREASE IN INCOME

FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS

FOR THE FIRST QUARTER

PHOENIX, Arizona, April 14, 1994 -- GFC Financial Corporation (NYSE:GFC)
today reported a 33% increase in income from continuing operations for the
quarter ended March 31, 1994 compared to the first quarter of 1993.

Income from continuing operations was $11.4 million ($0.56 per common
share) compared to $8.6 million ($0.39 per common share) for the first quarter
of 1993. Earnings per common share for the first quarter of 1993 is net of
preferred dividends equivalent to $0.03 per common share. The 1994 results
include income from Ambassador Factors, the factoring and asset based lending
company acquired from Fleet Financial Group, Inc. on February 14, 1994.

Net income for the first quarter of 1994 was $11.4 million ($0.56 per
common share) compared with $9.9 million ($0.45 per common share) for the
comparable period in 1993. The 1993 results included $1.3 million of income
($0.06 per common share) from Verex Assurance, Inc., the company's discontinued
mortgage insurance subsidiary, which was sold in July 1993.

Sam Eichenfield, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of GFC, said,
"The acquisition of the Asset Based Finance group in the first quarter of 1993
and the acquisition of Ambassador Factors in the first quarter of 1994
complement the company's core operations and have

3

<PAGE> 2
contributed to the growth in funds employed and the resulting improved
performance. The pending acquisition of TriCon Capital Corporation ("TriCon"),
which was announced on March 4, 1994, will further diversify GFC's asset base
and expand our focus on value-added products and services." TriCon is a $1.8
billion niche-oriented provider of commercial and equipment financing products.

Eichenfield added that portfolio quality remains consistent with
nonearning assets at 3.8% of funds employed after adding Ambassador, which
typically has a higher nonearning asset level (4.2% of its funds employed at
March 31, 1994), up slightly from 3.6% reported at year end.

Interest earned from financing transactions increased to $72.0 million
for the first quarter of 1994 from $58.3 million in the first quarter of 1993,
an increase of 24%. This rise in revenue was driven by a 29% increase in funds
employed during the twelve months ended March 31, 1994 resulting from $1.1
billion of new business being added by the core finance operations during that
period, and the acquisition of Ambassador Factors.

The improvement in earnings for the 1994 quarter primarily was due to
the increase in interest margins earned which advanced to $38.9 million for the
first quarter of 1994 from $27.7 million in the first quarter of 1993, a 40%
improvement. The higher interest margins, which equate to a 5.7% annualized
return on average earning assets compared to 5.1% for the first quarter of
1993, were attributable to the growth of the portfolio, a lower effective cost
of debt in 1994 and higher fee income principally generated by Ambassador
Factors.

The strong improvement in interest margins was more than enough to
offset the $2 million reduction in gains on sale of assets, higher provisions
for possible credit losses and the higher selling, administrative and other
operating ("operating") expenses.

The higher operating expenses primarily consisted of higher personnel
costs attributable in part to the acquisitions of the Asset Based Finance group
in February 1993 and Ambassador Factors in February 1994, and to expenses that
are no longer allocated to discontinued operations.

Income taxes were higher due to higher tax rates in effect during the
first quarter of 1994 and to higher income before taxes.

GFC Financial Corporation is a major domestic commercial finance
company that extends secured financing in selected markets: corporate finance,
transportation, communications, commercial real estate and resort finance. GFC
Financial also provides asset based lending, consumer rediscounting and
factoring.
