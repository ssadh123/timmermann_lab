Item 2. Disposition of Assets

On March 14, 1994 the travel management business operated by USTravel Systems
Inc. ("USTravel"), an 85% owned subsidiary of PS Group, Inc. ("PSG") was sold
to MTH Acquisition Corp. (the "Travel Business Sale"). MTH Acquisition Corp.
is controlled by Murrary T. Holland. The Travel Business Sale was
accomplished through the sale of the assets of USTravel and various of
USTravel's wholly-owned subsidiaries (the "Travel Business Assets").

The Travel Business Assets were sold for a total cash consideration of $43
million subject to certain post-closing adjustments. Minority stockholders of
USTravel received $3 million of the purchase price, and under certain
conditions, may receive an additional $400,000. Proceeds to be received by
USTravel for the portion of the Travel Business Assets attributable to PSG on
a consolidated basis is expected to be approximately $40 million. The
principle followed in determining the amount of consideration for the Travel
Business Assets was the negotiation of the purchase price with the purchaser
in an arms length transaction.
