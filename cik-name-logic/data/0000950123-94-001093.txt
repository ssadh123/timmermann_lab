CPC INT'L ANNOUNCES RESTRUCTURING MEASURES TO CONTINUE STRENGTHENING BUSINESS;
WILL RESULT IN SECOND QUARTER CHARGE

ENGLEWOOD CLIFFS, NJ, June 23, 1994 -- CPC International Inc. today
announced that the company will take a pre-tax restructuring charge of $227
million during the second quarter of 1994. On an after-tax basis, the charge
will amount to $.92 per share.
C.R. Shoemate, chairman and chief executive officer of CPC, said: "CPC
has been proactively restructuring for the past several years to ensure that we
remain as competitive in the future as we have been in the past. Over the last
several years we have absorbed the related restructuring costs on an ongoing
basis.
"The charge of $227 million recognizes the cost of additional
restructuring activities around the world, which are being compressed into the
next 18 to 24 months in order to anticipate now the competitive needs of the
ever more unified markets of the late 1990s. The majority of the charge
recognizes actions to be taken in our European and North American consumer
foods businesses. Most of the rest of the charge relates to our Latin American
corn refining business.
"Our objective in Europe and North America is to reduce costs and to
further strengthen our brand franchises through marketing investments and by
enhancing the value of our products and services. In Latin America, we are
taking important strategic steps to strengthen our competitive position in our
corn refining business."
About two-thirds of the charge is for non-cash for write-off of
assets, including some plant closures. The charge also includes the cost of a
phased reduction in personnel of about 2,600 worldwide, according to Mr.
Shoemate. CPC's total worldwide headcount is currently about 39,000.

"Our businesses are already sound, profitable, and growing, and they
are more competitive today as a result of our ongoing restructuring moves of
the last several years. These past moves have included the closing of six
plants in North America and substantial relocation of production within Europe
to achieve efficiencies in the unifying European market.
"But positioning our businesses for competitive advantage over the
next several years, as we have been doing, is not enough. The charge announced
today represents a longer-term, more aggressive view. We are taking actions
now for competitive advantage in the major world markets at the end of the
decade," Mr. Shoemate said.
Regarding CPC's earnings outlook for 1994, Mr. Shoemate said,
"Excluding the charge, our earnings expectation for 1994 remains unchanged."
