Item 5. Other Events.

On April 5, 1994, the Board of Directors of Standard Commercial
Corporation, a North Carolina corporation (the "Company"), declared a
dividend payable April 25, 1994 of one right (a "Right") for each
outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.20 per share ("Common
Stock"), of the Company held of record at the close of business on April
18, 1994 (the "Record Time"), or issued thereafter and prior to the
Separation Time (as hereinafter defined) and thereafter pursuant to options
and convertible securities outstanding at the Separation Time. The Rights
will be issued pursuant to a Shareholder Protection Rights Agreement, dated
as of April 5, 1994 (the "Rights Agreement"), between the Company and First
Union National Bank of North Carolina, as Rights Agent (the "Rights
Agent"). Each Right entitles its registered holder to purchase from the
Company, after the Separation Time, one share of Common Stock, for $60 (the
"Exercise Price"), subject to adjustment.

The Rights will be evidenced by the Common Stock certificates
until the close of business on the earlier of (either, the "Separation
Time") (i) the tenth business day (or such later date as the Board of
Directors of the Company may from time to time fix by resolution adopted
prior to the Separation Time that would otherwise have occurred) after the
date on which any Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement) commences a
tender or exchange offer which, if consummated, would result in such Person
becoming an Acquiring Person, as defined below, and (ii) the tenth day
after the first date (the "Flip-in Date") of public announcement by the
Company that such Person has become an Acquiring Person, other than as a
result of a Flip-over Transaction or Event (as defined below); provided
that if the foregoing results in the Separation Time being prior to the
Record Time, the Separation Time shall be the Record Time; and provided
further that if a tender or exchange offer referred to in clause (i) is
cancelled, terminated or otherwise withdrawn prior to the Separation Time
without the purchase of any shares of stock pursuant thereto, such offer
shall be deemed never to have been made. An Acquiring Person is any Person
having Beneficial Ownership (as defined in the Rights Agreement) of 10% or
more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (excluding as outstanding
any Common Stock held by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company), which
term shall not include (i) Ery Kehaya or his spouse or

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 3

descendants or their spouses or any trust established by or for the benefit
of, or any estate of, any of the foregoing, (ii) the Company, any wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Company or any employee stock ownership or other
employee benefit plan of the Company, (iii) any person who is the
Beneficial Owner of 10% or more of the outstanding Common Stock as of the
close of business on April 5, 1994 or who shall become the Beneficial Owner
of 10% or more of the outstanding Common Stock solely as a result of an
acquisition of Common Stock by the Company, until such time as such Person
acquires additional Common Stock, other than through a dividend or stock
split, (iv) any Person who becomes an Acquiring Person without any plan or
intent to seek or affect control of the Company if such Person, upon notice
by the Company, promptly divests sufficient securities such that such 10%
or greater Beneficial Ownership ceases or (iv) any Person who Beneficially
Owns shares of Common Stock consisting solely of (A) shares acquired
pursuant to the grant or exercise of an option granted by the Company in
connection with an agreement to merge with, or acquire, the Company at a
time at which there is no Acquiring Person, (B) shares owned by such Person
and its Affiliates and Associates at the time of such grant and (C) shares,
amounting to less than 1% of the outstanding Common Stock, acquired by
Affiliates and Associates of such Person after the time of such grant. The
Rights Agreement provides that, until the Separation Time, the Rights will
be transferred with and only with the Common Stock. Common Stock
certificates issued after the Record Time but prior to the Separation Time
shall evidence one Right for each share of Common Stock represented thereby
and shall contain a legend incorporating by reference the terms of the
Rights Agreement (as such may be amended from time to time). Notwith-
standing the absence of the aforementioned legend, certificates evidencing
shares of Common Stock outstanding at the Record Time shall also evidence
one Right for each share of Common Stock evidenced thereby. Promptly
following the Separation Time, separate certificates evidencing the Rights
("Rights Certificates") will be mailed to holders of record of Common Stock
at the Separation Time.

The Rights will not be exercisable until the Business Day (as
defined in the Rights Agreement) following the Separation Time. The Rights
will expire on the earliest of (i) the Exchange Time (as defined below),
(ii) the close of business on April 18, 2004, (iii) the date on which the
Rights are redeemed as described below and (iv) upon the merger of the
Company into another corporation pursuant to 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 4

an agreement entered into when there is no Acquiring Person (in any such
case, the "Expiration Time").

The Exercise Price and the number of Rights outstanding, or in
certain circumstances the securities purchasable upon exercise of the
Rights, are subject to adjustment from time to time to prevent dilution in
the event of a Common Stock dividend on, or a subdivision or a combination
into a smaller number of shares of, Common Stock, or the issuance or
distribution of any securities or assets in respect of, in lieu of or in
exchange for Common Stock. 

In the event that prior to the Expiration Time a Flip-in Date
occurs, the Company shall take such action as shall be necessary to ensure
and provide that each Right (other than Rights Beneficially Owned by the
Acquiring Person or any affiliate or associate thereof, which Rights shall
become void) shall constitute the right to purchase from the Company, upon
the exercise thereof in accordance with the terms of the Rights Agreement,
that number of shares of Common Stock of the Company having an aggregate
Market Price (as defined in the Rights Agreement), on the date of the
public announcement of an Acquiring Person becoming such (the "Stock
Acquisition Date") that gave rise to the Flip-in Date, equal to twice the
Exercise Price for an amount in cash equal to the then current Exercise
Price. In addition, the Board of Directors of the Company may, at its
option, at any time after a Flip-in Date and prior to the time that an
Acquiring Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of more than 50% of the out-
standing shares of Common Stock, elect to exchange all (but not less than
all) the then outstanding Rights (other than Rights Beneficially Owned by
the Acquiring Person or any affiliate or associate thereof, which Rights
become void) for shares of Common Stock at an exchange ratio of one share
of Common Stock per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock
split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring after the date of
the Separation Time (the "Exchange Ratio"). Immediately upon such action
by the Board of Directors (the "Exchange Time"), the right to exercise the
Rights will terminate and each Right will thereafter represent only the
right to receive a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Exchange
Ratio. 

In the event that prior to the Expiration Time the Company
enters into, consummates or permits to occur a transaction or series of
transactions after the time an Acquiring Person has become such in which,
directly or 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 5

indirectly, (i) the Company shall consolidate or merge or participate in a
binding share exchange with any other Person if, at the time of the
consolidation, merger or share exchange or at the time the Company enters
into an agreement with respect to such consolidation, merger or share
exchange, the Acquiring Person controls the Board of Directors of the
Company and any term of or arrangement concerning the treatment of shares
of capital stock in such merger, consolidation or share exchange relating
to the Acquiring Person is not identical to the terms and arrangements
relating to other holders of Common Stock or (ii) the Company shall sell or
otherwise transfer (or one or more of its subsidiaries shall sell or
otherwise transfer) assets (A) aggregating more than 50% of the assets
(measured by either book value or fair market value) or (B) generating more
than 50% of the operating income or cash flow, of the Company and its
subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any other Person (other than the Company
or one or more of its wholly owned subsidiaries) or to two or more such
Persons which are affiliated or otherwise acting in concert, if, at the
time of such sale or transfer of assets or at the time the Company (or any
such subsidiary) enters into an agreement with respect to such sale or
transfer, the Acquiring Person controls the Board of Directors of the
Company (a "Flip-over Transaction or Event"), the Company shall take such
action as shall be necessary to ensure, and shall not enter into,
consummate or permit to occur such Flip-over Transaction or Event until it
shall have entered into a supplemental agreement with the Person engaging
in such Flip-over Transaction or Event or the parent corporation thereof
(the "Flip-over Entity"), for the benefit of the holders of the Rights,
providing, that upon consummation or occurrence of the Flip-over
Transaction or Event (i) each Right shall thereafter constitute the right
to purchase from the Flip-over Entity, upon exercise thereof in accordance
with the terms of the Rights Agreement, that number of shares of common
stock of the Flip-over Entity having an aggregate Market Price on the date
of consummation or occurrence of such Flip-over Transaction or Event equal
to twice the Exercise Price for an amount in cash equal to the then current
Exercise Price and (ii) the Flip-over Entity shall thereafter be liable
for, and shall assume, by virtue of such Flip-over Transaction or Event and
such supplemental agreement, all the obligations and duties of the Company
pursuant to the Rights Agreement. For purposes of the foregoing
description, the term "Acquiring Person" shall include any Acquiring Person
and its Affiliates and Associates counted together as a single Person.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 6

The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at
any time prior to the close of business on the Flip-in Date, redeem all
(but not less than all) the then outstanding Rights at a price of $.01 per
Right) (the "Redemption Price"), as provided in the Rights Agreement. 
Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company
electing to redeem the Rights, without any further action and without any
notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and each Right will
thereafter represent only the right to receive the Redemption Price in cash
for each Right so held. 

The holders of Rights will, solely by reason of their ownership
of Rights, have no rights as shareholders of the Company, including,
without limitation, the right to vote or to receive dividends.

The Rights will not prevent a takeover of the Company. 
However, the Rights may cause substantial dilution to a person or group
that acquires 10% or more of the Common Stock unless the Rights are first
redeemed by the Board of Directors of the Company. Nevertheless, the
Rights should not interfere with a transaction that is in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders because the Rights can be
redeemed on or prior to the close of business on the Flip-in Date, before
the consummation of such transaction.

As of April 13, 1994 there were 10,913,459 shares of Common
Stock issued (of which 8,567,141 shares were outstanding and 2,346,318
shares were held by a wholly-owned subsidiary) and 2,950,350 shares
reserved for issuance pursuant to employee benefit plans and convertible
securities. As long as the Rights are attached to the Common Stock, the
Company will issue one Right with each new share of Common Stock so that
all such shares will have Rights attached. 

The Rights Agreement (which includes as Exhibit A the forms of
Rights Certificate and Election to Exercise) is attached hereto as an
exhibit and is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description
of the Rights is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Rights
Agreement and such exhibit thereto.

SHAREHOLDER PROTECTION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

SHAREHOLDER PROTECTION RIGHTS AGREEMENT (as amended from time

to time, this "Agreement"), dated as of April 5, 1994, between Standard

Commercial Corporation, a North Carolina corporation (the "Company"), and

First Union National Bank of North Carolina, a national banking

association, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agent", which term shall include

any successor Rights Agent hereunder).

WITNESSETH:

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has

(a) authorized and declared a dividend of one right ("Right") in respect of

each share of Common Stock (as hereinafter defined) held of record as of

the close of business on April 18, 1994 (the "Record Time") and

(b) authorized the issuance of one Right in respect of each share of Common

Stock issued after the Record Time and prior to the Separation Time (as

hereinafter defined) and, to the extent provided in Section 5.3, each share

of Common Stock issued after the Separation Time;

WHEREAS, subject to the terms hereof, each Right entitles the

holder thereof, after the Separation Time, to purchase securities of the

Company (or, in certain cases, of certain other entities) pursuant to the

terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 2

WHEREAS, the Company desires to appoint the Rights Agent to act

on behalf of the Company, and the Rights Agent is willing so to act, in

connection with the issuance, transfer, exchange and replacement of Rights

Certificates (as hereinafter defined), the exercise of Rights and other

matters referred to herein;

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the

respective agreements set forth herein, the parties hereby agree as

follows:

ARTICLE I

CERTAIN DEFINITIONS

1.1 Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, the

following terms have the meanings indicated:

"Acquiring Person" shall mean any Person who is a Beneficial

Owner of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock; provided,

however, that the term "Acquiring Person" shall not include (i) Ery Kehaya

or his spouse or any lineal descendants (including adopted descendants) of

Ery Kehaya or their spouses or any trust established by or for the benefit

of, or any estate of, any of the foregoing individuals, (ii) any Person who

is the Beneficial Owner of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Common

Stock as of the close of business (as defined herein) on the date of this

Agreement or who shall become the Beneficial Owner of 10% or more of the

outstanding shares of Common Stock solely as a result of an acquisition by

the Company of shares of 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 3

Common Stock, until such time hereafter or thereafter as any of such

Persons shall become the Beneficial Owner (other than by means of a stock

dividend or stock split or by exercise of the Rights) of any additional

shares of Common Stock, (iii) any Person who is the Beneficial Owner of 10%

or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock but who acquired

Beneficial Ownership of shares of Common Stock without any plan or

intention to seek or affect control of the Company, if such Person promptly

enters into an irrevocable commitment promptly to divest, and thereafter

promptly divests (without exercising or retaining any power, including

voting, with respect to such shares), sufficient shares of Common Stock (or

securities convertible into, exchangeable into or exercisable for Common

Stock) so that such Person ceases to be the Beneficial Owner of 10% or more

of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or (iv) any Person who

Beneficially Owns shares of Common Stock consisting solely of one or more

of (A) shares of Common Stock Beneficially Owned pursuant to the grant or

exercise of an option granted to such Person by the Company in connection

with an agreement to merge with, or acquire, the Company at a time at which

there is no Acquiring Person, (B) shares of Common Stock (or securities

convertible into, exchangeable into or exercisable for Common Stock),

Beneficially Owned by such Person or its Affiliates or Associates at the

time of grant of such option or (C) shares of Common Stock (or 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 4

securities convertible into, exchangeable into or exercisable for Common

Stock) acquired by Affiliates or Associates of such Person after the time

of such grant which, in the aggregate, amount to less than 1% of the

outstanding shares of Common Stock. In addition, the Company, any wholly-

owned Subsidiary of the Company and any employee stock ownership or other

employee benefit plan of the Company or a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the

Company shall not be an Acquiring Person and shares of Common Stock held by

any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company shall not be considered

outstanding for purposes of determining an Acquiring Person.

"Affiliate" and "Associate" shall have the respective meanings

ascribed to such terms in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of

1934, as such Rule is in effect on the date of this Agreement.

A Person shall be deemed the "Beneficial Owner", and to have

"Beneficial Ownership" of, and to "Beneficially Own", any securities as to

which such Person or any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates is or

may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of pursuant to Rule 13d-3 and 13d-

5 under the Securities Exchange Act, as such Rules are in effect on the

date of this Agreement as well as any securities as to which such Person or

any of such Person's Affiliates or Associates has the right to become

Beneficial Owner (whether such right is exercisable immediately or only

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 5

after the passage of time or the occurrence of conditions) pursuant to any

agreement, arrangement or understanding, or upon the exercise of conversion

rights, exchange rights, rights (other than the Rights), warrants or

options, or otherwise; provided, however, that a Person shall not be deemed

the "Beneficial Owner", or to have "Beneficial Ownership" of, or to

"Beneficially Own", any security (i) solely because such security has been

tendered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by such Person or any

of such Person's Affiliates or Associates until such tendered security is

accepted for payment or exchange or (ii) solely because such Person or any

of such Person's Affiliates or Associates has or shares the power to vote

or direct the voting of such security pursuant to a revocable proxy given

in response to a public proxy or consent solicitation made to more than ten

holders of shares of a class of stock of the Company registered under

Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and pursuant to, and in

accordance with, the applicable rules and regulations under the Securities

Exchange Act of 1934, except if such power (or the arrangements relating

thereto) is then reportable under Item 6 of Schedule 13D under the

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (or any similar provision of a comparable

or successor report). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no officer or

director of the Company shall be deemed to Beneficially Own any securities

of any other Person by virtue of any actions 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 6

such officer or director takes in such capacity. For purposes of this

Agreement, in determining the percentage of the outstanding shares of

Common Stock with respect to which a Person is the Beneficial Owner, all

shares as to which such Person is deemed the Beneficial Owner shall be

deemed outstanding.

"Business Day" shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday

or a day on which banking institutions in Charlotte, North Carolina are

generally authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.

"Close of business" on any given date shall mean 5:00 p.m.

Charlotte, North Carolina time on such date (or, if such date is not a

Business Day, 5:00 p.m. Charlotte, North Carolina time on the next

succeeding Business Day) at which the Charlotte, North Carolina office of

the transfer agent for the Common Stock (or, after the Separation Time, the

Charlotte, North Carolina office of the Rights Agent) are closed to the

public.

"Common Stock" shall mean the shares of Common Stock, par value

$0.20 per share, of the Company.

"Exchange Time" shall mean the time at which the right to

exercise the Rights shall terminate pursuant to Section 3.1(c) hereof.

"Exercise Price" shall mean, as of any date, the price at which

a holder may purchase the securities issuable upon exercise of one whole

Right. Until adjustment thereof 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 7

in accordance with the terms hereof, the Exercise Price shall equal $60.00.

"Expiration Time" shall mean the earliest of (i) the Exchange

Time, (ii) the Redemption Time, (iii) the close of business on the tenth-

year anniversary of the Record Time and (iv) upon the merger of the Company

into another corporation pursuant to an agreement entered into when there

is no Acquiring Person.

"Flip-in Date" shall mean the tenth business day after any

Stock Acquisition Date which is not the result of a Flip-over Transaction

or Event or such earlier or later date after such Stock Acquisition Date as

the Board of Directors of the Company may from time to time fix by

resolution adopted prior to the Flip-in Date that would otherwise have

occurred.

"Flip-over Entity," for purposes of Section 3.2, shall mean

(i) in the case of a Flip-over Transaction or Event described in clause

(i) of the definition thereof, the Person issuing any securities into which

shares of Common Stock are being converted or exchanged and, if no such

securities are being issued, the other party to such Flip-over Transaction

or Event and (ii) in the case of a Flip-over Transaction or Event referred

to in clause (ii) of the definition thereof, the Person receiving the

greatest portion of the assets or earning power being transferred in such

Flip-over Transaction or Event, provided in all cases 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 8

if such Person is a subsidiary of a corporation, the parent corporation

shall be the Flip-Over Entity.

"Flip-over Stock" shall mean the capital stock (or similar

equity interest) with the greatest voting power in respect of the election

of directors (or other persons similarly responsible for direction of the

business and affairs) of the Flip-Over Entity.

"Flip-over Transaction or Event" shall mean a transaction or

series of transactions after the time when an Acquiring Person has become

such in which, directly or indirectly, (i) the Company shall consolidate or

merge or participate in a share exchange with any other Person if, at the

time of the consolidation, merger or share exchange or at the time the

Company enters into any agreement with respect to any such consolidation,

merger or share exchange, the Acquiring Person controls the Board of

Directors of the Company and any term of or arrangement concerning the

treatment of shares of capital stock in such consolidation, merger or share

exchange relating to the Acquiring Person is not identical to the terms and

arrangements relating to other holders of the Common Stock or (ii) the

Company shall sell or otherwise transfer (or one or more of its

Subsidiaries shall sell or otherwise transfer) assets (A) aggregating more

than 50% of the assets (measured by either book value or fair market value)

or (B) generating more than 50% of the operating income or cash flow, of

the 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 9

Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any Person (other than

the Company or one or more of its wholly owned Subsidiaries) or to two or

more such Persons which are Affiliates or Associates or otherwise acting in

concert, if, at the time of the entry by the Company (or any such

Subsidiary) into an agreement with respect to such sale or transfer of

assets, the Acquiring Person controls the Board of Directors of the Com-

pany.

"Market Price" per share of any securities on any date shall

mean the average of the daily closing prices per share of such securities

(determined as described below) on each of the 20 consecutive Trading Days

through and including the Trading Day immediately preceding such date;

provided, however, that if an event of a type analogous to any of the

events described in Section 2.4 hereof shall have caused the closing prices

used to determine the Market Price on any Trading Days during such period

of 20 Trading Days not to be fully comparable with the closing price on

such date, each such closing price so used shall be appropriately adjusted

in order to make it fully comparable with the closing price on such date. 

The closing price per share of any securities on any date shall be the last

reported sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place or

is quoted on such date, the average of the closing bid and asked prices,

regular way, for each share of such securities, in either case as reported

in the principal 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 10

consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed

or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. or, if the

securities are not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock

THE RIGHTS

2.1 Summary of Rights. As soon as practicable after the

Record Time, the Company will mail a letter summarizing the terms of the

Rights to each holder of record of Common Stock as of the Record Time, at

such holder's address as shown by the records of the Company.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 13

2.2 Legend on Common Stock Certificates. Certificates for the

Common Stock issued after the Record Time but prior to the Separation Time

shall evidence one Right for each share of Common Stock represented thereby

and shall have impressed on, printed on, written on or otherwise affixed to

them the following legend:

Until the Separation Time (as defined in the Rights Agreement
referred to below), this certificate also evidences and entitles the
holder hereof to certain Rights as set forth in a Rights Agreement,
dated as of April 5, 1994 (as such may be amended from time to time,
the "Rights Agreement"), between Standard Commercial Corporation (the
"Company") and First Union National Bank of North Carolina, as Rights
Agent, the terms of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference
and a copy of which is on file at the principal executive offices of
the Company. Under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Rights
Agreement, such Rights may be redeemed, may be exchanged for shares
of Common Stock or other securities or assets of the Company or a
Subsidiary of the Company, may expire, may become void (if they are
"Beneficially Owned" by an "Acquiring Person" or an Affiliate or
Associate thereof, as such terms are defined in the Rights Agreement,
or by any transferee of any of the foregoing) or may be evidenced by
separate certificates and may no longer be evidenced by this
certificate. The Company will mail or arrange for the mailing of a
copy of the Rights Agreement to the holder of this certificate
without charge within five days after the receipt of a written
request therefor.

Certificates representing shares of Common Stock that are issued and

outstanding at the Record Time shall evidence one Right for each share of

Common Stock evidenced thereby notwithstanding the absence of the foregoing

legend.

2.3 Exercise of Rights; Separation of Rights. (a) Subject

to Sections 3.1, 5.1 and 5.10 and subject to adjustment as herein set

forth, each Right will entitle the 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 14

holder thereof, after the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time,

to purchase, for the Exercise Price, one share of Common Stock. 

(b) Until the Separation Time, (i) no Right may be exercised

and (ii) each Right will be evidenced by the certificate for the associated

share of Common Stock (together, in the case of certificates issued prior

to the Record Time, with the letter mailed to the record holder thereof

pursuant to Section 2.1) and will be transferable only together with, and

will be transferred by a transfer (whether with or without such letter) of,

such associated share. 

(c) Subject to the terms hereof, after the Separation Time

and prior to the Expiration Time, the Rights (i) may be exercised and (ii)

may be transferred independent of shares of Common Stock. Promptly

following the Separation Time, the Rights Agent will mail to each holder of

record of Common Stock as of the Separation Time (other than any Person

whose Rights have become void pursuant to Section 3.1(b)), at such holder's

address as shown by the records of the Company (the Company hereby agreeing

to furnish copies of such records to the Rights Agent for this purpose),

(x) a certificate (a "Rights Certificate") in substantially the form of

Exhibit A hereto appropriately completed, representing the number of Rights

held by such holder at the Separation Time and having such marks of 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 15

identification or designation and such legends, summaries or endorsements

printed thereon as the Company may deem appropriate and as are not

inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, or as may be required

to comply with any law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto

or with any rule or regulation of any national securities exchange or

quotation system on which the Rights may from time to time be listed or

traded, or to conform to usage, and (y) a disclosure statement describing

the Rights.

(d) Subject to the terms hereof, Rights may be exercised on

any Business Day after the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time

by submitting to the Rights Agent the Rights Certificate evidencing such

Rights with an Election to Exercise (an "Election to Exercise") substan-

tially in the form attached to the Rights Certificate duly completed,

accompanied by payment in cash, or by certified or official bank check or

money order payable to the order of the Company, of a sum equal to the

Exercise Price multiplied by the number of Rights being exercised and a sum

sufficient to cover any transfer tax or charge which may be payable in

respect of any transfer involved in the transfer or delivery of Rights

Certificates or the issuance or delivery of certificates for shares or

depositary receipts (or both) in a name other than that of the holder of

the Rights being exercised.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 16

(e) Upon receipt of a Rights Certificate, with an Election to

Exercise accompanied by payment as set forth in Section 2.3(d), and subject

to the terms hereof, the Rights Agent will thereupon promptly (i)(A)

requisition from a transfer agent stock certificates evidencing such number

of shares or other securities to be purchased (the Company hereby

irrevocably authorizing its transfer agents to comply with all such

requisitions) and (B) if the Company elects pursuant to Section 5.5 not to

issue certificates representing fractional shares, requisition from the

depositary selected by the Company depositary receipts representing the

fractional shares to be purchased or requisition from the Company the

amount of cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with

Section 5.5 and (ii) after receipt of such certificates, depositary

receipts and/or cash, deliver the same to or upon the order of the

registered holder of such Rights Certificate, registered (in the case of

certificates or depositary receipts) in such name or names as may be desig-

nated by such holder.

(f) In case the holder of any Rights shall exercise less than

all the Rights evidenced by such holder's Rights Certificate, a new Rights

Certificate evidencing the Rights remaining unexercised will be issued by

the Rights Agent to such holder or to such holder's duly authorized

assigns.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 17

(g) The Company covenants and agrees that it will (i) take

all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all shares delivered

upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates

for such shares (subject to payment of the Exercise Price), be duly and

validly authorized, executed, issued and delivered and fully paid and

nonassessable; (ii) take all such action as may be necessary to comply with

any applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities

Exchange Act of 1934, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and any

other applicable law, rule or regulation, in connection with the issuance

of any shares upon exercise of Rights; and (iii) pay when due and payable

any and all federal and state transfer taxes and charges which may be

payable in respect of the original issuance or delivery of the Rights

Certificates or of any shares issued upon the exercise of Rights, provided

that the Company shall not be required to pay any transfer tax or charge

which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the transfer or

delivery of Rights Certificates or the issuance or delivery of certificates

for shares in a name other than that of the holder of the Rights being

transferred or exercised.

2.4 Adjustments to Exercise Price; Number of Rights. (a) In

the event the Company shall at any time after the Record Time and prior to

the Separation Time (i) declare or pay a dividend on Common Stock payable

in 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 18

Common Stock, (ii) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock or (iii) combine

the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common

Stock, (x) the Exercise Price in effect after such adjustment will be equal

to the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment

divided by the number of shares of Common Stock (the "Expansion Factor")

that a holder of one share of Common Stock immediately prior to such divi-

dend, subdivision or combination would hold thereafter as a result thereof

and (y) each Right held prior to such adjustment will become that number of

Rights equal to the Expansion Factor, and the adjusted number of Rights

will be deemed to be distributed among the shares of Common Stock with

respect to which the original Rights were associated (if they remain

outstanding) and the shares issued in respect of such dividend, subdivision

or combination, so that each such share of Common Stock will have exactly

one Right associated with it. Each adjustment made pursuant to this

paragraph shall be made as of the payment or effective date for the

applicable dividend, subdivision or combination.

In the event the Company shall at any time after the Record

Time and prior to the Separation Time issue any shares of Common Stock

otherwise than in a transaction referred to in the preceding paragraph,

each such share of Common Stock so issued shall automatically have one new

Right associated with it, which Right shall be evidenced by 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 19

the certificate representing such share. To the extent provided in Section

5.3, Rights shall be issued by the Company in respect of shares of Common

Stock that are issued or sold by the Company after the Separation Time.

(b) In the event the Company shall at any time after the

Record Time and prior to the Separation Time issue or distribute any

securities or assets in respect of, in lieu of or in exchange for Common

Stock (other than pursuant to a regular periodic cash dividend or a

dividend paid solely in Common Stock) whether by dividend, in a

reclassification or recapitalization (including any such transaction

involving a merger, consolidation or share exchange), or otherwise, the

Company shall make such adjustments, if any, in the Exercise Price, number

of Rights and/or securities or other property purchasable upon exercise of

Rights as the Board of Directors of the Company, in its sole discretion,

may deem to be appropriate under the circumstances in order to adequately

protect the interests of the holders of Rights generally, and the Company

and the Rights Agent shall amend this Agreement as necessary to provide for

such adjustments.

(c) Each adjustment to the Exercise Price made pursuant to

this Section 2.4 shall be calculated to the nearest cent. Whenever an

adjustment to the Exercise Price is made pursuant to this Section 2.4, the

Company shall (i) promptly prepare a certificate setting forth such 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 20

adjustment and a brief statement of the facts accounting for such

adjustment, (ii) promptly file with the Rights Agent and with each transfer

agent for the Common Stock a copy of such certificate and (iii) mail a

brief summary thereof to each holder of Rights.

(d) Irrespective of any adjustment or change in the

securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights, the Rights Certificates

theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express the securities so

purchasable which were expressed in the initial Rights Certificates issued

hereunder.

2.5 Date on Which Exercise is Effective. Each person in

whose name any certificate for shares is issued upon the exercise of Rights

shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the

shares represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated, the

date upon which the Rights Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly

surrendered and payment of the Exercise Price for such Rights (and any

applicable taxes and other governmental charges payable by the exercising

holder hereunder) was made; provided, however, that if the date of such

surrender and payment is a date upon which the stock transfer books of the

Company are closed, such person shall be deemed to have become the record

holder of such shares on, and such certificate shall be dated, the next

succeeding

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 21

Business Day on which the stock transfer books of the Company are open. 

2.6 Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating of Rights

Certificates. (a) The Rights Certificates shall be executed on behalf of

the Company by its Chairman of the Board, Vice Chairman of the Board,

President or one of its Vice Presidents, under its corporate seal

reproduced thereon attested by its Secretary or one of its Assistant

Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Rights Certifi-

cates may be manual or facsimile.

Rights Certificates bearing the manual or facsimile signatures

of individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company

shall bind the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of

them have ceased to hold such offices prior to the countersignature and

delivery of such Rights Certificates.

Promptly after the Company learns of the Separation Time, the

Company will notify the Rights Agent of such Separation Time and will

deliver Rights Certificates executed by the Company to the Rights Agent for

countersignature, and, subject to Section 3.1(b), the Rights Agent shall

manually countersign and deliver such Rights Certificates to the holders of

the Rights pursuant to Section 2.3(c) hereof. No Rights Certificate shall

be valid for any purpose unless manually countersigned by the Rights Agent.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 22

(b) Each Rights Certificate shall be dated the date of

countersignature thereof.

2.7 Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange. (a) 

After the Separation Time, the Company will cause to be kept a register

(the "Rights Register") in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as

it may prescribe, the Company will provide for the registration and

transfer of Rights. The Rights Agent is hereby appointed "Rights

Registrar" for the purpose of maintaining the Rights Register for the

Company and registering Rights and transfers of Rights after the Separation

Time as herein provided. In the event that the Rights Agent shall cease to

be the Rights Registrar, the Rights Agent will have the right to examine

the Rights Register at all reasonable times after the Separation Time.

After the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time,

upon surrender for registration of transfer or exchange of any Rights

Certificate, and subject to the provisions of Section 2.7(c) and (d), the

Company will execute, and the Rights Agent will countersign and deliver, in

the name of the holder or the designated transferee or transferees, as

required pursuant to the holder's instructions, one or more new Rights

Certificates evidencing the same aggregate number of Rights as did the

Rights Certificate so surrendered.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 23

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.1(b), all

Rights issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Rights

Certificates shall be the valid obligations of the Company, and such Rights

shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Agreement as the Rights

surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

(c) Every Rights Certificate surrendered for registration of

transfer or exchange shall be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written

instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company or the Rights

Agent, as the case may be, duly executed by the holder thereof or such

holder's attorney duly authorized in writing. As a condition to the

issuance of any new Rights Certificate under this Section 2.7, the Company

may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other

governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto.

(d) The Company shall not be required to register the

transfer or exchange of any Rights after such Rights have become void under

Section 3.1(b), been exchanged under Section 3.1(c) or been redeemed or

terminated under Section 5.1.

2.8 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Rights

Certificates. (a) If any mutilated Rights Certificate is surrendered to

the Rights Agent prior to the Expiration Time, then, subject to Sections

3.1(b) and 5.1, the Company 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 24

shall execute and the Rights Agent shall countersign and deliver in

exchange therefor a new Rights Certificate evidencing the same number of

Rights as did the Rights Certificate so surrendered.

(b) If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Rights

Agent prior to the Expiration Time (i) evidence to their satisfaction of

the destruction, loss or theft of any Rights Certificate and (ii) such

security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and

any of their agents harmless, then, subject to Sections 3.1(b) and 5.1 and

in the absence of notice to the Company or the Rights Agent that such

Rights Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company

shall execute and upon its request the Rights Agent shall countersign and

deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Rights Certificate,

a new Rights Certificate evidencing the same number of Rights as did the

Rights Certificate so destroyed, lost or stolen.

(c) As a condition to the issuance of any new Rights

Certificate under this Section 2.8, the Company may require the payment of

a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be

imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and

expenses of the Rights Agent) connected therewith.

(d) Every new Rights Certificate issued pursuant to this

Section 2.8 in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 25

Rights Certificate shall evidence an original additional contractual

obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen

Rights Certificate shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be

entitled to all the benefits of this Agreement equally and proportionately

with any and all other Rights duly issued hereunder.

2.9 Persons Deemed Owners. Prior to due presentment of a

Rights Certificate (or, prior to the Separation Time, the associated Common

Stock certificate) for registration of transfer, the Company, the Rights

Agent and any agent of the Company or the Rights Agent may deem and treat

the person in whose name such Rights Certificate (or, prior to the

Separation Time, such Common Stock certificate) is registered as the

absolute owner thereof and of the Rights evidenced thereby for all purposes

whatsoever, including the payment of the Redemption Price and neither the

Company nor the Rights Agent shall be affected by any notice to the

contrary. As used in this Agreement, unless the context otherwise

requires, the term "holder" of any Rights shall mean the registered holder

of such Rights (or, prior to the Separation Time, the associated shares of

Common Stock).

2.10 Delivery and Cancellation of Certificates. All Rights

Certificates surrendered upon exercise or for registration of transfer or

exchange shall, if surrendered to any person other than the Rights Agent,

be delivered to the Rights Agent and, in any case, shall be promptly can-

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 26

celled by the Rights Agent. The Company may at any time deliver to the

Rights Agent for cancellation any Rights Certificates previously counter-

signed and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any

manner whatsoever, and all Rights Certificates so delivered shall be

promptly cancelled by the Rights Agent. No Rights Certificates shall be

countersigned in lieu of or in exchange for any Rights Certificates

cancelled as provided in this Section 2.10, except as expressly permitted

by this Agreement. The Rights Agent shall destroy all cancelled Rights

Certificates and deliver a certificate of destruction to the Company.

2.11 Agreement of Rights Holders. Every holder of Rights by

accepting the same consents and agrees with the Company and the Rights

Agent and with every other holder of Rights that:

(a) prior to the Separation Time, each Right will be

transferable only together with, and will be transferred by a transfer of,

the associated share of Common Stock;

(b) after the Separation Time, the Rights Certificates will

be transferable only on the Rights Register as provided herein; 

(c) prior to due presentment of a Rights Certificate (or,

prior to the Separation Time, the associated Common Stock certificate) for

registration of transfer, the Company, the Rights Agent and any agent of

the Company or 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 27

the Rights Agent may deem and treat the person in whose name the Rights

Certificate (or, prior to the Separation Time, the associated Common Stock

certificate) is registered as the absolute owner thereof and of the Rights

evidenced thereby for all purposes whatsoever, and neither the Company nor

the Rights Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary;

(d) Rights beneficially owned by certain Persons will, under

the circumstances set forth in Section 3.1(b), become void; and

(e) this Agreement may be supplemented or amended from time to

time pursuant to Section 2.4(b) or 5.4 hereof.

ARTICLE III

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RIGHTS IN 
THE EVENT OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS

3.1 Flip-in. (a) In the event that prior to the Expiration

Time a Flip-in Date shall occur, the Company shall take such action as

shall be necessary to ensure and provide that, except as provided in this

Section 3.1, each Right shall constitute the right to purchase from the

Company, upon exercise thereof in accordance with the terms hereof (but

subject to Section 5.10), that number of shares of Common Stock having an

aggregate Market Price on the Stock Acquisition Date equal to twice the

Exercise Price for an amount in cash equal to the Exercise Price (such

right to be appropriately adjusted in order to protect the interests 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 28

of the holders of Rights generally in the event that on or after such Stock

Acquisition Date an event of a type analogous to any of the events

described in Section 2.4(a) or (b) shall have occurred with respect to the

Common Stock).

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Rights that are or were

Beneficially Owned on or after the Stock Acquisition Date by an Acquiring

Person or an Affiliate or Associate thereof or by any transferee, direct or

indirect, of any of the foregoing shall become void and any holder of such

Rights (including transferees) shall thereafter have no right to exercise

or transfer such Rights under any provision of this Agreement. If any

Rights Certificate is presented for assignment or exercise and the Person

presenting the same will not complete the certification set forth at the

end of the form of assignment or notice of election to exercise and provide

such additional evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner and its

Affiliates and Associates (or former Beneficial Owners and their Affiliates

and Associates) as the Company shall reasonably request, then the Company

shall be entitled conclusively to deem the Beneficial Owner thereof to be

an Acquiring Person or an Affiliate or Associate thereof or a transferee of

any of the foregoing and accordingly will deem the Rights evidenced thereby

to be void and not transferable or exercisable.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 29

(c) The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option,

at any time after a Flip-in Date and prior to the time that an Acquiring

Person becomes the Beneficial Owner of more than 50% of the outstanding

shares of Common Stock, elect to exchange all (but not less than all) the

then outstanding Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become

void pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1(b)) for shares of Common

Stock at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock per Right,

appropriately adjusted in order to protect the interests of holders of

Rights generally in the event that after the Separation Time an event of a

type analogous to any of the events described in Section 2.4(a) or (b)

shall have occurred with respect to the Common Stock (such exchange ratio,

as adjusted from time to time, being hereinafter referred to as the

"Exchange Ratio").

Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the

Company electing to exchange the Rights, without any further action and

without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and

each Right (other than Rights that have become void pursuant to Section

3.1(b)) will thereafter represent only the right to receive a number of

shares of Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. Promptly after the

action of the Board of Directors electing to exchange the Rights, the

Company shall give notice thereof (specifying the steps to be taken to

receive 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 30

shares of Common Stock in exchange for Rights) to the Rights Agent and the

holders of the Rights (other than Rights that have become void pursuant to

Section 3.1(b)) outstanding immediately prior thereto by mailing such

notice in accordance with Section 5.9.

Each Person in whose name any certificate for shares is issued

upon the exchange of Rights pursuant to this Section 3.1(c) shall for all

purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares

represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated, the date upon

which the Rights Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered

and payment of any applicable taxes and other governmental charges payable

by the holder was made; provided, however, that if the date of such

surrender and payment is a date upon which the stock transfer books of the

Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the record

holder of such shares on, and such certificate shall be dated, the next

succeeding Business Day on which the stock transfer books of the Company

are open.

(d) In the event that there shall not be sufficient treasury

shares or authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock of the Company to

permit the exercise or exchange in full of the Rights in accordance with

Section 3.1(a) or (c), the Company shall take such action as shall be

necessary to ensure and provide, to the extent permitted by applicable law

and any agreements or instru-

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 31

ments in effect on the Stock Acquisition Date to which it is a party, that

each Right shall thereafter constitute the right to receive, (x) at the

Company's option, either (A) in return for the Exercise Price, debt or

equity securities or other assets (or a combination thereof) having a fair

value equal to twice the Exercise Price, or (B) without payment of

consideration (except as otherwise required by applicable law), debt or

equity securities or other assets (or a combination thereof) having a fair

value equal to the Exercise Price, or (y) if the Board of Directors of the

Company elects to exchange the Rights in accordance with Section 3.1(c),

debt or equity securities or other assets (or a combination thereof) having

a fair value equal to the product of the Market Price of a share of Common

Stock on the Flip-in Date times the Exchange Ratio in effect on the Flip-in

Date, where in any case set forth in (x) or (y) above the fair value of

such debt or equity securities or other assets shall be as determined in

good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation

with a nationally recognized investment banking firm. 

3.2 Flip-over. (a) Prior to the Expiration Time, the

Company shall not enter into any agreement with an Acquiring Person (or any

of its Affiliates or Associates) with respect to, consummate or permit to

occur any Flip-over Transaction or Event unless and until it shall have

entered into a supplemental agreement with the Flip-over Entity, for

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 32

the benefit of the holders of the Rights, providing that, upon consummation

or occurrence of the Flip-over Transaction or Event (i) each Right shall

thereafter constitute the right to purchase from the Flip-over Entity, upon

exercise thereof in accordance with the terms hereof, that number of shares

of Flip-over Stock of the Flip-over Entity having an aggregate Market Price

on the date of consummation or occurrence of such Flip-over Transaction or

Event equal to twice the Exercise Price for an amount in cash equal to the

Exercise Price (such right to be appropriately adjusted in order to protect

the interests of the holders of Rights generally in the event that after

such date of consummation or occurrence an event of a type analogous to any

of the events described in Section 2.4(a) or (b) shall have occurred with

respect to the Flip-over Stock) and (ii) the Flip-over Entity shall there-

after be liable for, and shall assume, by virtue of such Flip-over

Transaction or Event and such supplemental agreement, all the obligations

and duties of the Company pursuant to this Agreement. The provisions of

this Section 3.2 shall apply to successive Flip-over Transactions or

Events.

(b) Prior to the Expiration Time, unless the Rights will be

redeemed pursuant to Section 5.1 hereof in connection therewith, the

Company shall not enter into any agreement with respect to, consummate or

permit to occur any Flip-over Transaction or Event if at the time thereof

there 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 33

are any rights, warrants or securities outstanding or any other

arrangements, agreements or instruments that would eliminate or otherwise

diminish in any material respect the benefits intended to be afforded by

this Rights Agreement to the holders of Rights upon consummation of such

transaction.

ARTICLE IV

4.1 General. (a) The Company hereby appoints the Rights

Agent to act as agent for the Company in accordance with the terms and

conditions hereof, and the Rights Agent hereby accepts such appointment. 

The Company agrees to pay to the Rights Agent reasonable compensation for

all services rendered by it hereunder and, from time to time, on demand of

Company also agrees to indemnify the Rights Agent for, and to hold it

harmless against, any loss, liability, or expense, incurred without

negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Rights

Agent, for anything done or omitted to be done by the Rights Agent in

connection with the acceptance and administration of this Agreement,

including the costs and expenses of defending against any claim of

liability.

(b) The Rights Agent shall be protected and shall incur no

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 34

suffered or omitted by it in connection with its administration of this

Agreement in reliance upon any certificate for securities purchasable upon

exercise of Rights, Rights Certificate, certificate for other securities of

the Company, instrument of assignment or transfer, power of attorney,

endorsement, affidavit, letter, notice, direction, consent, certificate,

statement, or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to

be signed, executed and, where necessary, verified or acknowledged, by the

proper person or persons.

4.2 Merger or Consolidation or Change of Name of Rights

Agent. (a) Any corporation into which the Rights Agent or any successor

Rights Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any

corporation resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Rights

Agent or any successor Rights Agent is a party, or any corporation

succeeding to the shareholder services business of the Rights Agent or any

successor Rights Agent, will be the successor to the Rights Agent under

this Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper or any further

act on the part of any of the parties hereto, provided that such

corporation would be eligible for appointment as a successor Rights Agent

under the provisions of Section 4.4 hereof. In case at the time such

successor Rights Agent succeeds to the agency created by this Agreement any

of the Rights Certificates have been countersigned but not delivered, any

such 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 35

successor Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of the predecessor

Rights Agent and deliver such Rights Certificates so countersigned; and in

case at that time any of the Rights Certificates have not been

countersigned, any successor Rights Agent may countersign such Rights

Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Rights Agent or in the

name of the successor Rights Agent; and in all such cases such Rights

Certificates will have the full force provided in the Rights Certificates

and in this Agreement.

(b) In case at any time the name of the Rights Agent is

changed and at such time any of the Rights Certificates shall have been

countersigned but not delivered, the Rights Agent may adopt the

countersignature under its prior name and deliver Rights Certificates so

countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Rights Certificates

shall not have been countersigned, the Rights Agent may countersign such

Rights Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed name; and in

all such cases such Rights Certificates shall have the full force provided

in the Rights Certificates and in this Agreement.

4.3 Duties of Rights Agent. The Rights Agent undertakes the

duties and obligations imposed by this Agreement upon the following terms

and conditions, by all of which the Company and the holders of Rights

Certificates, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 36

(a) The Rights Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may

be legal counsel for the Company), and the opinion of such counsel will be

full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent as to

any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and in accordance with such

opinion.

(b) Whenever in the performance of its duties under this

Agreement the Rights Agent deems it necessary or desirable that any fact or

matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking or suffering

any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect

thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively

proved and established by a certificate signed by a person believed by the

Rights Agent to be the Chairman of the Board, the President or any Vice

President and by the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary

or any Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Rights

Agent; and such certificate will be full authorization to the Rights Agent

for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it under the provisions

of this Agreement in reliance upon such certificate.

(c) The Rights Agent will be liable hereunder only for its

own negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

(d) The Rights Agent will not be liable for or by reason of

any of the statements of fact or recitals 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 37

contained in this Agreement or in the certificates for securities

purchasable upon exercise of Rights or the Rights Certificates (except its

countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such

statements and recitals are and will be deemed to have been made by the

Company only.

(e) The Rights Agent will not be under any responsibility in

respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and delivery

hereof (except the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof by the

Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any certificate

for securities purchasable upon exercise of Rights or Rights Certificate

(except its countersignature thereof); nor will it be responsible for any

breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this

Agreement or in any Rights Certificate; nor will it be responsible for any

change in the exercisability of the Rights (including the Rights becoming

void pursuant to Section 3.1(b) hereof) or any adjustment required under

the provisions of Section 2.4, 3.1 or 3.2 hereof or responsible for the

manner, method or amount of any such adjustment or the ascertaining of the

existence of facts that would require any such adjustment (except with

respect to the exercise of Rights after receipt of the certificate

contemplated by Section 2.4 describing any such adjustment); nor will it by

any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to

the 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 38

authorization or reservation of any securities purchasable upon exercise of

Rights or any Rights or as to whether any securities purchasable upon

exercise of Rights will, when issued, be duly and validly authorized,

executed, issued and delivered and fully paid and nonassessable.

(f) The Company agrees that it will perform, execute,

acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged

and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments and assurances

as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying out or

performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this Agreement.

(g) The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to

accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder

from any person believed by the Rights Agent to be the Chairman of the

Board, the President or any Vice President or the Secretary or any

Assistant Secretary or the Treasurer or any Assistant Treasurer of the

Company, and to apply to such persons for advice or instructions in

connection with its duties, and it shall not be liable for any action taken

or suffered by it in good faith in accordance with instructions of any such

person.

(h) The Rights Agent and any shareholder, director, officer

or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in Common Stock,

Rights or other securities of the 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 39

Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the

Company may be interested, or contract with or lend money to the Company or

otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Rights Agent under

this Agreement. Nothing herein shall preclude the Rights Agent from acting

in any other capacity for the Company or for any other legal entity.

(i) The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the

rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either

itself or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent will

not be answerable or accountable for any act, default, neglect or

misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Company

resulting from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct, provided

reasonable care was exercised in the selection and continued employment

thereof.

4.4 Change of Rights Agent. The Rights Agent may resign and

be discharged from its duties under this Agreement upon 90 days' notice (or

such lesser notice as is acceptable to the Company) in writing mailed to

the Company and to each transfer agent of Common Stock by registered or

certified mail, and to the holders of the Rights in accordance with

Section 5.9. The Company may remove the Rights Agent upon 30 days' notice

in writing, mailed to the Rights Agent and to each transfer agent of the

Common Stock by registered or certified mail, and to the holders of the 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 40

Rights in accordance with Section 5.9. If the Rights Agent should resign

or be removed or otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company will

appoint a successor to the Rights Agent. If the Company fails to make such

appointment within a period of 30 days after such removal or after it has

been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning

or incapacitated Rights Agent or by the holder of any Rights (which holder

shall, with such notice, submit such holder's Rights Certificate for

inspection by the Company), then the holder of any Rights may apply to any

court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent. 

Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a

court, shall be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws

of the United States or of the State of New York or North Carolina, in good

standing, having its principal office in the State of New York or North

Carolina, which is authorized under such laws to exercise the powers of the

Rights Agent contemplated by this Agreement and is subject to supervision

or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the time of

its appointment as Rights Agent a combined capital and surplus of at least

$50,000,000. After appointment, the successor Rights Agent will be vested

with the same powers, rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been

originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the

predecessor Rights Agent shall deliver 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 41

and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by

it hereunder, and execute and deliver any further assurance, conveyance,

act or deed necessary for the purpose. Not later than the effective date

of any such appointment, the Company will file notice thereof in writing

with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Common

Stock, and mail a notice thereof in writing to the holders of the Rights. 

Failure to give any notice provided for in this Section 4.4, however, or

any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the

resignation or removal of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the

successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.

ARTICLE V 

MISCELLANEOUS

5.1 Redemption. (a) The Board of Directors of the Company

may, at its option, at any time prior to the close of business on the Flip-

in Date, elect to redeem all (but not less than all) the then outstanding

Rights at the Redemption Price and the Company, at its option, may pay the

Redemption Price either in cash or shares of Common Stock or other

securities of the Company deemed by the Board of Directors, in the exercise

of its sole discretion, to be at least equivalent in value to the

Redemption Price.

(b) Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of

the Company electing to redeem the Rights (or, 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 42

if the resolution of the Board of Directors electing to redeem the Rights

states that the redemption will not be effective until the occurrence of a

specified future time or event, upon the occurrence of such future time or

event), without any further action and without any notice, the right to

exercise the Rights will terminate and each Right will thereafter represent

only the right to receive the Redemption Price in cash or securities, as

determined by the Board of Directors. Promptly after the Rights are

redeemed, the Company shall give notice of such redemption to the Rights

Agent and the holders of the then outstanding Rights by mailing such notice

in accordance with Section 5.9.

5.2 Expiration. The Rights and this Agreement shall expire

at the Expiration Time and no Person shall have any rights pursuant to this

Agreement or any Right after the Expiration Time, except, if the Rights are

exchanged or redeemed, as provided in Section 3.1(c), 3.1(d), 3.2 or 5.1

hereof.

5.3 Issuance of New Rights Certificates. Notwithstanding any

of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the

Company may, at its option, issue new Rights Certificates evidencing Rights

in such form as may be approved by its Board of Directors to reflect any

adjustment or change in the number or kind or class of shares of stock

purchasable upon exercise of Rights made in accordance with the provisions

of this Agreement. In 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 43

addition, in connection with the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock

by the Company following the Separation Time and prior to the Redemption

Time or Expiration Time pursuant to the terms of securities convertible or

redeemable into shares of Common Stock or to options, in each case issued

or granted prior to, and outstanding at, the Separation Time, the Company

shall issue to the holders of such shares of Common Stock, Rights

Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection

with the issuance or sale of such shares of Common Stock; provided,

however, in each case, (i) no such Rights Certificate shall be issued, if,

and to the extent that, the Company shall be advised by counsel that such

issuance would create a significant risk of material adverse tax

consequences to the Company or to the Person to whom such Rights

Certificates would be issued, (ii) no such Rights Certificates shall be

issued if, and to the extent that, appropriate adjustment shall have

otherwise been made in lieu of the issuance thereof, and (iii) the Company

shall have no obligation to distribute Rights Certificates to any Acquiring

Person or Affiliate or Associate of an Acquiring Person or any transferee

of any of the foregoing.

5.4 Supplements and Amendments. The Company and the Rights

Agent may from time to time supplement or amend this Agreement without the

approval of any holders of Rights (i) prior to the close of business on the

Flip-in Date, in 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 44

any respect and (ii) after the close of business on the Flip-in Date, to

make any changes that the Company may deem necessary or desirable and which

shall not materially adversely affect the interests of the holders of

Rights generally or in order to cure any ambiguity or to correct or

supplement any provision contained herein which may be inconsistent with

any other provisions herein or otherwise defective. The Rights Agent will

duly execute and deliver any supplement or amendment hereto requested by

the Company which satisfies the terms of the preceding sentence.

5.5 Fractional Shares. If the Company elects not to issue 

certificates representing fractional shares upon exercise or redemption of 

Rights, the Company shall, in lieu thereof, in the sole discretion of the 

Board of Directors, either (a) evidence such fractional shares by depositary

receipts issued pursuant to an appropriate agreement between the Company

and a depositary selected by it, providing that each holder of a depositary

receipt shall have all of the rights, privileges and preferences to which

such holder would be entitled as a beneficial owner of such fractional

share, or (b) sell such shares on behalf of the holders of Rights and pay

to the registered holder of such Rights the appropriate fraction of price

per share received upon such sale.

5.6 Rights of Action. Subject to the terms of this Agreement

(including Section 3.1(b)), rights of action 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 45

in respect of this Agreement, other than rights of action vested solely in

the Rights Agent, are vested in the respective holders of the Rights; and

any holder of any Rights, without the consent of the Rights Agent or of the

holder of any other Rights, may, on such holder's own behalf and for such

holder's own benefit and the benefit of other holders of Rights, enforce,

and may institute and maintain any suit, action or proceeding against the

Company to enforce, or otherwise act in respect of, such holder's right to

exercise such holder's Rights in the manner provided in such holder's

Rights Certificate and in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing

or any remedies available to the holders of Rights, it is specifically

acknowledged that the holders of Rights would not have an adequate remedy

at law for any breach of this Agreement and will be entitled to specific

performance of the obligations under, and injunctive relief against actual

or threatened violations of, the obligations of any Person subject to this

Agreement.

5.7 Holder of Rights Not Deemed a Shareholder. No holder, as

such, of any Rights shall be entitled to vote, receive dividends or be

deemed for any purpose the holder of shares or any other securities which

may at any time be issuable on the exercise of such Rights, nor shall

anything contained herein or in any Rights Certificate be construed to

confer upon the holder of any Rights, as such, any of the rights of a

shareholder of the Company or any right to vote 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 46

for the election of directors or upon any matter submitted to shareholders

at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate

action, or to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting

shareholders (except as provided in Section 5.8 hereof), or to receive

dividends or subscription rights, or otherwise, until such Rights shall

have been exercised or exchanged in accordance with the provisions hereof.

5.8 Notice of Proposed Actions. In case the Company shall

propose after the Separation Time and prior to the Expiration Time (i) to

effect or permit (in cases where the Company's permission is required)

occurrence of any Flip-in Date or Flip-over Transaction or Event or (ii) to

effect the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, then, in

each such case, the Company shall give to each holder of a Right, in

accordance with Section 5.9 hereof, a notice of such proposed action, which

shall specify the Flip-in Date or the date on which such Flip-over

Transaction or Event, liquidation, dissolution, or winding up is to take

place, and such notice shall be so given at least 20 Business Days prior to

Agent", which term shall include any successor Rights Agent under the
Rights Agreement), to purchase from the Company at any time after the
Separation Time (as such term is defined in the Rights Agreement) and prior
to the close of business on April 18, 2004, one fully paid share of Common
Stock, par value $0.20 per share (the "Common Stock") of the Company

NEWS RELEASE - April 5, 1994 Contact: Guy M. Ross

STANDARD COMMERCIAL ADOPTS SHAREHOLDER PROTECTION RIGHTS PLAN

The Board of Directors of Standard Commercial Corporation (STW:NYSE) today
adopted a Shareholder Protection Rights Plan and declared a dividend of one
Right on each outstanding share of Standard Common Stock. The dividend
will be paid on April 25, 1994 to shareholders of record on April 18, 1994.

Until it is announced that a person or group has acquired 10% or more of
Standard's Common Stock (an "Acquiring Person") or commences a tender offer
that will result in such person or group owning 10% or more of Standard's
Common Stock, the Rights will be evidenced by the Common Stock
certificates, will automatically trade with the Common Stock and will not
be exercisable. Thereafter, separate Rights certificates will be
distributed and each Right will entitle its holder to purchase one share of
Common Stock for an exercise price of $60.00. 

Upon announcement that any person or group has become an Acquiring Person
then 10 days thereafter (or such earlier or later date as the Board may
decide) (the "Flip-in Date") each Right (other than Rights beneficially
owned by any Acquiring Person or transferees thereof, which Rights become
void) will entitle its holder to purchase, for the exercise price, a number
of shares of Standard Common Stock having a market value of twice the
exercise price. Also, if after an Acquiring Person controls Standard's
Board of Directors, Standard is involved in a merger or sells more than 50%
of its assets or earning power (or has entered an agreement to do any of
the foregoing) and, in the case of a merger, the Acquiring Person will
receive different treatment than all other shareholders, each Right will
entitle its holder to purchase, for the exercise price, a number of shares
of common stock of the Acquiring Person having a market value of twice the
exercise price. If any person or group acquires between 10% and 50% of
Standard's Common Stock, Standard's Board of Directors may, at its option,
exchange one share of Standard Common Stock for each Right. Holdings of
the Kehaya family will not trigger the Rights.

The Rights may be redeemed by the Board of Directors for $0.01 per Right
prior to the Flip-in Date.

Ery W. Kehaya, Chairman of the Board of Standard, stated that "the Rights
are designed to cause substantial dilution to a person or group that
acquires 10% or more of the Common Stock unless the Rights are first
redeemed by the Board of Directors of the Company. Nevertheless, the
Rights should not interfere with a transaction that is in the best
interests of the Company and its

shareholders because the Rights can be redeemed prior to a triggering
event.

The Rights Plan does not in any way weaken Standard's financial strength or
interfere with its business plans. The issuance of the Rights has no
dilutive effect, will not affect reported earnings per share, is not
taxable to Standard or its shareholders and will not change the way in
which Standard shares are traded."

A letter to shareholders regarding the Rights Plan and a summary of certain
terms of the Rights Plan will be mailed to shareholders on April 25.
