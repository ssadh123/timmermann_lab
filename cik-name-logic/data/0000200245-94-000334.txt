For Immediate Release:

SALOMON INC TO REPORT A NET LOSS FOR THE 1994 SECOND QUARTER

New York, July 6, 1994 - Although its results are not yet
final, Salomon Inc today announced that it will report a net
loss for the 1994 second quarter. The Company expects to
release final quarterly results on or about July 21. The
aftertax loss, currently estimated at approximately $200
million, is attributable to poor results for Salomon
Brothers, the Company's global investment banking and
securities business.

Salomon Brothers will report a loss, attributable primarily
to its Client-Driven Businesses. Such businesses were
adversely affected by inventory related losses, particularly
in fixed income markets, and declines in underwriting
activity and customer trading volume. Losses were also
recorded in proprietary trading businesses. Salomon
Brothers' loss will be partly offset by good results at the
Phibro Division, the Company's commodities trading business.
