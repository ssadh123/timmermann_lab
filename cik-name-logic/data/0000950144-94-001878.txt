ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

The Actava Group Inc. (the "Company") believes that historical financial
statements which have been restated to report Qualex Inc. as a discontinued
operation would be helpful in allowing investors to evaluate the Company's
current financial statements. Therefore, the Company has restated its historical
consolidated statements of operations and cash flows to reflect Qualex as a
discontinued operation and such restated financial statements are included in
the following:

- Audited Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Company and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related Consolidated Statements of
Operations, Stockholders' Equity, and Cash Flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 1993.

- Unaudited Balance Sheets as of March 31, 1994 and December 31, 1993 of

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To The Stockholders
The Actava Group Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Actava
Group Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
The Actava Group Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements, in 1993
Actava changed its method of accounting for income taxes and postretirement
benefits, and in 1992 Actava changed its method of accounting for the cost of
its proof advertising program.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Actava and
its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany transactions and
accounts have been eliminated in consolidation.

Accounting Changes

Change in Method of Accounting for Certain Advertising Costs of Discontinued
Operation

Effective January 1, 1992, Qualex changed its method of accounting for the
cost of its proof advertising program to recognize these costs at the time the
advertising is placed by the customer. Under the proof advertising program,
Qualex reimburses certain advertising costs incurred by its customers up to a
percentage of sales to that customer. Qualex previously accrued such costs at
the time of the initial sale. Qualex believes that this new method is preferable
because it recognizes advertising expense as it is incurred rather than at the
time of the initial sale to the customer. The 1992 adjustment of $1,034,000, was
included in the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for 1992 to
apply retroactively the new method. The pro forma amounts presented in the
consolidated statements of operations for 1992 and 1991 reflect the effect of
the retroactive application of applying the new method.

Change in Method of Accounting for Income Taxes

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." Under Statement 109, the liability method is used
in accounting for income taxes: deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws
that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Prior to
the adoption of Statement 109, income tax expense was determined using the
deferred method: deferred tax expense was based on items of income and expense
that were reported in different years in the financial statements and tax
returns and were measured at the tax rate in effect in the year the difference
originated.

As permitted by Statement 109, the Company has elected not to restate the
financial statements of any prior years. The presentation of some items, such as
depreciation, has changed; however, the cumulative effect of the change in
accounting principle on pre-tax income from continuing operations, net income
and financial position was not material.

Change in Method of Accounting for Postretirement Benefits

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 106,
"Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." The Company and
its subsidiaries provide group medical plans and life insurance coverage for
certain employees subsequent to retirement. The plans have been funded on a
pay-as-you-go (cash) basis. The plans are contributory, with retiree
contributions adjusted annually, and contain other cost-sharing features such as
deductibles, coinsurance and life-time maximums. The plan accounting anticipates
future cost-sharing changes that are consistent with the Company's expressed
intent to increase the retiree contribution rate annually for the expected
medical trend rate for that year. The Company funds the excess of the cost of
benefits under the plans over the participants' contributions as the costs are
incurred. The coordination of benefits with medicare uses a supplemental, or
exclusion of benefits, approach.

As permitted by Statement 106, the Company elected to immediately recognize
the effect in the statement of operations for the first quarter of 1993 as a
$4,404,000 charge to net income as the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle. The annual net periodic postretirement benefit expense for
1993 decreased by $38,000 as a result of adopting the new rules. Postretirement
benefit expense for 1992 and 1991, recorded on a cash basis, has not been
restated. The pro forma amounts presented in the consolidated

7
<PAGE> 9

THE ACTAVA GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

statements of operations reflect no effect of the retroactive application of
applying the new method as it is not material. The assumed health care cost
trend rate used to measure the expected cost of benefits covered by the plan for
1993 is 14%. This trend rate is assumed to decrease in 1% decrements to 6% in
2001 and years thereafter. A 7% discount rate per year, compounded annually, was
assumed to measure the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of
December 31, 1993, as compared to 9% for January 1, 1993. A 1% increase in the
assumed health care cost trend rate would increase the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligations as of December 31, 1993, by 16% and the net
periodic postretirement benefit cost by 18%.

The following table presents the plans' funded status reconciled with
amounts recognized in the Company's consolidated balance sheet:

Change in Accounting Estimate

During 1993, Snapper revised its estimate of accrued product warranty
expense to reflect an increase in the amount of future warranty expense to be
incurred due to increased warranty claims. This change in accounting estimate
resulted in an additional $4,000,000 charge to net income in 1993.

Short-Term Investments

Short-term investments which are classified as current assets are carried
at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. These investments consist of
interest bearing obligations and other obligations whose return is based upon
market rates of interest. There is no significant concentration of short-term
investments in any single issuer.

Marketable equity securities which are classified as long-term investments
are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or market value. Marketable debt
securities which are classified as long-term investments are

carried at cost which approximates market value. Market values for these
securities are based on quoted market prices. Interest income is accrued as
earned, while dividend income is recorded on the exdividend date. The cost of
marketable securities sold is determined on the specific identification method
and realized gains and losses are reflected in income.

Inventories

Inventories of finished goods, work in process and raw materials are stated
at the lower of cost or market. The Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) method of
determining cost is used for a substantial portion of these inventories.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over
their expected useful lives. Generally, depreciation is provided on the
straight-line method for financial reporting purposes and on accelerated methods
for tax purposes. Amortization associated with capitalized leases is included in
depreciation expense.

Intangibles

Intangibles consist of the excess of the purchase price over the net assets
of businesses acquired, customer lists and covenants not to compete. Amounts
relating to the excess of the purchase price over the net assets of businesses
acquired are amortized over a 40-year period using the straight-line method.
Amounts relating to customer lists and covenants not to compete are amortized
over two to five years or the life of the agreement, respectively. Management
continuously evaluates intangible assets to determine that no diminishment in
value has occurred. Management evaluates intangible assets on the basis of the
operations of the particular entity to which the intangible relates to determine
whether any changes in the nature and expected benefits to be derived from the
intangible have occurred which would require an adjustment to its recorded
value. In the event management believes that the recorded value of the
intangible is greater than its actual value, the Company will write-down the
value of the intangible. In conjunction with the evaluation of any possible
impairment of its intangibles, the Company also similarly assesses whether a
change in the life of the intangible is required for amortization purposes.

Intangible assets are summarized as follows:

Income Taxes

Income taxes are provided for all taxable items in the statement of
operations regardless of when these items are reported for federal income tax
purposes. Actava elects to utilize certain provisions of the federal income tax
laws to reduce current taxes payable. Deferred income taxes are provided for
temporary differences in recognition of income and expenses for tax and
financial reporting purposes.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes." Under Statement 109, the liability method is used
in accounting for income taxes: deferred tax assets

9

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting
and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax
rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to
reverse.

Postemployment Benefits

The Company and its subsidiaries provide benefits to former or inactive
employees after employment, but before retirement, such as severance benefits,
continuation of health care benefits and life insurance coverage. The costs of
these are currently accounted for on a pay-as-you-go (cash) basis. The Financial
Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," which
requires employers to recognize the obligation to provide these benefits when
certain conditions are met. The Company is required to adopt the new method of
accounting for these benefits no later than January 1, 1994. The adoption of
Statement No. 112 will not have a significant effect on the Company's financial
position or results of operations.

Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities

The Company and its subsidiaries invest in various debt and equity
securities. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities," which requires certain debt securities to be
reported at amortized cost, certain debt and equity securities to be reported at
market with current recognition of unrealized gains and losses, and certain debt
and equity securities to be reported at market with unrealized gains and losses
as a separate component of shareholders' equity. The Company is required to
adopt the new method of accounting no later than January 1, 1994. The adoption
of Statement No. 115 will not have a significant impact on the Company's
financial position or results of operations.

Earnings Per Share of Common Stock

Primary earnings per share are computed by dividing net income (loss) by
the average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the
year. Common equivalent shares include shares issuable upon the assumed exercise
of stock options using the treasury stock method when dilutive. Computations of
common equivalent shares are based upon average prices during each period.

Fully diluted earnings per share are computed using such average shares
adjusted for any additional shares which would result from using end-of-year
prices in the above computations, plus the additional shares that would result
from the conversion of the 6 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Debentures. Net
income (loss) is adjusted by interest (net of income taxes) on the 6 1/2%
Convertible Subordinated Debentures. The computation of fully diluted earnings
per share is used only when it results in an earnings per share number which is
lower than primary earnings per share.

Revenue Recognition

Sales from the lawn and garden and sporting goods segments are recognized
when the products are shipped to their customers.

Index Protection Agreements

The Company uses index protection agreements to hedge interest rate risk
associated with its borrowings and to hedge the risk or market price
fluctuations of commodities bought and sold in the normal course of business.
These contracts are accounted for as hedges and any gains or losses are deferred
and included in the basis of the underlying transactions. Cash flows from the
contracts are accounted for in the same categories as the cash flows from the
items being hedged.

During 1993, Qualex entered into a hedge agreement with a bank which
expires in 1996 related to Qualex's $200,000,000 of Senior Notes. The hedge
agreement includes a Basic Transaction for a notional amount of $100,000,000
under which Qualex pays an interest rate based on the three-month London
Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and receives a fixed interest rate of 4.0587%
quarterly, and an Enhancement Transaction for a notional amount of $163,000,000
under which Qualex pays an interest rate based on the three-month LIBOR and
receives a variable interest rate based on the prime rate less 2.49%. A net
settlement is calculated and paid on a quarterly basis. At December 31, 1993,
termination of this interest rate swap agreement would require a cash payment by
Qualex of $1,158,000 based on market quotes.

Qualex also entered into various commodity swaps to provide protection for
silver recoveries from photofinishing processes. The outstanding contracts at
December 31, 1993 cover the sale of 2,900,000 troy ounces of silver at index
amounts of $3.85 to $4.67 per ounce in 1994 and 1,420,000 troy ounces per year
at index amounts of $4.23 to $5.10 per ounce from 1995 to 2005. In 1997, Qualex
has the sale of 4,300,000 troy ounces covered by swap agreements at an index
amount of $5.15 per ounce. During 1993 and 1992, gain amortization related to
these contracts totaled 2,445,000 and 1,232,000 net of tax, and is included in
income from discontinued operations. At December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively, $7,442,000 and $11,476,000 of these gains were recorded as
deferred income. The deferred gains are amortized over the original effective
lives of the agreements and $4,990,000, $1,338,000, $835,000 and $279,000 will
be amortized in 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997, respectively. At December 31, 1993,
termination of the commodity swap agreements would require cash payments by
Qualex of $18,688,000 based on market quotes.

Self-Insurance

The Company is primarily self-insured for workers' compensation, health,
automobile, product and general liability costs. The self-insurance claim
liability is determined based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred
but not yet reported.

Accrued Warranty

The Company provides an accrual for estimated future warranty costs related
to various product coverage programs, based on the historical relationship of
actual costs as a percentage of sales.

Reclassifications

Certain reclassifications were made in prior years' financial statements to
conform to current presentations.

PHOTOFINISHING TRANSACTION AND DISCONTINUED OPERATION

Photofinishing operations are conducted by Qualex Inc., which was formed in
March 1988 by the combination of Actava's photofinishing subsidiary with the
domestic photofinishing operations of Eastman Kodak Company. Actava and Kodak
currently share equally in Qualex's equity, income and dividends. Actava owns
51% of the voting stock of Qualex, is entitled to and has elected a majority of
the members of the Board of Directors of Qualex, and has the ability through its
control of the Board of Directors to declare dividends, remove the executive
officers of Qualex and otherwise direct the management and policies of Qualex,
except for policies relating to certain designated actions requiring the consent
of at least one member of the Board of Directors of Qualex designated by Kodak.
Because of these rights, the Company believes that, it has effective unilateral
control of Qualex which is not temporary. As a result, the Company consolidates
the results of operations of Qualex with the results of operations of the
Company.

Upon the formation of Qualex in 1988, the Company and Kodak entered into a
Shareholders Agreement (the "Qualex Shareholders Agreement") that provided,
among other things, for a reduction in the Company's voting control of Qualex
from 51% to 50% and for changes in the composition of the Board of Directors of
Qualex in the event of a "change in control" of the Company. The Qualex
Shareholders Agreement defined the term "change in control" to include a
"transaction or occurrence the effect of which is to give a person or group of
affiliated persons or entities the power to direct the management and policies"
of the Company.

In 1991, Charles R. Scott was elected President and Chief Executive Officer
of the Company. At the time of his election, Mr. Scott was also serving as
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of a company that owned approximately 25%
of the Company's voting stock and was the Company's single largest stockholder.
Because Mr. Scott was serving at the same time as the chief executive officer of
both the Company and the Company's single largest stockholder, the Company and
Kodak agreed that a "change in control" of the Company had occurred for purposes
of the Qualex Shareholders Agreement. Despite this "change in control" of the
Company, Kodak agreed that the Company would continue to own 51% of the voting
control of Qualex and to elect a majority of the directors of Qualex. The Qualex
Shareholders Agreement, however, was amended to provide that Kodak had the right
to change the Company's control of Qualex on March 1, 1992 or on any subsequent
March 1. The Company does not believe that Kodak would exercise the right to
change the Company's control of Qualex, and Kodak, in fact, did not exercise
this right on March 1, 1992, 1993 or 1994.

Actava consolidates the accounts of Qualex and presents Kodak's portion of
ownership and equity in the income of Qualex as minority interest.

The Qualex Shareholders' Agreement between Actava and Eastman Kodak Company
stipulates that upon a change of control at Actava certain Qualex preferred
stock, including the voting preferred owned by Actava, will be redeemed. On
March 28, 1991, the Qualex Shareholders' Agreement between Actava and Kodak was
amended. The amendment stipulates that a change of control of Actava, as defined
in the Shareholders' Agreement, occurred on February 6, 1991. However, in the
amendment Kodak waived its change of control rights under the Shareholders'
Agreement with respect to the February 6, 1991 change of control. As of March 1,
1992, and each subsequent March 1, Kodak may withdraw its waiver, and enforce
its rights under the Agreement by providing Actava with 30 days written notice.
At March 3, 1994, Kodak had not provided notice to Actava of an election to
withdraw its waiver. The Board of Directors of Qualex was increased from seven
to nine members, comprised of five representatives of Actava, three
representatives of Kodak and the chief executive officer of Qualex, pursuant to
the amendment.

Should Kodak withdraw its waiver or if an additional change in control of
Actava were to occur and if the Qualex preferred stock were redeemed, Actava
would own 50% of the voting securities of Qualex. While Actava's voting stock
would be reduced from 51% to 50%, this change would not alter Actava's and
Kodak's current equal interest in the equity, earnings and cash dividends of
Qualex. In addition, the Board of Directors of Qualex would be composed of 11
members, comprised of five representatives of Actava, five representatives

13

THE ACTAVA GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

of Kodak and the chief executive officer of Qualex, and all actions of the Board
would require the affirmative vote of at least seven board members. In the event
these changes were to occur, Actava may possibly be deemed to no longer control
Qualex and Actava would no longer be in a position unilaterally to control,
among other things, the declaration of dividends to Actava and Kodak by Qualex.

In June 1994, the Company decided to sell its interest in Qualex and
engaged in negotiations with Kodak regarding the sale of such interest.
Accordingly, the results of Qualex for all years presented are reported in the
accompanying restated statements of operations under discontinued operations. In
the second quarter of 1994, the Company provided for an anticipated loss of
$37,858,000 on the sale of its interest in Qualex and the related covenant not
to compete and release. No income tax expenses or benefits were recognized due
to the Company's net operating loss carryforwards and recognition of tax
benefits in prior periods.

On August 12, 1994, Kodak purchased all of the Company's interest in Qualex
and obtained a covenant not to compete and related releases from the Company in
exchange for $50,000,000 in cash and a promissory note in the principal amount
of $100,000,000. The promisory note is payable in installments of $50,000,000
each, without interest, on February 13, 1995 and August 11, 1995. Because the
principal amount due under the note does not bear interest, the Company
discounted the value of the note to $92,832,000 and will record imputed interest
income of $7,168,000 over the term of the note. All amounts received in exchange
for the covenant not to compete and release were included in the computation of
the anticipated loss on sale of Qualex.

The following assets and liabilities of Qualex are included in the
Company's balance sheet at December 31, 1993 and 1992.

ACQUISITIONS

On June 8, 1993, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of
Diversified Products Corporation ("DP") for a net purchase price consisting of
$11,629,500, the issuance of 1,090,909 shares of the Company's Common Stock
valued at $12,000,000, and the assumption or payment of certain liabilities
including trade payables and a revolving credit facility. The Company also
entered into an agreement which may provide the seller the right to additional
payments depending upon the value of the issued shares over a period of not
longer than one year from the purchase date. The issuance of additional payments
of cash since the cost of DP will be increased by the amount of the cash payment
and simultaneously reduced by the same amount due to a corresponding adjustment
to the respective redeemable common stock. This transaction was accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting; accordingly, the purchased assets and
liabilities have been recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of the
acquisition. The purchase price resulted in an excess of costs over net assets
acquired of approximately $11,417,000. The results of operations of the acquired
business have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the
date of acquisition.

The following data represents the combined unaudited operating results of
Actava on a pro forma basis as if the above transaction had taken place at the
beginning of 1992. The pro forma information does not necessarily reflect the
results of operations as they would have been had the transaction actually taken
place at that time. Adjustments include amounts of depreciation to reflect the
fair value and economic lives of property, plant and equipment and amortization
of intangible assets:

During 1992, Qualex acquired Samiljan Foto, L.P. and certain other
photofinishing operations for $21,228,000 and $22,997,000 respectively,
including expenses. For one of the businesses in which Qualex purchased a
majority interest in 1992, the sellers have the right to require Qualex to
purchase the remaining interest, beginning in 1997, at an amount not to exceed
$18,000,000. During 1991, Qualex acquired Guardian

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

Photo Inc. and Phototron Corporation for $73,785,000 and $16,137,000,
respectively, including expenses. In a concurrent transaction with the
acquisition of Phototron Corporation, Actava, Kodak and Qualex settled the
litigation brought against them by Phototron Corporation.

These transactions were accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting, accordingly; the assets and liabilities of the purchased businesses
have been recorded at their estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition.
The purchase price resulted in an excess of costs over net assets acquired of
approximately $23,321,000 and $53,848,000 during 1992 and 1991, respectively, in
addition to $19,215,000 and $30,300,000 attributed to customer lists,
respectively. The results of operations of the businesses acquired have been
included in the consolidated financial statements since the dates of
acquisition.

The following data represents the combined unaudited operating results of
Actava on a pro forma basis as if the 1991 transactions had taken place at the
beginning of 1991. Pro forma information for 1992 acquisitions would not be
significantly different from the results reported. The pro forma information
does not necessarily reflect the results of operations as they would have been
had the transaction actually taken place at that time. Adjustments include
amounts of depreciation to reflect the fair value and economic lives of

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE

Receivables from sales of Actava's lawn and garden products amounted to
$146,994,000 and $157,605,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The
receivables are primarily due from independent distributors located throughout
the United States. Amounts due from distributors are supported by a security
interest in the inventory or accounts receivable of the distributors. The
receivables generally have extended due dates which correspond to the seasonal
nature of the products' retail selling season. Concentrations of credit risk due
to the common business of the customers are limited due to the number of
customers comprising the customer base and their geographic location. Ongoing
credit evaluations of customer's financial condition are performed and reserves
for potential credit losses are maintained. Such losses, in the aggregate, have
not exceeded management's expectations.

Photofinishing sales are made to national, regional and local retailers
located throughout the United States, including mass merchants, grocery store
chains and drug store chains. Photofinishing receivables, which were $70,744,000
and $76,202,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, are unsecured and
generally due within 20 days following the end of each month. Included in
accounts receivable at December 31, 1993 and 1992 are $54,711,000 and
$47,564,000, respectively, due from national retail chains. Of these amounts,
$9,812,000 and $9,465,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, were
receivable from one such customer on net sales of $84,297,000 and $86,611,000,
respectively. The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts equal to
the estimated losses expected to be incurred in the collection of accounts
receivable. Such losses have consistently been within management's expectations.

Receivables from the sale of sporting goods are primarily from mass
merchants and sporting goods retailers located throughout the United States. The
receivables, which are unsecured, were $71,836,000 and

within 30 to 60 days. Of these amounts, $23,362,000, and $4,686,000 are from the
same four highest balance customers for December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively. The companies which comprise the sporting goods group maintain
allowances for potential credit losses and such losses, in the aggregate, have
not exceeded management's expectations.

TRITON GROUP LTD. LOAN

At December 31, 1993, the Company had a $26,726,000 million note receivable
from Triton Group Ltd. secured by 4,413,598 shares of Actava Common Stock. At
December 31, 1992, $31,726,000 was outstanding under the agreement and was
secured by 4,338,598 shares of Actava Common Stock.

Effective June 25, 1993, the Company and Triton modified the terms of the
loan as part of a plan of reorganization filed by Triton under Chapter 11 of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The modifications, which became effective June 25, 1993,
included: extending the due date of the Loan to April 1, 1997; reducing the
interest rate to prime plus 1 1/2% for the first six months following June 25,
1993, to prime plus 2% for the next six months, and to prime plus 2 1/2% for the
remainder of the term of the note; revising collateral maintenance (margin call)
requirements; and providing for release of collateral under certain
circumstances. Under the modified agreements, Actava's right of first refusal
with respect to any sale by Triton of its Actava Common stock will continue in
effect until the loan is paid off. The Stockholder Agreement was amended to
permit Triton to designate two directors (who are not officers or employees of
Triton) on an expanded nine-member Board of Directors so long as Triton
continues to own 20% or more of Actava's outstanding Common Stock.

Triton filed a motion on July 30, 1993, with the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of California seeking to modify Triton's
recently approved Plan of Reorganization. The modifications sought by Triton
would have amended or eliminated the collateral maintenance (margin call)
provisions that are an integral part of the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement.
On August 2, 1993, the Bankruptcy Court entered a temporary restraining order
suspending the effectiveness of the margin call provisions until the Court had
an opportunity to hear Triton's motion seeking preliminary injunction. The
motion seeking a preliminary injunction was heard on August 10, 1993, and was
denied. Triton then withdrew its motion to modify its Plan of Reorganization.
Therefore, the provisions of the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement continue to
remain in effect. On August 19, 1993, the Amended and Restated Loan agreement
was amended to allow Triton to satisfy certain margin call requirements by
making deposits to a Collateral Deposit Account in lieu of delivering
certificates of deposit. The margin call provisions for principal repayments and
transfers of shares of Company Common Stock were not amended. On December 7,
1993, the Amended and Restated Loan Agreement was amended, in connection with a
$5,000,000 prepayment of principal received on December 7, 1993, to provide for
quarterly principal payment installments of $1,250,000 due on the last day of
each quarter of each year beginning March 31, 1994, with any unpaid principal
and accrued interest due on April 1, 1997. The Agreement was also amended to
require 75,000 additional shares of Actava Common Stock to be pledged as
collateral and to modify the margin call provisions of the Agreement to provide
a $7.50 minimum per share value of Actava Common Stock for purposes of
determining the amount of any margin call mandatory payments. These
modifications limit the circumstances under which Triton must pledge additional
collateral for the loan; however, the 4,413,598 shares of Actava Common Stock
owned by Triton will continue to be pledged to secure the loan until the loan is
paid in full. At March 3, 1994, the pledged shares had a market value of
$30,895,000 as compared to the loan balance of $26,726,000. In the opinion of
management, the shares held as collateral are, and will continue to be,
sufficient to provide for realization of the loan.

During 1991, certain inventory quantities were reduced resulting in a
liquidation of LIFO inventory quantities which were carried at lower costs
prevailing in prior years as compared with the cost of current year purchases.
The utilization of this lower cost inventory decreased net loss by approximately
$1,487,000 and decreased loss per share of common stock by $.09.

NOTES PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM DEBT

Qualex has three separate line of credit agreements for working capital
needs. These agreements are $5,000,000 each, for a total of $15,000,000. The
Company pays a facility fee of 1/4% per annum on the committed line of credit
agreements. At December 31, 1993, $3,200,000 was outstanding under these
agreements while no amounts were outstanding at December 31, 1992.

Included in Notes Payable at December 31, 1993 and 1992 is $87,359,000 and
$58,243,000, respectively, which was outstanding under a three year Finance and
Security Agreement which provides working capital to the Snapper division. The
Agreement, dated October 23, 1992, is for $75,000,000 (and may be increased
under certain circumstances up to $100,000,000 for a specified period of time).
Interest is payable at the prime rate plus 3/4% to 1 1/4%, depending upon the
prime rate in effect. The Agreement provides for the payment of an annual line
fee of $487,500 which is subject to increases in certain circumstances. The loan
is principally secured by Snapper assets and certain inventory of Snapper and
requires Actava to comply with various restrictive financial covenants. The
assets which serve as collateral are determined by reference to the outstanding
balance under the credit agreement and the qualification of the assets as
collateral is defined in the credit agreement; however, the assets potentially
available as collateral are, in the aggregate, $173,068,000. As of March 29,
1994, effective as of December 31, 1993, various provisions of the Agreement,
including the financial covenants, were amended.

During 1992, in order to provide additional working capital and for general
corporate purposes, an Actava Sports subsidiary entered into a three year Loan
and Security Agreement with a financial institution to provide up to $35,000,000
of working capital. Interest is payable at the prime rate plus 1 1/4%. The
Agreement provides for a facility fee of $350,000. The loan is principally
secured by certain receivables and inventory of the subsidiary and requires the
subsidiary to comply with various restrictive financial covenants. The assets
which serve as collateral are determined by reference to the outstanding balance
under the credit agreement and the qualification of the assets as collateral is
defined in the credit agreement; however, the assets potentially available as

$6,500,000 for working capital. Interest is payable at the prime rate of the
financial institution. The loan is unsecured and requires the subsidiary to
comply with various restrictive financial covenants. In August, 1993, the
agreement was amended to increase the facility limit to $8,000,000 for a
six-month period beginning

In April 1993, a Revolving Loan and Security Agreement with respect to a
revolving credit facility of up to $10,000,000 was entered into by an Actava
Sports subsidiary. Interest is payable at the prime rate plus 1%. The agreement
provides for a facility fee of $25,000. The loan is principally secured by

In December 1993, an Actava Sports subsidiary, DP, entered into a Finance
and Security Agreement with two financial institutions in order to provide up to
$50,000,000 of working capital under a revolving credit facility. The agreement
is secured by certain receivables, inventories, property, plant and equipment,
and intangibles, as well as DP's issued and outstanding common stock and
requires compliance with various restrictive financial covenants. The assets
which serve as collateral are determined by reference to the outstanding balance
under the credit agreement and the qualification of the assets as collateral is
defined in the credit agreement; however, the assets potentially available as
collateral are, in the aggregate, $109,000,000. As of March 29, 1994, effective

$70,000,000 and $70,000,000, respectively, with interest rates of 7.99%, 8.45%
and 8.84%, respectively.

During 1992, Qualex entered into an unsecured $115,000,000 Revolving Credit
Agreement with eight financial institutions which will expire in May 1995.
Interest is payable under three rate options which are determined by reference
to the prime rate, the London interbank offered rate plus 1/2% to 3/4%, and
competitive bids. The Agreement provides for a participation fee of 1/8% and an
annual facility fee of 1/4%. At December 31, 1993, $10,000,000 was outstanding
under the agreement while no amounts were outstanding at December 31, 1992.

The Qualex Credit Agreement and the Shareholders' Agreement with Eastman
Kodak Company restrict the amount of net assets of Qualex which may be
transferred to Actava by dividend or other means. At December 31, 1993,
approximately $166,000,000 of the $194,000,000 representing Actava's share of
the net assets of Qualex was restricted under the terms of these agreements.

Collateral for certain of the long-term debt includes real property. Assets
pledged as collateral under the borrowings are not material. Maturities of
long-term and subordinated debt are $15,142,000 in 1995, $35,172,000 in 1996,
$75,783,000 in 1997 and $59,121,000 in 1998.

The fair value of Actava's long-term and subordinated debt, including the
current portion, at December 31, 1993 is estimated to be approximately
$445,000,000 and was estimated at $425,000,000 at December 31, 1992. This
estimate is based on a discounted cash flow analysis using Actava's current
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of agreements and on quoted market
prices for issues which are traded. Actava does not anticipate settlement of
long-term debt at fair value and currently does not intend to pay the debt prior
to maturity.

In 1986 Actava issued 6% Senior Subordinated Swiss Franc Bonds due 1996 for
100,000,000 Swiss francs. Simultaneously, in order to eliminate exposure to
fluctuations in the currency exchange rate over the life of the bonds, Actava
entered into a currency swap agreement with a financial institution whereby
Actava received approximately $48,000,000 in exchange for the Swiss Franc Bond
proceeds. As a result of the swap agreement, Actava will, in effect, make its
interest and principal bond repayments in U.S. dollars without regard for
changes in the currency exchange rate. A default by the counterparty to the swap
agreement would expose Actava to potential currency exchange risk on the
remaining bond interest and principal payments in that Actava would be required
to purchase Swiss francs at current exchange rates rather than at the swap
agreement exchange rate. The amount of this potential risk cannot be currently
calculated as the principal and interest payments will be made in future years
and alternative swap agreements could be entered into by Actava. At December 31,
1993, the swap agreement has an effective exchange rate over its remaining term
of .5459 Swiss francs per U.S. dollar while the U.S. dollar equivalent market
exchange rate was .6734. After considering the stated interest rate, the cost of
the currency swap agreement, taxes and underwriting commissions, the effective
cost of the bonds is approximately 11.3%. The fair value of the currency swap as
of December 31, 1993 and 1992, was $10,795,000 and $7,242,000, respectively;
however, this is subject to change as domestic interest rates and foreign
currency markets are determining factors.

Actava, at its option, may redeem the Senior Subordinated Swiss Franc Bonds
at 101.0% plus accrued interest for one year subsequent to March 6, 1994 and at
decreasing amounts thereafter. The Bonds include a covenant which restricts the
amount of stockholders' equity available for cash dividends and the cash
redemption of capital stock. At December 31, 1993, $3,412,000 was available for
these purposes pursuant to this covenant.

In 1987 Actava issued $75,000,000 of 6 1/2% Convertible Subordinated
Debentures due in 2002 in the Euro-dollar market. The Debentures are convertible
into Actava's Common Stock at a conversion price of

21

THE ACTAVA GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

41 5/8 per share. At Actava's option the Debentures may be redeemed at 101% plus
accrued interest prior to August 4, 1994 and at 100% thereafter.

The 9 7/8% Senior Subordinated Debentures are redeemable at the option of
Actava at 101.555% of the principal amount plus accrued interest if redeemed
prior to March 15, 1994, and at decreasing prices thereafter. Mandatory sinking
fund payments of $3,000,000 (which Actava may increase to $6,000,000 annually)
began in 1982 and are intended to retire, at par plus accrued interest, 75% of
the issue prior to maturity.

At the option of Actava, the 10% Subordinated Debentures are redeemable, in
whole or in part, at the principal amount plus accrued interest. Sinking fund
payments of 10% of the outstanding principal amount commenced in 1989; however,
Actava receives credit for Debentures redeemed or otherwise acquired in excess
of sinking fund payments.

REDEEMABLE COMMON STOCK

Redeemable common stock represents 1,090,909 shares of common stock which
were issued in the acquisition of substantially all the assets and liabilities
of Diversified Products Corporation. These shares are subject to a right of
redemption at the option of the holder with an exercise date, as amended on
August 17, 1994, of February 7, 1995.

Preferred and Preference Stock

There are 5,000,000 authorized shares of Preferred Stock and 1,000,000

There were 591,550 and 696,300 shares under Actava's stock option plans at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, which were available for the granting
of additional stock options.

PROVISIONS FOR PLANT CLOSURE COSTS

The 1993 and 1991 income from discontinued operations includes $1,038,000
and $5,196,000 ($4,096,000 and $17,037,000, respectively, before income taxes
and minority interest for discontinued operations) or $.06 and $.31 per share
for the costs of closing 3 and 12, respectively of Qualex's photofinishing
plants. The provision for plant closure for Qualex included in income from
discontinued operations includes lease termination costs and fixed asset and
facility closure costs which may be incurred over several years based on the
remaining terms of the leases and employee severance and termination costs.

The reserve for closing certain lawn and garden facilities was established
in 1990 by a provision for plant closure of approximately $13,700,000. Lawn and
garden production at these facilities ceased in early 1991, however, inventory
previously produced at these sites continued to be distributed from these sites
until 1992. Costs associated with this warehouse and distribution function were
included in costs of sales in 1992 and 1991 and were immaterial. Due to market
conditions and the size of these lawn and garden facilities, the Company
estimated in 1990 that it would require approximately three years to dispose of
these facilities and in 1993 this was accomplished. During 1993, 1992 and 1991,
costs of approximately $3,400,000, $2,100,000 and $4,280,000 respectively were
incurred related to employee severance, plant maintenance, interest on
capitalized lease obligations and the loss on disposal of equipment and
buildings. In 1993, the provision for plant

23

THE ACTAVA GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

closure costs includes reductions of $849,000, before and after tax, of $.05 per
share, to the reserve for closing the lawn and garden facilities as this
disposal was completed.

The 1991 provision for plant closure costs also includes $500,000 before
tax ($315,000 net of tax or $.02 per share) for closing facilities at a sporting
goods subsidiary and $1,432,000 before tax ($945,000 net of tax or $.06 per
share) for reducing the Actava corporate office facilities. The costs related to
the planned reduction of corporate office facilities were estimated in 1991 when
management made the decision to move out of its corporate office. The Company
subleased a portion of its space in 1991 and utilized $300,000 of the original
reserve. However, in 1992, it became apparent that the remaining space could not
be subleased as anticipated in 1991 and the Company decided to reverse its
remaining reserve of approximately $1,100,000 through the provision for plant
closure costs and utilize its remaining space until the lease expires in 1995.

Changes in the reserve for plant closure costs were as follows:

PENSION PLANS

Actava and its subsidiaries have several noncontributory defined benefit
and other pension plans which are "qualified" under federal tax law and cover
substantially all employees. In addition Actava has a "nonqualified"
supplemental retirement plan which provides for the payment of benefits to
certain employees in excess of those payable by the qualified plans. Benefits
under the qualified and nonqualified plans are based upon the employee's years
of service and level of compensation. Actava's funding policy for the qualified
plans is to contribute annually such amounts as are necessary to provide assets
sufficient to meet the benefits to be paid to the plans' members and to keep the
plans actuarially sound. Contributions are intended to provide not only for
benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned
in the future.

The components of net periodic pension costs are as follows:

defined benefit plans as of December 31, 1993. The change in discount rates from
8.4% for 1992 to 7.2% for 1993 increased projected benefit obligations by
approximately 12%.

of their employees. Contributions from continuing operations of approximately
$400,000 in 1993, $800,000 in 1992, and $200,000 in 1991 were made to these
plans.

1992 and 1991, respectively.

Certain noncancelable leases have renewal options for up to 10 years, and
generally, related real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance expenses are
obligations of Actava. Certain leases have escalation clauses which provide for
increases in annual rentals in certain circumstances.

LITIGATION

On February 18, 1994, Photographic Concepts Inc. ("PCI"), a Florida
corporation, sued Qualex in the United States District Court for the Middle
District of North Carolina, in a lawsuit captioned Photographic Concepts, Inc.
v. Qualex, Inc., Civil Action No. 1:94-CV-00081. PCI's claims arise out of
allegations that Qualex entered into and then breached an agreement with PCI
relating to the marketing of on-site "microlab" photofinishing services. During
1993, Qualex's microlab business resulted in $33,300,000 in revenues and
$7,300,000 in gross profits, and Qualex expects such business to increase in the
future. PCI alleges, among other things, that Qualex breached agreement with
PCI, and misappropriated trade property and other information from PCI. PCI is
seeking an injunction against Qualex's alleged use and misappropriation of PCI's
allegedly confidential and proprietary trade methods and techniques, an
accounting for and payment over to PCI of Qualex's profits from such alleged use
and misappropriation, unspecified consequential and punitive damages and
attorneys' fees and other costs of litigation. Qualex is currently gathering the
information and documents necessary to file its response to PCI's Complaint.
That response must be filed by April 25, 1994. Qualex intends to defend the case
vigorously, but the Company is unable to determine the probable impact of the
suit at this early stage in the proceeding.

In 1991, three lawsuits were filed against Actava, certain of Actava's
current and former directors and Intermark, Inc., which owned approximately 26%
of Actava's Common Stock. One complaint alleged, among other things, a
long-standing pattern and practice by the defendants of misusing and abusing
their power as directors and insiders of Actava by manipulating the affairs of
Actava to the detriment of Actava's past and present stockholders. The complaint
sought monetary damages from the director defendants, injunctive relief against
Actava, Intermark and its current directors, and costs of suit and attorney's
fees. The other two complaints alleged, among other things that members of the
Actava Board of Directors contemplate either a sale, a merger, or other business
combination involving Intermark, Inc. and Actava or one or more of its

30
<PAGE> 32

THE ACTAVA GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

subsidiaries or affiliates. The complaints sought costs of suit and attorney's
fees and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies, ordering the director defendants to carry out their fiduciary duties
and to take all appropriate steps to enhance Actava's value as a
merger/acquisition candidate. These three suits were consolidated on May 1,
1991. While these actions are in their preliminary stages, management currently
believes the actions will not materially affect the operations or financial
position of Actava.

On November 30, 1993, a lawsuit was filed by the Department of Justice
("DOJ") against American Seating Company ("American Seating"), a former
subsidiary of Actava, in the United States District Court for the Western
District of Michigan. The lawsuit is captioned United States v. American Seating
Co., Civil Action No. 1:93-CV-956. Pursuant to an asset purchase agreement
between Actava and Amseco Acquisition, Inc., dated July 15, 1987, Actava assumed
the obligation for certain liabilities incurred by American Seating arising out
of litigation or other disputes, involving events occurring on or before June
22, 1987. The DOJ alleges among other things that American Seating failed to
disclose certain information relating to its price discount practices that it
contends was required in an offer submitted by American Seating to the General
Services Administration for possible contracts for sales of systems furniture
and related services. The complaint seeks recovery of unspecified single and
treble damages, penalties, costs and prejudgment and post-judgment interest. The
parties have engaged in settlement discussions but not have agreed on a
disposition of the case. A trial, if necessary, has been scheduled for June
1995. The DOJ has asserted damages of approximately $3.5 million. If such
damages were awarded and then trebled, the total damages, excluding penalties,
costs and interest, could exceed $10 million. In addition, penalties, if
assessed, could range from several thousand dollars to several million dollars.
As a result, the lawsuit could have a material effect on the results of
operations and financial condition of the Company. Management, however, believes
that American Seating has meritorious defenses to the allegations made by the
DOJ and does not expect the Company to incur any material liability as a result
of this suit.

Actava is a defendant in various other legal proceedings. However, Actava
is not aware of any action which, in the opinion of management, would materially
affect the financial position or results of operations of Actava.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS

Actava, on behalf of its Snapper division, has an agreement with a
financial institution which makes available to dealers floor plan financing for
Snapper products. This agreement provides financing for dealer inventories and
accelerates cash flow to Snapper's distributors and to Snapper. Under the terms
of the agreement, a default in payment by one of the dealers on the program is
non-recourse to both the distributor and to Snapper. However, the distributor is
obligated to repurchase any equipment recovered from the dealer and Snapper is
obligated to repurchase the recovered equipment if the distributor defaults. At
December 31, 1993 and 1992, there was approximately $23,000,000 and $20,000,000,
respectively, outstanding under these floor plan financing arrangements.

Actava is contingently liable under various guarantees of debt totaling
approximately $8,600,000. The debt is primarily Industrial Revenue Bonds which
were issued by former subsidiaries to finance their manufacturing facilities and
equipment, and is secured by the facilities and equipment. In addition, upon the
sale of the subsidiaries, Actava received lending institution guarantees or bank
letters of credit to support Actava's contingent obligations. There are no
material defaults on the debt agreements.

Actava is contingently liable under various real estate leases of former
subsidiaries. The total future payments under these leases, including real
estate taxes, is estimated to be approximately $9,100,000. The leased properties
generally have financially sound subleases.

THE ACTAVA GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

In January 1992, Qualex entered into an agreement with a bank whereby it
sells an undivided interest in a designated pool of trade accounts receivable on
an ongoing basis. The receivables are discounted at the commercial paper rate.
At December 31, 1993 this rate was 3.42%. In addition, the bank charges Qualex a
program fee of .425% of the balance outstanding at the end of each month.

The maximum allowable amount of receivables to be sold, initially set at
$50,000,000, was increased to $75,000,000 in August 1992. Qualex continued to
service the receivables at no charge to the purchaser since any servicing cost
would be negligible due to the nature of the receivables, e.g., short-term
(generally collected in 45 days based on invoice terms). As collections reduce
the pool of sold accounts receivable, Qualex sells participating interest in new
receivables to bring the amount sold up to the desired level. At December 31,
1993 and 1992, the uncollected balance of receivables sold amounted to
$60,000,000 and $30,000,000, respectively. The proceeds are reported as cash
flows from discontinued operations in the statement of cash flows and a
reduction of receivables in Qualex's balance sheet. Total proceeds received by
Qualex during the year were $519,000,000 for 1993 and $220,000,000 for 1992. The
allowance for doubtful accounts for Qualex includes a reserve for losses on
receivables sold with recourse pursuant to this agreement which was recorded at
the time of sale. During 1993 and 1992, Qualex recorded expense of $2,200,000
and $1,100,000, respectively, which represents the discount and fees charged on
these sales included in income from discontinued operations. No other gains or
losses are recorded on the sale of these receivables.

Qualex has a supply contract with Kodak for the purchase of sensitized
photographic paper and purchases substantially all of the chemicals used in
photoprocessing from Kodak. Qualex also purchases various other production
materials and equipment from Kodak.

Qualex and DP handle and store various materials in the normal course of
business that have been classified as hazardous by various federal, state and
local regulatory agencies. As of December 31, 1993, Qualex and DP are continuing
to conduct tests at various sites and will perform any necessary cleanup where
and to the extent legally required. At those sites where tests have been
completed, cleanup costs have been immaterial. The Company may also be liable
for remediation of environmental damage relating to businesses previously sold
in excess of amounts accrued. At the sites currently being tested, it is
management's opinion that cleanup costs will not have a material effect on
Actava's financial position or results of operations.

In January 1993, Qualex signed a ten year agreement to purchase its
information systems services from an outside agency. Annual service charges
under this agreement are approximately $13,000,000.

At December 31, 1993, approximately $5,000,000 of Actava's cash and
short-term investments were pledged to secure a Snapper credit line and
approximately $20,700,000 of cash and short-term investments were pledged to
support outstanding letters of credit.

(a) Actava's lawn and garden division estimates certain sales related expenses
for the year and charges these expenses to income based upon estimated sales
for the year. Sales and expenses for 1993 were different than estimated in
the first three quarters. If the expenses had been charged to income based
upon actual sales for the year, net loss would have increased in the first
and second quarter by $4,500,000 and $7,450,000, respectively, and decreased
in the third and fourth quarters by $1,750,000 and $10,200,000,

respectively. Sales and expenses for the year were also different in 1992
than estimated in the first three quarters. If the expenses had been charged
to income based upon actual sales for the year, net income would have
increased in the first and third quarters by $3,500,000 and $700,000,
respectively, and decreased in the fourth quarter by $4,200,000.
(b) Effective January 1, 1992, Qualex changed its method of accounting for the
cost of its proof advertising program to recognize these costs at the time
the advertising is placed by the customer. Under the proof advertising
program, Qualex reimburses certain advertising costs incurred by its
customers up to a percentage of sales to that customer. Qualex previously
accrued such costs at the time of the initial sale. Qualex believes that
this new method is preferable because it recognizes advertising expense as
it is incurred rather than at the time of the initial sale to the customer.
Information for the first quarter of 1992, as previously reported, differs
from the above amounts as a result of this change. The effects of this
change do not have a significant effect on the other quarters.
(c) Effective January 1, 1993, Actava adopted FASB Statement No. 106,
"Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions". Actava and its
subsidiaries provide group medical plans and life insurance coverage for
certain employees subsequent to retirement. In prior years, these benefits
had been charged to operations on a pay-as-you-go (cash) basis; effective as
of 1993 they are charged to operations on an accrual basis. Information for
the first quarter of 1993, as previously reported, differs from the above
amounts because the cumulative effect was originally reported net-of-tax.
(d) During the fourth quarter of 1993, Actava's lawn and garden division revised
its estimate of accrued product warranty expense to reflect an increase in
the amount of future warranty cost to be incurred due to increased warranty
claims. This change in accounting estimate resulted in an increase in the
net loss for the fourth quarter of approximately $4,000,000.
(e) During the fourth quarter of 1993, Actava increased its valuation allowance
for an investment in a real estate development from $1,425,000 to
$4,425,000, due to an accelerated plan for disposition. This change in
estimate resulted in an increase in the net loss for the fourth quarter of
approximately $3,000,000.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not
include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of
financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. In the opinion of management, such
financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of
the results of operations and financial position for the interim periods
presented. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Operating
results for the three months ended March 31, 1994 are not necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 1994.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

Change in Method of Accounting for Income Taxes

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 109,
"Accounting for Income Taxes". Under Statement 109, the liability method is used
in accounting for income taxes: deferred tax assets and liabilities are
determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of
assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws
that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Prior to
the adoption of Statement 109, income tax expense was determined using the
deferred method: deferred tax expense was based on items of income and expense
that were reported in different years in the financial statements and tax
returns and were measured at the tax rate in effect in the year the difference
originated.

As permitted by Statement 109, the Company has elected not to restate the
financial statements of any prior years. The presentation of some items, such as
depreciation, has changed; however, the cumulative effect of the change in
accounting principle on pre-tax income from continuing operations, net income,
and the effective tax rate was not material.

Change in Method of Accounting for Postretirement Benefits

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted FASB Statement No. 106,
"Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions". The Company and
its subsidiaries provide group medical plans and life insurance coverage for
certain employees subsequent to retirement. The plans have been funded on a
pay-as-you-go (cash) basis. The plans are contributory, with retiree
contributions adjusted annually, and contain other cost-sharing features such as
deductibles, coinsurance and life-time maximums. The plan accounting anticipates
future cost-sharing changes that are consistent with the Company's expressed
intent to increase the retiree contribution rate annually for the expected
medical trend rate for that year. The coordination of benefits with medicare
uses a supplemental, or exclusion of benefits, approach.

As permitted by Statement 106, the Company elected to immediately recognize
the effect in the statement of operations for the first quarter of 1993 as a
$4,404,000 charge to net income as the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle. The annual net periodic postretirement benefit expense for
1993 decreased by $38,000 as a result of adopting the new rules. The annual net
periodic postretirement benefit expense for 1994 will be $240,000. The assumed
health care cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of benefits by the
plan for 1993 was 14%, with 1% decrements to 6% in 2001 and years thereafter. A
7% discount rate per year, compounded annually, was assumed to measure the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 1993. A 1%
increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would increase the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 1993, by 16%
and the net periodic postretirement benefit cost by 18%.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

Change in Method of Accounting for Postemployment Benefits

Effective January 1, 1994, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits." The Company and its subsidiaries provide benefits to former or
inactive employees after employment but before retirement such as severance
benefits, disability-related benefits (including workers' compensation), and
continuation of health care benefits and life insurance coverage. The cumulative
effect as of January 1, 1994, of this change in accounting was not material.
Prior to January 1, 1994, the Company recognized the cost of providing some
postemployment benefits on a cash basis while substantially all other
postemployment benefits were accounted for in the Company's self-insurance
program. Under the new method of accounting, the Company will accrue benefits
when it becomes probable that such benefits will be paid and when sufficient
information exists to make reasonable estimates of the amounts to be paid. As
required by the Statement, prior year financial statements have not been
restated to reflect the change in accounting method.

Change in Method of Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities

The Company and its subsidiaries invest in various debt and equity
securities. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities", which requires certain debt securities to be
reported at amortized cost, certain debt and equity securities to be reported at
market with current recognition of unrealized gains and losses, and certain debt
and equity securities to be reported at market with unrealized gains and losses
as a separate component of shareholders' equity. The Company adopted the
provisions of the new standard for investments held as of or acquired after
January 1, 1994. In accordance with the Statement, prior period financial
statements have not been restated to reflect the change in accounting principle.
The cumulative effect as of January 1, 1994, of adopting Statement 115 was not
material.

REDEEMABLE COMMON STOCK

Redeemable common stock represents 1,090,909 shares of common stock which
were issued in the acquisition of substantially all the assets and liabilities
of Diversified Products Corporation. These shares are subject to a right of
redemption at the option of the holder with an exercise date of February 17,
1995.

SALE OF SPORTS GROUP

On July 20, 1994 the Company entered into a definitive agreement with
Roadmaster Industries, Inc. (Roadmaster) to combine the Company's four sports
companies with Roadmaster in exchange for common stock of Roadmaster which would
represent an approximate 39% ownership interest in Roadmaster.

QUALEX INC. -- DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Qualex, Inc. is a photofinishing business formed in March 1988 by the
combination of Actava's photofinishing operations with the domestic
photofinishing operations of Eastman Kodak Company. Prior to June 30, 1994,
Actava owned 51% of the voting stock of Qualex, was entitled to and elected a
majority of the members of the Board of Directors of Qualex, and had the ability
through its control of the Board of Directors to declare dividends, remove the
executive officers of Qualex and otherwise direct the management and policies of
Qualex, except for policies relating to certain designated actions requiring the
consent of at least one member of the Board of Directors of Qualex designated by
Kodak. Because of these rights, the Company believes that it has effective
unilateral control of Qualex which was not temporary during the period from 1988
until the second quarter of 1994. As a result, the Company consolidated the
results of operations of Qualex with the results of operations of the Company
for periods ending prior to June 30, 1994.

THE ACTAVA GROUP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

Upon the formation of Qualex in 1988, the Company and Kodak entered into a
Shareholders Agreement (the "Qualex Shareholders Agreement") that provided,
among other things, for a reduction in the Company's voting control of Qualex
from 51% to 50% and for changes in the composition of the Board of Directors of
Qualex in the event of a "change of control" of the Company. The Qualex
Shareholders Agreement defined the term "change in control" to include a
"transaction or occurrence the effect of which is to give a person or group of
affiliated persons or entities the power to direct the management and policies"
of the Company. In 1991, Charles R. Scott was elected President and Chief
Executive Officer of the Company. At the time of his election, Mr. Scott was
also serving as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of a company that owned
approximately 25% of the Company's voting stock and was the Company's single
largest stockholder. Because Mr. Scott was serving at the same time as the chief
executive officer of both the Company and the Company's single largest
stockholder, the Company and Kodak agreed that a "change in control" of the
Company had occurred for purposes of the Qualex Shareholders Agreement. Despite
this "change in control" of the Company, Kodak agreed that the Company would
continue to own 51% of the voting control of Qualex and to elect a majority of
the directors of Qualex. The Qualex Shareholders Agreement, however, was amended
to provide that Kodak had the right to change the Company's control of Qualex on
March 1, 1992 or on any subsequent March 1. During the period from 1991 until
the second quarter of 1994, the Company did not believe that Kodak would
exercise the right to change the Company's control of Qualex, and Kodak, in
fact, did not exercise this right on March 1, 1992, 1993 or 1994.

Mr. Phillips was elected as President and Chief Executive Officer of the
Company on April 19, 1994. The Company did not believe that the election of Mr.
Phillips constituted a "change in control" of the Company as defined in the
Qualex Shareholders Agreement. This belief was based in part on the fact that
(i) Mr. Phillips beneficially owned less than 4% of the Company's voting stock
at the time of his election, (ii) Delaware corporate law, under which the
Company is governed, provides that the business and affairs of a corporation
shall be managed by and under the direction of the board of directors -- not the
president, and (iii) eight of the nine members of the Board of Directors of the
Company after the election of Mr. Phillips were serving as directors before the
election of Mr. Phillips. Kodak informed the Company that it believed that the
election of Mr. Phillips constituted "change in control" of the Company under
the Qualex Shareholders Agreement and requested that changes be made in the
Company's voting control of Qualex and in the composition of the Board of
Directors of Qualex. The disagreement between the Company and Kodak as to
whether or not a "change in control" had occurred was resolved on June 8, 1994
when the Company agreed that it would not contest Kodak's interpretation of the
Qualex Shareholders Agreement. As a result, on June 30, 1994, the Company's
ownership of the voting stock of Qualex was reduced to 50% and the Company and
Kodak each became entitled to elect an equal number of members of the Board of
Directors of Qualex. Because of these changes affecting the Company's control of
Qualex, the Company discontinued its practice of consolidating the accounts of
Qualex and began accounting for its ownership in Qualex under the equity method
effective as of June 30, 1994.

In June 1994, the Company decided to sell its interest in Qualex and
engaged in negotiations with Kodak regarding the sale of such interest.
Accordingly, the results of Qualex for all years presented are reported in the
accompanying statements of operations under discontinued operations. In the
second quarter of 1994, the Company provided for an anticipated loss of
$37,858,000 on the sale of its interest in Qualex and the related covenant not
to compete and release. No income tax expenses or benefits were recognized due
to the Company's net operating loss carryforwards and recognition of tax
benefits in prior periods.

On August 12, 1994, Kodak purchased all of the Company's interest in Qualex
and obtained a covenant not to compete and related releases from the Company in
exchange for $50,000,000 in cash and a promissory note in the principal amount
of $100,000,000. The promissory note is payable in installments of $50,000,000
each, without interest, on February 13, 1995 and August 11, 1995. Because the
principal amount due under the note does not bear interest, the Company
discounted the value of the note to $92,832,000 and will record imputed interest
income of $7,168,000 over the term of the note. All amounts received in exchange
for the covenant not to compete and release were included in the computation of
the anticipated loss on sale of Qualex.

The results of operations of Qualex have been reclassified from income from
continuing operations to income from discontinued operations and are as follows:

ACQUISITIONS

On June 8, 1993, the Company acquired substantially all the assets of
Diversified Products Corporation ("DP") for a net purchase price consisting of
$11,629,500, the issuance of 1,090,909 shares of the Company's Common Stock
valued at $12,000,000, and the assumption or payment of certain liabilities
including trade payables and a revolving credit facility. The Company also
entered into an agreement which obligated the Company under certain conditions,
all of which have been satisfied, to repurchase the shares of Common Stock
issued in the acquisition for $12,000,000 at the option of the holder of such
shares. SEE "REDEEMABLE COMMON STOCK" in Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements. The repurchase of such shares will not increase the Company's
investment in DP since the cost of DP will be increased by the amount of the
cash payment and simultaneously reduced by the same amount due to a
corresponding adjustment to the respective redeemable common stock. This
transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting;
accordingly, the purchased assets and liabilities have been recorded at their
estimated fair value at the date of the acquisition. The purchase price resulted
in an excess of costs over net assets acquired of approximately $11,417,000. The
results of operations of the acquired business have been included in the

Early payment interest credit expense results from cash payments received
by Snapper from distributors prior to receivable due dates which reduce accrued
interest and increase miscellaneous (expense). The early payment interest credit
expense was $1,163,000 and $1,140,000 for the three month periods ended March
31, 1994 and 1993, respectively

INCOME TAXES

loss adjusted for permanent differences between book and taxable income or loss.
The Company's businesses may have an annual effective tax rate which is above or
below statutory rates depending upon the amount of earnings from any short-term

tax advantaged investments and other items. For the three month period ended
March 31, 1994, the Company's consolidated effective tax rate has decreased as
compared to the same prior period because the Company is not able to recognize a
tax benefit for its losses due to limitations from prior period recognition.

During the year, the Company provides for income taxes using anticipated
effective annual tax rates for all Company operations. The rates are based on
expected operating results for the year, estimated permanent differences between
book and tax income, and estimated utilization of any net operating loss
carryovers.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes as required by FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes" (See "Changes in Accounting Principles -- Change in Method of Accounting
for Income Taxes"). The adoption of Statement No. 109 did not have a material
effect on net income and the Company's effective tax rate.

LITIGATION

In 1991, three lawsuits were filed against the Company, certain of the
Company's current and former directors and Intermark, Inc., which owned
approximately 26% of the Company's Common Stock. One complaint alleged, among
other things, a long-standing pattern and practice by the defendants of misusing
and abusing their power as directors and insiders of the Company by manipulating
the affairs of the Company to the detriment of the Company's past and present
stockholders. The complaint sought monetary damages from the director
defendants, injunctive relief against the Company, Intermark and its current
directors, and costs of suit and attorneys' fees. The other two complaints
alleged, among other things, that members of the Company's Board of Directors
contemplate either a sale, a merger, or other business combination involving
Intermark and the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries or affiliates. The
complaints sought costs of suit and attorneys' fees and preliminary and
permanent injunctive relief and other equitable remedies, ordering the director
defendants to carry out their fiduciary duties and to take all appropriate steps
to enhance the Company's value as a merger/acquisition candidate. These three
suits were consolidated on May 1, 1991. While these actions are in their
preliminary stages, management currently believes the actions will not
materially affect the results of operations, financial position or liquidity of
the Company.

On November 30, 1993, a lawsuit was filed by the Department of Justice
("DOJ") against American Seating Company ("American Seating"), a former
subsidiary of Actava, in the United States District Court for the Western
District of Michigan. The lawsuit is captioned United States v. American Seating
Co., Civil Action No. 1:93-CV-956. Pursuant to an asset purchase agreement
between Actava and Amseco Acquisition, Inc., dated July 5, 1987, Actava assumed
the obligation for certain liabilities incurred by American Seating arising out
of litigation or other disputes, involving events occurring on or before June
22, 1987. The DOJ alleges among other things that American Seating failed to
disclose certain information relating to its price discount practices that it
contends was required in an offer submitted by American Seating to the General
Services Administration for possible contracts for sales of systems furniture
and related services. The complaint seeks recovery of unspecified single and
treble damages, penalties, costs and prejudgment and post-judgment interest. The
parties have engaged in settlement discussions but have not agreed on a
disposition of the case. A trial, if necessary, has been scheduled for June
1995. The DOJ has asserted damages of approximately $3,500,000. If such damages
were awarded and then trebled, the total damages, excluding penalties, costs and
interest, could exceed $10,000,000. In addition, penalties, if assessed, could
range from several thousand dollars to several million dollars. As a result, the
lawsuit could have a material effect on the results of operations and financial
condition of the Company. Management, however, believes that American Seating
has meritorious defenses to the allegations made by the DOJ and does not expect
the Company to incur any material liability as a result of this suit.

Actava is a defendant in various other legal proceedings. However, the
Company is not aware of any action which, in the opinion of management, would
materially affect the financial position, results of operations or liquidity of
the Company.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS

Actava, on behalf of its Snapper division, has an agreement with a
financial institution which makes available to dealers floor plan financing for
Snapper products. This agreement provides financing for dealer inventories and
accelerates cash flow to Snapper's distributors and to Snapper. Under the terms
of the agreement, a default in payment by one of the dealers on the program is
non-recourse to both the distributor and to Snapper. However, the distributor is
obligated to repurchase any equipment recovered from the dealer and Snapper is
obligated to repurchase the recovered equipment if the distributor defaults. At
December 31, 1993 and 1992, there was approximately $23,000,000 and $20,000,000,
respectively, outstanding under these floor plan financing arrangements.

Actava is contingently liable under various guarantees of debt totaling
approximately $8,600,000. The debt is primarily Industrial Revenue Bonds which
were issued by former subsidiaries to finance their manufacturing facilities and
equipment, and is secured by the facilities and equipment. In addition, upon the
sale of the subsidiaries, Actava received lending institution guarantees of bank
letters of credit to support Actava's contingent obligations. There are no
material defaults on the debt agreements.

Actava is contingently liable under various real estate leases of former
subsidiaries. The total future payments under these leases, including real
estate taxes, is estimated to be approximately $9,100,000. The leased properties
generally have financially sound subleases.

At March 31, 1994, approximately $5,000,000 of Actava's cash and short-term
investments were pledged to secure a Snapper credit line. At August 12, an
additional $12,000,000 was pledged to secure a letter of credit issued with
regard to the Company's redeemable stock.
