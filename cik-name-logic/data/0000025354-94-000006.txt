ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On April 6, 1994, CPI Corp. issued the following Press Release:

CPI CORP. CONFIRMS FY 1993 PROJECTIONS OF LOWER EARNINGS,
RECORD SALES

- RECONFIRMS EXPECTATION OF HIGHER FY 1994 EARNINGS

St. Louis, MO, April 6, 1994 - CPI Corp. (NYSE - CPY) today
confirmed earlier projections that fiscal 1993 sales reached record
levels, but that earnings declined as expected. For the 52 weeks
ended February 5, 1994, net sales were $475.5 million, 5.8% above
the $449.4 million for the 53 weeks ended February 6, 1993. 
Earnings from continuing operations were $11.1 million versus $22.6
million, while net earnings, including a $2.1 million credit from
an accounting change, were $13.2 million. Earnings per share,
before the $0.14 credit from the accounting change, were $0.76
versus $1.54. Net earnings per share, including the credit, were
$0.90. Weighted average shares outstanding were virtually
unchanged at 14,666,000. 

Commenting on the outlook for the new fiscal year, Alyn V. Essman,
chairman and chief executive officer said, "As indicated in a March
17 letter to shareholders, we believe 1994 will be a better
earnings year than 1993, with earnings per share anticipated to be
in a range of $0.85 to $1.05. We expect a reduction in Portrait
Studio earnings for the first two quarters, followed by a
turnaround in the second half as we begin to realize the benefits
of marketing programs emanating from new technology. We also
anticipate somewhat better results for the year in the
Photofinishing segment and Other Products and Services. We should
repeat, however, that shareholders should be aware that these
projections are subject to the uncertainties of estimating in a
year of rapid change, are dependent on a second half earnings
increase, and cannot be confirmed until we experience the peak
sales period in November and December." 

CPI Corp. is a consumer services company operating over 1,800
retail locations, including 995 Sears Portrait Studios in the U.S.,
Puerto Rico and Canada, 672 CPI/Fox Photo/Proex photofinishing
locations, 103 Prints Plus wall decor locations, and 45 high-tech
copy stores.
