Gentlemen:

We have read Item 4 included in the Form 8-K dated September 29,
1994 of Gibson Greetings, Inc. filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and are in agreement with the statements
contained therein in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3, and the substance of
paragraph 4. Paragraph 4 does not disclose that the Cleo
inventory overstatement resulted from a deliberate attempt by one
or more Cleo personnel to overstate income before income taxes
and included misrepresentations to us by certain Cleo personnel.

Very truly yours,

ARTHUR ANDERSEN LLP
