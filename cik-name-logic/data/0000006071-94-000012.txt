ITEM 5: OTHER EVENTS

Beginning on April 22, 1994, Ames Department Stores, Inc. ("Ames" or 
the "Company") will distribute, to certain of its banks, committed 
lenders, principal trade vendors and factors, summaries of its 
unaudited financial results for the five and nine weeks ended April 
2, 1994. These monthly and year-to-date results (collectively, the 
"monthly results") are attached hereto as Exhibit 20 and are 
incorporated by reference herein. The balance sheet as of April 2, 
1994 is subject to possible debt reclassifications (in addition to 
the $32.9 million already reclassified to current for the Series D 
Notes) depending upon the status of the Company's new long-term 
financing commitment prior to the filing of its Form 10-K for the 
fiscal year ended January 29, 1994. The financing commitment, dated 
April 5, 1994, is subject to customary conditions and is for a 
three-year, $300 million financing facility. Further details of the 
new financing will be released upon final agreement.

Compared with the projections contained in the Form 8-K dated 
February 17, 1994 (referred to herein as the "Plan"), sales for the 
five weeks ended April 2, 1994 were $2.5 million below Plan and 
EBITDA (as defined in Exhibit 20) was $1.2 million worse than Plan. 
In March, the sales shortfall was entirely in hardlines. The 
unfavorable EBITDA variance for March was primarily due to a 
lower-than-planned gross margin rate, partially offset by a gain on 
insurance proceeds of approximately $.7 million. Gross margin 
performance was hurt by higher-than-planned clearance markdowns in 
apparel. The EBIT and net loss for March and for the year-to-date 
period include a non-cash charge of $2.0 million resulting from an 
accrual for the value of unexercised stock appreciation rights. This 
non-cash charge was excluded from EBITDA. This expense was accrued 
because the market price of the Company's common stock as reported on 
NASDAQ appreciated above the exercise price of the stock appreciation 
rights.

Sales for the nine weeks ended April 2, 1994 were $6.1 million below 
Plan; however, EBITDA was $.6 million better than Plan. The 
year-to-date sales shortfall against Plan was primarily due to the 
harsh winter weather in February and certain merchandise shortages 
resulting from the temporary closing of the Company's Leesport, PA 
distribution center. The unfavorable impact on the year-to-date 
EBITDA from the sales shortfall and from the lower gross margin rate 
for March discussed above was more than offset by lower-than-planned 
expenses and gains from the disposition of properties.

As of April 2, 1994, inventories were $7.0 million above Plan, 
principally in hardline categories, primarily due to purchases 
required to replace certain inventories at Leesport. Trade payables 
were $52.2 million above Plan due primarily to the timing of payments 
and inventory shipments, some extended terms, and the Leesport 
reorders (most of which had extended terms). Outstanding borrowings 
under the Company's revolving line of credit as of April 2, 1994 were 
$36.4 million below Plan due, in part, to the above timing factors. 
The Company's unrestricted cash balance at April 2, 1994 was $9.9 
million above Plan due, in part, to the timing of trade payments.

The Company is in compliance with all debt covenants through 
April 2, 1994.

Ames is distributing the monthly results to its banks, committed 
lenders, principal trade vendors and factors to facilitate their 
credit analysis following the Company's emergence from bankruptcy. 
The summary results SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE 
and should be read in conjunction with the Company's Form 10-K for 
the fiscal year ended January 30, 1993, the Company's most recent 
Form 10-Q for the third fiscal quarter ended October 30, 1993, the 
Company's Form 10-K to be filed for the fiscal year ended January 29, 
1994, and the Company's Form 8-K dated February 17, 1994. The 
monthly results are being reported publicly solely because they are 
being distributed to a large number of the Company's vendors for 
purposes of their credit analyses.

During the pendency of its reorganization case, Ames disclosed 
publicly its monthly results through filings with the Office of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee and continued to report publicly its monthly 
results during the fiscal year ended January 29, 1994. Although Ames 
expects to continue to make its monthly results public for the fiscal 
year ending January 28, 1995, Ames does not believe it is obligated 
to provide such information indefinitely, other than as required by 
applicable regulations, and Ames may cease making such disclosures 
and updates at any time. The monthly results were not examined, 
reviewed or compiled by Ames' independent certified accountants. 
Moreover, Ames does not believe that it is obligated to update the 
monthly results to reflect subsequent events or developments. The 
reported monthly results are subject to future adjustments, if any, 
that could materially affect such results. However, in the opinion 
of the Company, the monthly results contain all adjustments 
(consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair 
statement of the results for the periods presented.
