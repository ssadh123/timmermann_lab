REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors
and Shareholders of MascoTech, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of MascoTech,
Inc. and subsidiaries (formerly Masco Industries, Inc.) as of December 31, 1993
and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of income and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of MascoTech, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the consolidated results
of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Principles of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and all majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Corporations that are 20 to 50
percent owned are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. Capital
transactions by equity affiliates at amounts differing from the Company's
carrying amount are reflected in other income or expense and the investment in
affiliates account.

Certain amounts for the years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991 have been
reclassified to conform to the presentation adopted in 1993. The statements of
income and cash flows for 1993, 1992 and 1991 and related notes have been
reclassified to present the Energy-related segment as discontinued operations.
In addition, the balance sheet as of December 31, 1993 reflects the
Energy-related segment as discontinued operations (see "Discontinued Operations"
note). The balance sheet as of December 31, 1992 has not been reclassified for
discontinued operations. Effective June 23, 1993 the Company changed its name to
MascoTech, Inc. from Masco Industries, Inc.

The Company has a corporate services agreement with Masco Corporation,
which at December 31, 1993 owned approximately 42 percent of the Company's
Common Stock. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company pays fees to Masco
Corporation for various corporate staff support and administrative services,
research and development and facilities. Such fees, which are determined
principally as a percentage of net sales, including net sales related to
discontinued operations, aggregated approximately $11 million in each of 1993,
1992 and 1991.

Cash and Cash Investments. The Company considers all highly liquid debt
instruments with an initial maturity of three months or less to be cash and cash
investments. The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash
investments approximates fair value. At December 31, 1993, the Company has $33
million on deposit with a German bank that is subject to currency exchange rate
fluctuations.

Receivables. Receivables are presented net of allowances for doubtful
accounts of $5.1 million and $7.2 million at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
respectively.

Inventories. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable
value, with cost determined principally by use of the first-in, first-out
method.

Property and Equipment, Net. Property and equipment additions, including
significant betterments, are recorded at cost. Upon retirement or disposal of
property and equipment, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from
the accounts, and any gain or loss is included in income. Repair and maintenance
costs are charged to expense as incurred.

Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation is computed principally using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Annual
depreciation rates are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 2 1/2 to 10
percent, and machinery and equipment, 6 2/3 to 33 1/3 percent. Deferred
financing costs are amortized over the lives of the related debt securities. The
excess of cost over net assets of acquired companies is amortized using the
straight-line method over the period estimated to be benefitted, not exceeding
40 years. At each balance sheet date management assesses whether there has been
a permanent impairment of the excess of cost over net assets of acquired
companies by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from operating
activities with the carrying amount of the excess of cost over net assets of
acquired companies. The factors considered by management in performing this
assessment include current operating results, business prospects, market trends,
potential product obsolescence, competitive activities and other economic
factors. Based on this assessment there was no permanent impairment related to
excess of cost over net assets of acquired companies at December 31, 1993.

At December 31, 1993 and 1992, accumulated amortization of the excess of
cost over net assets of acquired companies and patents was $98.4 million and
$105.1 million, respectively. Amortization expense was

7

MASCOTECH, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

$22.2 million, $22.8 million and $21.2 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively, including amortization expense of approximately $1.6 million in
each year related to discontinued operations.

Income Taxes. In January, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109 ("SFAS No. 109"), "Accounting for Income Taxes."
SFAS No. 109 is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of
deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
events that have been recognized in the Company's financial statements or tax
returns. In estimating future tax consequences, SFAS No. 109 generally allows
consideration of all expected future events other than enactments of changes in
the tax law or tax rates. Previously, the Company used the SFAS No. 96 asset and
liability approach that gave no recognition to future events other than the
recovery of assets and settlement of liabilities at their carrying amounts.
There was no income statement impact from the adoption of SFAS No. 109 and the
required balance sheet reclassification was immaterial. Provision is made for
U.S. income taxes on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries unless
such earnings are considered permanently reinvested.

Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share. Primary earnings (loss) per common share
are based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and common
stock equivalents outstanding (including the dilutive effect of options and
warrants, utilizing the treasury stock method) of 57.4 million, 60.9 million 
and 59.7 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, and earnings (loss) 
after deducting preferred stock dividends of $14.9 million, $9.3 million and 
$9.6 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Fully diluted earnings (loss) per common share are only presented when the
assumed conversion of convertible debentures is dilutive. Fully diluted earnings
per share in 1993 were calculated based on 68.8 million weighted average common
shares outstanding. Convertible securities did not have a dilutive effect on
earnings (loss) in 1992 or 1991. The shares of Dividend Enhanced Convertible 
Stock-DECSSM (the "DECS") issued in 1993 (see "Shareholders' Equity" note) are
common stock equivalents, but are not included in the calculation of primary 
or fully diluted shares outstanding as such inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

In late 1993, approximately 10.4 million shares were issued as a result of
the conversion of the 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures (see "Shareholders'
Equity" note). If such conversion had taken place at the beginning of 1993, the
primary earnings per common and common equivalent share amounts would have
approximated the amounts presented for earnings per common and common equivalent
share, assuming full dilution, for the year ended December 31, 1993.

Adoption of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards. The Company
expects that the adoption of Statements of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 112 "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits", SFAS No.
114 "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" and SFAS No. 115
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities" will not have
a material impact on the financial position or the results of operations of the
Company when adopted in 1994 and 1995.

SUPPLEMENTARY CASH FLOWS INFORMATION:

Significant transactions not affecting cash were: in 1993: in addition to
the payment by the Company of $87.5 million, the non-cash portion of the
issuance of Company Preferred Stock and warrants in exchange for Company Common
Stock, Company Preferred Stock and Masco Corporation's holdings of Emco Limited
common stock and convertible debentures (see "Shareholders' Equity" note);
conversion of $187 million of convertible debentures into Company Common Stock
(see "Shareholders' Equity" note); and conversion of the Company's TriMas
Corporation ("TriMas") convertible preferred stock holdings into TriMas common
stock (see "Equity and Other Investments in Affiliates" note); and in 1991: an
exchange of certain operating assets (see "Dispositions of Other Operations"
note); and the assumption of liabilities of $18 million in partial exchange for
the acquisition of Creative Industries Group (see "Equity and Other Investments
in Affiliates" note).

MASCOTECH, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

Income taxes paid were $32 million in 1993 and $23 million in 1992. Income
tax refunds of $8 million were received in 1991. Interest paid was $82 million,
$91 million and $115 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS:

In late November, 1993, the Company adopted a formal plan to divest its
Energy-related business segment, which consisted of seven business units.
Accordingly, the consolidated statements of income and cash flows and related
notes have been reclassified to present such Energy-related segment as
discontinued operations. During 1993, two such business units were sold for
approximately $93 million, including the sale of one business unit to the
Company's equity affiliate, TriMas for $60 million cash. The expected loss from
the planned disposition of the Company's Energy-related segment resulted in a
fourth quarter 1993 pre-tax charge of approximately $41 million (approximately
$22 million after-tax), including a provision for the businesses not yet sold
and the deferral of a portion of the gain (approximately $6 million after-tax)
related to the sale of the business to TriMas. The Company expects to sell the
remaining business units in privately negotiated transactions in 1994.

Selected financial information for discontinued operations is as follows as
at December 31, 1993 and for the period up to the decision to discontinue in
1993 and for the years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991:

The unusual relationship of income taxes to pre-tax income in 1992 results
principally from foreign losses for which no tax benefit was recorded. Operating
and pre-tax income include charges of $6 million in 1991, principally related to
the discontinuance of product lines and the cost of restructuring several
businesses.

DISPOSITIONS OF OTHER OPERATIONS:

In separate transactions from late 1989 to early 1991, the Company divested
itself of three subsidiaries and received consideration of approximately $160
million, of which $108 million was received in 1990. The remaining $52 million
was received in 1991. In addition, in 1991 the Company disposed of certain
equity affiliates, and exchanged operating assets aggregating approximately $27
million.

These transactions, including the disposition of Masco Capital Corporation
(see "Equity and Other Investments in Affiliates" note), resulted in an
approximate $22 million pre-tax gain in 1991.

In 1988, the Company transferred several businesses to TriMas, a publicly
traded, diversified manufacturer of commercial, industrial and consumer
products. In exchange, the Company received $128 million principal amount of 14%
Subordinated Debentures (which were subsequently redeemed resulting in
prepayment premium income to the Company of $9 million in 1992 and $4 million in
1991), $70 million (liquidation value) of 10% Convertible Participating
Preferred Stock and 9.3 million shares of TriMas common stock.

During the second quarter of 1992, TriMas sold 9.2 million shares of newly
issued common stock at $9.75 per share in a public offering, which reduced the
Company's common equity ownership interest in TriMas to

10
<PAGE> 12

MASCOTECH, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

28 percent from 41 percent. As a result, the Company recognized a pre-tax gain
of $16.7 million from the change in the Company's common equity ownership
interest in TriMas. In late 1993, the TriMas 10% Convertible Participating
Preferred Stock held by the Company was converted at a conversion price of $9
per share into 7.8 million shares of TriMas common stock, increasing the
Company's common equity ownership interest in TriMas to 43 percent.

In 1993, the Company sold a business unit to TriMas for $60 million cash
(see "Discontinued Operations" note).

Included in notes receivable are approximately $10.7 million of notes which
resulted from the sale by the Company of one million shares of its TriMas common
stock holdings to members of the Company's executive management group in
mid-1989. The notes have an effective interest rate of nine percent, payable at
maturity in mid-1994. Ownership and resale of certain of such shares is
restricted and subject to the continuing employment of these executives.

TriMas' Board of Directors declared a 100 percent stock distribution (one
additional share for every share held) to its shareholders effective July 19,
1993. TriMas share amounts and per share prices have been restated to reflect
this distribution.

The Company's holdings in Emco Limited ("Emco") were acquired from Masco
Corporation in 1993 (see "Shareholders' Equity" note). Emco is a major, publicly
traded, Canadian based manufacturer and distributor of building and other
industrial products with annual sales of approximately $800 million.

At December 31, 1992, the Company had an approximate 47 percent common
equity ownership interest in Titan Wheel International, Inc. ("Titan"), a
manufacturer of wheels and other products for agricultural, construction and
other off-highway equipment markets. In May, 1993, Titan completed an initial
public offering of three million shares of common stock at $15 per share
(including 292,000 shares held by the Company), reducing the Company's common
equity ownership interest in Titan to 24 percent. The Company's ownership
interest was further reduced in late 1993 to 21 percent as a result of the
issuance of additional common shares by Titan in connection with an acquisition
by Titan. These transactions resulted in 1993 gains aggregating approximately
$12.8 million pre-tax (principally in the second quarter) as a result of the
sale of shares held by the Company and from the change in the Company's common
equity ownership interest in Titan.

During the second quarter of 1991, the Company acquired the remaining 50
percent equity ownership interest of Creative Industries Group, which had sales
in 1990 of approximately $150 million.

In 1991, Masco Capital Corporation ("Masco Capital") sold its principal
asset and used the proceeds to repay its outstanding bank borrowings and to make
loan repayments and distributions to its shareholders, whereby the Company
received approximately $65 million (including repayment of $44 million advanced
during 1991). In addition, the Company subsequently sold its 50 percent equity
ownership interest in Masco Capital to the other shareholder, Masco Corporation,
for approximately $50 million (which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately
$5 million) and contingent amounts based on the future value of certain assets
held by Masco Capital.

In addition to its equity and other investments in publicly traded
affiliates, the Company retains interests in privately held manufacturers of
automotive components, including the Company's 50 percent common equity
ownership interests in Autostyle, Inc., a manufacturer of reaction injection
molded automotive components, and Elbi-Hi Ram, Inc., a manufacturer of 
electrical and electronic automotive components.

In 1993, the Company entered into a new $675 million revolving credit
agreement with a group of banks, replacing its prior bank credit agreement
(which had consisted of a revolving credit facility and a bank term loan at
December 31, 1992). Amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement are
due in January, 1997; however, under certain circumstances, the due date may be
extended to July, 1998. The interest rates applicable to the revolving credit
agreement are principally at alternative floating rates provided for in the
agreement (approximately four percent at December 31, 1993).

The revolving credit agreement requires the maintenance of a specified
level of shareholders' equity, with limitations on the ratio of senior debt to
earnings, long-term debt (at December 31, 1993 additional borrowing capacity of
approximately $380 million was available under this agreement), intangible
assets and the acquisition of Company Capital Stock. Under the most restrictive
of these provisions, $120 million of retained earnings was available at December
31, 1993 for the payment of cash dividends and the acquisition of Company
Capital Stock.

The 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures were converted into Company
Common Stock in late 1993 (see "Shareholders' Equity" note).

The senior subordinated notes contain limitations on the payment of cash
dividends and the acquisition of Company Capital Stock. In late 1993, the
Company called for redemption, on February 1, 1994, the $250 million of 10 1/4%
Senior Subordinated Notes. During 1992, the Company repurchased, in open-market
transactions, approximately $67 million of its 10% Senior Subordinated Notes at
prices approximating face value.

In early 1994, the Company issued, in a public offering, $345 million of
4 1/2% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due December 15, 2003. These
debentures are convertible into Company Common Stock at $31 per share. The net
proceeds were used to redeem the $250 million of 10 1/4% Subordinated Notes
(called in late 1993 for redemption on February 1, 1994) and to reduce other
indebtedness. In the fourth quarter of 1993, the Company recognized a $5.8
million pre-tax extraordinary charge ($3.7 million after-tax) related to the
call premium (1.25%) and unamortized prepaid debenture expense associated with
the call for early extinguishment of the $250 million of 10 1/4% Subordinated
Notes. The 10 1/4% Subordinated Notes are classified as non-current as the
Company had the intent and the ability to maintain these borrowings on a
long-term basis (due to the issuance of the 4 1/2% Convertible Subordinated
Debentures). The maturities of long-term debt during the next five years are as
follows (in millions): 1994 -- $3; 1995 -- $234; 1996 -- $1; 1997 -- $303; and
1998 -- $0.

On March 31, 1993, the Company acquired from Masco Corporation 10 million
shares of Company Common Stock, recorded at $100 million, $77.5 million of the
Company's previously outstanding 12% Exchangeable Preferred Stock, and Masco
Corporation's holdings of Emco Limited common stock and convertible debentures,
recorded at $80.8 million. In exchange, Masco Corporation received $100 million
(liquidation value) of the Company's 10% Exchangeable Preferred Stock,
seven-year warrants to purchase 10 million shares of Company Common Stock at $13
per share, recorded at $70.8 million, and $87.5 million in cash. The
transferable warrants are not exercisable by Masco Corporation if an exercise
would increase Masco Corporation's common equity ownership interest in the
Company above 35 percent. The cash portion of this transaction is included in
the accompanying statement of cash flows as cash used for investing activities
of $87.5 million. As part of this transaction, as modified in late 1993, Masco
Corporation agreed to purchase from the Company, at the Company's option through
March, 1997, up to $200 million of subordinated debentures. In late 1993, the
Company redeemed the 10% Exchangeable Preferred Stock for its $100 million
liquidation value.

In July, 1993, the Company issued 10.8 million shares of 6% Dividend
Enhanced Convertible Stock (DECS) at $20 per share ($216 million aggregate
liquidation amount) in a public offering (classified as

15

<PAGE> 17

MASCOTECH, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

Convertible Preferred Stock). The net proceeds from this issuance were used to
reduce the Company's indebtedness. On July 1, 1997, each of the then outstanding
shares of the DECS will convert into one share of Company Common Stock, if not
previously redeemed by the Company or converted at the option of the holder, in
both cases for Company Common Stock.

Each share of the DECS is convertible at the option of the holder anytime
prior to July 1, 1997 into .806 of a share of Company Common Stock, equivalent
to a conversion price of $24.81 per share of Company Common Stock. Dividends are
cumulative and each share of the DECS has 4/5 of a vote, voting together as one
class with holders of Company Common Stock.

Beginning July 1, 1996, the Company, at its option, may redeem the DECS at
a call price payable in shares of Company Common Stock principally determined by
a formula based on the then current market price of Company Common Stock.
Redemption by the Company, as a practical matter, will generally not result in a
call price that exceeds one share of Company Common Stock or is less than .806
of a share of Company Common Stock (resulting from the holder's conversion
option).

The Company's 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures were called for
redemption in late 1993. Substantially all holders, including Masco Corporation,
exercised their right to convert these debentures into Company Common Stock (at
a conversion price of $18 per share), resulting in the issuance of approximately
10.4 million shares of Company Common Stock.

The Company's consideration for a 1987 acquisition included two million
shares of Company Common Stock which were subject to a stock value guarantee
agreement. During the second quarter of 1993, the Company's stock value
guarantee obligation was settled, resulting in no material financial impact to
the Company.

The Company commenced paying cash dividends on its Common Stock in August,
1993 and declared three and paid two quarterly dividends in 1993, each in the
amount of $.02 per common share.

STOCK OPTIONS AND AWARDS:

For the three years ended December 31, 1993, stock option data pertaining

As of December 31, 1993, options have been granted and are outstanding with
exercise prices ranging from $4 1/2 to $26 per share, the fair market value at
the dates of grant.

Pursuant to restricted stock incentive plans, the Company granted long-term
incentive awards, net, for 202,000, 251,000 and 675,000 shares of Company Common
Stock during 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, to key employees of the Company
and affiliated companies. The unamortized costs of incentive awards,

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

aggregating approximately $20 million at December 31, 1993, are being amortized
over the ten-year vesting periods.

At December 31, 1993 and 1992, a combined total of 5,631,000 and 5,759,000
shares, respectively, of Company Common Stock were available for the granting of
options and incentive awards under the above plans.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

Pension and Profit-Sharing Benefits. The Company sponsors defined-benefit
pension plans for most of its employees. In addition, substantially all salaried
employees participate in noncontributory profit-sharing plans, to which payments
are approved annually by the Directors. Aggregate charges to income under these
plans were $10.9 million in 1993, $10.3 million in 1992 and $8.3 million in
1991, including approximately $.9 million in each year related to discontinued
operations.

Net periodic pension cost for the Company's defined-benefit pension plans
includes the following components for the three years ended December 31, 1993:

Postretirement Benefits. The Company provides postretirement medical and
life insurance benefits for certain of its active and retired employees.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106 "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions" ("SFAS 106") for its postretirement benefit plans. This
statement requires the accrual method of accounting for postretirement health
care and life insurance based on actuarially determined costs to be recognized
over the period from the date of hire to the full eligibility date of employees
who are expected to qualify for such benefits. In conjunction with the adoption
of SFAS 106, the Company elected to recognize the transition obligation on a
prospective basis and accordingly, the net transition obligation is being
amortized over 20 years. Net periodic postretirement benefit cost includes the
following components for the year ended December 31, 1993:

The incremental cost in 1993 of accounting for postretirement health care

million.

The discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation was seven percent. The assumed health care cost trend rate in
1993 was 12 percent, decreasing to an ultimate rate in the year 2000 of seven
percent. If the assumed medical cost trend rates were increased by one percent,
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation would increase by $2.6 million
and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic
postretirement benefit cost would increase by $.2 million.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107,
"Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments," the following methods
were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments:

Notes Receivable and Other Assets. Fair values of financial instruments
included in notes receivable and other assets were estimated using various
methods including quoted market prices and discounted future cash flows based on
the incremental borrowing rates for similar types of investments. In addition,
for variable-rate notes receivable that fluctuate with the prime rate, the
carrying amounts approximate fair value.

Long-Term Debt. The carrying amount of bank debt and certain other
long-term debt instruments approximate fair value as the floating rates inherent
in this debt reflect changes in overall market interest rates. The fair values
of the Company's subordinated debt instruments are based on quoted market
prices. The fair values of certain other debt instruments are estimated by
discounting future cash flows based on the Company's incremental borrowing rate
for similar types of debt instruments.

The carrying amounts and fair values of the Company's financial instruments
at December 31, 1993 and 1992 are as follows:

Certain amounts presented above have been reclassified to present a segment
of the Company's business as discontinued operations (see "Discontinued
Operations" note).

Results for the second quarters of 1993 and 1992 include pre-tax income of
approximately $9 million and $25 million, respectively, as a result of gains
associated with the sale of common stock through public offerings by equity
affiliates and, in 1992, a prepayment premium related to the redemption of
debentures held by the

24

<PAGE> 26

MASCOTECH, INC.
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

Company. This income was largely offset by costs and expenses related to cost
reduction initiatives, the restructuring of certain operations and product
lines, adjustments to the carrying value of certain long-term assets, and other
costs and expenses.

Results for the third quarter of 1993 were reduced by a charge of
approximately $.04 per common share reflecting the recently increased 1993
federal corporate income tax rate.

The fourth quarter of 1993 net income includes the effect of a $5.8 million
pre-tax extraordinary charge ($3.7 million after-tax or $.06 per common share)
related to the early extinguishment of subordinated debt (see "Long-Term Debt"
note). The fourth quarter of 1993 net loss also includes an after-tax charge of
approximately $22 million ($.38 per common share) related to the disposition of
a segment of the Company's business (see "Discontinued Operations" note).

The 1993 results include the benefit of approximately $11.5 million pre-tax
income ($6.7 million after-tax or $.12 per common share), primarily in the third
and fourth quarters, resulting from net gains from sales of marketable
securities.

The 1992 results include the benefit of approximately $4 million pre-tax
income ($2 million after-tax or $.04 per common share), primarily in the fourth
quarter, resulting from net gains from sales of marketable securities.

The 1993 income (loss) per common share amounts for the quarters do not
total to the full year amounts due to the changes in the number of common shares
outstanding during the year and the dilutive effect of first, second and third
quarter 1993 results.

The calculation of earnings per common and common equivalent share for the
fourth quarter of 1993 results in dilution for income from continuing
operations, assuming full dilution. Therefore, the fully diluted earnings per
share computation is used for all computations, even though the result is
anti-dilutive for one of the per share amounts.
