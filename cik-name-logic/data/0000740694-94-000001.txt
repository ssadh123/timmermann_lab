ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

Kaydon Corporation has signed an agreement with Axel Johnson Inc.,
headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, to acquire the assets and business of
Industrial Tectonics, Inc. located in Dexter, Michigan. Industrial Tectonics,
Inc. manufactures special balls used in measuring devices, floats, valves, ball
point pens and anti-friction bearings. Annual sales for the operation are
slightly over $10 million. The effective date of the purchase is expected to be
on or about January 31, 1994.

Kaydon has also acquired the assets of Kenyon Power Transmission Ltd.
effective December 4, 1993. Kenyon is a small manufacturer of pulleys and drive
components and is located in Manchester, England. Annualized sales of
approximately $2 million will be absorbed by Kaydon's Cooper Roller Bearing Co.
Ltd. subsidiary in King's Lynn, England.

The combined purchase price of the two aforementioned acquisitions do not
meet the significant asset acquisition threshold.
