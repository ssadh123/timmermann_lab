MERCANTILE BANCORPORATION INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO SUPPLEMENTAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE A

ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Mercantile Bancorporation Inc. ("Corporation" or "Mercantile")
and its subsidiaries follow generally accepted accounting
principles and reporting practices applicable to the banking
industry. The significant accounting policies are summarized
below.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION:

Consolidation: The Supplemental Consolidated Financial
Statements include the accounts of Mercantile Bancorporation
Inc. and its subsidiaries. All subsidiaries are wholly-owned.
Material intercompany transactions are eliminated.

Restatements: Effective January 3, 1994, Mercantile
Bancorporation Inc. acquired Metro Bancorporation ("Metro"),
and effective February 1, 1994, the Corporation acquired United
Postal Bancorp, Inc. ("United Postal"), in transactions
accounted for as poolings-of-interests.

The Supplemental Consolidated Financial Statements give
retroactive effect to the transactions and, as a result, the
Supplemental Consolidated Statement of Income, Balance Sheet
and Statement of Cash Flows are presented as if the combining
companies had been consolidated for all periods presented. (As
required by generally accepted accounting principles, the
Supplemental Consolidated Financial Statements will become the
historical consolidated financial statements upon issuance of
the financial statements for the period that includes the date
of the transactions.) The Supplemental Consolidated Statement
of Changes in Shareholders' Equity reflects the accounts of
Mercantile Bancorporation Inc. as if the common stock issued in
the Metro acquisition had been outstanding during all periods
presented. The Supplemental Statement of Changes in
Shareholders' Equity reflects the accounts of the Corporation
as if the additional common stock issued in the United Postal
acquisition was outstanding effective March 20, 1992, the date
United Postal made its initial public offering of common stock.
The Supplemental Consolidated Financial Statements, including
the notes thereto, should be read in conjunction with the
historical consolidated financial statements of the Corporation
included in its 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

A three-for-two stock split, which was paid in the form of a
dividend, was distributed on April 11, 1994 to shareholders of
record March 10, 1994. All per share amounts, as well as ending
and average common shares data, reflect the three-for-two stock
split.

Reclassification: Certain reclassifications have been made to
the 1992 and 1991 historical financial statements to conform
with the 1993 presentation.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS:

Financial Accounting Standard ("FAS") 106, "Employers'
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions,"
was adopted by the Corporation in the first quarter of 1993.
The Corporation adopted FAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes,"
in the first quarter of 1993 with an effective date of January
1, 1988. FAS 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt
and Equity Securities," was adopted by the Corporation on
December 31, 1993.

FAS 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits,"
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 1993,
and FAS 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairments of a
Loan," effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
1994, had not been adopted by the Corporation at December 31,
1993. The adoptions of FAS 112 and FAS 114 are not expected to
have a material impact on the Corporation's financial condition
or results of operations.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE:

Earnings per common share data is based on the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period.

Earnings of United Postal are excluded from the earnings per
share calculation from January 1, 1991 through March 20, 1992,
which is the date United Postal made its initial public
offering of common stock. Also on March 20, 1992, United Postal
Savings Association, a wholly-owned subsidiary of United
Postal, converted from a Missouri state-chartered mutual
savings association to a Missouri state-chartered stock
association.

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES:

Trading securities, which include any security held primarily
for near-term sale, are valued at fair value. Gains and losses
on trading securities, both realized and unrealized, are
recorded in investment banking income.

Available-for-sale securities, which include any security for
which the Corporation has no immediate plan to sell but which
may be sold in the future under different circumstances, are
valued at fair value. Realized gains and losses, based on the
amortized cost of the specific security, are included in other
income as securities gains. Unrealized gains and losses are
recorded, net of related income tax effects, in retained
earnings.
6

<PAGE> 9

Held-to-maturity securities, which include any security for
which the Corporation has the positive intent and ability to
hold until maturity, are valued at historical cost adjusted for
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts computed by
the level-yield method. Prior to December 31, 1993, realized
gains and losses, based on the amortized cost of the specific
security, were included in other income as securities gains.

Prior to December 31, 1993, marketable equity securities were
stated at the lower of cost or fair value. Changes in the
valuation of marketable equity securities which were considered
to be temporary were recorded as adjustments to retained
earnings. At December 31, 1993, these securities were
classified as available-for-sale.

LOANS AND LEASES:

Interest income on loans not discounted is generally accrued on
a simple interest basis. Interest income on discounted loans is
computed on the sum-of-the-months'-digits method, which
approximates the interest method.

Loan fees and direct costs of loan originations are deferred
and amortized over the life of the loans under methods
approximating the interest method.

The finance method is used to account for direct and leveraged
equipment lease contracts. Income is recorded over the lease
periods in proportion to the unrecovered investment in the
leases after consideration of investment tax credits and other
related income tax effects.

When, in management's opinion, the collection of interest on a
loan is unlikely, or when either principal or interest is past
due over 90 days, that loan is generally placed on non-accrual
status. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, accrued
interest for the current year is reversed and charged against
current earnings, and accrued interest from prior years is
charged against the reserve for possible loan losses. Interest
payments received on non-accrual loans are applied to principal
if there is doubt as to the collectibility of such principal;
otherwise, these receipts are recorded as interest income. A
loan remains on non-accrual status until the loan is current as
to payment of both principal and interest, and/or the borrower
demonstrates the ability to pay and remain current.

RESERVE FOR POSSIBLE LOAN LOSSES:

The reserve for possible loan losses is increased by provisions
charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off, net of
recoveries. The reserve is maintained at a level considered
adequate to provide for potential loan losses based on
management's evaluation of current economic conditions, changes
in the character and size of the portfolio, past experience,
expected future losses, and other pertinent factors.

FORECLOSED ASSETS:

Foreclosed assets include real estate and other assets acquired
through foreclosure or other proceedings, and in-substance
foreclosures. In-substance foreclosures represent loans
accounted for as foreclosed assets due to the borrower having
limited equity in the underlying collateral, anticipated
repayment only through the operation or sale of the collateral,
or the borrower either formally or effectively abandoning
control of the collateral. Foreclosed assets are included in
other assets in the Supplemental Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Foreclosed assets are valued at the lower of cost or fair
value. Losses arising at the time of transfer from loans are
charged to the reserve for possible loan losses. Subsequent
valuation changes based upon periodic appraisals are charged
against current earnings.

BANK PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT:

Bank premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Provisions for depreciation are computed
principally by the straight-line method and are based on
estimated useful lives of the assets. The carrying value of
assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation
are eliminated from the accounts, and the resulting gains or
losses are reflected in income.

Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to
expense, while expenditures for major renewals are capitalized.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS:

Intangible assets, consisting primarily of goodwill and core
deposit premium, are included in other assets in the
Supplemental Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Goodwill, the excess of cost over the net assets acquired in
business combinations accounted for as purchases, is amortized
using the straight-line method over the estimated period to be
benefited, most recently 15 years, but not exceeding 40 years.

Core deposit premium represents the premiums paid, net of any
rebate on assets acquired, plus the insurance funds' entrance
and exit fees, for deposits acquired from failed thrift
institutions in Resolution Trust Corporation-assisted
transactions. This intangible asset is amortized, on an
accelerated basis, over the estimated life of the core deposit
base acquired, but not exceeding 10 years.

CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS RESTRICTIONS

The Corporation's subsidiary banks and thrift institution are
required to maintain average reserve balances which place
withdrawal and/or usage restrictions on cash and due from banks
balances. The average amount of these restricted balances for
the year ended December 31, 1993 was $166,330,000.

NOTE E

INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES

Effective December 31, 1993, the Corporation adopted FAS 115,
and its cumulative effect was recorded on the Supplemental
Consolidated Balance Sheet on that date. The most significant
impact of the new accounting requirements is that unrealized
holding gains and losses, net of applicable income taxes, on
securities classified as available-for-sale are recorded as an
adjustment to retained earnings. In 1992 these securities were
classified as held-for-sale, and were carried at the lower of
amortized cost or fair value determined on an aggregate basis
with adjustments recorded in current year earnings. The
adoption of FAS 115 did not have a material effect on the
financial condition or results of operations for the year ended
December 31, 1993, and prior year Supplemental Consolidated
Financial Statements have not been restated.

On December 31, 1993, debt securities with an amortized cost of
$2,970,160,000 were classified as "held-to-maturity;" and debt
and equity securities with an amortized cost of $409,688,000
were classified as "available-for-sale." A market valuation
account of $5,595,000 was established for the available-for-
sale securities to increase the recorded balance of such
securities at December 31, 1993 to their estimated fair value
on that date. A tax liability of $1,959,000 established the
deferred tax effect of the market valuation account. The net
increase resulting from the market valuation adjustment at
December 31, 1993 was recorded as an adjustment to retained
earnings.

On October 15, 1992, the Corporation issued $150,000,000 of
subordinated notes with a ten-year maturity and a coupon rate
of 7.625% to yield 7.741%. These notes qualify as Tier II
capital under current regulatory guidelines.

On January 25, 1994, Mercantile Bank of St. Louis N.A. issued
$75,000,000 of 6.375% 10-year, non-callable subordinated debt,
due January 15, 2004. This debt qualifies as Tier II capital.
The Corporation used the proceeds of this subordinated debt
issue to: (1) prepay in full on February 23, 1994 the
$30,550,000 8.500% unsecured debentures of the Corporation; and
(2) prepay in full on February 1, 1994 the $23,653,000 8.250%
mortgage secured by the Corporation's headquarters building.

The 11.750% notes were direct, unsecured obligations of the
Corporation. The notes were paid in full upon maturity in
December 1992.

The 8.500% debentures were direct, unsecured obligations of the
Corporation. Required minimum annual redemptions of $1,050,000
were met through 1993. These debentures were prepaid in full on
February 23, 1994 as part of the debt refinancing described
above.

The 8.000% convertible subordinated capital notes were issued
by Ameribanc, Inc. prior to its acquisition by the Corporation.
At December 31, 1993, these notes were convertible into
approximately 520,000 shares of the Corporation's common stock.

Notes issued in acquisitions by the parent company with an
interest rate of 6.500% matured in November 1993.

All second-tier holding company debt was issued by either
MidAmerican Corporation or Johnson County Bankshares, Inc.
prior to their acquisition by the Corporation. Except for the
notes issued in acquisitions, all second-tier holding company
debt was paid off on January 5, 1993. Notes issued in
acquisitions by a second-tier holding company were issued at a
variable rate and are due in 1994. The notes are subject to
offset based upon the outcome of certain litigation and losses
in the loan portfolio of the acquired bank subsidiary.

In July 1989, United Postal Savings Association issued $100
million of 9.000% fixed-rate mortgage-backed notes with a
maturity of July 1999. United Postal Savings Association used a
portion of the proceeds from the sale of the notes as, or to
purchase, eligible collateral which was pledged to the trustee
simultaneously with the initial sale of the notes. During 1990,
$46,600,000 of the mortgage-backed notes were repurchased on
the open market at a discount.

The mortgage payable, which bears interest at a rate of 8.250%,
was a direct obligation of a bank subsidiary secured by the
Corporation's headquarters building, Mercantile Tower, which
had a carrying value of $23,548,000 at December 31, 1993. The
Corporation prepaid this mortgage in full on February 1, 1994
as part of the debt refinancing described above.

The advance from the Federal Home Loan Bank was paid in full
during 1993 by United Postal Savings Association.

INCOME TAXES

The Corporation adopted FAS 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes,"
in the first quarter of 1993 and applied the provisions
retroactively to January 1, 1988. The cumulative effect of this
change in accounting for income taxes was a $6,900,000
reduction of retained earnings as of that date. Adoption of FAS
109 had no material impact on net income for the years ended
December 31, 1993 and 1992. The effect on 1991 net income of
adopting FAS 109 was a reduction to income tax expense of
$18,000,000.

RETIREMENT PLANS

PENSION PLANS:

The Corporation maintains both qualified and nonqualified
noncontributory pension plans that cover all employees meeting
certain age and service requirements.

The qualified plan provides pension benefits based on the
employee's length of service and compensation earned during the
five years prior to retirement. The Corporation's funding
policy is to contribute annually at least the minimum amount
required by government funding standards but not more than is
tax deductible. No contribution was required or made during
1993, 1992 or 1991.

United Postal Savings Association is a member of the Financial
Institutions Retirement Fund ("Fund"). This trust provides
retirement and death benefits to multiple employers. All
contributions to the Fund are comingled, and all assets of the
Fund are invested on a pooled basis, without allocation to the
individual employers. Therefore, United Postal Savings
Association's pension plan assets and actuarial liabilities are
not included in the qualified plan tables listed below. Due to
an overfunding of the Fund, pension expense for the periods
presented has been comprised primarily of an administrative
fee.

<TABLE>
The net periodic pension expense (credit) related to the
qualified plan included in the Supplemental Consolidated
Statement of Income is summarized as follows:

</TABLE>

At December 31, 1993, approximately 57% of the plan's assets
was invested in listed common stocks; the remaining 43% was
invested in government and corporate bonds rated A or better. A
nominal amount of common stock of the Corporation was held by
the plan.

During 1991 the Corporation announced an early retirement
program available to certain employees. The pension expense
related to this program was $2,529,000.

The nonqualified plans provide pension benefits which would
have been provided under the qualified plan in the absence of
limits placed on qualified plan benefits by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Corporation's funding policy is to fund
benefits as they are paid. Contributions under the nonqualified
plans were not material for the three years ended December 31,
1993, 1992 and 1991. The expense related to these plans was
$1,641,000 in 1993, $1,337,000 in 1992 and $996,000 in 1991.

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS:

In addition to the pension plans described above, the
Corporation provides other postretirement benefits, largely
medical benefits and life insurance, to its retirees.

The Corporation adopted FAS 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," in the first
quarter of 1993. Expense for 1993 under FAS 106, assuming a 20-
year amortization period for the transition obligation, was
$4,917,000 compared with the cash basis cost of $2,225,000 in
1992 and $1,846,000 in 1991.

NOTES TO SUPPLEMENTAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONT'D)

The Corporation's Dividend Reinvestment Plan allows
shareholders of record to reinvest dividends and/or make
voluntary cash contributions to purchase additional shares of
the Corporation's common stock. Under the Plan, stock is
purchased in the open market by the Plan Trustee with no
service charge to the shareholder.

PREFERRED STOCK:

The authorized preferred stock of the Corporation consists of
5,000,000 shares, no par value, of which none were issued or
outstanding at December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, although 700,000
shares were reserved at December 31, 1993, for issuance pursuant to
the Preferred Share Purchase Rights Plan. The preferred stock,
which is issuable in series, shall have specific terms, preferences
and other rights as determined by the Board of Directors for each
series.

PREFERRED SHARE PURCHASE RIGHTS PLAN:

One Preferred Share Purchase Right ("Right") is attached to each
share of common stock and trades automatically with such shares.
The Rights, which can be redeemed by the Board of Directors in
certain circumstances and expire by their terms on June 3, 1998,
have no voting rights.

The Rights become exercisable and will trade separately from the
common stock 10 days after a person or a group either becomes the
beneficial owner or announces an intention to commence a tender
offer for 20% or more of the Corporation's outstanding common
stock. When exercisable, each Right entitles the registered holder
to purchase from the Corporation 1/100 of a share of Series A
Junior Participating Preferred Stock for $100 per 1/100 of a
preferred share.

In the event a person acquires beneficial ownership of 20% or more
of the Corporation's common stock, holders of Rights (other than
the acquiring person or group) may purchase, at the Rights' then
current exercise price, common stock of the Corporation having a
value at that time equal to twice the exercise price. In the event
the Corporation merges into or otherwise transfers 50% or more of
its assets or earnings power to any person after the Rights become
exercisable, holders of Rights may purchase, at the then current
exercise price, common stock of the acquiring entity having a value
at that time equal to twice the exercise price.

STOCK OPTIONS:

The Corporation had stock options outstanding under various plans
at December 31, 1993, including plans assumed in acquisitions. The
original Mercantile plans provide for the granting to employees of
the Corporation and its subsidiaries of options to purchase shares
of common stock of the Corporation over periods of up to 10 years
at a price not less than the market value of the shares at the date
the options are granted. The plans provide for the granting of
options which either qualify or do not qualify as Incentive Stock
Options as defined by Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended. A summary of the plans follows:

DEBT AND DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS:

Consolidated retained earnings at December 31, 1993 were not
restricted under any debenture agreement as to payment of
dividends and reacquisition of common stock.

The primary source of funds for dividends paid by the
Corporation to its shareholders is dividends received from bank
and thrift subsidiaries. At December 31, 1993, approximately
$251,139,000 of the equity of bank and thrift subsidiaries was
available for distribution as dividends to the Parent Company
without prior regulatory approval or without reducing the
capital of the respective subsidiary banks and thrift
institution below present minimum standards. An additional
$94,218,000 would be available for loans to the Parent Company
under Federal Reserve regulations. The remaining equity of bank
and thrift subsidiaries approximating $679,312,000 was
restricted as to transfers to the Parent Company.

CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT

The Corporation's primary market area is the state of Missouri and
the lower Midwest. At December 31, 1993, approximately 93% of the
total loan portfolio, and 91% of the commercial and commercial real
estate loan portfolio, were to borrowers within this region. The
diversity of the region's economic base tends to provide a stable
lending environment.

Real estate lending constituted the only other significant
concentration of credit risk. Real estate-related financial
instruments (loans, commitments and standby letters of credit)
comprised 36% of all such instruments of the Corporation. However,
of this total, approximately 64% was consumer-related in the form
of residential real estate mortgages and home equity lines of
credit.

The Corporation is, in general, a secured lender. At December 31,
1993, approximately 83% of the loan portfolio was secured.
Collateral is required in accordance with the normal credit
evaluation process based upon the creditworthiness of the customer
and the credit risk associated with the particular transaction.

NOTE N

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

FAIR VALUES:

Fair values for financial instruments are management's
estimates of the values at which the instruments could be
exchanged in a transaction between willing parties. These
estimates are subjective and may vary significantly from
amounts that would be realized in actual transactions. In
addition, certain financial instruments and all non-financial
instruments are excluded from the fair value disclosure
requirements of FAS 107. Therefore, the fair values presented
below should not be construed as the underlying value of the
Corporation.

The following methods and assumptions were used in estimating
fair values for financial instruments.

Cash and Due from Banks, Short-term Investments and Short-
term Borrowings: The carrying values reported in the
Supplemental Consolidated Balance Sheet approximated fair
values.

Investments in Debt and Equity Securities: Fair values for
held-to-maturity and available-for-sale securities were based
upon quoted market prices where available. Fair values for
trading securities, which also were the amounts reported in
the Supplemental Consolidated Balance Sheet, were based on
quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices
were not available, fair values were based upon quoted market
prices of comparable instruments.

Loans and Leases: The fair values for most loans were
estimated utilizing discounted cash flow calculations that
applied interest rates currently being offered for similar
loans to borrowers with similar risk profiles. Loans with
similar characteristics were aggregated for purposes of these
calculations. Non-accrual loans were valued at face value
adjusted for potential credit loss. The par value of credit
card loans was assumed to be the same as the fair value. The
fair value estimate of the credit card portfolio does not
include any value attributable to the ongoing cardholder
relationship. That component was estimated to be
approximately $135,000,000 to $165,000,000 in excess of the
fair value at December 31, 1993 as compared to approximately
$110,000,000 to $135,000,000 in excess of the fair value at
December 31, 1992.

Deposits: The fair values disclosed for deposits generally
payable on demand (i.e., interest bearing and non-interest
bearing demand, savings, and money market accounts) were
considered equal to their respective carrying amounts as
reported in the Supplemental Consolidated Balance Sheet. Fair
values for certificates of deposit and foreign deposits were
estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that
applied interest rates currently being offered on similar
certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly
maturities of time deposits. The fair value estimate of the
deposit portfolio has not been adjusted for any value derived
from the retention of those deposits for an expected future
period of time. That component, commonly referred to as core
deposit premium, was estimated to be approximately
$180,000,000 to $275,000,000 at December 31, 1993 as compared
to approximately $185,000,000 to $280,000,000 at December 31,
1992 and was neither considered in the fair value amounts
below nor recorded as an intangible asset in the Supplemental
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Long-term Debt: The fair value of publicly traded debt was
based upon quoted market prices, where available, or upon
quoted market prices of comparable instruments. The fair
values of other long-term debt were estimated using
discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Corporation's
current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of
borrowing arrangements.

Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments: Fair values of foreign
exchange contracts and interest rate contracts were
determined from quoted market prices. Fair values of
commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and
commercial letters of credit were based on fees currently
charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account
the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties'
credit standings.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK:

The Corporation is, in the normal course of business, a party to
certain off-balance-sheet financial instruments with inherent
credit and/or market risk. These instruments, which include
commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, interest
options written, interest futures contracts and foreign exchange
contracts, are used by the Corporation to meet the financing needs
of its customers and, to a lesser degree, to reduce its own
exposure to interest rate fluctuations. These instruments involve,
to varying degrees, credit and market risk in excess of the amount
recognized in the Supplemental Consolidated Balance Sheet.

<TABLE>
Financial instruments with off-balance-sheet credit risk for which
the contract amounts represent potential credit risk were as
follows:

======== ======== ========
Interest rate contracts $37,500 $71,000 $84,737
======= ======= =======
</TABLE>

The Corporation's maximum exposure to credit loss under commitments
to extend credit and standby letters of credit is the equivalent of
the contractual amount of those instruments. The same credit
policies are used by the Corporation in granting commitments and
conditional obligations as are used in the extension of credit.

Commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend
to a borrower as long as the borrower performs in accordance with
the terms of the contract. Commitments generally have fixed
expiration dates or other termination clauses, and may require
payment of a fee. As many of the commitments are expected to expire
without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does not
necessarily represent future cash requirements. Included in
consumer commitments are the unused portions of lines of credit for
credit card and home equity credit line loans.

Standby letters of credit are commitments issued by the Corporation
to guarantee specific performance of a customer to a third party.

Collateral is required for both commitments and standby letters of
credit in accordance with the normal credit evaluation process
based upon the creditworthiness of the customer and the credit risk
associated with the particular transaction. Collateral held varies,
but may include commercial real estate, accounts receivable,
inventory and equipment.

Included in interest rate contracts are interest rate exchange
agreements with major investment banking firms to convert short-
term variable-rate liabilities into long-term fixed-rate
liabilities, to secure interest margins, and to hedge against
interest rate movements.

For interest options written and foreign exchange contracts, the
contractual or notional amounts of $31,400,000 and $287,030,000,
respectively, at December 31, 1993 do not represent exposure to
credit loss. These commitments are generally entered into on behalf
of customers and result in the Corporation being in a matched
position. Credit risk in the transactions is minimal. The
Corporation controls the credit risk of these instruments through
established credit approvals, risk control limits and other
monitoring procedures. Market risk to the Corporation could result
from non-performance by the counterparty to a contract.

NOTE O

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

proceedings pending against the Corporation and its
subsidiaries. Management, after consultation with legal
counsel, is of the opinion that the ultimate resolution of
these proceedings will have no material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position or results of operations of the
Corporation.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

KPMG Peat Marwick
Certified Public Accounts

1010 Market Street
St. Louis, MO 63101

Shareholders and Board of Directors
Mercantile Bancorporation Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying supplemental consolidated balance
sheets of Mercantile Bancorporation Inc. and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, and the related supplemental
consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity,
and cash flows for the years then ended. These supplemental
consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. The
supplemental consolidated financial statements give retroactive
effect to the mergers of Metro Bancorporation and United Postal
Bancorp, Inc. on January 3, 1994 and February 1, 1994,
respectively, which have been accounted for using the pooling of
interests method as described in the notes to the supplemental
consolidated financial statements. Generally accepted accounting
principles proscribe giving effect to consummated business
combinations accounted for by the pooling of interest method in
financial statements that do not include the dates of consummation.
These financial statements do not extend through the dates of
consummation; however, they will become the historical consolidated
financial statements of Mercantile Bancorporation Inc. and
subsidiaries after financial statements covering the dates of
consummation of the business combinations are issued.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the supplemental consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of Mercantile Bancorporation Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then
ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
applicable after financial statements are issued for a period which
includes the date of consummation of the business combinations.
