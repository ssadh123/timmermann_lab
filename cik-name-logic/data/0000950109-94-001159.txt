Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets
------------------------------------

On June 27, 1994, CoreStates Financial Corp ("CoreStates") acquired
all of the outstanding shares of Independence Bancorp, Inc. ("Independence").
The acquisition was effected through a merger of Independence with and into
CoreStates (the "Merger") in accordance with (i) an Agreement and Plan of
Merger between CoreStates and Independence dated as of November 19, 1993
(the "Agreement"). The Agreement is attached as Appendix I to Independence's
Proxy Statement, dated May 23, 1994 (the "Proxy Statement"), which is Exhibit
2.1 hereto. The Articles of Merger dated June 27, 1994 are Exhibit 2.2 hereto.
The statements herein are qualified in their entirety by Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2,
which are incorporated herein by reference.

In the Merger, shareholders of Independence received 1.5 shares of common
stock of CoreStates, par value $1.00 per share ("CoreStates Common
Shares"), for each outstanding share of common stock of Independence, $2.50
par value per share ("Independence Common Shares"). A total of 16,700,513
CoreStates Common Shares were issued in the Merger. In addition, each option
to purchase Independence Common Shares outstanding under Independence's stock
option plans was converted into an option to purchase the number of
CoreStates Common Shares equal to the number of Independence Common Shares
subject to such option multiplied by a formula to reflect the exchange ratio
for the Merger. The outstanding Independence 7% Convertible Subordinated
Debentures due 2011 ("Debentures") have been assumed by CoreStates and remain
outstanding as an obligation of CoreStates. The conversion price at which the
Debenture may be converted into CoreStates Common Shares is $24.167 per share
of CoreStates Common Shares. The Merger is being treated for accounting
purposes as a pooling of interests.

Independence, a bank holding company, was engaged through its banking
subsidiaries, Bucks County Bank and Trust Company, Cheltenham Bank, Lehigh
Valley Bank, and Third National Bank and Trust Company of Scranton and its
other subsidiaries in providing commercial lending services, personal banking
services, and trust services. CoreStates intends to continue such uses
for the assets of Independence.

certain Indenture, dated as of June 15, 1986 (the "Indenture") relating to 
$50,000,000 principal amount of its 7% Convertible Subordinated Debentures Due
2011 (the "Debentures"); and

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of the 19th 
day of November, 1993 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and between CoreStates and 
IBI, IBI will merge with and into CoreStates (the "Merger"), effective at a 
time to be specified on June 27, 1994, or at such other time as the parties 
may agree in accordance with the provisions of the Merger Agreement (the 
"Effective Time"); and

WHEREAS, the Merger Agreement provides that, by virtue of the Merger, each
share of IBI common stock, par value $2.50 per share (the "IBI Common Stock"),
except for shares held directly or indirectly by CoreStates other than in a 
fiduciary capacity or in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted, will be
converted into 1.50 shares of CoreStates common stock, par value $1.00 per 
share (the "CoreStates Common Stock"); and

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 1.6 of the Merger Agreement, the Debentures 
outstanding at the Effective Time will be assumed by CoreStates and remain 
outstanding thereafter as an obligation of CoreStates and, from and after the 
Effective Time, the debentureholders will have the right to convert the 
Debentures into such number of shares of CoreStates Common Stock receivable by
a holder of the number of shares of IBI Common Stock into which such 
Debentures might have been converted immediately prior to the Merger. As a 
result, the conversion price at which the Debentures, immediately after the 
Effective Time, may be converted into CoreStates Common Stock shall be $24.167
per share of CoreStates Common Stock; and
<PAGE>

WHEREAS, section 4.06 of the Indenture provides that, in the case of the
merger of IBI into another corporation, the successor corporation will enter 
into a supplemental indenture providing that the Debentureholders may convert 
the Debentures into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other 
securities and property receivable upon such merger by a holder of the number 
of shares of Common Stock into which such Debenture might have been converted 
immediately prior to such merger; and

WHEREAS, section 4.06 of the Indenture further requires that the 
supplemental indenture provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly 
equivalent as may be practical to the adjustments provided for in Article Four
of the Indenture; and

WHEREAS, IBI and Corestates desire to evidence CoreState's assumption of 
the Debentures, and the parties' compliance with Section 1.6 of the Merger 
Agreement and Section 4.06 of the Indenture, by the execution and delivery of 
this First Supplemental Indenture; and
