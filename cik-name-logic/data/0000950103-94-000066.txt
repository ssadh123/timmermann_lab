Limited Partnership dated January 25, 1994.

FREEPORT-McMoRan RESOURCE PARTNERS
REPORTS FOURTH-QUARTER AND YEAR-END 1993 RESULTS

HIGHLIGHTS
*Phosphate fertilizer markets improve throughout the fourth quarter.
*IMC-Agrico Company, a joint venture with IMC Fertilizer Group, Inc. (IMC),
increases phosphoric acid and granulated phosphate fertilizer production.
*Main Pass sulphur production reaches full design capacity of approximately
5,500 tons per day (2 million tons per year) in December.
*Previously mined Florida phosphate rock acreage sold for approximately
$13.0 million cash; a $10.7 million gain recorded.
*Crude oil production at the Main Pass complex averages 22,400 barrels
per day during the quarter; a decline in oil prices trigger a noncash
charge to income.

NEW ORLEANS, LA., January 25, 1994 -- Freeport-McMoRan Resource Partners,
Limited Partnership (NYSE: FRP), an affiliate of Freeport-McMoRan Inc.
(NYSE: FTX), reported a fourth-quarter 1993 net loss of $63,827,000 ($0.62
per unit), after charges, compared with a net loss of $8,311,000 ($0.08 per
unit) a year ago. For the year ending December 31, 1993, FRP reported a
net loss of $246,111,000 ($2.37 per unit), after charges, compared with net
income of $20,211,000 ($0.20 per unit) a year ago. The following factors
contributed to the difference between the quarterly periods:

* Asset Valuation/Sales. FRP's fourth-quarter 1993 results include a
noncash charge of $60.0 million ($0.58 per unit) for the reduction in the
book value of FRP's Main Pass oil investment caused by a decline in oil
prices. Operationally, the Main Pass asset continues to perform extremely
well and the writedown has no effect on FRP's distributable cash. Also,
FRP recognized a gain of $10.7 million ($0.11 per unit) related to the sale
of certain previously mined phosphate rock acreage in Polk County, Florida.
The sale provided the company with approximately $13.0 million cash which
will be used to augment cash from operations for fourth-quarter 1993
distributable cash.
* Improving Sales Volumes/Prices for Phosphate Fertilizers. FRP's fourth-
quarter 1993 phosphate fertilizer and phosphate rock production and
sales, relative to a year-ago, reflects changes due to FRP's
proportionate share of IMC-Agrico Company's product mix compared with
FRP's previous stand-alone phosphate business. During the quarter,
improving demand for phosphate fertilizers allowed the IMC-Agrico joint
venture to increase phosphoric acid and granulated phosphate fertilizer
production by the restart of operations on the Mississippi River,
primarily at the Taft, Louisiana facility. Unit production costs
declined from the 1992 period reflecting initial production efficiencies
achieved by the joint venture, reduced raw material costs for sulphur and
lower phosphate rock mining expenses, partially offset by increased
natural gas costs and lower production volumes. The joint venture is
projected to capture annual savings of at least $95 million by the end of
the second full year of operations, to be shared essentially equally
between FRP and IMC.
After posting the lowest product prices in nearly 20 years,
the recovery in the phosphate fertilizer industry that began in
the third quarter continued in the fourth, as domestic and international
phosphate prices improved from the third quarter average. DAP prices on
the Chicago Board of Trade improved to over $140 per short ton (central
Florida) in late December compared to a low of $104 per short ton at mid-
year. Current international DAP prices have climbed to approximately
$160 per metric ton for the first quarter of 1994, compared with $123 per
metric ton and $148 per metric ton in the third and fourth quarter of
1993, respectively.
These price increases have been fueled by disappointing
harvests in many countries, particularly the United States,
which have helped to improve demand for phosphate fertilizers.
Furthermore, lower U.S. phosphoric acid operating rates early in the
quarter, coupled with higher fertilizer exports, resulted in a
significant reduction in producer inventory and a sharp rise in market
prices. In the U.S., the Department of Agriculture has eliminated set-
aside acreage for feedgrains this spring--a move which may result in an
approximate 5% increase in demand for phosphates from corn alone. In
foreign markets, Fertecon, a leading fertilizer industry consulting firm,
expects world DAP/MAP trade to set an all-time high. The combination of
anticipated strong domestic and export markets should sustain higher
prices during 1994.
* Higher Sulphur Production, Lower Cost. Fourth-quarter 1993 sulphur
production increased compared with the 1992 period, as the Main Pass mine
experienced higher production rates. In December, Main Pass reached the
design production rate of 2 million tons of sulphur per year, essentially
on target with the feasibility study that preceded construction. Having
produced approximately one million long tons of sulphur to date, the Main
Pass deposit now contains approximately 66 million long tons of recoverable
reserves which will be mined over an expected 30 years. Main Pass is one
of the most thermally efficient mines ever operated and is now the lowest
cost sulphur mine in North America. As anticipated, production ceased at
FRP's Caminada mine on January 21, 1994 which will further reduce operating
costs. The shutdown of Caminada will have no significant impact on FRP's
earnings or market position.
In the sulphur market, prices have remained depressed and settled
at approximately $50 per long ton in Tampa, Florida at year-end. The
market activity during the year was characterized by declining prices,
lower demand, and increasing inventories. Canadian sour gas producers
poured more than 2.0 million tons of sulphur to inventory in the second
half of 1993 alone. Late in the fourth quarter of 1993, international
sulphur prices firmed slightly as a consequence of reduced market supply
caused by inventory additions and an improvement in international trade
volumes. However, due to the large amount of production being placed
into inventory, a significant rebound in sulphur prices is not likely
until world demand improves substantially.
* Higher Oil Production. With the process of optimizing both oil and
sulphur production now complete at Main Pass and aided by the heat from
sulphur mining, production volumes continue to exceed prior expectations as
crude deliveries averaged 22,400 barrels per day (BPD) in the fourth
quarter of 1993 compared with 15,200 BPD in last year's comparable period.
Oil production, net to FRP, in 1994 is expected to approximate the more
than three million barrels produced in 1993 if current oil production
trends and water encroachment patterns continue.

DISTRIBUTABLE CASH
Distributable cash for the fourth quarter of 1993 was $0.60 per public
unit ($30.3 million) and $0.12 per general partnership unit ($6.2
million) payable on February 15, 1994. Therefore, FTX will receive $6.2
million of the $31.9 million owed it from this quarter's distribution,
bringing the total unpaid cash distributions due FTX to $239.2 million.
FTX will be entitled to receive this amount in the future from a portion of
the quarterly distributable cash after payments of 60 cents per unit to all
unitholders. The fourth quarter distributable cash calculation included
$30.9 million from the IMC-Agrico joint venture (including $9.3 million
from working capital reductions), operating cash flow from assets not in
the IMC-Agrico joint venture, and proceeds from the sale of previously
mined Florida phosphate rock acreage.
