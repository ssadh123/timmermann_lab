7-3/8% SENIOR NOTE DUE AUGUST 15, 2001

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of debentures, notes or
other evidences of indebtedness (the "Securities") of the Company of the series
hereinafter specified, which series is limited in aggregate principal amount to
$200,000,000 (except as provided in the Indenture hereinafter mentioned), all
such Securities issued and to be issued under an indenture dated as of May 15,
1984, as supplemented by a First Supplemental Indenture dated as of March 1,
1991 and a Second Supplemental Indenture dated as of August 27, 1991 (the
"Indenture"), between the Company and THE CHASE MANHATTAN BANK (NATIONAL
ASSOCIATION), as Trustee, to which Indenture reference is hereby made for a
statement of the rights and limitation of rights thereunder of the Holders of
the Securities and of the rights, obligations, duties and immunities of the
Trustee and of the Company, and the terms upon which the Securities are and are
to be authenticated and delivered. As provided in the Indenture, the Securites
may be issued in one or more series, which different series may be issued in
various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different times, may bear
interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to different redemption
provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking, purchase or analogous
funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and Events of Default and
may otherwise vary as in the Indenture provided or permitted. This Note is one
of a series of the Securities designated therein as 7-3/8% Senior Notes due
August 15, 2001 (the "Notes").

The Notes may not be redeemed by the Company prior to their Stated
Maturity.

If an Event of Default with respect to the Notes, as defined in the
Indenture, shall occur and be continuing, the principal of all the Notes may be
declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the
Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities under the Indenture at
any time by the Company with the consent of the Holders of 66-2/3% in aggregate
principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be
affected thereby. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders
of specified percentages in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any
series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities
of such series, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of
the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their
consequences with respect to such series. Any such consent or waiver by the
Holder of this Note shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon 
all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the transfer hereof
or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such 
consent or waiver is made upon this Note.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Note or of
the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of and interest on this Note at
the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth, this Note is transferable on the Securities Register of the Company,
upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency
of the Company to be maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan,
The City of New York, or at any other office or agency of the Company maintained
for that purpose, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Securities Registrar duly
executed by the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and
thereupon one or more new Notes, of authorized denominations and for the same
aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or
transferees.

The Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in
denominations of $1,000 and any multiple of $1,000. As provided in the Indenture
and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Notes are exchangeable for
a like aggregate principal amount of Notes of a like tenor and of a different
authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

No service charge shall be made for any such transfer or exchange, but
the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any taxes or other
governmental charge payable in connection with the registration of such transfer
or exchange, other than certain exchanges not involving any transfer.

Certain terms used in this Note which are defined in the Indenture have
the meanings set forth therein.

This Note shall for all purposes be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may
treat the Person in whose name this Note is registered as the owner hereof for
the purpose of receiving payment as herein provided and for all other purposes,
whether or not this Note be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor
any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
