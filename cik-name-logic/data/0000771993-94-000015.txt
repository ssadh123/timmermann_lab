Item 5. Other Events

On Thursday, July 14, 1994, Intelogic Trace, Inc. issued a
press release which announced that it is engaged in discussions
with its largest bondholders to explore the restructuring of the
company's debt. The company currently has $49.9 million in
11.99% subordinated debentures outstanding which are due on July
15, 1996. The company also announced today that the $2.99
million interest payment due on July 15, 1994 on its 11.99%
subordinated debentures will not be made tomorrow. In its
discussions, the company has principally been dealing with
Fidelity Management & Research Company with a view towards
promptly reaching an agreement on an equity for debt exchange.

Mark S. Helwege, President and Chief Executive Officer,
stated: "We look forward to a restructuring which will
strengthen our company, benefit our customers, employees, and all
parties concerned by providing I T with an excellent opportunity
to succeed in its mission of providing quality service and
support in the industries we serve." 

The Company noted in its latest Form 10-Q report that if the
$2.99 million interest payment is not made on or before August
15, 1994, an event of default could be declared which could
result in the acceleration of the obligation to make payment of
the principal and accrued interest. The company declined to make
any comment as to whether the company will make the interest
payment in the future.
