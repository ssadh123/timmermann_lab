REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors and Stockholders
New Line Cinema Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of New Line Cinema
Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of New
Line Cinema Corporation and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 1993 in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

NEW LINE CINEMA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1993

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ORGANIZATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

New Line Cinema Corporation (the "Company") is a motion picture production and
distribution company. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three
months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

FILM INVENTORIES

Film inventories consist of the cost of the Company's productions, acquired
films, prints and certain exploitation costs including advertising costs
expected to benefit the films in future markets, the cost of acquiring certain
rights for domestic home video and foreign distribution of certain films and
capitalized interest and overhead related to production of films and acquisition
of film rights. Such inventories are stated at the lower of unamortized costs or
net realizable value generally on a film-by-film basis. The costs of films
released are amortized using the individual-film-forecast-computation method
which amortizes costs in the same ratio that current gross revenues bear to
anticipated total gross revenues. The costs of distribution rights are amortized
in the same ratio that fees earned in the current period from the rights bear to
anticipated total fees. Such anticipated total gross revenues and fees are
estimated by management.

The anticipated total gross revenue and fees are reviewed periodically, which
may result in revised amortization rates and, when applicable, write-downs to
net realizable value.

Film inventories, net of accumulated amortization, approximated the following:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
DECEMBER 31,
---------------------------
1993 1992
------------ ------------
<S> <C> <C>
Films released $104,269,000 $ 62,784,000
Films completed but not released 18,712,000 41,519,000
Films in process 88,813,000 30,557,000
Distribution rights 9,656,000 12,915,000
------------ ------------
$221,450,000 $147,775,000
------------ ------------
------------ ------------
</TABLE>

Based on the Company's anticipated total gross revenue estimates, over 95% of
released film inventories at December 31, 1993 will be amortized within the
three-year period ending December 31, 1996.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT; DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The
estimated useful life used for property and equipment is ten years, while the
life used for computer hardware and software is three years. Leasehold
improvements are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related assets
or the remaining term of the lease, whichever is shorter.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenue from theatrical exhibition of films is reflected in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements when the film is exhibited. Revenue from the
sale of film rights, principally for the home video, domestic and

6

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

foreign syndicated television and domestic pay cable television markets is
recognized when the film is available for showing or exploitation. Amounts
received prior to the film's availability are classified as deferred income.

Films with theatrical releases (which generally may continue for up to six
months) are generally made available for release in other media as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
MONTHS AFTER
INITIAL APPROXIMATE
MARKET RELEASE RELEASE PERIOD
------------------------------------------------------- -------------- --------------
<S> <C> <C>
Domestic home video 4-6 months --
Domestic pay-per view 6-9 months 3 months
Domestic pay television 10-18 months 12-21 months
Domestic network or basic cable 30-36 months 18-36 months
Domestic syndication 30-36 months 3-15 years
Foreign theatrical -- 4-6 months
Foreign home video 6-12 months --
Foreign television 18-24 months 18-30 months
</TABLE>

For the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, approximately 39%, 44% and
63%, respectively, of the Company's total revenue was attributable to four
films, six films and four films, respectively.

Foreign revenue related to the Company's films approximated 19%, 24% and 11% of
total revenue for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively.

THIRD-PARTY PARTICIPATIONS

Total expected third-party participations are charged to expense in the same
ratio as current gross revenues bear to anticipated total gross revenues. At
December 31, 1993, the portion of third-party participations payable within one
year was approximately $13 million.

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISKS

The Company licenses various rights in its motion pictures to distributors
throughout the world. Generally, payment is received in full or in part, or
letters of credit are obtained, prior to the Company's release of the films to
its distributors.

INCOME TAXES

Deferred income taxes result from timing differences between the amounts
reported for financial reporting and income tax purposes. These differences
relate primarily to the gain on issuance of stock by an affiliated company,
advertising and print expenditures, third-party participations, and film
amortization.

COMMON STOCK DATA

Primary and fully diluted net income per share of common stock and common stock
equivalents are based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock
and common stock equivalents outstanding.

TRANSACTIONS IN SHARES OF AFFILIATED COMPANIES

The Company recognizes as separate nonoperating income, gains and losses arising
from sales of previously unissued stock by a subsidiary or affiliate to outside
investors when such sales change the Company's percentage of ownership in such
companies.

NEW LINE CINEMA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Long-Term Debt: The fair values of the Company's long-term debt is estimated
using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Company's current incremental
borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. The Company
believes the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for these
instruments is approximately equal to their fair value.

RECLASSIFICATION

Certain amounts in 1991 and 1992 have been reclassified to conform to the 1993
presentation.

2. INVESTMENT IN AFFILIATED COMPANY

On October 26, 1990, the Company acquired from RHI Entertainment, Inc. ("RHI")
52.6% of RHI's outstanding capital stock for $8,700,000. A portion of the excess
of cost over the Company's equity in RHI, consists of goodwill of $850,000 which
is being amortized over a 20-year period and an option valued at $1,270,000 to
acquire additional shares of RHI capital stock. The investment is accounted for
under the equity method, as the Company does not have majority voting control of
RHI. The Company has the right to designate two of the five members of RHI's
board of directors and all major decisions as to the financing and operations of
RHI require a super majority vote of the board of directors of RHI. RHI is a
leading producer of movies-of-the-week, mini-series and other programming for
the United States television market. RHI has acquired the worldwide televisions
rights of Qintex Entertainment Inc., including Hal Roach and Robert Halmi
titles. In April 1992, in exchange for $561,000 paid by the Company to one of
the principals of RHI, such principal cancelled an option to acquire shares of
common stock of RHI owned by the Company.

On July 29, 1992, RHI issued 2,315,000 shares of common stock at $10 per share,
in an initial public offering, resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of
$23,150,000. This issuance reduced the Company's interest in the capital stock
of RHI to 37.4%. As a result, the Company recognized a gain of $4,335,000
(before provision for income taxes of $1,647,000) which reflects a reduction by
$3,512,000 in the carried amount of its investment which was deemed sold. Income
taxes provided on the gain are not payable until the gain is recognized for tax
purposes, such as from an actual sale of RHI stock by the Company.

Summary financial information for RHI as of and for the years ended December 31,
1993, 1992 and 1991 is as follows:

On March 26, 1993, the Company entered into a new credit facility (the "Credit
Facility") providing a revolving credit facility of $150,000,000 for a period of
three years. Except for the increase in principal amount and a restriction on
the amounts of permitted increases in selling, general and administrative
expenses, the terms of the Credit Facility do not materially differ from the
Company's previous credit facility.

The Credit Facility contains various covenants which, among other things, (i)
provide that minimum consolidated tangible net worth, as defined, must be
maintained by the Company, (ii) limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness,
(iii) prohibit the payment of cash dividends as long as an outstanding loan
balance exists, (iv) limit the amount of certain capital expenditures, (v) limit
the amount of certain production and preproduction costs per film in active
production or preproduction, for a maximum of eight such films at any one time
and no more than three such films to be in principal photography at any one
time, (vi) restrict the amount to be paid to acquire rights in films produced by
others, and (vii) require that the Company's Chief Executive Officer maintain
his ownership of the Company, as defined, and remain as its Chief Executive
Officer.

Other information relating to the note payable under the existing and prior
credit facilities during the three year period ended December 31, 1993 is
summarized as follows:

</TABLE>

Interest paid under the Credit Facility (net of capitalized amounts) amounted to
approximately $1,535,000, $437,000 and $99,000 in 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively.

In 1993, the Company also paid approximately $74,000 of interest related to a
$40,000,000 advance received from Columbia TriStar Home Video and $324,000
relating to other funds.

Commitment fees under the agreements were $562,000, $249,000 and $234,000 for
each of the three years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

On January 28, 1994, the Company repaid all amounts owed under the Credit
Facility with funds received from the Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. ("TBS").
(See Note 12).

4. LONG-TERM DEBT

On November 14, 1991, the Company issued $30,000,000 of convertible subordinated
debentures which are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of the
Company's common stock at $16 7/8 per share, for a total of 1,777,778 shares.
The debentures are payable with interest at 6 1/2% payable semiannually and are
due November 15, 2006. Annual sinking fund payments of $3,500,000, commencing
November 15, 2000, are calculated to retire 70% of the debentures prior to
maturity. The debentures are redeemable at the option of

9
<PAGE> 12

NEW LINE CINEMA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

the Company, in whole or in part, at the following redemption prices together
with accrued and unpaid interest commencing on each November 15 in the years set
forth as follows:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
1994 103%
1995 102%
1996 101%
1997 and thereafter 100%
</TABLE>

The debentures were not redeemable by the Company before November 15, 1993 and
from that date until November 15, 1994, are not redeemable unless the average
price of the Company's common stock for a defined period exceeds 150% of the
conversion price.

In December 1993, certain holders converted $875,000 of the debentures into
51,851 shares of common stock. The Company accounted for the conversion using
the book method where the converted value of the debt is equal to the increase
in equity. $29,125,000 of debentures were outstanding at December 31, 1993.

For the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, the Company incurred
interest charges of $1,950,000, $1,950,000 and $244,000, respectively, of which
approximately $1,852,000, $1,853,000 and $215,000 was capitalized. Interest paid
(net of capitalized amounts) amounted to $100,000 in 1993.

5. INCOME TAXES

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company changed its method of accounting for
income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method required by FASB
Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". As permitted under the new
rules, prior years' financial statements have not been restated.

The cumulative effect of adopting Statement 109 as of January 1, 1993 was not
material. As of December 31, 1993 the Company has a federal net operating loss
carryforward of approximately $16 million for income tax purposes that expires
in the year 2008. This carryforward resulted primarily from a deduction related
to the exercise of employee stock options.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of
the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 1993 and
1992 are as follows:

7. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

LEGAL MATTERS

In December 1992, the Company was named as a defendant in an action brought by
Troma, Inc. in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York.
The action seeks unspecified damages in an amount "no less than $50 million" for
breach of an agreement which allegedly required the Company to produce and
distribute a film based upon the characters owned by the plaintiff. No answer
has yet been filed, and the Company is considering its possible counterclaims
against the plaintiff and its principal officers.

In June 1990, an action was brought against the Company in the Supreme Court,
New York County, by Smart Egg Pictures, S.A., one of the joint ventures with the
Company in the first two "Nightmare on Elm

11
<PAGE> 14

NEW LINE CINEMA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

Street" films. The plaintiff alleges that the Company wrongfully induced it to
enter into an agreement diminishing its rights in the joint venture assets. The
action seeks an accounting and damages of at least $5,000,000, together with
punitive damages and treble damages under the RICO laws, in connection with the
series of "A Nightmare on Elm Street" films.

The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various other legal proceedings,
all of which are considered routine and incidental to the business of the
Company and are not material to the financial condition and operation of the
business. Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party to any
litigation, including the matters described above, which is expected to have a
material adverse effect upon the Company's business.

ACQUISITION OF DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS

In addition to the Film inventories recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet
at December 31, 1993, the Company is contractually committed to advancing funds,
in accordance with contract terms, for the acquisition rights to films which
will be completed subsequent to December 31, 1993. These unrecorded contractual
commitments were approximately $56 million at December 31, 1993.

8. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

PENSION EXPENSE

Certain employees of certain subsidiaries of the Company are covered under
collective bargaining agreements. All such union employees are covered by
multiemployer defined benefit pension plans. The Company makes contributions to
such plans based on amounts specified in the related union contracts. The unions
have informed the Company that they are unable to provide the actuarial present
values of accumulated plan benefits or the plan's net assets available for
benefits with respect to any individual firm, including the Company. The Company
contributed approximately $2,498,000, $1,531,000 and $755,000 during the years
ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively, to such plans.

EXECUTIVE BENEFIT TRUST

Effective November 1, 1991, the Company established the New Line Cinema
Corporation Executive Benefit Trust (the "Trust") to provide incentive
compensation to certain executive employees. The Trust is not intended to
provide retirement income to employees, or to provide for a deferral of income
by employees for periods extending to the termination of covered employment or
beyond.

401(k) PLAN

In December 1992, the Company adopted a 401(k) defined contribution plan (the
"Plan") for certain of its employees. Employees can make voluntary contributions
to the Plan subject to certain limitations. Eligible employees are those who
have reached age 21 and have worked at least 1,000 hours. No contribution was
made to the Plan by the Company in 1992 or 1993.

9. CAPITAL STOCK

RESERVED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

At December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, the Company had reserved 3,359,616,
3,083,637 and 2,722,003 shares, respectively, of common stock for grant and
exercise of stock options. In addition, shares reserved for future issuance
include 1,725,926 shares for the conversion of the 6.5% convertible subordinated
debentures (see Note 4) and 250,000 shares reserved for Nelson Holdings
International, Ltd. (see Note 11). Solely as a result of the completion of a

Chairman was granted options to purchase

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

approximately 925,305 additional shares of common stock at the market price of
the common stock on February 26, 1993, pursuant to the operation of the
provisions of his Employment Agreement. The terms of this Employment Agreement
provide the Company's Chairman the ability to maintain his holdings at
approximately 25% of the outstanding common stock of the Company (as defined).

10. STOCK OPTIONS

1990 STOCK OPTION PLAN

On February 18, 1990, the Company adopted the 1990 Stock Option Plan (the "1990
Plan") under which a committee of independent members of the Board of Directors
is authorized to grant options for 750,000 shares under the 1990 Plan, to any
full-time employee, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends and
certain other events. The 1990 Plan is similar to the 1986 Plan, except that
options under the 1990 Plan may be incentive stock options and the grant may
allow options to be exercised by the surrender of common stock or options to
acquire Common stock having a market value equal to the aggregate exercise price
of the option. As of December 31, 1993, options for a total of 709,199 shares of
common stock had been granted of which 675,354 were outstanding.

1991 STOCK OPTION PLAN

On January 14, 1992, the Company's Board of Directors adopted a new Stock Option
Plan (the "1991 Plan"), which is identical to the 1990 Plan except that options
for a total of 250,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock may be granted
thereunder. As of December 31, 1993, options for a total of 200,000 shares of
common stock had been granted under the 1991 Plan, all of which are outstanding.

certain securities of the Company comprised of 150,000 shares of common stock
and five-year warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock at $13.87 per

acquisition of foreign distribution rights and domestic home video distribution
rights to the 11 motion pictures to be produced by Castle Rock Entertainment
through 1995 ("Castle Rock Pictures"). The Company's financial

portion of this loan. There can be no assurance that funds will be available
under the CLBN facility for the purchase of rights in connection with a Castle
Rock Picture. The Company's ability to distribute the remaining Castle Rock
Pictures is predicted upon the continued availability of funds from CLBN or from
other sources.

On November 27, 1991, the Company acquired the stock of Sultan Entertainment
Holdings Inc. for $100,000 in cash and contributed the stock to the New Line
Cinema Corporation Executive Benefit Trust (see Note 8).

$20.75 per share of TBS's Class B Common Stock. The maximum number of Class B
common shares issuable pursuant to the Merger is approximately 21,312,000.

The accompanying Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial
Information gives effect to (i) the acquisition by TBS of Castle Rock together
with the acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in HB Holding Co. (together,
the "Acquisitions") and (ii) the Acquisitions together with the Merger with New
Line Cinema. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Operations
for the year ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 present the pro forma combined
results of the continuing operations of TBS, Castle Rock, HB Holding Co. and New
Line for those periods assuming that (i) the Acquisitions and (ii) the
Acquisitions together with the Merger had occurred at the beginning of the
periods presented. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet at
December 31, 1993 presents the pro forma condensed combined financial position
of TBS, which includes the Acquisitions, and New Line assuming that the Merger
had occurred at that date.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information is
provided for informational purposes only and does not purport to be indicative
of the future results or financial position of TBS or what the results of
operations or financial position would have been had (i) the Acquisitions or
(ii) the Acquisitions together with the Merger been effected on the dates
indicated. This information should be read in conjunction with the historical
financial statements, including the related notes thereto, and "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"
contained in TBS's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
1993. This information should also be read in conjunction with the historical
financial statements and related notes thereto of New Line included herein.

The accompanying Unaudited Pro Form Condensed Combined Financial
Information is based on TBS's preliminary review of New Line. TBS has not
received any appraisals or valuations from independent third parties of the
assets or properties of New Line. However, the pro forma information presented
below may be adjusted once complete information on the fair value of all of New
Line's assets and liabilities is developed and once a more thorough review of
New Line's operating and accounting policies and procedures has been completed.

TBS currently intends to redeem the New Line Debentures as soon as possible
under the terms thereof after closing the Merger. The New Line Debentures are
redeemable at the earlier of (i) November 15, 1994 or (ii) such point in time
that the average price of the common stock into which the New Line Debentures
are convertible exceeds 150% of the conversion price for a defined period.

The excess of the total purchase price over the net assets acquired
consists of:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Total purchase price.................................................... $456,224
Less: net assets acquired of $124,931 plus $29,125 for the assumed

</TABLE>

The excess purchase price over net assets acquired in connection with the
Merger has been allocated in the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance
Sheet as follows:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Film costs.............................................................. $ 50,000
Investment in RHI....................................................... 25,000
Goodwill and other intangible assets.................................... 261,521

</TABLE>

New Line currently owns approximately 37% of RHI. TBS management has
considered a number of alternatives regarding New Line's investment in RHI
following the Merger but has not yet made any decision with respect thereto.
Such alternatives include the possible disposition of further acquisition of
shares of RHI. Valuation included herein is based on the 52-week average of RHI
stock price, multiplied by the number of shares owned, less book value.

(b) To reclassify New Line's unclassified balance sheet to provide for current
and long-term assets and liabilities.

(c) Assumes TBS incurs new debt to retire the current New Line credit facility
of $126,800. All of the outstanding New Line Debentures are assumed to be
converted into shares of TBS Class B Common Stock.

(d) To eliminate historical equity and affect retained earnings for the above
adjustments.

NOTE 2. CASTLE ROCK ADJUSTMENTS TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED
STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS

(a) To record additional salary expense for new employment agreements with
Castle Rock management as if the agreements were in effect during the
periods presented.

<PAGE> 6

(b) To record amortization of adjustments to goodwill and other intangible
assets acquired in connection with the Castle Rock acquisition using an
estimated life of 20 years.

(c) To record interest expense related to incremental indebtedness incurred to
finance the purchase price for the Castle Rock acquisition and to record
the effect of refinancing Castle Rock's existing long-term debt.

(d) To adjust the provision for income taxes to reflect the tax impact assuming
the Castle Rock acquisition occurred at the beginning of the periods
presented.

NOTE 3. HB HOLDING CO. ADJUSTMENTS TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED
STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS

(a) To eliminate intercompany revenue associated with the license of film
rights between TBS and HB Holding Co.

(b) To eliminate the distribution fee payable to TBS by HB Holding Co.

(c) To record amortization of adjustments to assets using an estimated life of
20 years.

(d) To eliminate TBS service fees charged to HB Holding Co.

(e) To record interest expense related to the incremental indebtedness incurred
to finance the cash purchase price of HB Holding Co. and to record (i) the
effect of refinancing HB Holding Co.'s existing indebtedness and (ii) the
continuing effect of interest rate swap agreements entered into by HB
Holding Co.

For purposes of the pro forma calculations, TBS has assumed that the
existing interest rate swap agreements of HB Holding Co. will remain in
place. HB Holding Co. entered into such interest rate swap agreements with
a total notional principal amount of $130,000 in January 1992 to mitigate
against possible rising interest rates. Each contract expires in January
1995. For purposes of the pro forma presentation, TBS has included the
effect of the differential between the interest rates under such swap
agreements and TBS's incremental borrowing rate under its credit facility.
The differential to be paid on the interest rate swaps was estimated to be
approximately $2,200 and was included in the pro forma adjustments as
interest expense.

(f) To eliminate TBS's equity in (income) loss of HB Holding Co.

(g) To adjust the provision for income taxes to reflect the tax impact assuming
the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the periods presented.

NOTE 4. NEW LINE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED
STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS

(a) To record amortization of adjustments to assets made in connection with the
Merger using estimated lives of 20 to 40 years.

(b) To record additional salary expense for the New Employment Agreements as if
the agreements were in effect during the periods presented.

(c) To eliminate interest expense related to New Line Debentures assumed to be
converted.

(d) To adjust the provision for income taxes to reflect the tax impact assuming
the Merger occurred at the beginning of the periods presented.
