Item 5. Other Events.

Bell Atlantic Corporation (the "Company") today said that rumors that the
Company intends to cut its dividend are totally false. The Company does not
intend to cut its dividend as a result of its pending merger with
TeleCommunications, Inc. ("TCI") and Liberty Media Corporation ("Liberty").

The Company also confirmed that negotiations on that transaction are
proceeding satisfactorily. The proposed merger is an exceedingly complex
transaction, and, as in any negotiation, various elements may be modified. It
is the Company's intention that the final financial terms of the transaction
will not differ significantly from the Letter of Intent executed by the
Company, TCI and Liberty on October 12, 1993.
