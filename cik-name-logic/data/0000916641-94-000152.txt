NOTES TO COMBINED SUMMARIES OF REVENUES AND CERTAIN RENTAL EXPENSES

The combined summaries of revenues and certain rental expenses
reflect the operations of Copperfield Apartments, Mediterranean Village
Apartments, Briar Club Apartments, Covington Crossing Apartments, and Hunters
Trace Apartments (the "Properties") for the year ended December 31, 1993 based
upon the audited statement of rental operations of the properties appearing
elsewhere herein and for the nine month period ended September 30, 1994
based upon the unaudited combined statements of rental operations of the
properties through the date on which it was acquired. During 1993 and a
portion of 1994, the properties were owned and operated by an entity other
than United Dominion Realty Trust (the "Trust").

The summaries have been prepared on the accrual method of accounting.
Rental expenses include repair and maintenance expenses, utilities, real
estate taxes, property management fees and certain other expenses. In
accordance with the regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
mortgage interest expense, depreciation, and general and administrative costs
have been excluded from operating expenses, as they are dependent upon a
particular owner, purchase price or financial arrangement.

In assessing the properties, management considered the existing and
potential tenant base, expected job growth in the area, occupancy rates, the
competitive nature of the market and comparative rental rates. Furthermore,
current and anticipated maintenance and repair costs, real estate taxes and
anticipated capital improvements were assessed.
