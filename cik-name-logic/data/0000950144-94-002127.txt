Item 5. Other Events.

At approximately 3:00 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, Friday, December 9,
1994, the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") issued an Airworthiness
Directive prohibiting all ATR-42 and ATR-72 aircraft from flight into forecast
or reported "icing conditions" (the "December 9, 1994, Airworthiness
Directive").

Atlantic Southeast Airlines, Inc. (the "Company") currently operates
12 ATR-72 aircraft (the "ATRs") from its hubs in Dallas/Fort Worth (8 aircraft)
and Atlanta (4 aircraft). The ATR-72 is a 66 passenger aircraft, powered by
two Pratt & Whitney turbo-prop engines, and is built by Avions de Transport
Regionale, a joint enterprise involving Alenia-Aeritalia & Selenia S.P.A., an
Italian aircraft manufacturer, and Aerospatiale Societe Nationale Industrielle,
a French aircraft manufacturer. The Company accepted delivery of eight new
ATR-72 aircraft during the second and third quarters of 1993 and accepted
delivery of four additional ATR-72 aircraft in the second quarter of 1994.

As of December 14, 1994, the Company's operating fleet consisted of 83
turbo-prop airplanes, including the 12 ATRs. The rest of the Company's
operating fleet is comprised of 60 aircraft that seat 30 passengers each and 11
aircraft that seat 15 passengers each. Prior to the issuance of the December
9, 1994, Airworthiness Directive, the ATRs generated approximately 30 percent
of the scheduled available seat miles ("ASMs") flown by the Company's aircraft.

The Company is complying with the December 9, 1994, Airworthiness
Directive. After the release of the December 9, 1994, Airworthiness Directive,
the Company determined that it would assess forecast and reported weather
conditions, in conjunction with customer service concerns and other relevant
factors, and decide whether any or all scheduled operations of ATR-72 aircraft
must be cancelled to comply with the December 9, 1994, Airworthiness Directive.

The implementation of the December 9, 1994, Airworthiness Directive
could have a material adverse effect on the Company's operations.
