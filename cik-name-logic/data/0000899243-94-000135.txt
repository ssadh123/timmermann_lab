ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

(a) On April 27, 1994 at the Zapata Corporation (the "Company") 1994
Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the 1-for-5 reverse stock split (the
"Reverse Stock Split") of the Company's outstanding Common Stock (the
"Common Stock") was approved by the stockholders of the Company. This
Reverse Stock Split became effective at 5:00 (E.D.T.) on May 2, 1994
and reduced the number of outstanding shares of the Company's Common
Stock from approximately 158,300,000 to approximately 31,700,000.

The number of authorized shares shall remain at 165,000,000 and the
par value of the Common Stock will remain at $0.25 per share. The
total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock held by each
stockholder will be converted into a right to receive an amount of
whole shares of Common Stock after the Reverse Stock Split equal to
the number of shares owned immediately prior to the Reverse Stock
Split divided by five. In lieu of any fractional share interests, each
holder of Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fractional share of Common Stock after the Reverse Stock Split will be
paid cash upon the surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing Common Stock held by such holder in an amount equal to
the product of such fraction multiplied by the closing price of the
Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the first trading date
after the effective date of the Reverse Stock Split.

In connection with the Reverse Stock Split, the Company filed its
Certificate of Amendment to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation
on May 2, 1994 with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware
(the "Secretary of State") making the Reverse Stock Split effective.
On May 3, 1994, the Company filed with the Secretary of State a
Certificate of Retirement and a Certificate of Elimination to retire
and eliminate those series of the Company's capital stock which are no
longer outstanding. Also on May 3, 1994, the Company filed its
Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State,
which is filed as Exhibit 3(a) hereto and incorporated herein by
reference.

(b) The information set forth in the press release issued by Zapata
Corporation on April 27, 1994 and filed as Exhibit 99(a) hereto is
incorporated herein by reference.

The following is a statement of the designations and the powers,
preferences and rights and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions, of
the classes of stock of the corporation.

I. PREFERRED STOCK

1. ISSUANCE IN SERIES. The Preferred Stock may be issued in one or
more series, consisting of such series as may be established and designated from
time to time by the board of directors as hereinafter provided. The board of
directors is hereby vested with authority to establish and designate any
unissued shares of Preferred Stock as additional shares of an existing series of
such stock or as a new series of such stock and the voting powers, full or
limited, or the absence of voting powers, and the designations, powers,
preferences and relative and other special rights and the qualifications,
limitations and restrictions of the Preferred Stock of any such new series shall
be such as are stated and expressed herein and, to the extent not stated and
expressed herein, shall be such as may be fixed by the board of directors and
stated and expressed in a resolution or resolutions adopted by the board of
directors providing for the issuance of Preferred Stock of such series. Such
resolution or resolutions shall (a) specify the series to which such Preferred
Stock shall belong; (b) specify the annual rate of dividends payable on shares
of such series; (c) fix the amount which the holders of shares of such series
shall be entitled to be paid in the event of any liquidation, dissolution

1
<PAGE>

or winding up of the corporation; (d) state at what times and under what
conditions the shares of such series shall be redeemable and the amount or
amounts payable thereon in the event of redemption; and may, in a manner not
inconsistent with the provisions of this Article FOURTH, (i) limit the number of
shares of such series which may be issued, (ii) provide for a sinking fund for
the purchase or redemption, or a purchase fund for the purchase of shares of
such series and the terms and provisions governing the operation of any such
fund and the status as to reissuance of shares purchased or otherwise reacquired
or redeemed or retired through the operation thereof, and that so long as the
corporation is in default as to such sinking or purchase fund the corporation
shall not (with such exceptions, if any, as may be provided) pay any dividends
upon or purchase or redeem shares of capital stock ranking junior to the
Preferred Stock with respect to dividends or distribution of assets upon
liquidation (referred to herein as "stock ranking junior to the Preferred
Stock"), (iii) impose conditions or restrictions upon the creation of
indebtedness of the corporation or upon the issue of additional Preferred Stock
or other capital stock ranking on a parity therewith or prior thereto with
respect to dividends or distribution of assets upon liquidation, (iv) impose
conditions or restrictions upon the payment of dividends upon, or the making of
other distributions to, or the acquisition of, stock ranking junior to the
Preferred Stock, (v) grant to the holders of shares of such series the right to
convert such shares into shares of stock ranking junior to the Preferred Stock
and (vi) grant such other special rights to the holders of shares of such series
as the board of directors may determine and as shall not be inconsistent with
the provisions of this Article FOURTH; and (e) specify the voting powers, full
or limited, or the absence of voting powers that the holders of shares of such
series shall have, provided that the holders of the shares of such series shall
not have more than one vote for each such share held. The term "fixed for such
series" and similar terms as used in this Part I of Article FOURTH shall mean
stated and expressed in this Part I of Article FOURTH or in a resolution or
resolutions adopted by the board of directors providing for the issue of
Preferred Stock of the series referred to therein.

2. DIVIDENDS. The holders of the Preferred Stock of each series shall
be entitled to receive, when and as declared by the board of directors, out of
any funds legally available therefor, cumulative preferential dividends, in
cash, at the rate per annum fixed for such series, and no more, payable quarter
yearly on the first days of January, April, July and October in each year to
stockholders of record on the date, not exceeding forty (40) days preceding each
such dividend payment date, fixed for the purpose by the board of directors.
Dividends on shares of the Preferred Stock shall accrue from the dividend
payment date immediately preceding the date of issuance (unless the date of
issuance shall be a dividend payment date, in which case they shall occur from
the date), or from such other date or dates as may be fixed in this Article
FOURTH or by the board of directors for any series, and shall be cumulative.
Each share of Preferred Stock shall rank on a parity with each other share of
Preferred Stock, irrespective of series, with respect to preferential dividends
at the respective rates fixed for such series, and no dividends shall be
declared or paid or set apart for payment for the Preferred Stock of any series
unless at the same time a dividend in like proportion to the accrued and unpaid
dividends upon the Preferred Stock of each other series shall be declared or
paid or set apart for payment, as the case may be, on Preferred Stock of each
other series then outstanding.

<PAGE>

3. DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS ON JUNIOR STOCK. So long as any shares of
Preferred Stock are outstanding, the corporation shall not pay or declare any
dividends whatsoever, whether in cash, stock or otherwise, or make any
distribution on the Common Stock or any other class of stock ranking junior to
the Preferred Stock in respect of dividends or distribution of assets upon
liquidation, or purchase or retire or otherwise acquire for a consideration any
shares of stock ranking junior to the Preferred Stock in respect of dividends or
assets, unless all dividends on the Preferred Stock of all series for all past
quarter yearly dividend periods shall have been paid or declared and a sum
sufficient for the payment thereof set apart, and the full dividends thereon for
the then current quarter yearly dividend period shall have been paid or
declared.

4. REDEMPTION. The corporation, at the option of the board of
directors, may redeem the Preferred Stock of any series, at the time or times
and on the terms and conditions fixed for such series, upon notice duly given as
hereinafter provided, by paying therefor in cash the sum fixed for such series,
together, in each case, with an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends
thereon. The term "accrued and unpaid dividends" as used herein with respect to
Preferred Stock of any series shall mean dividends on all outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock of such series at the rate fixed for such series, from the date
or dates from which such dividends accrued to the date as of which accrued and
unpaid dividends are being determined, less the aggregate amount of all
dividends theretofore declared and paid or set apart for payment upon such
outstanding Preferred Stock.

At least thirty (30) and not more than sixty (60) days' previous
notice of any such redemption of Preferred Stock shall be mailed, addressed to
the holders of record of the shares to be redeemed, at their respective
addresses as the same shall appear on the books of the corporation, and such
notice may also be published in a newspaper printed in the English language and
published daily for at least five (5) days per calendar week (other than legal
holidays) and of general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of
New York, State of New York, and in the City of Houston, State of Texas.

In case of the redemption of only part of the Preferred Stock of any
series at the time outstanding, at the option of the board of directors such
redemption shall be made pro rata or the shares of such series to be redeemed
shall be chosen by lot in such manner as may be prescribed by the board of
directors.

If such notice of redemption shall have been duly given by publication
as aforesaid, at least thirty (30) days prior to the redemption date, and if on
or before the redemption date specified in such notice all funds necessary for
such redemption shall have been set aside by the corporation, separate and apart
from its other funds, in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the
shares so called for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available
therefor, then from and after the date of redemption so designated,
notwithstanding that any certificate for shares of Preferred Stock so called for
redemption shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the shares
represented thereby shall no longer be deemed outstanding, the right to receive
dividends thereon shall cease to accrue, and all rights with respect to such
shares of Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall forthwith on such
redemption date cease and terminate except only the right of the holders thereof
to receive the redemption price of such shares so to be redeemed but without
interest thereon.

<PAGE>

The corporation may, however, prior to the redemption date specified
in the notice of redemption, deposit in trust for the account of the holders of
the Preferred Stock to be redeemed, with a bank or trust company in good
standing organized under the laws of the United States of America or of the
State of New York, doing business in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New
York, State of New York, or the City of Houston, State of Texas, and having
capital, surplus, and undivided profits aggregating at least $10,000,000,
designated in such notice of redemption, all funds necessary for such
redemption, together with irrevocable written instructions authorizing such bank
or trust company on behalf and at the expense of the corporation, to cause the
notice of redemption to be duly mailed and the publication of such notice to be
made as herein provided at least thirty (30) days prior to the redemption date,
and to include in said notice of redemption a statement that all funds necessary
for such redemption have been so deposited in trust and are immediately
available, and thereupon, notwithstanding that any certificate for shares of
Preferred Stock so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered for
cancellation, all shares of Preferred Stock with respect to which such deposit
shall have been made shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding, and all rights
with respect to such shares of Preferred Stock shall forthwith, upon such
deposit in trust, cease and terminate, except only the right of the holders
thereof to receive from such bank or trust company at any time after the time of
such deposit, the redemption price of such shares so to be redeemed, and the
right, if any, of the holders thereof to convert such shares into other stock of
the corporation.

Any moneys so deposited by the corporation and unclaimed at the end of
six (6) months from the date fixed for such redemption shall be repaid to the
corporation upon its request expressed in a resolution of its board of
directors, after which repayment the holders of the shares so called for
redemption shall look only to the corporation for payment thereof. Any moneys
deposited by the corporation which shall not be required for redemption because
of the exercise of any right of conversion or exchange subsequent to the date of
the deposit and any interest accrued on any moneys so deposited, shall be repaid
to the corporation upon similar request.

5. LIQUIDATION OR DISSOLUTION. In the event of any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the corporation, then, before any
distribution or payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock or any
other class of stock of the corporation ranking junior to the Preferred Stock in
respect of dividends or distribution of assets on liquidation, the holders of
the Preferred Stock of the respective series shall be entitled to be paid in
full the respective amounts fixed for such series, plus in each case a sum equal
to accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date of payment thereof. After
such payment shall have been made in full to the holders of the Preferred Stock,
the remaining assets and funds of the corporation shall be distributed among the
holders of the stock of the corporation ranking junior to the Preferred Stock
according to their respective rights, in the event that the assets of the
corporation available for distribution to holders of Preferred Stock shall not
be sufficient to make the payment herein required to be made in full, such
assets shall be distributed to the holders of the respective shares of Preferred
Stock pro rata in proportion to the amounts payable hereunder upon each share
thereof.

6. STATUS OF SHARES REDEEMED OR RETIRED. Except as otherwise provided
in this Article FOURTH or in any resolution of the board of directors providing
for the issuance of any particular series of Preferred Stock, Preferred Stock
redeemed or otherwise retired by the corporation shall assume the status of
authorized but unissued Preferred Stock and may thereafter, subject to the
provisions of this Part I and of any restrictions contained in any resolution of
the board of directors providing for the issuance of any particular series of
Preferred Stock, be reissued in the same manner as other authorized but unissued
Preferred Stock.

7. RESTRICTIONS ON CERTAIN CORPORATE ACTION. So long as any shares of
any series of the Preferred Stock are outstanding (a) the corporation shall not,

shares of Preferred Stock at the time outstanding, given in person or by proxy,
either in writing or by vote at a special meeting called for the purpose, amend,

respect of dividends or distribution of assets on liquidation. Any action
specified in this Paragraph 7 as requiring the consent of the holders of at
least a specified proportion of the number of shares of Preferred Stock or of
any particular series thereof at the time outstanding or represented at a

hereinafter provided.

At least thirty (30) and not more than sixty (60) days' previous notice of
any such redemption of Preference Stock shall be mailed, addressed to the
holders of record of the shares to be redeemed, at their respective addresses as
the same shall appear on the books of the corporation.

In case of the redemption of only part of the Preference Stock of any

directors.

If such notice of redemption shall have been duly given as aforesaid, at
least thirty (30) days prior to the redemption date, and if on or before the
redemption date specified in such notice all funds necessary for such redemption
shall have been set aside by the corporation, separate and apart from its other
funds, in trust for the pro rata benefit of the holders of the shares so called
for redemption, so as to be and continue to be available therefor, then from and
after the date of redemption so designated, notwithstanding that any certificate
for shares of Preference Stock so called for redemption shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, the shares represented thereby shall no longer be
deemed outstanding, the right to receive dividends thereon shall cease to
accrue, and all rights with respect to such shares of Preference Stock so called
for redemption shall forthwith on such redemption date cease and terminate
except only the right of the holders thereof to receive the redemption price of
such shares so to be redeemed but without interest thereon.

The corporation may, however, prior to the redemption date specified in the
notice of redemption, deposit in trust for the account of the holders of the
Preference Stock to be redeemed, with a bank or trust company in good standing
organized under the laws of the United States of

8

such redemption, together with irrevocable written instructions authorizing such
bank or trust company, on behalf and at the expense of the corporation, to cause
the notice of redemption to be duly mailed as herein provided at least thirty
(30) days prior to the redemption date, and to include in said notice of

deposited in trust and are immediately available, and thereupon, notwithstanding
that any certificate for shares of Preference Stock so called for redemption
shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, all shares of Preference Stock
with respect to which such deposit shall have been made shall no longer be
deemed to be outstanding, and all rights with respect to such shares of
Preference Stock shall forthwith, upon such deposit in trust, cease and
terminate, except only the rights of the holders thereof to receive from such
bank or trust company at any time after the time of such deposit, the redemption
price of such shares so to be redeemed and the right, if any, of the holders
thereof to convert such shares into other stock of the corporation.

Any moneys so deposited by the corporation and unclaimed at the end of six
(6) months from the date fixed for such redemption shall be repaid to the
corporation upon its request expressed in a resolution of its board of
directors, after which repayment the holders of the shares so called for
redemption shall look only to the corporation for payment thereof. Any moneys
deposited by the corporation which shall not be required for redemption because
of the exercise of any right of conversion or exchange subsequent to the date of
the deposit, and any interest accrued on any moneys so deposited, shall be
repaid to the corporation upon similar request.

4. LIQUIDATION OR DISSOLUTION. In the event of any liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the corporation, subject to the
prior rights of the holders of any outstanding Preferred Stock as set forth in
Part I of this Article FOURTH or in any resolution of the board of directors
providing for the issuance of any series of Preferred Stock, the holders of the
Preference Stock of the respective series shall be entitled to such rights as
may be fixed for such series. After payment shall have been made in full to the
holders of Preferred Stock and Preference Stock having special rights to
payment, the remaining assets and funds of the corporation shall be distributed
among the holders of the junior stock of the corporation according to their
respective rights. In the event that the assets of the corporation available
for distribution to holders of Preference Stock having special rights to payment
shall not be sufficient to make the payment required to be made in full, such
assets shall be distributed to the holders of the respective shares of
Preference Stock having special rights to payment, pro rata in proportion to the
amounts payable upon each share thereof.

5. STATUS OF SHARES REDEEMED OR RETIRED. Except as otherwise provided
herein or in any resolution of the board of directors providing for the issuance
of any particular series of Preference Stock, Preference Stock redeemed or
otherwise retired by the corporation shall assume the status of authorized but
unissued Preference Stock and may thereafter, subject to the provisions of this
Part II and of any restrictions contained in any resolution of the board of
directors providing

9
<PAGE>

for the issuance of any particular series of Preference Stock, be reissued in
the same manner as other authorized but unissued Preference Stock.

6. RESTRICTIONS ON CERTAIN CORPORATE ACTION. So long as any shares of
any series of the Preference Stock are outstanding (a) the corporation shall
not, without the consent of the holders of at least a majority of the number of
shares of Preference Stock at the time outstanding, given in person or by proxy,
either in writing or by vote at a special meeting called for the purpose, amend,
alter or repeal any of the provisions of this Article FOURTH (other than
provisions relating exclusively to the shares of Preference Stock of a
particular series) so as to affect adversely the rights, powers or preferences
of the Preference Stock, and shall not, without the consent of the holders of at
least a majority of the number of shares of Preference Stock of such series at
the time outstanding, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or by a
vote at a special meeting called for the purpose, amend, alter or repeal any of
the provisions of this Article FOURTH or of any resolution or resolutions
relating exclusively to the shares of Preference Stock of such series, so as to
affect adversely the rights, powers or preferences of the Preference Stock of
such series, and (b) the corporation shall not, without the consent of the
holders of at least a majority of the number of shares of Preference Stock at
the time outstanding, given in person or by proxy, either in writing or by a
vote at a special meeting called for that purpose, increase the authorized
amount of Preference Stock or create or authorize any additional class of stock
ranking on a parity with or prior to the Preference Stock in respect of
dividends or distribution of assets on liquidation, or increase the authorized
amount of any additional class of stock ranking on a parity with or prior to the
Preference Stock in respect of dividends or distribution of assets on
liquidation or create or authorize any obligation or security convertible into
or evidencing the right to purchase shares of stock of any additional class
ranking on a parity with or prior to the Preference Stock in respect of
dividends or distribution of assets on liquidation. Any action specified in
this Paragraph 6 as requiring the consent of the holders of at least a specified
proportion of the number of shares of Preference Stock or of any particular
series thereof at the time outstanding or represented at a meeting may be taken
with such consent and with such additional vote or consent, if any, of
stockholders as may be from time to time required by this Certificate of
Incorporation, as amended from time to time, or by law.

7. VOTING RIGHTS. Each holder of Preference Stock of each series shall
have such voting rights as may be fixed for such series, and except as otherwise
provided herein or by law, the Preferred Stock, the Preference Stock having
voting rights and the Common Stock shall vote together as one class.

A. $2 NONCUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE PREFERENCE STOCK.

242,419 shares of the Preference Stock have been designated as $2
Noncumulative Convertible Preference Stock, and the powers, preferences and
relative and other special rights and the qualifications, limitations and
restrictions of the $2 Preference Stock, to the extent not heretofore
established, shall be as follows:

10
<PAGE>

1. Dividends. The holders of the $2 Preference Stock shall be
entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the board of directors and
out of the assets of the corporation which are by law available for the
payment of the dividends, noncumulative cash dividends payable quarterly on
the first days of January, April, July and October in each year to holders
of record on a record date, fixed by the board of directors, not more than
40 days preceding the dividend payment date, at the annual rate of $2 per
share, and no more. Dividends on any shares of $2 Preference Stock issued
prior to April 1, 1969 shall accrue from that date; dividends on shares of
$2 Preference Stock issued after April 1, 1969 shall accrue from the
dividend payment date next preceding the date of issue. So long as any $2
Preference Stock shall remain outstanding, no dividend whatsoever shall be
declared or paid upon or set apart for any class of stock or series thereof
ranking junior to the $2 Preference Stock in the payment of dividends nor
shall any shares of any class of stock or series thereof ranking junior to
the $2 Preference Stock in payment of dividends be redeemed or purchased by
the corporation or any subsidiary thereof nor shall any moneys be paid to
or made available for a sinking fund for the redemption or purchase of any
shares of any class of stock or series thereof ranking junior to the $2
Preference Stock in payment of dividends, unless in each instance dividends
on all outstanding shares of $2 Preference Stock for the then current
quarterly dividend period shall have been paid, or declared and sufficient
funds set aside for the payment thereof.

No dividend shall be declared on any share or shares of any other
series of Preference Stock or of any other class of stock or series thereof
ranking on a parity with the $2 Preference Stock in respect of payment of
dividends unless there shall have been declared on all shares then
outstanding of the $2 Preference Stock, for the same dividend period, or
for the dividend period of the $2 Preference Stock terminating within the
dividend period of said parity stock, like proportionate dividends,
ratably, in proportion to the $2 Preference Stock and said parity stock.
No shares of any other series of Preference Stock or of any such other
class or series ranking on a parity with the $2 Preference Stock in respect
of payment of dividends shall be redeemed or purchased by the corporation
or any subsidiary thereof nor shall any moneys be paid to or made available
for a sinking fund for any such redemption or purchase unless dividends at
the rate fixed hereby for the $2 Preference Stock for the then current
dividend period shall have been paid or declared and sufficient funds set
aside for payment thereof.

2. Preference on Liquidation. In the event of any voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the
corporation, after payment or provision for payment of the debts and other
liabilities of the corporation and any preferential amounts due to holders
of Preferred Stock, the holders of the $2 Preference Stock shall be
entitled to receive, out of the net assets of the corporation, $30 per
share, and no more, before any distribution shall be made to the holders of
the Common Stock or any other class of stock or series thereof ranking
junior to the $2 Preference Stock with respect to the distribution of
assets.

11
<PAGE>

Neither the merger nor consolidation of the corporation into or with
any other corporation, nor the merger or consolidation of any other
corporation into or with the corporation, nor a sale, transfer or lease of
all or any part of the assets of the corporation, shall be deemed to be a
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the corporation within the
meaning of this Paragraph 2.

Written notice of any voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the corporation, stating a
payment date and the place where the distributable amounts shall be payable
and containing a statement of or reference to the conversion right set
forth in Paragraph 5 of this Part IIA, shall be given by mail, postage
prepaid, not less than 30 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to
the holders of record of the $2 Preference Stock at their respective
addresses as the same shall appear on the books of the corporation.

No payment on account of such dissolution, liquidation or winding up
of the affairs of the corporation shall be made to the holders of any class
or series of stock ranking on a parity with the $2 Preference Stock in
respect to the distribution of assets, unless there shall likewise be paid
at the same time to the holders of the $2 Preference Stock like
proportionate distributive amounts, ratably, in proportion to the full
distributive amounts to which they and the holders of such parity stock are
respectively entitled with respect to such preferential distribution.

3. Redemption. Subject to the prior rights of the holders of any
outstanding Preferred Stock, the corporation shall have the right, at its
option and by resolution of its board of directors, to redeem at any time
after February 1, 1974 all or part of the shares of $2 Preference Stock
outstanding, upon payment in cash in respect of each share redeemed of $85
per share on or before February 1, 1977, and $80 per share after February
1, 1977.

4. Voting Rights. The holders of the $2 Preference Stock shall be
entitled to one vote per share, voting with the holders of any other class
of stock entitled to vote, without regard to class, on all matters to be
voted on by the stockholders of the corporation.

If at any time the equivalent of six or more full quarterly dividends
(whether or not consecutive) payable on the $2 Preference Stock shall be in
default, the number of directors constituting the board of directors of the
corporation shall be increased by two, and the holders of the $2 Preference
Stock shall have, in addition to the voting rights provided above, which
shall continue, the exclusive right, voting separately as one class, to
elect two directors to fill such newly created directorships. This right
shall remain vested until dividends on the $2 Preference Stock shall have
been paid for at least four consecutive quarters since the vesting of this
right, at which time (i) the right shall terminate (subject to revesting in
the case of any subsequent default of the kind described above); (ii) the
term of the directors then in office elected by the holders of the $2
Preference Stock as a class shall terminate; and (iii) the number of
directors constituting the board of directors of the corporation shall be
reduced by two.

12
<PAGE>

Whenever such right shall vest, it may be exercised initially either
at a special meeting of holders of $2 Preference Stock or at any annual
stockholders' meeting, but thereafter it shall be exercised only at annual
stockholders' meetings. A special meeting for the exercise of such right
shall be called by the Secretary of the corporation as promptly as
possible, and in any event within 10 days, after receipt of a written
request signed by the holders of record of at least 10% of the outstanding
shares of $2 Preference Stock. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
paragraph, no such special meeting shall be held during the 90-day period
preceding the date fixed for the annual meeting of stockholders.

Any director who shall have been elected by the holders of $2
Preference Stock as a class shall hold office for a term expiring (subject
to the earlier termination of the default in dividends) at the next annual
meeting of stockholders, and during such term may be removed at any time,
either for or without cause, by, and only by, the affirmative votes of the
holders of record of a majority of the outstanding shares of $2 Preference
Stock given at a special meeting of such stockholders called for the
purpose, and any vacancy created by such removal may also be filled at such
meeting. A meeting for the removal of a director elected by the holders of
$2 Preference Stock as a class and the filling of the vacancy created
thereby shall be called by the Secretary of the corporation within ten days
after receipt of a request therefor, signed by the holders of not less than
25% of the then outstanding shares of $2 Preference Stock. Such meeting
shall be held at the earliest practicable date thereafter.

Any vacancy caused by the death or resignation of a director who shall
have been elected by the holders of $2 Preference Stock as a class may be
filled only by the holders of $2 Preference Stock at a meeting called for
such purpose. Such meeting of the holders of $2 Preference Stock shall be
called by the Secretary of the corporation at the earliest practicable date
after any such death or resignation and in any event within 10 days after
receipt of a written request signed by the holders of record of at least
10% of the outstanding shares of $2 Preference Stock.

If any meeting of the holders of $2 Preference Stock required by this
Paragraph 4 to be called shall not have been called within ten days after
personal service of a written request therefor upon the Secretary of the
corporation or within 15 days after mailing the same within the United
States of America by registered mail addressed to the Secretary of the
corporation at its principal office, then the holders of record of at least
10% of the outstanding shares of $2 Preference Stock may designate in
writing one of their number to call such meeting at the expense of the
corporation and such meeting may be called by such person so designated
upon the notice required for annual meetings of stockholders. Any holder
of $2 Preference Stock so designated shall have access to the stock books
of the corporation for the purpose of causing meetings of stockholders to
be called pursuant to these provisions.

Any meeting of the holders of $2 Preference Stock to vote as a class
for the election or removal of directors shall be held at the place for the
holding of the annual meeting of the

13
<PAGE>

stockholders of the corporation. At such meeting, the presence in person
or by proxy of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of $2
Preference Stock shall be required to constitute a quorum; in the absence
of a quorum, a majority of the holders present in person or by proxy shall
have power to adjourn the meeting from time to time without notice, other
than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum shall be present.

So long as any shares of $2 Preference Stock are outstanding, the
corporation shall not, by amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation or
by-laws or by merger or consolidation or in any other manner authorize or
increase any class of stock ranking prior to the $2 Preference Stock either
as to the payment of dividends or distribution of assets upon liquidation,
or authorize or create or issue any security convertible into or evidencing
the right to purchase any such stock ranking prior to the $2 Preference
Stock, or change the preferences, powers, rights or limitations with
respect to the $2 Preference Stock, so as to affect adversely the rights,
powers or preferences of the $2 Preference Stock, without the affirmative
vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the $2 Preference Stock at
the time outstanding.

5. Convertibility. Shares of the $2 Preference Stock shall be
convertible into Common Stock of the corporation on the following terms and
conditions:

5A. The $2 Preference Stock shall be convertible, at the option of
the holder thereof, into shares of Common Stock of the corporation at the
rate in effect from time to time as hereinafter set forth, provided,
however, that as to any shares of $2 Preference Stock called for redemption
the right of conversion shall terminate at the close of business on the
fifth full business day prior to the date fixed for redemption. The
conversion rates in effect from time to time shall be the following, and
shall be subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided in Paragraph 5B to
protect against dilution:

(a) Prior to February 1, 1971, the conversion rate shall be
1.4 shares of Common Stock for each share of $2 Preference Stock.

(b) On and after February 1, 1971, the conversion rate shall
be the rate in effect by virtue of the preceding clause (a) or the
Alternative Conversion Rate determined as hereinafter provided,
whichever would result in the greatest number of shares of Common
Stock (but in no event more than two shares) being issuable upon
conversion. The Alternative Conversion Rate for purposes of this
clause (b) shall be determined by dividing $120 by the Current Market
Price of the Common Stock, as hereinafter defined provided that the
number of shares issuable under such Alternative Conversion Rate shall
in no event exceed two shares.

(c) For purposes of determining the Alternative Conversion
Rate, the term "Current Market Price" of the Common Stock shall be the
average of the last sales prices of the Common Stock on the New York
Stock Exchange during the

14
<PAGE>

twenty trading days next preceding February 1, 1971 (or the quoted bid
price for any of such trading days on which no sales were made).

(d) The limitation respecting the issuance of not more than
two shares of Common Stock under the Alternative Conversion Rate
described in the foregoing clause (a) shall be equitably adjusted (as
determined by the board of directors) so as to increase such number of
shares in the event of any subdivision of the Common Stock, any
issuance of Common Stock as a dividend or other distribution upon
stock of the corporation, or any reclassification or recapitalization
(whether resulting from a merger or consolidation or conveyance of all
or substantially all of the assets of the corporation or otherwise)
resulting in a greater number of shares of Common Stock being
outstanding or to decrease such number of shares in the event of any
combination of the Common Stock or any reclassification or
recapitalization reducing the number of shares outstanding.

(e) Any holder of $2 Preference Stock electing to convert
shall surrender the certificates representing the shares to be
converted at the office of any Transfer Agent for the $2 Preference
Stock, with the form of written request for conversion duly endorsed
on such certificates. The conversion right shall be deemed to have
been exercised immediately prior to the close of business on the date
on which the certificates for the $2 Preference Stock, with the
request for conversion duly endorsed thereon, shall have been so
surrendered, and the person entitled to receive the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the
record holder of such Common Stock on said date. The corporation
shall not be required, in connection with any such conversion, to
issue a fraction of a share of its Common Stock, but in lieu thereof,
the corporation shall make a cash payment equal to such fraction
multiplied by the market price of the Common Stock determined as
hereafter set forth unless the board of directors shall determine to
adjust fractional shares by the issuance of fractional scrip
certificates or in some other manner. The market price of the Common
Stock for the purpose of computing payment to be made for fractional
shares shall be the closing sale price (or if there were no sales, the
closing bid price on the New York Stock Exchange) as of the close of
business on the date of conversion.

(f) As soon as practicable after the conversion of any $2
Preference Stock into Common Stock, the corporation shall deliver to
the person entitled thereto, at the office of the Transfer Agent for
the $2 Preference Stock at which such $2 Preference Stock shall have
been presented for conversion, certificates representing shares of
Common Stock, and the cash, if any, to which such person shall be
entitled. The corporation, as a condition to the exercise of any
right of conversion, may require the payment of a sum equal to any
transfer tax or other governmental charge (but not including any tax
payable upon the issue of stock deliverable upon such conversion)

15
<PAGE>

that may be imposed or required by law upon any transfer incidental or
prior thereto, or the submission of proper proof that the same has
been paid.

5B. The conversion rates established by the foregoing Paragraph 5A
for the respective periods specified therein shall be subject to adjustment
during any such period (and, as so adjusted, will be subject to further
adjustment) as herein provided. The conversion rate to be in effect after
any such adjustment shall be determined by dividing $82.50 by $58.93 or
such amount as adjusted (therein called the "conversion price") by virtue
of the provisions set forth in Paragraph 5C.

5C. The conversion price shall be subject to adjustment as follows:

(A) For the purposes of this Paragraph 5C, the term "current
conversion price" is defined as meaning at the time of any adjustment the
conversion price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment; and the
term "current quotient" is defined as meaning on any given date the amount
determined at the close of business on such day by dividing:

(i) an amount equal to (a) the total number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding when the current conversion price became effective,
including any such shares deemed to have been issued as provided in
paragraph (6) or (7) below, multiplied by the current conversion
price, plus (b) the aggregate of the amounts of all consideration, if
any, received by the corporation (or, without duplications, deemed to
have been received as provided in paragraph (6) or (7) or subdivision
(C) below) upon all issuances of shares of Common Stock since the
current conversion price became effective and prior to the time of the
determination of the current quotient, by

(ii) the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the time of such determination, including any
such shares deemed to have been issued as provided in paragraph (6) or
(7) below.

For the purposes of this paragraph, the original conversion price specified
in Paragraph 5B above shall be deemed to have become effective at the close
of business on February 1, 1969. In determining the current quotient, the
results shall be expressed to the nearest cent.

In case at the close of business on any date after February 1, 1969,
the current conversion price shall exceed the current quotient by as much
as 50 cents (or, in case adjustment of the conversion price has taken place
pursuant to subdivision (B) of this Paragraph 5C, the amount which shall be
to the nearest one cent, in the same proportion to 50 cents as the
conversion price after the latest such adjustment shall be to the original
conversion price), the conversion price shall be reduced to the price equal
to the current quotient, effective at the close of business on such date.
In case of a subdivision or combination of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock, the conversion price shall first be

16
<PAGE>

reduced, effective immediately prior to an adjustment of the conversion
price pursuant to subdivision (B) of this Paragraph 5C, by the amount, if
any, by which the current conversion price shall exceed the current
quotient.

For the purposes of this subdivision, the following provisions shall
also be applicable, except that the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2), (6),
(7), (8) and (9) below shall not be applicable in the case of the issuance
of shares of Common Stock as contemplated in subdivision (C) hereof (or the
issuance of shares of any class, or series, of stock or obligation of the
corporation, convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock, or any
rights or options to subscribe for or to purchase such convertible or
exchangeable stock or obligations or shares of Common Stock, as
contemplated in subdivision (C) hereof):

(1) In case of the issuance of additional shares of Common
Stock for cash, the consideration received by the corporation therefor
shall be deemed to be the total amount of cash received for such
shares, before deducting therefrom any commissions or other expenses
paid or incurred by the corporation for any underwriting of, or
otherwise in connection with, the issuance of such shares.

In case of the issuance of additional shares of Common Stock
(otherwise than as provided in subdivision (C) hereof) for a
consideration not consisting solely of cash, the amount of the
consideration other than cash received by the corporation for such
shares shall be deemed to be the value of such consideration as
determined by the board of directors.

(2) In case of the issuance of additional shares of Common
Stock upon conversion or exchange of any obligations or of any shares
of stock of the corporation that shall be convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of Common Stock or upon the exercise of rights
or options to subscribe for or to purchase shares of Common Stock,
(subject to paragraphs (6) and (7) and subdivision (C) below), the
amount of the consideration received by the corporation for such
additional shares of Common Stock shall be deemed to be the total of
(a) the amount of the consideration received upon the original
issuance of such obligations, shares, rights or options, as the case
may be, plus (b) the consideration, if any, other than such
obligations, shares, rights or options, received upon such conversion,
exchange, or exercise, except in adjustment of interest and dividends.
If obligations, shares, rights or options, of the same class or series
of a class as the obligations, shares, rights or options so converted,
exchanged or exercised, have been originally issued for different
amounts of consideration, then the amount of consideration received
upon the original issuance of each of the obligations, shares, rights
or options so converted, exchanged or exercised shall be deemed to be
the average amount of the consideration received upon the original
issuance of all such obligations, shares, rights or options. The
amount of the consideration received upon the original issuance of the
obligations, shares, rights or options so converted, exchanged or

17
<PAGE>

exercised and the amount of the consideration, if any, other than such
obligations, shares, rights or options, received upon such conversion,
exchange or exercise shall be determined in the same manner provided
in paragraph (1) above with respect to the consideration received by
the corporation in case of the issuance of additional shares of Common
Stock; if such obligations, shares, rights or options shall have been
issued as a dividend upon any stock of the corporation, the amount of
the consideration received by the corporation upon the original
issuance thereof shall be deemed to be zero.

(3) In case of the issuance of additional shares of Common
Stock as a dividend, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock
issued in payment of such dividend shall be deemed to have been issued
and to be outstanding at the close of business on the record date
fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to such dividend
and shall be deemed to have been issued without consideration. Shares
of Common Stock issued otherwise than as a dividend shall be deemed to
have been issued and to be outstanding at the close of business on the
date of issue.

(4) The term "dividend" shall mean a dividend or other
distribution upon stock of the corporation.

(5) The number of shares of Common Stock at any time
outstanding shall include all shares of Common Stock then owned or
held by or for the account of the corporation.

(6) Subject to paragraph (8) below, in case of the issuance
of any rights to subscribe for or to purchase, or any options for the
purchase of, additional shares of Common Stock (other than options or
rights contemplated in subdivision (C) hereof) at a price per share
for the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise
of such rights or options less than the current conversion price
immediately prior to the issuance of such rights or the granting of
such options, then the issuance of such rights or options shall be
deemed to be an issuance (as of the date of issuance of such right or
options) of the total maximum number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of all such rights or options. In such
case, subject to paragraph (8) below, the amount received or
receivable by the corporation in consideration of the issuance of such
rights or options (plus the minimum aggregate amount of premium or
additional consideration payable to the corporation upon the exercise
of such rights or options) before deducting therefrom any commissions
or other expenses paid or incurred by the corporation for any
underwriting of, or otherwise in connection with, the issuance of such
rights or options, shall be deemed to be the consideration actually
received (as of the date of issuance of such rights or options) for
the issuance of the additional shares of Common Stock.

18
<PAGE>

(7) Subject to paragraph (8) below, in case the corporation
shall issue any shares of stock or obligations convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of Common Stock or rights to subscribe for or
options to purchase such convertible or exchangeable stock or
obligations (other than any such shares of stock or obligations or
rights or options contemplated in subdivision (C) below) and the price
per share at which Common Stock is deliverable upon conversion or
exchange of such stock or obligations (determined by dividing (x) the
total amount received or receivable by the corporation in
consideration of the issuance of such stock, obligations, rights or
options, as the case may be, plus the minimum additional aggregate
amount (if any) payable to the corporation upon such conversion or
exchange and upon the exercise of such rights or options, by (y) the
total maximum number of shares of Common Stock then necessary to
effect the conversion or exchange of all such convertible or
exchangeable stock or obligations) shall be less than the current
conversion price immediately prior to the issuance of such convertible
or exchangeable stock or obligations or the issuance of such rights or
options, then such issuance shall be deemed to be an issuance (as of
the date of issuance of such convertible stock or obligations or such
rights or options) of the total maximum number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such convertible
securities. In such case, subject to paragraph (8) below, the amount
received or receivable by the corporation in consideration of the
issuance of such convertible or exchangeable stock or obligations or
such rights or options (plus the minimum aggregate amount of
additional consideration payable to the corporation upon conversion or
exchange of such stock or obligations or upon the exercise of such
rights or options) before deducting therefrom any commissions or other
expenses paid or incurred by the corporation for the underwriting of,
or otherwise in connection with, the issuance of such stock,
obligations, rights or options, shall be deemed to be the
consideration actually received (as of the date of issuance of such
stock, obligations, rights or options) for the issuance of the
additional shares of Common Stock.

(8) Upon expiration without exercise of any rights or
options referred to in paragraph (6) above, or of the conversion or
exchange privileges applicable to any shares of stock or obligations
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock or of
rights to subscribe for or options to purchase such convertible or
exchangeable stock or obligations, referred to in paragraph (7) above
(hereinafter in this paragraph called "Expiring Rights"), (i) the
number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding
by reason of the fact that they were issuable upon the exercise of
such Expiring Rights shall no longer be deemed to be issued and
outstanding, and (ii) the current conversion price shall forthwith be
readjusted and thereafter the current conversion price shall be the
price which it would have been had adjustment been made on the basis
of the issue only of the shares of Common Stock actually issued upon
the exercise of rights or options or upon the conversion or exchange
of stock or obligations of the same class as such Expiring Rights;

19
<PAGE>

provided, that termination without exercise of any such Expiring
Rights at the minimum price or consideration theretofore reflected in
the computation of the current conversion price, and continuation of
such Expiring Rights at a greater price or consideration, shall be
deemed the expiration of the Expiring Rights and the granting of a new
right or option or conversion or exchange privilege at the minimum
price or consideration thereafter applicable.

(9) The consideration actually received by the corporation
for any shares of Common Stock issued upon the conversion or exchange
of stock or obligations or upon the exercise of rights or options,
which pursuant to paragraph (6) or (7) above is deemed to have been
received, shall not be included in clause (b) of subparagraph (i) of
this subdivision for the purpose of computing the current quotient and
no further adjustment of the conversion price (except as specifically
provided in paragraph (8) above) shall be made in respect thereof. In
case, however, such stock or obligations shall be convertible at a
conversion price, or such rights or options shall be exercisable at a
purchase price, per share equal to or in excess of the current
conversion price immediately prior to the issuance or sale of such
convertible stock or obligations or of such rights or options, then
the shares shall be deemed to be issued and the consideration therefor
received when such additional shares of Common Stock are actually
issued upon the conversion or exchange of any such convertible stock
or obligations or upon the exercise of any such rights or options.

(B) In case the corporation shall at any time subdivide the
outstanding shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the $2
Preference Stock, the conversion price in effect immediately prior to such
subdivision shall be proportionately decreased, and in case the corporation
shall at any time combine the outstanding shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of the $2 Preference Stock, the conversion price in effect
immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately increased.
Any such adjustment shall become effective at the close of business on the
date that such subdivision or combination shall become effective.

(C) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Paragraph 5C to the
contrary:

(i) No adjustment of the conversion price shall be made as a
result of or in connection with

(a) the issuance after February 10, 1969 of shares of
Common Stock of the corporation pursuant to options or stock
purchase agreements theretofore or thereafter granted to or
entered into with directors, officers or employees of the
corporation or of a subsidiary in connection with their
employment, whether granted or entered into at the beginning of
the employment, or at the time of becoming a director or at any
time thereafter,

20
<PAGE>

or as a result of or in connection with the granting of such
options or the entering into of such stock purchase agreements,
or

(b) the issuance after February 10, 1969 of shares of
Common Stock of the corporation upon conversion of the $2
Preference Stock, the 6% convertible subordinated notes due 1982
of the corporation outstanding on February 10, 1969, the 4 3/4%
convertible subordinated debentures due 1988 of the corporation
outstanding on February 10, 1969, the 4 3/4% convertible
subordinated debentures due 1988 (series B) of the corporation
outstanding on February 10, 1969, the 4 3/4% convertible
subordinated debentures due 1988 (series C) outstanding on
February 10, 1969 or the $2 Preferred Stock of the corporation
outstanding on February 10, 1969, or upon exercise of warrants of
the corporation outstanding on February 10, 1969, or

(c) the issuance after February 10, 1969 of (i) shares
of Common Stock of the corporation, (ii) rights to subscribe for
or to purchase, or options for the purchase of, shares of Common
Stock of the corporation, (iii) shares of stock or obligations
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock of
the corporation, or (iv) rights to subscribe for or options to
purchase such convertible or exchangeable stock or obligations,
where, in any such case, the consideration therefor does not
consist solely of cash and such shares of Common Stock, rights,
options, stock or obligations are issued for all or any part of a
going business, or the issuance of any shares of Common Stock
upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of any rights, options,
stocks or obligations described in items (ii), (iii) or (iv) of
this clause (c); and

(ii) Shares of Common Stock, the issuance of which shall not
result in any adjustment of the conversion price pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this subdivision, shall nevertheless be taken
into account in the event of any subsequent determination of the
current quotient and the consideration received by the corporation
with respect to such shares shall be deemed to be the conversion price
in effect hereunder at the time of issuance of such shares.

5D. In case of any capital reorganization or any reclassification of
the capital stock of the corporation or in case of the consolidation or
merger of the corporation with or into another corporation or the
conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation to
another corporation, each share of the $2 Preference Stock shall thereafter
be convertible into the number of shares of stock or other securities or
property to which a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the
corporation deliverable upon conversion of such share of the $2 Preference
Stock would have been entitled upon such reorganization, reclassification,
consolidation, merger or conveyance; and, in any such case, appropriate
adjustment (as determined by the board of directors) shall be made in the

21
<PAGE>

application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to the rights
and interests thereafter of the holders of the $2 Preference Stock, to the
end that the provisions set forth herein (including provisions with respect
to adjustments of the conversion rate) shall thereafter be applicable, as
nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to any shares of stock or other
property thereafter deliverable upon the conversion of the shares of the $2
Preference Stock and, for purposes of determining the Alternative
Conversion Rate, such shares of stock or other property, to the extent
practicable, shall be substituted for the Common Stock of the corporation
in the formula heretofore set forth.

5E. No adjustment is to be made upon conversion of the $2 Preference
Stock for accrued and unpaid dividends thereon or for dividends upon the
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion.

5F. Whenever the conversion rate is required to be adjusted as
provided herein, the corporation shall forthwith compute the adjusted
conversion rate and shall prepare a certificate setting forth such adjusted
conversion rate and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment
is based. Such certificate shall forthwith be filed with the Transfer
Agent or Agents for the $2 Preference Stock and thereafter, until further
adjusted, the adjusted conversion rate shall be as set forth in said
certificate, provided that the computation of the adjusted conversion rate
shall be reviewed at least annually by the independent public accountants
regularly employed by the corporation and said accountants shall file a
corrected certificate, if required, with the Transfer Agent or Agents. The
corporation shall cause the Transfer Agent or Agents for the $2 Preference
Stock to mail to the holders thereof, at the time of each quarterly
dividend payment, a statement setting forth the adjustments, if any, made
in the conversion rate and not theretofore reported to such holders, and
the reasons for such adjustment.

5G. So long as any shares of the $2 Preference Stock remain
outstanding and the holders thereof have the right to convert said shares,
the corporation will at all times reserve from its authorized Common Stock
a sufficient number of shares to provide for such conversion. As a
condition precedent to the taking of any action which would cause an
adjustment in the conversion rate in a manner affecting the receipt by the
corporation of at least the then par value of the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon conversion, the corporation will take such corporate action
as may be necessary in order that it may validly and legally issue fully
paid and nonassessable shares of such Common Stock at such adjusted
conversion rate.

5H. In case at any time

(i) the corporation shall declare any dividend in stock upon
its Common Stock; or

22
<PAGE>

(ii) propose a subdivision of its outstanding Common Stock
into a greater number of shares of Common Stock or propose a
combination of its outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of
shares of Common Stock; or

(iii) any capital reorganization or any reclassification of
capital stock of the corporation or any consolidation, merger or sale
of the properties and assets is proposed by the corporation which
would require an adjustment of the conversion terms;

then, and in each of said cases, the corporation shall cause notice thereof
to be mailed to the owners of all $2 Preference Stock at the last address
if any, appearing on the books of the corporation or given by them to the
corporation for the purpose of notice, and stating in such notice the
conversion rate then in effect, but such mailing shall be solely for the
convenience of the owners of $2 Preference Stock and shall not be a
condition precedent to nor shall any defect therein or failure in
connection therewith affect the validity of the action proposed to be taken
by the corporation. Such notices shall be mailed at least ten (10) days
prior to the date on which the books of the corporation shall close, or a
record date shall be taken for such stock dividend, stock split or
combination, or to vote upon such capital reorganization, reclassification,
consolidation, merger or sale of properties and assets, as the case may be.
Such notice shall specify such record date or date for the closing of the
transfer books.

6. Status of Shares Redeemed or Retired. Any shares of $2 Preference
Stock which shall have been converted into Common Stock or acquired by the
corporation through redemption or otherwise shall assume the status of
authorized but unissued Preference Stock and shall not be reissued as
shares of the $2 Noncumulative Convertible Preference Stock.

B. $100 CONVERTIBLE PREFERENCE STOCK

1. Designation and Number. The distinctive designation of such series
is "$100 Convertible Preference Stock" ("$100 Preference Stock"), and such
series shall consist initially of 150,000 shares.

2. Dividends. The holders of the $100 Preference Stock shall be
entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the board of directors and
out of the assets of the corporation which are by law available for the
payment of dividends, cumulative cash dividends payable quarterly on the
first days of January, April, July and October in each year to holders of
record on a record date, fixed by the board of directors, not more than 40
days preceding the dividend payment date, at the annual rate of $1.00 per
share, and no more. Dividends on any shares of $100 Preference Stock are
cumulative from the date of original issuance and accrue whether or not
earned or declared. All dividends are payable in cash. So long as any $100
Preference Stock shall remain outstanding, no dividend whatsoever shall be
declared or paid upon or set apart for any class of stock or series thereof
ranking junior

23
<PAGE>

to the $100 Preference Stock in the payment of dividends nor shall any
shares of any class of stock or series thereof ranking junior to the $100
Preference Stock in payments of dividends be redeemed or purchased by the
corporation or any subsidiary thereof nor shall any moneys be paid to or
made available for a sinking fund for the redemption or purchase of any
shares of any class of stock or series thereof ranking junior to the $100
Preference Stock in payment of dividends, unless in each instance dividends
on all outstanding shares of $100 Preference Stock for the then current
annual dividend period shall have been paid, or declared and sufficient
funds set aside for the payment thereof.

No dividend shall be declared on any share or shares of any other series of
Preference Stock or of any other class of stock or series thereof ranking
on a parity with the $100 Preference Stock in respect of payment of
dividends unless there shall have been declared on all shares then
outstanding of the $100 Preference Stock, for the same dividend period, or
for the dividend period of the $100 Preference Stock terminating within the
dividend period of said parity stock, like proportionate dividends,
ratably, in proportion to the $100 Preference Stock and said parity stock.
No shares of any other series of Preference Stock or of any such other
class or series ranking on a parity with the $100 Preference Stock in
respect of payment of dividends shall be redeemed or purchased by the
corporation or any subsidiary thereof nor shall any moneys be paid to or
made available for a sinking fund for any such redemption or purchase
unless dividends at the rate fixed hereby for the $100 Preference Stock for
the then current dividend period shall have been paid or declared and
sufficient funds set aside for payment thereof.

3. Preference on Liquidation. In the event of any voluntary or
involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the
corporation, after payment or provision for payment of the debts and other
liabilities of the corporation and any preferential amounts due to holders
of Preferred Stock, the holders of the $100 Preference Stock shall be
entitled to receive, out of the net assets of the corporation, $100 per
share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends thereon, and no more, before
any distribution shall be made to the holders of the Common Stock or any
other class of stock or series thereof ranking junior to the $100
Preference Stock with respect to the distribution of assets.

Neither the merger nor consolidation of the corporation into or with any
other corporation, nor the merger or consolidation of any other corporation
into or with the corporation, nor a sale, transfer or lease of all or any
part of the assets of the corporation, shall be deemed to be a dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the corporation within the meaning of this
Paragraph 3.

Written notice of any voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or
winding up of the affairs of the corporation, stating a payment date and
the place where the distributable amounts shall be payable and containing a
statement of or reference to the exchange right set forth in Paragraph 6 of
this Designation, shall be given by mail, postage prepaid, not less than 30
days prior to the payment date stated therein, to the holders of record of
the $100

24
<PAGE>

Preference Stock at their respective addresses as the same shall appear on
the books of the corporation.

No payment on account of such dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the
affairs of the corporation shall be made to the holders of any class or
series of stock ranking on a parity with the $100 Preference Stock in
respect to the distribution of assets, unless there shall likewise be paid
at the same time to the holders of the $100 Preference Stock like
proportionate distributive amounts, ratably, in proportion to the full
distributive amounts to which they and the holders of such parity stock are
respectively entitled with respect to such preferential distribution.

4. Redemption. Subject to the prior rights of the holders of any
outstanding Preferred Stock, the corporation shall have the right, at its
option and by resolution of its board of directors, to redeem at any time
after May 1, 1996, all or part of the shares of $100 Preference Stock
outstanding, upon payment in cash in respect of each share redeemed of $100
plus accrued and unpaid dividends thereon to the date fixed for redemption.

5. Voting Rights. Except as set forth below, the holders of the $100
Preference Stock shall have no voting rights.

So long as any shares of $100 Preference Stock are outstanding, the
corporation shall not, by amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation or
by-laws or by merger or consolidation or in any other manner authorize or
increase any class of stock ranking prior to the $100 Preference Stock
either as to the payment of dividends or distribution of assets upon
liquidation, or authorize or create or issue any security convertible into
or evidencing the right to purchase any such stock ranking prior to the
$100 Preference Stock, or change the preferences, powers, rights or
limitations with respect to the $100 Preference Stock, so as to affect
adversely the rights, powers or preferences of the $100 Preference Stock,
without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of the
$100 Preference Stock at the time outstanding.

6. Convertibility. Shares of the $100 Preference Stock shall be
convertible into Common Stock of the corporation on the following terms and
conditions:

6A. Any share of the $100 Preference Stock which is issued or
transferred to a person or entity which is not controlling, controlled by
or under common control with Norex America, Inc., a Cayman Islands
corporation, upon such issuance or transfer and without any action on the
part of the recipient or transferee, shall automatically convert into
shares of Common Stock of the corporation at a conversion rate of 100
shares of Common Stock per one share of $100 Preference Stock, subject to
the availability of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock for such
conversion and subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided Paragraph 6B.

25
<PAGE>

6B. The conversion rate in effect at any time shall be subject to
adjustments from time to time on or after the date of original issuance as
follows:

(i) In case the corporation shall (A) declare a dividend or make a
distribution payable in Common Stock on the Common Stock, (B) subdivide or
reclassify its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater number of
shares, or (C) combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a
smaller number of shares, the conversion rate in effect at the time of the
record date for such dividend or distribution or the effective date of such
subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be proportionately
increased in the case of any increase in the number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding, and reduced in the case of any reduction in the number
of shares of Common Stock outstanding, so that the holder of any shares of
$100 Preference Stock surrendered for conversion after such time shall be
entitled to receive the kind and amount of shares which he would have owned
or have been entitled to receive had such shares of $100 Preference Stock
been converted into Common Stock immediately prior to such time and had
such Common Stock received such dividend or other distribution or
participated in such subdivision, combination or reclassification. Such
adjustment shall be effective as of the record date for such dividend or
distribution or the effective date of such combination, subdivision or
reclassification and shall be made successively whenever any event listed
above shall occur. If, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to this
Paragraph 6B, the holder of any shares of $100 Preference Stock thereafter
surrendered for conversion shall become entitled to receive shares of two
or more classes of the capital stock of the corporation, the board of
directors of the corporation shall in good faith determine the allocation
of the conversion rate between and among the shares of such classes of
capital stock.

(ii) In case the corporation shall issue rights or warrants to all
holders of its Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or purchase
shares of Common Stock at a price per share less than the Current Market
Price (as defined in paragraph (iv) below) of the Common Stock, on the date
fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights
or warrants (the "Determination Date"), the conversion rate at the opening
of business on the day following the Determination Date shall be increased
by multiplying the conversion rate by a fraction of which the numerator
shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of
business on the Determination Date plus the number of shares of Common
Stock so offered for subscription or purchase and the denominator shall be
the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the close of business
on the Determination Date plus the number of shares of Common Stock which
the aggregate of the offering price of the total number of shares of Common
Stock so offered for subscription or purchase would purchase at such
Current Market Price of the Common Stock, such increase to become effective
immediately after the opening of business on the day following the
Determination Date. For purposes of determining under this paragraph the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time, there shall be
excluded all shares of Common Stock held in the treasury of the
corporation. If any or all such rights or warrants are not so issued or
expire or terminate before being exercised, the conversion rate

26
<PAGE>

then in effect shall be appropriately readjusted, but such readjustment
shall not be applied retroactively to any conversion of $100 Preference
Stock effected prior to such readjustment.

(iii) In case the corporation shall distribute to all holders of its
Common Stock evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including securities,
but excluding cash dividends or a distribution referred to in paragraph (i)
above or paid out of surplus) or rights or warrants to subscribe for or
purchase any of the corporation's securities (excluding those referred to
in paragraph (ii) above), the conversion rate shall be adjusted so that it
shall equal the ratio determined by multiplying the conversion rate in
effect immediately prior to the close of business on the Determination Date
by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Current Market Price per
share of the Common Stock at the Determination Date and the denominator
shall be such Current Market Price per share less the then fair market
value (as determined by the board of directors of the corporation, in good
faith and in the exercise of its reasonable business judgment and described
in a resolution of the board of directors certified by the secretary or an
assistant secretary of the corporation and delivered to the holders of $100
Preference Stock), of the portion of the assets or evidences of
indebtedness so distributed applicable to one share of Common Stock,
provided, however, if exercise of such right or warrant is subject to the
occurrence of a contingent event, adjustment of the conversion rate shall
be made in the manner provided for in paragraph (ii) above and the date
that the right or warrant becomes exercisable shall be deemed to be the
Determination Date for purposes of such adjustment. The conversion rate
adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph (iii) shall become effective
immediately prior to the opening of business on the day following the date
fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such
distribution (except in the case of rights or warrants subject to exercise
upon the occurrence of a contingent event, in which case such adjustment
shall become effective at the time such rights or warrants become
exercisable).

(iv) For the purposes of this Paragraph 6B, the "Current Market Price"
per share of Common Stock on any date shall be deemed to be the average of
the daily closing prices for the 30 consecutive days on which the New York
Stock Exchange, Inc. is open for trading commencing 45 days before such
date (or if less than 30 consecutive days for the maximum number of
consecutive days on which such Exchange is open for trading commencing 45
days before such date). The closing price for each day shall be the
closing price on the New York Stock Exchange-Consolidated Tape (or any
successor composite tape reporting transactions on national securities
exchanges) or, if such composite tape shall not be in use or shall not
report transactions in the Common Stock, the last sale price regular way
or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average of the
closing bid and asked prices regular way, in either case on the New York
Stock Exchange, or, if the shares of Common Stock are not listed or
admitted to trading on such Exchange, on the principal national securities
exchange on which the shares are listed or admitted to trading, or if they
are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange,
the average of the closing bid and asked prices of the Common Stock on
NASDAQ or any comparable system, or if the Common Stock is not listed on
NASDAQ or any comparable system, the closing bid and

27
<PAGE>

asked prices as furnished by any member of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. selected from time to time by the corporation for
that purpose.

(v) All calculations under this Paragraph 6B shall be made to the
nearest dollar or to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, as the case may
be.

(vi) No adjustment in the conversion rate shall be required pursuant
to any paragraph of this Paragraph 6B unless such adjustment (together with
prior adjustments which by reason of this paragraph (vi) were not required
to be made at the time otherwise required by the above paragraphs of this
Paragraph 6B) would require a change of at least 1% in such rate; provided,
however, that any adjustments which by reason of this paragraph (vi) are
not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in
any subsequent adjustment.

(vii) The corporation from time to time may increase the conversion
rate (i.e., increase the number of shares of Common Stock exchangeable for
one share of $100 Preference Stock) by any amount for any period of time if
the period is at least twenty (20) days and if the increase is irrevocable
during the period; provided, however, that the corporation may not increase
the conversion rate such that the Common Stock would be issued at less than
the par value per share of the Common Stock. Whenever the conversion rate
is increased in such manner, the corporation shall send to the holders of
the $100 Preference Stock a written notice of the increase at least fifteen
(15) days before the date the increased conversion rate is to take effect.
The notice shall state the increased conversion rate and the period it will
be in effect. An increase of the conversion rate does not change or adjust
the conversion rate otherwise in effect for purposes of this Paragraph 6B.

(viii) If the corporation shall be consolidated with or merged into
any other corporation, provisions shall be made as part of the terms of
such consolidation or merger whereby each share of the $100 Preference
Stock outstanding immediately prior to such event shall thereafter be
convertible into the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities
or property to which a holder of a number of shares of Common Stock
deliverable upon conversion of such share of the $100 Preference Stock
would have been entitled upon such consolidation or merger.

7. Status of Shares Redeemed or Retired. Any shares of $100
Preference Stock which shall have been acquired by the corporation through
redemption or otherwise shall assume the status of authorized but unissued
Preference Stock and shall not be reissued as shares of the $100
Convertible Preference Stock.

28
<PAGE>

III. COMMON STOCK

1. DIVIDENDS. Subject to the prior and superior rights of the Preferred
Stock, and any Preference Stock with respect to which any such prior and
superior rights are provided in this Article FOURTH or by the board of directors
as herein authorized, and on the conditions set forth in the foregoing Parts I
and II or in any resolution of the board of directors providing for the issuance
of any particular series of Preferred Stock or Preference Stock, and not
otherwise, such dividends (payable in cash, stock or otherwise) as may be
determined by the board of directors may be declared and paid on the Common
Stock from time to time out of any funds legally available therefor.

2. VOTING RIGHTS. Each holder of Common Stock shall be entitled to one
vote for each share held and, except as otherwise provided herein or by law, the
Common Stock, the Preferred Stock and the Preference Stock having voting rights
shall vote together as a class.

3. LIQUIDATION OR DISSOLUTION. After payment shall have been made in
full to the holders of the Preferred Stock and Preference Stock in the event of
any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the corporation,
the remaining assets and funds of the corporation shall be distributed among
the holders of the Common Stock according to their respective shares.

IV. PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHTS

No stockholder of this corporation shall by reason of his holding shares of
any class have any pre-emptive or preferential right to purchase or subscribe to
any shares of any class of this corporation now or hereafter to be authorized or
any notes, debentures, bonds, or other securities convertible into or carrying
options or warrants to purchase shares of any class, now or hereafter to be
authorized, whether or not the issuance of any such shares, or such notes,
debentures, bonds or other securities would adversely affect dividend or voting
rights of such stockholder, other than such rights, if any, as the board of
directors in its discretion may fix; and the board of directors may issue shares
of any class of this corporation, or any notes, debentures, bonds, or other
securities convertible into or carrying options or warrants to purchase shares
of any class, without offering any such shares of any class, either in whole or
in part, to the existing stockholders of any class.

FIFTH: All the corporate powers of this corporation shall be vested in and
exercised by a board of directors consisting of the number of directors
specified in the by-laws of the corporation.

The board of directors shall be divided into three classes as nearly equal
in number as may be with the initial term of office of Class I expiring at the
annual meeting of stockholders in 1972, of Class II expiring at the annual
meeting of stockholders in 1973, and of Class III expiring at the annual meeting
of stockholders in 1974.

At each annual meeting of stockholders, directors chosen to succeed those
whose terms then expire shall be elected for a full term of office expiring at
the third succeeding annual meeting of

29
<PAGE>

stockholders after their election. When the number of directors is increased by
amendment to the by-laws of the corporation, and any newly created directorships
are filled by the board of directors, there shall be no classification of such
additional directors until the next annual meeting of stockholders. Subject to
the foregoing, directors elected to fill a vacancy shall hold office for a term
expiring at the annual meeting at which the term of the class to which they
shall have been elected expires. No decrease in the number of directors
constituting the board of directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent
director.

SIXTH: By-laws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by
the board of directors or by the affirmative vote of the holders of 80% or more
of the corporation's stock, outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting at
which any by-law is adopted, amended or repealed. Such by-laws may contain any
provision for the regulation and management of the affairs of the corporation
and the rights or powers of its stockholders, directors, officers or employees
not inconsistent with statute or this Certificate of Incorporation.

SEVENTH: (A) Except as set forth in Paragraph (D) of this Article
SEVENTH, the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of 80% of all stock of
this corporation entitled to vote in elections of directors, considered for the
purposes of this Articles SEVENTH as one class, shall be required:

(i) for a merger or consolidation with or into any other corporation,
or

(ii) for any sale or lease of all or any substantial part of the
assets of this corporation to any other corporation, person or other
entity, or

(iii) any sale or lease to this corporation or any subsidiary thereof
of any assets (except assets having an aggregate fair market value of less
than $2,000,000) in exchange for voting securities (or securities
convertible into voting securities or options, warrants, or rights to
purchase voting securities or securities convertible into voting
securities) of this corporation or any subsidiary by any other corporation,
person or entity,

if as of the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to
notice thereof and to vote thereon or consent thereto such other corporation,
person or entity which is party to such a transaction is the beneficial owner,
directly or indirectly, of 5% or more of the outstanding shares of stock of this
corporation entitled to vote in elections of directors, considered for the
purpose of this Article SEVENTH as one class. Such affirmative vote or consent
shall be in addition to the vote or consent of the holders of the stock of this
corporation otherwise required by law or any agreement between this corporation
and any national securities exchange.

(B) For purposes of this Article SEVENTH any corporation, person or other
entity shall be deemed to be the beneficial owner of any shares of stock of this
corporation,

(i) which it owns directly, whether or not of record, or

30
<PAGE>

(ii) which it has the right to acquire pursuant to any agreement or
understanding or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants or options or
otherwise, or

(iii) which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly (including
shares deemed to be owned through application of clause (ii) above), by any
"affiliate" or "associate" as those terms are defined in Rule 12b-2 of the
General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as
in effect on July 1, 1970, or

(iv) which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly (including
shares deemed owned through application of clause (iii) above), by any
other corporation, person or entity with which it or its "affiliate" or
"associate" has any agreement or arrangement or understanding for the
purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of stock of this
corporation.

For the purposes of this Article SEVENTH, the outstanding shares of any class of
stock of this corporation shall include shares deemed owned through the
application of clauses (B), (ii), (iii) and (iv) above, but shall not include
any other shares which may be issuable pursuant to any agreement or upon
exercise of conversion rights, warrants, options or otherwise.

(C) The board of directors shall have the power and duty to determine for
the purposes of this Article SEVENTH on the basis of information known to this
corporation, whether

(i) such other corporation, person or other entity beneficially owns
more than 5% of the outstanding shares of stock of this corporation
entitled to vote in elections of directors,

(ii) a corporation, person, or entity is an "affiliate" or "associate"
(as defined in Paragraph (B) above) of another,

(iii) the assets being acquired by this corporation, or any
subsidiary thereof, have an aggregate fair market value of less than
$2,000,000, and

(iv) the memorandum of understanding referred to in Paragraph (D)
below is substantially consistent with the transaction covered thereby.

Any such determination shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes of this
Article SEVENTH.

(D) The provisions of this Article SEVENTH shall not apply to,

(i) any merger or similar transaction with any corporation if the
board of directors of this corporation has approved a memorandum of
understanding with such other corporation with respect to such transaction
prior to the time that such other corporation shall have become a
beneficial owner of more than 5% of the outstanding shares of stock of this
corporation entitled to vote in elections of directors; or

31
<PAGE>

(ii) any merger or consolidation of this corporation with, or any sale
or lease to this corporation or any subsidiary thereof of any assets of or
sale or lease by this corporation or any subsidiary thereof of any of its
assets to any corporation of which a majority of the outstanding shares of
all classes of stock entitled to vote in elections of directors is owned of
record or beneficially by this corporation and its subsidiaries.

EIGHTH: Whenever a compromise or arrangement is proposed between this
corporation and its creditors or any class of them and/or between this
corporation and its stockholders or any class of them, any court of equitable
jurisdiction within the State of Delaware may, on the application in a summary

EXHIBIT 99(A)

ZAPATA STOCK REVERSE APPROVED, FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
14-CENT DIVIDEND TO BE PAID; April 27, 1994
2ND QUARTER RESULTS REPORTED

HOUSTON--A one-for-five reverse split of Zapata Corporation's common stock
was approved and financial results for the company's second quarter were
reported at Zapata's annual stockholders meeting here today. As a result of the
reverse split approval, Zapata will begin paying a dividend on its common stock
in July.

The reverse split takes effect on May 3 with Zapata exchanging one new
share of common stock for five current shares, reducing the overall number of
common shares outstanding from approximately 158.3 million to approximately 31.7
million shares, according to Zapata Chairman and Chief Executive Officer R.C.
Lassiter. Zapata will shortly send letters to individual stockholders detailing
the exchange process.

"Zapata's Board recommended the reverse split to Zapata stockholders
because we believe that by reducing the overall number of shares the share price
will increase, and in so doing increase the company's attractiveness as an
investment vehicle. At its current share price, Zapata's stock falls below the
established price threshold of many institutional and other investors," Lassiter
said.

Now that stockholders have approved the reverse split, Zapata will
implement a 14-cent per share annual dividend, to be paid quarterly (at 3.5-
cents per share) beginning in July to stockholders of record on June 30, 1994.
The dividend will mean a cash distribution to stockholders of approximately $1.1
million per quarter.

At the stockholders meeting Lassiter reported that the company had net
income of $2.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, 1994, compared with a net
loss of $1.5 million for the second quarter of fiscal 1993. Operating income
for the 1994 quarter was $1.3 million, versus an operating loss of $300,000 a
year earlier. The company posted revenue of $75.2 million for the 1994 quarter,
compared with revenue of $71.9 million the year before.

The Zapata Chairman noted that while operating results were improved
compared with the previous year, the 1994 second quarter included a $3.6 million
pretax gain from the sale of 375,000 shares of Tidewater Inc. common stock.

"Zapata's natural gas processing operations did not perform as well as
anticipated because low world oil prices have depressed natural gas liquids
prices; however, the cost of natural gas, the feedstock for processing, has been
increasing, which resulted in a narrowing of the profit to be

1
<PAGE>

earned in gas processing. As a consequence, Zapata's gas gathering and
processing subsidiary recorded an operating loss for the quarter," Lassiter
said.

Operating income for Zapata's oil and gas production division was also
reduced due to production problems at the company's WISDOM gas property offshore
Texas. A workover program on that property is nearly complete and should
restore production to acceptable levels, he said.

Zapata's natural gas compression business recorded operating income of $2.4
million on revenues for the quarter of $28.1 million. Comparative figures for
the year-earlier quarter are not available as Zapata acquired the business in
November 1993.

The company's marine protein division recorded improved quarterly results,
compared with the previous year, because of increased sales volumes that were
carried over from the 1993 fishing season. The 1994 menhaden fishing season
began in the Gulf of Mexico on April 18, and will begin in Chesapeake Bay on
May 2.

For the six-month period ended March 31, Zapata reported net income of
$19.6 million, compared with a net loss of $500,000 for the year-earlier period.
Operating income for the 1994 period was $3.5 million, versus $2.2 million for
the first six months of fiscal 1993. Revenues for the six months were $155.4
million, compared with revenues of $142.8 million the year before. The six-
month figures include only five months of results from Zapata's natural gas
compression operations.

In other business, Zapata stockholders re-elected Peter M. Holt, 45,
President and Chief Executive Officer of the Holt Companies, and Kristian Siem,
45, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Norex America, Inc., to three-year
terms on the company's seven-member Board of Directors.

Zapata Corporation (NYSE symbol: ZOS) is a Houston-based international
company primarily involved in natural gas services. Zapata rents, fabricates
and services natural gas compression packages; and gathers and processes natural
gas. Zapata also produces natural gas and marine protein products.
