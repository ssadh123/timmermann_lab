Item 5. Other Events
------------

On December 7, 1994, KeyCorp announced that, as part of an on-going
management program to monitor and manage interest rate sensitivity, it
plans to reduce its exposure to higher interest rates through a
combination of strategies that may include the following:

- Reconfiguring the securities "available for sale" portfolio
to improve portfolio responsiveness to rising interest rates,

- Securitizing and selling certain fixed-rate loans,

- Allowing certain fixed-rate loans and investments to mature
without reinvestment, and

- Promoting certain fixed-rate market funding to support like
assets.

These steps, while not designed to totally eliminate interest
rate sensitivity, are intended to substantially reduce KeyCorp's
interest rate sensitivity below the level reported at September 30,
1994. Management anticipates that KeyCorp will incur, as a result of
implementing the above strategies, pre-tax losses of up to $100
million. Of this amount, $25 to $35 million ($0.07 to $0.10 per Common
Share) will likely be recognized in the 1994 fourth quarter. The
remaining $65 to $75 million in estimated losses will likely be
recognized in the first quarter of 1995. Management also anticipates
that, as a result of these strategies, 1994 earnings per Common Share
will be in the range of $3.45 to $3.50.

SIGNATURE

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the

undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
