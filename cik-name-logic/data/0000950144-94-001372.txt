UNION PLANTERS CORPORATION
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INTRODUCTION

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements
present a balance sheet as of March 31, 1994, and statements of earnings for
the three-month period ended March 31, 1994, and for each of the three years
ended December 31, 1993. The pro forma balance sheet presents certain
acquisitions which were completed subsequent to March 31, 1994, as well as
pending acquisitions, the consummation of which is considered by management to
be probable (the probable acquisitions). The statement of earnings for the
three-month period ended March 31, 1994 and for the twelve-month period ended
December 31, 1993, present the pro forma impact of certain acquisitions
completed in 1993 and 1994 and the probable acquisitions assuming that all of
the acquisitions had been completed at January 1, 1993. Acquisitions accounted
for as poolings of interests and completed in 1993 are included in the
Corporation's 1993 results. Pro forma statements of earnings are also presented
for the two years ended December 31, 1992, to reflect the pending acquisitions
of BNF BANCORP, INC. (formerly BANCFIRST Corporation) (BNF), and Grenada
Sunburst System Corporation (GSSC) which are expected to be accounted for as
poolings of interests. Consummation of the BNF and GSSC acquisitions are
considered probable and both meet the test for a significant subsidiary. With
the exception of these two acquisitions, the pro forma impact of the other
probable acquisitions expected to be accounted for as poolings of interests is
not presented because the results of the entities acquired are not considered
significant to consolidated results. The pro forma financial statements should
be read in connection with the Corporation's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K
and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 1994.
Additionally, the Corporation's Current Reports on Form 8-K dated February 8,
1994, April 14, 1994, May 18, 1994, July 1, 1994, and July 26, 1994 contain
audited financial statements, unaudited interim financial statements, and other
related information for BNF and GSSC. Note 1 to these pro forma financial
statements identifies (including the abbreviations for the company names
heading the columns of the statements) the completed and probable acquisitions
included herein.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. CONSUMMATED ACQUISITIONS

The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and statements of
earnings reflect the consummated and the probable acquisitions listed below.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet gives effect to these
transactions at March 31, 1994 as if they had occurred on that date, and the
unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of earnings reflect the impact of
the transactions as if they had occurred January 1, 1993, except for the
acquisitions of BNF BANCORP, INC. (formerly BANCFIRST Corporation) (BNF) and
Grenada Sunburst System Corporation (GSSC) which are presented assuming the
transaction occurred January 1, 1991. The unaudited pro forma consolidated
results shown are not necessarily indicative of future operating results, nor
can there be any assurance that the pending transactions will be consummated.
For the probable acquisitions expected to be accounted for as poolings of
interests, except BNF and GSSC, statements of earnings for periods prior to
1993 are not presented because the transactions are not significant.

(a) The Corporation had previously acquired 17.93% of the common stock of BOET
($3.4 million). On January 1, 1993, the Corporation purchased an
additional 43.93% of the common stock of BOET in exchange for Series E
Preferred Stock ($11.1 million). Effective May 3, 1993, the Corporation
acquired the remaining outstanding common stock of BOET in exchange for
the Corporation's Series E Preferred Stock ($10.8 million).

(b) The Corporation acquired Maryville, a federal mutual savings bank which,
incidental to a conversion/acquisition, converted to a federal stock
charter. All of the stock of Maryville was acquired by the Corporation in
exchange for a capital contribution equalling approximately $14.1 million
derived in part from the proceeds of a public offering of the
Corporation's Common Stock made in connection with the
conversion/acquisition.
-17-
<PAGE> 21

(c) The recording of the acquisition of Maryville using the purchase method of
accounting resulted in negative goodwill of approximately $9.4 million,
$8.1 million of which was deducted from noncurrent, nonmonetary assets
(premises and equipment, fair value adjustment of loans, prepaid software
and mortgage servicing rights). The remaining negative goodwill of $1.3
million was recorded in other liabilities and is being amortized over 7
years.

NOTE 2. REORGANIZATION OF UPNB

As of July 1, 1994, the Corporation formed four new regional bank
subsidiaries, Union Planters Bank of East Tennessee, N.A. (Knoxville), Union
Planters Bank of Middle Tennessee, N.A. (Nashville), Union Planters Bank of
Chattanooga, N.A. (Chattanooga), and Union Planters Bank of Jackson, N.A.
(Jackson) (collectively, the Regional Banks). UPC injected equity of $101.7
million into the Regional Banks with a majority of the funds ($98 million)
provided by a dividend from Union Planters National Bank (UPNB). Each of the
Regional Banks purchased from UPNB, at book value, substantially all of the
assets and assumed the liabilities of the UPNB branches located in its region.
While the separation of the branches previously held by UPNB had no material
impact on the consolidated financial condition of UPC, it will promote the
identification of individual branch operations within their local communities.
UPNB continues to operate branches located in Memphis and West Tennessee.

NOTE 3. EARNINGS CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO PENDING ACQUISITIONS AND
REORGANIZATIONS

In connection with pending acquisitions and reorganizations, including
the reorganization of UPNB, UPC anticipates that possible significant expenses
(e.g., elimination of duplicate facilities, staff reductions, elimination of
duplicate functions, write-off of impaired assets, etc.) may be incurred in the
third and fourth quarters of 1994 upon completion of ongoing financial, due
diligence, and strategic reviews and assessments of the post-merger operating
environment of the Corporation. It is preliminarily estimated that at least 
$2 million will be incurred in the third quarter. Any additional charges which
may be incurred in either the third or fourth quarter as a result of the 
completion of the studies cannot be estimated at this time. Additionally, 
management

-19-
<PAGE> 23

of the Corporation expects significant future cost savings from the combined
operations of the Corporation and GSSC once that acquisition is consummated.
Preliminary studies indicate that there are significant savings opportunities
and management expects that they will be realized once the recommendations are
implemented; however, the final savings which may actually be realized cannot
be estimated at this time.

NOTE 4. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

The following summarizes the unaudited pro forma adjustments which are
necessary to reflect the transactions described previously as of March 31,
1994, for the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and for the
three-month period ended March 31, 1994 and for the three years ended December
31, 1993, for the unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of earnings. The
adjustments for the probable acquisitions are based on currently available
information and could change significantly upon consummation. Not all purchase
accounting adjustments have been reflected because certain information is not
available; however, the amounts not reflected are not expected to be material.
