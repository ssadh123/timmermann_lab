Item 5. Other Events

On February 3, 1994, the Registrant issued the following press
release:

"St. Louis, Missouri, February 3, 1994 . . . At its Annual
Meeting of Shareholders today, Ralston Purina for the first time
disclosed operating profit for its two most profitable businesses
- -- batteries and pet foods.

Ralston Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William P. Stiritz
reported Fiscal 1993 operating profit for domestic pet foods at
approximately $310 million. Eveready Battery Company operating
profit in Fiscal 1993 was approximately $250 million.

"Since being acquired in 1986, Eveready Battery Company's
contributions to earnings and shareholder value continue to
grow," Stiritz said. "Pet food and Eveready contribute the
lion's share of profits. Those contributions would increase with
the completion of the proposed spin-off of Ralcorp Holdings,
Inc., so it makes sense to report pet food and Eveready
performance separately and in greater detail."

Stiritz said Ralston's hallmark throughout its first century has
been the ability to adapt and evolve -- attributes it must
continue to master in today's challenging business environment.

Also, at the meeting today Ralston's Chairman reported that
Ralston Purina Group earnings per primary share were $1.27 versus
pro forma earnings per share of $1.20 for the same period last
year. At its meeting today Ralston's Board of Directors declared
a quarterly dividend of $.30 per share on the Ralston-Ralston
Purina Group Common stock, payable on March 11, 1994, to
shareholders of record at the close of business on February 14,
1994. Stiritz said the proposed spin off company, Ralcorp,
constitutes a significant part of Ralston Purina Group's cash
flow, which would reduce Ralston's ability to pay dividend
increases in the near term. Stiritz also said that its
Continental Baking Group reported a loss of $.01 per primary
share compared to pro form earnings per share of $.08 in the 1st
quarter of last year. Results declined based on lower volume and
unfavorable product mix. Based on the negative 1st quarter
results, the Board felt it was prudent to eliminate Continental
Baking Group's dividend.

In other business at the Annual Meeting, Ralston shareholders
elected three directors to serve three year terms expiring in
January 1997. All three are currently serving as directors.
They are:

- John H. Biggs, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement
Equities Fund;

- David C. Farrell, Chairman of the Board and Chief
Executive Officer, The May Department Stores Company;

- William P. Stiritz, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive
Officer and President, Ralston Purina Company.

Shareholders also ratified the appointment of Price Waterhouse as
independent accountants for the Company for the fiscal year
ending September 30, 1994."
