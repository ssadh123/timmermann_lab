NORTH FORK BANCORP ANNOUNCES RECORD
NET INCOME FOR 1994 THIRD QUARTER

Mattituck, N.Y. - October 17, 1994 - North Fork
Bancorporation, Inc. (NYSE:NFB) reported record net
income of $7.5 million, or $.50 per share in the quarter
ended September 30, 1994, and $19 million, or $1.28 per
share, for the nine month period. Net income for the
three months and nine months ended September 30, 1993
were $3.9 million, or $.26 per share, and $11.0 million,
or $.77 per share respectively. Return on average assets
and equity climbed to 1.51% and 17.85%, respectively, in
this quarter and 1.29% and 15.81% for the 1994 nine month 
period. "We believe that these results confirm our
Company's strategy which emphasizes the fundamentals of
sound banking" stated John Adam Kanas, Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer. "We are diligent
in our efforts to improve net interest margin and all
components of non-interest income while continuing to
stress vigorous controls over operating and credit
costs." On September 27, 1994 the Company declared a
quarterly cash dividend of 10 cents per share which
represented a 33% increase over the previous quarter.

Net interest income on a fully taxable
equivalent basis was $22.7 million and $65.4 million for
the three and nine month periods ended September 30,
1994, respectively, compared to $20 million and $58.6
million for the comparable periods in the preceding year. 
The net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent
basis increased to 4.83% in the 1994 third quarter, as
compared with 4.78% and 4.57% in the first two quarters
of 1994. The net interest margin for the nine months
ended September 30, 1994 and 1993 was 4.73% and 4.78%,
respectively. The improvements in margin during 1994
result primarily from the effect of increases in the
prime lending rate on the Company's rate sensitive
assets, partially offset by increased funding costs. The
Company's demand deposit balances at September 30, 1994
rose to $291 million and constitute 19.7% of total
deposits as compared with $239 million, or 16.7%, at
September 30, 1993. Non-interest income, net of security
gains, continues to be impacted by the decline in
mortgage banking operations prevalent within the
industry. Non-interest income, net of security gains,
aggregated $4.1 million in the current quarter and $12.4
million for the nine months year-to-date. Comparable
amounts in 1993 were $4.2 million and $12.8 million,
respectively. The Company's core efficiency ratio was
49.21% in the quarter and 49.98% in the nine month period
ended September 30, 1994. Such ratios for 1993 were
53.9% in the quarter and 54.79% for the nine month
period.

Non-performing assets were $50.3 million, or
2.6% of total assets, at September 30, 1994. The
comparable amounts at September 30, 1993 were $77.6
million and 4% of total assets. The allowance for loan
losses at September 30, 1994 was 4.16% of net loans and
115% of non-performing loans.

The Company's pending acquisition of Metro
Bancshares Inc., the parent company of Bayside Federal
Savings Bank, is expected to close before the end of the
year. "All major elements of the merger integration
plans are being implemented and we expect them to be
completed with the consummation of the transaction this
year" stated Daniel M. Healy, Executive Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer. The concurrent Special
Meetings of Stockholders of North Fork and Metro, to
consider and vote upon the proposed merger, will be held
on November 10, 1994. Metro, through its subsidiary,
operates 13 branches in Queens, Nassau and Suffolk
Counties in New York. It has total assets of
approximately $1 billion, deposits of $.9 billion and
shareholders' equity of 82.6 million.

North Fork Bancorporation, Inc., with total
assets of $1.9 billion, deposits of $1.5 billion and
stockholders' equity of $169.5 million, or $11.82 book
value per share, is the holding company for North Fork
Bank, the largest independent commercial bank
headquartered on Long Island. The Bank operates thirty-
five branches in Suffolk, Nassau, Westchester and
Rockland Counties.
