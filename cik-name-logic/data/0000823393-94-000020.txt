SHAWMUT NATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders
of Shawmut National Corporation

We have audited, in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, the
consolidated financial statements of Shawmut National Corporation as of
December 31, 1993 and 1992 and for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1993, appearing on pages F-4 to F-39 of the Corporation's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993 (which statements are
not presented herein); and, in our report dated January 19, 1993, we expressed
an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

As described in Note 2, the Corporation merged with Peoples Bancorp of
Worcester, Inc. on May 23, 1994, New Dartmouth Bank on June 7, 1994 and Gateway
Financial Corporation on June 27, 1994 in transactions accounted for as
poolings of interests. The accompanying combined consolidated financial
statements give retroactive effect to the mergers of Shawmut National
Corporation with Peoples Bancorp of Worcester, Inc., New Dartmouth Bank and
Gateway Financial Corporation.

In our opinion, the accompanying combined consolidated balance sheet and the
related combined statements of income, of cash flows, and of changes in
shareholders' equity present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
position of Shawmut National Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31,
1993 and 1992, the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Corporation's management; our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe our
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed above.

SHAWMUT NATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting and reporting policies of Shawmut National Corporation and
its subsidiaries (the Corporation) are in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles followed within the banking industry.
Certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform to
current year presentation. As more fully discussed in "Note 2 -
Acquisitions", the Corporation consummated the acquisitions of three
banking organizations accounted for as poolings of interests. These
combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto give effect
to the acquisitions and, therefore, the financial position, results of
operations and cash flows are presented as if the Corporation and
the acquired banking organizations had been combined for all periods
presented. The significant accounting policies followed by the Corporation
are summarized below.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The combined consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of Shawmut National Corporation and its
subsidiaries after elimination of material intercompany balances and
transactions.

TRADING ACCOUNT SECURITIES - Trading account securities include debt
securities that are purchased and held principally for the purpose of
selling them in the near term and are stated at fair value, as determined
by quoted market prices. Gains and losses realized on the sale of
trading account securities and adjustments to fair value are included in
trading account profits.

RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES HELD FOR SALE - Residential mortgages held for
sale are primarily one to four family real estate mortgage loans which
are reported at the lower of cost or market, as determined by outstanding
commitments from investors or current investor yield requirements,
calculated on an aggregate basis. Forward mandatory, standby and put
option contracts are entered into to limit market risk on residential
mortgages held for sale. Gains and losses from sales of residential
mortgages held for sale are recognized upon settlement with investors and
recorded in noninterest income. These activities, together with
underwriting and servicing of residential mortgage loans, comprise the
Corporation's mortgage banking business.

SECURITIES - The Corporation adopted, as of December 31, 1993, Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities". Debt securities that the
Corporation has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are
classified as held to maturity and reported at cost, adjusted for the
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. Debt and equity
securities which are not classified as held to maturity or as trading
securities are classified as available for sale and reported at fair
value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from the results of
operations and reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity,
net of income taxes. See "Note 3 - Securities".

Prior to adoption of this new accounting standard, debt securities that
were to be held for indefinite periods of time, including securities that
management intended to use as part of its asset/liability strategy or
that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment
risk or other factors, were reported at the lower of aggregate cost or
fair value. Changes in net unrealized losses were included in the
Corporation's results of operations. Equity securities were stated at
the lower of aggregate cost or fair value with net unrealized losses
reported as a reduction of retained earnings.

<PAGE>F-6 11

Fair values of securities are determined by prices obtained from
independent market sources. Realized gains and losses on securities sold
are computed on the identified cost basis on the trade date and are
included in the results of operations.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING - Foreign exchange trading positions, including
spot, forward and option contracts, are reported at market value. The
resulting realized and unrealized gains and losses from foreign exchange
trading are included in other noninterest income.

INTEREST RATE INSTRUMENTS - Interest rate instruments, such as futures
contracts and forward rate agreements, are used in conjunction with
foreign exchange trading activities. These instruments are carried at
market value with realized and unrealized gains and losses recognized
currently in other noninterest income.

Interest rate swap and cap agreements and futures contracts are used to
manage the Corporation's interest rate risk. The periodic net settlements
on interest rate swap and cap agreements are recorded as an adjustment to
interest expense. Deferred gains or losses on futures contracts are
amortized over the expected remaining life of the underlying asset or
liability.

The Corporation also utilizes combination options, which involve a group
of options consisting of at least one put and one call entered into as a
unit in relation to specific underlying securities classified as
available for sale, in order to limit the market risk of the securities.
The market value of the options are included with the valuation of
securities available for sale.

LOANS - Loans are stated at the principal amounts outstanding, net of
unearned income.

Interest on undiscounted loans is recognized primarily utilizing the
simple interest method based upon the principal amount outstanding.
Interest on discounted loans is recognized utilizing the effective yield
method.

The net amount of loan origination and commitment fees and direct costs
incurred to underwrite and issue a loan are deferred and amortized as an
adjustment of the related loan's yield over the contractual life of the
loan in a manner which approximates the interest method.

When a loan is past due 90 days or more or the ability of the borrower to
repay principal or interest is in doubt, the Corporation discontinues the
accrual of interest and reverses any unpaid accrued amounts. If there is
doubt as to subsequent collectibility, cash interest payments are applied
to reduce principal. A loan is not restored to accruing status until the
borrower has brought the loan current and demonstrated the ability to
make payments of principal and interest, and doubt as to the
collectibility of the loan is not present. The Corporation may continue
to accrue interest on loans past due 90 days or more which are well
secured and in the process of collection.

Restructured loans are loans with original terms which have been modified
as a result of a change in the borrower's financial condition. Interest
income on restructured loans is accrued at the modified rates.

SHAWMUT NATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

A commitment to extend credit is a binding agreement to make a loan to a
customer in the future if certain conditions are met and is subject to
the same risk, credit review and approval process as a loan. Many
commitments expire without being used and, therefore, do not represent
future funding requirements.

Certain loans of acquired institutions are subject to protection under
agreements with federal banking regulatory agencies and are discussed
more fully in "Note 4 - Loans and Reserve for Loan Losses" and "Note 17 -
FDIC Assisted Transactions".

RESERVE FOR LOAN LOSSES - The reserve for loan losses is maintained at a
level determined by management to be adequate to provide for probable
losses inherent in the loan portfolio, including commitments to extend
credit. The reserve is maintained through the provision for loan losses,
which is a charge to operations. When a loan, or a portion of a loan, is
considered uncollectible, the loss is charged to the reserve. Recoveries
of previously charged off loans are credited to the reserve. The
potential for loss in the portfolio reflects the risks and uncertainties
inherent in the extension of credit.

The determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon
management's assessment of risk elements in the portfolio, factors
affecting loan quality and assumptions about the economic environment in
which the Corporation operates. The process includes identification and
analysis of loss potential in various portfolio segments utilizing a
credit risk grading process and specific reviews and evaluations of
significant individual problem credits. In addition, management reviews
overall portfolio quality through an analysis of current levels and
trends in charge-off, delinquency and nonaccruing loan data, and a review
of forecasted economic conditions and the overall banking environment.
These reviews are of necessity dependent upon estimates, appraisals and
judgments, which may change quickly because of changing economic
conditions, and the Corporation's perception as to how these factors may
affect the financial condition of debtors.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT - Premises, leasehold improvements and equipment
are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization
computed primarily on the straight-line method. Depreciation of
buildings and equipment is based on the estimated useful lives of the
assets. Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the term of
the related lease or the estimated useful lives of the improvements,
whichever is shorter. Major renewals and betterments are capitalized and
recurring repairs and maintenance are charged to operations. Gains or
losses on dispositions of premises and equipment are included in income
as realized.

FORECLOSED PROPERTIES - Properties acquired through foreclosure or in
settlement of loans and in-substance foreclosures are classified as
foreclosed properties and are valued at the lower of the loan value or
estimated fair value of the property acquired less estimated selling
costs. An in-substance foreclosure occurs when a borrower has little or
no equity in the collateral, repayment can only be expected to come from
the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower has effectively
abandoned the collateral or has doubtful ability to rebuild equity in the
collateral. At the time of foreclosure the excess, if any, of the loan
value over the estimated fair value of the property acquired less
estimated selling costs is charged to the reserve for loan losses.
Additional decreases in the carrying values of foreclosed properties or
changes in estimated selling costs, subsequent to the time of
foreclosure, are recognized through a provision charged to operations. A
valuation reserve is maintained for estimated selling costs and to record
the excess of the carrying values over the fair market values of
properties if changes in the carrying values are judged to be temporary.

<PAGE>F-8 13

NOTES TO COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The fair value of foreclosed properties is determined based upon
appraised value, which primarily utilizes the selling price of properties
for similar purposes, or discounted cash flow analyses of the properties'
operations.

GOODWILL - The excess cost over the fair value of assets acquired from
acquisitions accounted for as purchases is included in other assets and
amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of up to 25 years.

PENSION AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS - The Corporation maintains a
noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, which covers substantially
all full-time employees. Pension expense is based upon an actuarial
computation of current and future benefits for employees. The pension
plan is funded annually in an amount consistent with the funding
requirements of federal law and regulations.

The Corporation adopted FAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions", effective January 1, 1993.
The Corporation sponsors postretirement health care and life insurance
benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for
retired employees that have met certain age and service requirements.
Postretirement health care and life insurance benefits expense is based
upon an actuarial computation of current and future benefits for
employees and retirees. See "Note 11 - Pension and Other Employee
Benefit Plans".

The Corporation also adopted FAS No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits", during the fourth quarter of 1993, retroactive
to January 1, 1993. The Corporation provides disability and workers'
compensation related benefits to former or inactive employees after
employment but before retirement and had also provided supplemental
severance benefits to certain former employees. Postemployment benefits
expense is determined based upon various criteria depending on the type
of benefit. See "Note 11 - Pension and Other Employee Benefit Plans".

INCOME TAXES - The Corporation adopted FAS No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes", prospectively, effective January 1, 1993. Income tax
expense is based on estimated taxes payable or refundable on a tax return
basis for the current year and the changes in the amount of deferred tax
assets and liabilities during the year. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are established for temporary differences between the
accounting basis and the tax basis of the Corporation's assets and
liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the
amounts related to such temporary differences are realized or settled.
Prior to January 1, 1993, the Corporation recognized income taxes based
on income reported in the financial statements. See "Note 13 - Income
Taxes".

PER COMMON SHARE CALCULATIONS - Income (loss) per common share is
calculated by dividing net income (loss) less preferred stock dividends
by the weighted average common shares outstanding for each period
presented.

CASH FLOWS STATEMENT - For the purpose of reporting cash flows, the
Corporation has defined cash equivalents as those amounts included in the
balance sheet caption "Cash and due from banks".

<PAGE>F-9 14

SHAWMUT NATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - FAS No. 107, "Disclosures about
Fair Value of Financial Instruments", requires the disclosure of the fair
value of financial instruments. A financial instrument is defined as
cash, evidence of an ownership interest in an entity, or a contract that
conveys or imposes the contractual right or obligation to either receive
or deliver cash or another financial instrument. Examples of financial
instruments included in the Corporation's balance sheet are cash, federal
funds sold or purchased, debt and equity securities, loans, demand,
savings and other interest-bearing deposits, notes and debentures and
foreign exchange contracts. Examples of financial instruments which are
not included in the Corporation's balance sheet are commitments to extend
credit, standby letters of credit, loans sold with recourse and interest
rate swap, cap and option agreements.

Fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could
be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than
in a forced sale or liquidation, and is best evidenced by a quoted market
price if one exists.

The statement requires the fair value of deposit liabilities with no
stated maturity, such as demand deposits, NOW and money market accounts,
to equal the carrying value of these financial instruments and does not
allow for the recognition of the inherent value of core deposit
relationships, when determining fair value. While the statement does not
require disclosure of the fair value of nonfinancial instruments, such as
the Corporation's premises and equipment, its banking and trust
franchises and its core deposit relationships, the Corporation believes
these nonfinancial instruments have significant fair value.

The Corporation has estimated fair value based on quoted market prices
where available. In cases where quoted market prices were not available,
fair values were based on the quoted market price of a financial
instrument with similar characteristics, the present value of expected
future cash flows or other valuation techniques. Each of these
alternative valuation techniques utilize assumptions which are highly
subjective and judgmental in nature. Subjective factors include, among
other things, estimates of cash flows, the timing of cash flows, risk and
credit quality characteristics and interest rates. Accordingly, the
results may not be precise and modifying the assumptions may
significantly affect the values derived. In addition, fair values
established utilizing alternative valuation techniques may or may not be
substantiated by comparison with independent markets. Further, fair
values may or may not be realized if a significant portion of the
financial instruments were sold in a bulk transaction or a forced
liquidation. Therefore, any aggregate unrealized gains or losses should
not be interpreted as a forecast of future earnings or cash flows.
Furthermore, the fair values disclosed should not be interpreted as the
aggregate current value of the Corporation. The fair value of financial
instruments is disclosed in the related notes to the consolidated
financial statements except for time deposits, which is disclosed below.

The methodology and assumptions utilized to estimate the fair value of
the Corporation's financial instruments, not previously discussed in the
policy statements above, are described below.

Financial instruments with fair value approximate to carrying value - The
carrying value of cash and due from banks, interest-bearing deposits in
other banks, federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements
to resell, residential mortgages held for sale, demand deposits, savings,
NOW and money market deposits, foreign time deposits, other borrowings
and accrued interest income and expense approximates fair value due to
the short-term nature of these financial instruments.

<PAGE>F-10 15

NOTES TO COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Loans - The fair value of loans was estimated for groups of similar loans
based on the type of loan, interest rate characteristics, credit risk and
maturity. The fair value of performing fixed-rate commercial and
commercial real estate loans was estimated by discounting expected future
cash flows utilizing risk-free rates of return, adjusted for credit risk
and servicing costs. The carrying value of performing variable-rate
commercial and commercial real estate loans was estimated to approximate
fair value due to the short-term and frequent repricing characteristics
of these loans. Prepayments were not anticipated for either fixed-rate
or variable-rate commercial and commercial real estate loans. The fair
value of performing residential mortgage, home equity and installment
loans was estimated utilizing quoted market values for securities backed
by similar loans. The fair value of nonaccruing loans was estimated by
discounting expected future cash flows utilizing risk-free rates of
returns, adjusted for credit risk and servicing costs commensurate with a
portfolio of nonaccruing loans. Where appropriate, the fair values
reflect any FDIC loss protection arrangements.

Deposits - The fair value of time deposits with fixed maturities was
estimated by discounting expected future cash flows utilizing interest
rates currently being offered on deposits with similar characteristics
and maturities. The fair value of these deposits was approximately $5.0
billion and $6.0 billion at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Notes and debentures - The fair value of notes and debentures was
estimated based on quoted market prices.

Off-balance sheet financial instruments - The fair value of interest rate
swap agreements was based on the amount the Corporation would receive or
pay to terminate the agreements as of the reporting date based on the
terms of the agreements, the creditworthiness of the counterparties and
interest rates. The fair value of commitments to extend credit and
standby letters of credit was determined based on the discounted value of
fees currently charged for similar agreements. The fair value of other
off-balance sheet financial instruments, such as interest rate cap and
option agreements, was based on quoted market prices.

These acquisitions were accounted for as poolings of interests and as
such are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as though the
Corporation, Peoples, New Dartmouth and Gateway had been combined as of
the beginning of the earliest period presented.

Merger related charges of $100.9 million were recorded to reflect the
integration of these acquisitions during the second quarter of 1994. The
merger related charges include $18.9 million for severance and benefits
costs for workforce reductions; $39.4 million for the closure of
duplicative branches and facilities and cancellation of vendor contracts;
$11.1 million for financial advisory, legal and accounting expenses; and
$7.0 million for losses on the anticipated sales of foreclosed
properties. In addition, the sales of securities and anticipated
disposition of residential loans of the acquired entities to maintain an
interest rate risk profile consistent with that of the Corporation
resulted in losses of $12.5 million and $12.0 million, respectively.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FAS No. 114, "Accounting
By Creditors for Impaired Loans", in May 1993. The new accounting
standard will require that impaired loans, which are defined as loans
where it is probable that a creditor will not be able to collect both the
contractual interest and principal payments, be measured at the present
value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective
rate when assessing the need for a loss accrual. The new accounting
standard is effective for the Corporation's financial statements
beginning January 1, 1995. The effect on the Corporation of adopting
this new accounting standard is currently being evaluated.

</TABLE>
The fair value of the Corporation's notes and debentures was
approximately $827.4 million and $828.4 million at December 31, 1993 and
1992, respectively.

Both the 8 7/8% and 8 1/8% notes are unsecured obligations with interest
payable semiannually. The floating rate subordinated notes bear interest
at a rate of 3/8 percent above LIBOR (London Inter Bank Offered Rate).
Both the 8 5/8% and 7.20% subordinated notes may not be redeemed prior to
maturity. Interest is payable semiannually. The 7.20% subordinated
notes were issued during April 1993.

The agreement for the 9.85% subordinated capital notes provides that, on
the maturity date of June 1, 1999, the notes, at the Corporation's
option, will either be exchanged for common stock, preferred stock or
certain other primary capital securities of the Corporation having a
market value equal to the principal amount of the notes, or will be
repaid from the proceeds of other issuances of such securities. The
Corporation may, however, at its option, revoke its obligation to redeem
the notes with capital securities based upon the capital treatment of the
notes by its primary regulator or consent by its primary regulator for
such revocation. The holders of the capital notes are subordinate in
rights to depositors and other creditors.

The Corporation redeemed the outstanding balances of the following notes
with balances aggregating $85.2 million during 1993: 11 3/4% notes due
1995; 8 5/8% sinking fund debentures due 1999; 8 1/2% sinking fund
debentures due 1996 and 8 1/8% promissory notes due 1998 included in
other notes above. The redemption of these notes did not have a material
effect on the Corporation's results of operations or financial condition.
During 1993, the 8 1/4% notes matured and were fully paid.

Certain of the Corporation's note and debenture agreements include
provisions that limit the ability of the Corporation to sell the capital
stock of its subsidiary banks or dispose of significant portions of
assets of these subsidiaries.

NOTES TO COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Corporation has agreed to guarantee payment of certain notes and
debentures of Hartford National Corporation totaling $149.9 million and
of Shawmut Corporation totaling $249.6 million at December 31, 1993. See
"Note 19 - Summarized Financial Information of Certain Note and Debenture
Issuers".

The scheduled maturities of the Corporation's notes and debentures for
each of the next five years are as follows: $.4 million in 1994; $.4
million in 1995; $150.2 million in 1996; $150.4 million in 1997; $.5
million in 1998; and $457.0 million after 1998.

NOTE 10 - SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

The payment of dividends is determined by the Board of Directors in light
of the earnings, capital levels, cash requirements and the financial
condition of the Corporation and its subsidiaries, applicable government
regulations and policies and other factors deemed relevant by the Board
of Directors, including the amount of dividends payable to the
Corporation by its subsidiary banks. Various federal laws, regulations
and policies limit the ability of the Corporation's subsidiary banks to
pay dividends. See "Note 16 - Regulatory Matters".

Shawmut National Corporation's Board of Directors is authorized to issue
up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock without par value in series
and to determine the designation, dividend rates, redemption provisions,
liquidation preferences, sinking fund provisions and all other rights of
each series. Shawmut National Corporation had outstanding at December
31, 1993 a series of 575,000 shares of 9.30% Cumulative Preferred Stock
with a stated value of $250 per share represented by Depositary Shares
and a series of 700,000 shares of Preferred Stock with Cumulative and
Adjustable Dividends with a stated value of $50 per share. Both series
of preferred stock rank senior to the Corporation's common stock as to
dividends and liquidation preference. As discussed below, the
Corporation's New Hampshire banking subsidiary issued preferred stock in
connection with the acquisition of certain assets and assumption of
certain liabilities from the FDIC (see Note 17 - "FDIC Assisted
Transactions").

The Depositary Shares represent a one-tenth interest in a share of 9.30%
Cumulative Preferred Stock and are not subject to any mandatory
redemption or sinking fund provisions. The 9.30% Cumulative Preferred
Stock will be redeemable on at least 30 but not more than 60 days notice,
at the option of the Corporation, as a whole or in part, at any time on
and after October 15, 1997 at a redemption price equal to $250 per share
plus dividends accrued and accumulated but unpaid to the redemption date.

The dividend rate on the Preferred Stock with Cumulative and Adjustable
Dividends is established quarterly and is based on a rate that is 2.25
percent below the highest interest rate of selected short- and long-term
U. S. Treasury securities prevailing at the time the rate is set. The
dividend rate for any dividend period will in no event be less than 6.00
percent or greater than 12.00 percent per annum. This series of
preferred stock is redeemable, at the Corporation's option, at $50.00 per
share.

SHAWMUT NATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Dividends of $23.25 and $4.65 per share were declared on the 9.30%
Cumulative Preferred Stock during 1993 and 1992, respectively. Dividends
of $3.00, $3.01 and $3.23 per share were declared during 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively, on the Preferred Stock with Cumulative and Adjustable
Dividends. Dividends declared per common share were $.50 during 1993.
There were no dividends declared on common shares during 1992 or 1991.

On October 10, 1991 New Dartmouth Bank (which was subsequently merged
with Shawmut Bank NH upon consummation of the acquisition discussed in
"Note 2 - Acquisitions") issued 347,073 shares of non-voting,
convertible, redeemable, preferred stock ("FDIC Preferred Stock") to the
FDIC at a price of $89.46 per share. The shares of FDIC Preferred Stock
were redeemable at New Dartmouth's option. During 1993, New Dartmouth
redeemed 177,000 shares of FDIC Preferred Stock at the stipulated
redemption prices. On May 27, 1994, New Dartmouth redeemed the remaining
shares of FDIC Preferred Stock from the FDIC at a redemption price of
$107.77 per share.

The Corporation's Board of Directors previously adopted a rights plan
which provides for the distribution of one right for each outstanding
share of common stock. Each right entitles common stockholders to buy
one-one hundredth of a newly issued share of Series A Junior
Participating Preferred Stock of the Corporation at an exercise price of
$100 per share, subject to adjustment. The rights, which will expire
March 10, 1999, can be redeemed by the Corporation under certain
circumstances at one cent per right. The rights become exercisable if
certain events relating to the acquisition or proposed acquisition of
common shares of the Corporation occur. When exercisable, under certain
circumstances, each right will enable its holder to purchase, at the
right's then current exercise price, common shares of the Corporation
(or, under certain circumstances, a combination of cash, property, common
shares or other securities) having a value of twice the right's exercise
price. In addition, if thereafter the Corporation is involved in a
merger or other business combination transaction with another person in
which its shares are changed or exchanged, or if the Corporation sells
more than 50 percent of its assets, cash flow, or earning power to
another person or persons, each right (with certain exceptions) that has
not previously been exercised will entitle its holder to purchase, at the
right's then current exercise price, common shares of such other person
having a value of twice the right's exercise price.

Common shares totaling 20,669,749 at December 31, 1993 were reserved for
issuance under the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan and the
Corporation's Stock Option and Restricted Stock Award Plan.

In connection with the settlement of certain litigation, on January 18, 1994
the Corporation issued warrants for the purchase of up to 1,329,115
shares of common stock. The warrants have an exercise price of $22.11
per share, are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, are freely tradable
and are exercisable for a period of one year, commencing January 18,
1995. See "Note 15 - Litigation".

At the annual meeting of shareholders of the Corporation held on April 26,
1994, the Corporation's shareholders approved a proposal to increase the number
of authorized shares of common stock from 150 million shares to 300 million
shares.

NOTE 11 - PENSION AND OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Pension and Thrift Plans - The Corporation has noncontributory, qualified
defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all full-time
employees meeting certain requirements as to age and length of service.
For those vested, the plans provide a monthly benefit upon retirement
based on compensation during the five consecutive highest paid years of
employment and years of credited service. It is the Corporation's policy
to fund annually an amount consistent with the funding requirements of
federal law and regulations and not to exceed an amount which would be
deductible for federal income tax purposes. Contributions are intended
to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also
for those expected to be earned in the future. The assets of the plans
are primarily invested in listed stocks.

The Corporation also has supplemental retirement plans that cover certain
employees and pay benefits that supplement any benefits paid under the
qualified plans. Benefits under the supplemental plans are generally
based on compensation not includible in the calculation of benefits to be
paid under the qualified plans.

The Corporation also sponsors defined contribution plans covering
substantially all employees. Contributions under such plans totaled $6.8
million in 1993, $6.3 million in 1992 and $6.6 million in 1991.

Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefits - The Corporation
sponsors primarily four postretirement benefit plans that provide health
care and life insurance benefits for retired employees that have met
certain age and service requirements. One plan provides medical benefits
and the other three plans provide life insurance benefits. The
postretirement medical plan and one of the life insurance plans are
contributory with contributions adjusted annually to reflect certain
cost-sharing provisions of the plans. The remaining two postretirement
life insurance plans are noncontributory. It is the Corporation's policy
to fund the postretirement benefit plans as claims are paid. Plan assets
represent the cash surrender value of life insurance policies related to
one of the plans described above.

The Corporation adopted FAS No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions", effective January 1, 1993.
This new accounting standard requires the expected cost of these
postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to be accrued and
charged to operations during the years the employees render the service.
The Corporation is amortizing the transition obligation of $95.5 million
on a straight-line basis over 20 years. The postretirement benefit
expense for 1993 was $14.9 million. Previously, the Corporation's
postretirement benefits were expensed as claims were paid and totaled
approximately $5.0 million for 1992 and $4.5 million for 1991.

SHAWMUT NATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Postemployment Benefits - The Corporation provides disability and
workers' compensation related benefits to former or inactive employees
after employment but before retirement and had also provided supplemental
severance benefits to certain former employees. The Corporation adopted,
in the fourth quarter of 1993 retroactive to January 1, 1993, FAS No.
112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits". The new
accounting standard requires that the cost of these benefits be accrued
and charged to operations if the obligation is attributable to services
already rendered, rights to such benefits accumulate or vest, payment of
the benefits is probable and the amount of the benefits can be reasonably
estimated. Previously, the Corporation's postemployment benefits were
expensed as payments were made. The Corporation recognized an after-tax
charge of $6.6 million recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in
method of accounting for 1993 relating to the adoption of this new
accounting standard.

Stock Option and Restricted Stock Award Plan - The Corporation has a
Stock Option and Restricted Stock Award Plan (the Plan), which provides
for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options to certain
employees for the purchase of Shawmut National Corporation common stock
at 100 percent of fair market value at the date of grant. Options granted
under the Plan are exercisable after a minimum of one year but within ten
years of the date of grant. Also, options granted may be accompanied by
stock appreciation rights (SARs) or limited stock appreciation rights
(LSRs), or both. SARs and LSRs entitle the holder to receive payment
equal to the increase in the market value of the common stock from the
date of grant to the date of exercise. LSRs may be exercised only during
the 60-day period following a change of control. SARs and LSRs may be
granted only in tandem with stock options and may be paid in cash or
common stock at the election of the employee.

The Plan also provides for the granting of restricted stock and
performance share units to certain key executives. A performance share
unit represents an interest in a restricted share of common stock and any
dividends declared. Grants of performance share units are determined
using certain guidelines based on salary and responsibility levels, as
well as predetermined performance criteria. A total of 7,600,000 shares
of common stock have been reserved for the Plan, including the
performance share units. Charges for the Plan related to restricted
stock awards totaled $1.0 million in 1993 and $.8 million in 1992. There
were no charges associated with the Plan in 1991. A grant of 308,200
shares of performance share units occurred on October 28, 1993, for the
performance periods beginning January 1, 1994 through December 31, 1995.
Compensation expense will be recognized based on the fair value of the
performance share units over this period.

NOTE 13 - INCOME TAXES

The Corporation adopted FAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (FAS
109), prospectively, effective January 1, 1993. The cumulative effect of this 
accounting change was the recognition of a $52.8 million income tax benefit in 
the first quarter of 1993. Prior to January 1, 1993, two of the Corporation's 
acquired entities adopted FAS 109 and the effects on prior period combined 
consolidated results of operations and financial position were not material.
The Corporation's deferred tax asset (deferred tax assets less deferred tax 
liabilities) at December 31, 1992 was $134.8 million. The Corporation's 
deferred tax asset represents future deductible temporary differences 
attributable primarily to provisions for loan losses in excess of the 
deductible amounts for tax purposes. The Corporation's deferred federal tax 
asset recorded upon adoption of FAS 109 (prior to valuation allowance) at 
January 1, 1993 was $285.1 million. The income tax benefits of these 
deductible temporary differences recognized under FAS 109 were subjected to an 
evaluation of whether it was more likely than not that the income tax benefits 
will be realized and, as a result, a valuation allowance of $96.3 million was
established, resulting in a net deferred tax asset of $188.8 million at
January 1, 1993. The level of the valuation allowance reflected
management's best judgment regarding the amounts and timing of future
taxable income and the estimated reversal pattern of these temporary
differences. At year end 1993, deferred state tax assets, net of related 
federal tax and a valuation allowance of $115.1 million, were nil.

<PAGE>F-28 33

NOTES TO COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

At December 31, 1993, the Corporation's net deferred tax asset was
$200.9 million and is deemed realizable based upon management's best
judgment regarding the amounts and timing of future taxable income and the
estimated pattern of temporary differences. The valuation allowance of $126.4
million relates primarily to the realization of state tax benefits. As a
result of state tax laws, the corporation believes that uncertainty remains
concerning the realization of tax benefits in various state jurisdictions.
These benefits may be recorded in the future as realized or as it becomes more
likely than not, in management's best judgement, that such tax benefits will
be realized.

NOTE 14 - CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

The Corporation provides deposit and loan products and other financial
services to consumer and commercial customers located principally in New
England. The Corporation's loan portfolio at December 31, 1993 consisted
of commercial and industrial loans (36 percent), consumer loans (46
percent), real estate investor/developer loans (10 percent) and
owner-occupied commercial real estate loans (8 percent). Securities,
short-term investments and off-balance sheet interest rate instruments,
such as futures contracts and interest rate swaps, option and cap
agreements, are among the financial instruments used by the Corporation
in its balance sheet management activities.

Securities and short-term investment activities are conducted with a
diverse group of domestic and foreign governments, corporations and
depository and other financial institutions. The Corporation evaluates
the counterparty's creditworthiness and the need for collateral on a case
by case basis.

The Corporation manages its loan portfolio to avoid concentration by
industry or loan size to minimize its credit exposure. Commercial loans
may be collateralized by the assets underlying the borrowers' business
such as accounts receivable, equipment, inventory and real property.
Consumer loans such as residential mortgage and installment loans are
generally secured by the real or personal property financed. Commercial
real estate loans are generally secured by the underlying real property
and rental agreements.

Commitments to extend credit at December 31, 1993 included commercial and
industrial lines of $6.5 billion, consumer home equity credit lines of
$1.2 billion and commercial real estate lines of $190.6 million. The
fair value of these commitments at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
representing the discounted value of potential fee income, was
approximately $26.0 million and $13.6 million, respectively.

Standby letters of credit are obligations to make payments under certain
conditions to meet contingencies related to customers' contractual
agreements and are subject to the same risk, credit review and approval
process as a loan. Letters of credit are primarily used to enhance credit
for public and private borrowing arrangements and to guarantee a
customer's financial performance. The fair value of the Corporation's
standby letters of credit, representing the discounted value of potential
fee income, was approximately $6.4 million and $5.4 million at December
31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

Residential mortgage loans sold with recourse represent loans sold to
U.S. Government agencies which allows the purchaser the option of
requiring the Corporation to reacquire a loan in the event of default by
the borrower. The option may extend for a period of five years or for
the life of the loan. The Corporation has determined that the liability
under the terms of the option agreements is not material. Residential
mortgage loans are primarily underwritten and sold by the Corporation's
mortgage banking subsidiary.

Foreign exchange contracts are entered into primarily for trading
activities. The risk associated with foreign exchange contracts arises
from the counterparties' failure to meet the terms of the contracts. An
additional risk is that the value of a foreign currency might change in
relation to the U.S. dollar. In the event of a default by a
counterparty, the cost to the Corporation, if any, would be the
replacement cost of the contract at the current market rate. Exposure to
changes in market rate is substantially lessened since the Corporation
limits its risk by entering into offsetting contracts. The Corporation's
foreign exchange contracts are valued monthly at current market value and
changes in market value are included in other noninterest income.

Interest rate swap agreements are used by the Corporation to manage its
interest rate risk. These agreements involve the exchange of fixed and
variable rate interest payments based upon a notional principal amount
and maturity date. Interest rate cap agreements are similar to interest
rate swap agreements except that interest payments are only made or
received if current interest rates rise above a predetermined rate.
Included in both written and purchased interest rate cap agreements are
approximately $2.4 billion in notional balances of interest rate cap
agreements which consist of a simultaneous purchase and sale of a cap.
This combination of agreements are also known as interest rate corridors.
The risk associated with these agreements arises from the counterparties'
failure to meet the terms of the agreements. Limits are set on the
exposure to any one counterparty. The Corporation estimated it would pay
approximately $21.5 million and $30.0 million at December 31, 1993 and
1992, respectively, if it were to terminate the interest rate swap
agreements at these dates. The fair value of interest rate cap
agreements at December 31, 1993 was approximately $4.2 million, which
represents the amount that the Corporation would realize as a loss if the
agreements were terminated at that date.

<PAGE>F-32 37

NOTES TO COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Futures contracts are also used by the Corporation to manage interest
rate exposure. These instruments are exchange-traded contracts for the
future delivery of securities, other financial instruments or cash
settlement at a specified price or yield. The fair value of the futures
contracts at December 31, 1993 was approximately $.3 million, which
represents the amount that the Corporation would receive if the contracts
were terminated at that date.

The Corporation utilizes option contracts to limit its exposure to market
fluctuations on securities classified as available for sale. Options
give the holder the right to purchase or sell securities at a specified
price at a future date. The risk associated with options arises from the
counterparties' failure to meet the terms of the agreements. The fair
value of the Corporation's option contracts approximated the carrying
amount, or the net unamortized premium, at December 31, 1993 and 1992.

NOTE 15 - LITIGATION

The Corporation and certain of its officers and directors were named as
defendants in several complaints during 1990 and 1991, purportedly
brought on behalf of purchasers of the Corporation's common stock between
December 8, 1988 and January 24, 1991. Among other things, the complaint
in the actions alleged violations of federal securities laws and
negligent misrepresentation based upon certain allegedly false and
misleading public statements relating to the Corporation's financial
position and omissions in the Corporation's public reports.

The Corporation and the plaintiffs entered into a settlement which was
approved by the court on October 27, 1992. The settlement provided that,
in full and complete settlement of all claims had been or could
have been brought in the class actions, the defendants would distribute to
the members of the class including all persons who purchased the
Corporation's common stock during the period December 8, 1988 to January
24, 1991, inclusive, warrants to purchase the Corporation's common stock.
On January 18, 1994 the Corporation issued warrants for the purchase of
up to 1,329,115 shares of common stock. The warrants have an exercise
price of $22.11 per share, are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, are
freely tradable and are exercisable for a period of one year, commencing
January 18, 1995.

Defendants denied all allegations of wrongdoing contained in the
pleadings in these actions and agreed to settle these actions solely to
avoid the time and expense of contesting this burdensome litigation. The
settlement did not have a material effect on the Corporation's results of
operations or financial condition.

During 1993, Shawmut Mortgage Company, the Corporation's mortgage banking
subsidiary, was the subject of an investigation of possible
discriminatory lending by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ)
and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). On December 13, 1993, without
admitting any wrongdoing, Shawmut Mortgage Company entered into a consent
decree with the DOJ and FTC regarding past lending practices. Pursuant
to the consent decree, Shawmut Mortgage Company established a $960
thousand monetary fund to compensate minority loan applicants who were
denied mortgages between January 1990 and October 1992 but whose
applications would be approved under the Corporation's more recent
flexible underwriting criteria. This settlement did not have a material
effect on the Corporation's results of operations or financial condition.

SHAWMUT NATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

The Corporation's Shawmut Bank Connecticut subsidiary, which served as
indenture trustee for certain healthcare receivable backed bonds issued
by certain special purpose subsidiaries of Towers Financial Corporation,
and another defendant, have been named in a lawsuit in federal court in
Manhattan by purchasers of the bonds. The suit seeks damages in an
undetermined amount equal to the difference between the current value of
the bonds and their face amount of approximately $200 million, plus
interest, as well as punitive damages. The Corporation believes its
actions were reasonable and appropriate and were not the cause of any
loss by the bondholders, and is vigorously defending the action.

The Corporation is subject to various other pending and threatened
lawsuits in which claims for monetary damages are asserted. Management,
after consultation with legal counsel, does not anticipate that the
ultimate liability, if any, arising out of such other pending and threatened
lawsuits will have a material effect on the Corporation's results of
operations or financial condition.

NOTE 16 - REGULATORY MATTERS

The Corporation is a bank holding company subject to supervision and
regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the
Board) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. As a bank holding
company, the Corporation's activities and those of its banking and
nonbanking subsidiaries are limited to the business of banking and
activities closely related or incidental to banking.

The Corporation's subsidiary banks, Shawmut Bank Connecticut, National
Association (Shawmut Bank Connecticut) and Shawmut Bank, National
Association (Shawmut Bank Massachusetts), are subject to supervision and
examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). The
Corporation's other subsidiary bank, Shawmut Bank NH, is
subject to supervision and examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (FDIC) and the State of New Hampshire. The deposits of the
Corporation's subsidiary banks are insured by, and therefore the
subsidiary banks are subject to the regulations of, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The banks are also subject to requirements
and restrictions under federal and state law, including requirements to
maintain reserves against deposits, restrictions on the types and amounts
of loans that may be granted and the interest that may be charged
thereon, limitations on the types of investments that may be made and the
types of services that may be offered. Various consumer laws and
regulations also affect the operations of the Corporation's subsidiary
banks. In October 1993, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (FRB) and the
OCC removed certain regulatory agreements under which the Corporation and
certain of its subsidiary banks had been operating. The regulatory
agreements focused on the need to improve asset quality and credit
administration policies, as well as prior approval by the regulators for
dividend payments.

The Board and the OCC have adopted minimum risk-based capital and
leverage guidelines for bank holding companies and national banks. The
minimum Total capital ratio requirement is 8.00 percent, of which
one-half must be Tier 1 capital. The minimum Leverage ratio requires
Tier 1 capital of at least 3.00 percent of average quarterly assets less
goodwill and other intangibles. This Leverage ratio is the minimum
requirement for the most highly rated banking organizations and other
banking organizations are expected to maintain an additional level of at
least 100 to 200 basis points.

<PAGE>F-34 39

NOTES TO COMBINED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Board, OCC and FDIC implemented regulations, pursuant to the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA), effective
on December 19, 1992, concerning prompt supervisory and regulatory
actions to be taken against undercapitalized depository institutions.
FDICIA establishes five capital categories: "well-capitalized";
"adequately capitalized"; "undercapitalized"; "significantly
undercapitalized"; and "critically undercapitalized". Under these
regulations, an institution will be deemed "well-capitalized" if it has a
Risk-based Total capital ratio of 10.00 percent or greater, a Risk-based
Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.00 percent or greater and a Leverage ratio of
5.00 percent or greater. In addition, the institution cannot be subject
to an order, written agreement, capital directive or prompt correction
action directive.

The Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Leverage ratios for the Corporation
at December 31, 1993 were 8.79 percent, 12.73 percent and 6.47 percent,
respectively. The Tier 1 capital, Total capital and Leverage ratios for
Shawmut Bank Connecticut were 10.19 percent, 11.47 percent and 7.73
percent, respectively, while these ratios for Shawmut Bank Massachusetts
were 10.17 percent, 11.71 percent and 7.54 percent, respectively, at
December 31, 1993. These ratios for Shawmut Bank NH were 17.30 percent,
18.56 percent and 5.64 percent, respectively, at December 31, 1993. The
Corporation and its subsidiary banks at December 31, 1993 met the
definition for a "well-capitalized" institution.

The Corporation's subsidiary banks are required to maintain reserves
against certain deposit liabilities in either cash or balances on deposit
with the Federal Reserve System. The Corporation's subsidiary banks
maintained combined average reserves of approximately $565 million in
1993 with the FRB.

The Board issued proposed revisions to its capital adequacy guidelines in
February 1993 which proposes to limit the amount of deferred tax assets
recorded under FAS 109 that can be used to meet risk-based capital
requirements. This proposal would limit deferred tax assets to those
assets which may be realized from income taxes paid in prior carryback
years, the reversal of future taxable temporary differences and the
lesser of: (1) the amount of deferred tax assets expected to be realized
within one year of the quarter-end date based on future taxable income
(exclusive of tax carryforwards and reversals of existing temporary
differences) for that year, or (2) ten percent of Tier 1 capital. The
Corporation believes the deferred tax asset at December 31, 1993 would be
allowable in computing regulatory risk-based capital because the deferred
tax asset would not exceed the amount of income taxes previously paid in
prior carryback years. The Corporation cannot determine whether, or in
what form, this proposal may be enacted.

Principal sources of revenues for the Corporation are dividends received
directly and indirectly from its banks and other subsidiaries and
interest earned on short-term investments and advances to subsidiaries.
Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by the
subsidiaries of the Corporation that are national banks. Two different
calculations are performed to measure the amount of dividends that may be
paid: a recent earnings test and an undivided profits test. Under the
recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all
dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year is in excess
of the current year's net profits combined with the retained net profits
of the two preceding years, unless the bank obtains the approval of the
OCC. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in
excess of a bank's undivided profits then on hand, after deducting bad
debts in excess of the reserve for loan losses. Under the recent
earnings test at January 1, 1994, which is the more restrictive of the
two tests, Shawmut Bank Connecticut could pay up to $103.2 million in
dividends to its parent holding company without prior approval. Shawmut
Bank Massachusetts, under the recent earnings test at January 1, 1994,
could pay up to $223.7 million in dividends to its parent holding company
without prior approval. Shawmut Bank Connecticut and Shawmut Bank
Massachusetts had undivided profits of $272.9 million and $521.2 million,
respectively, at December 31, 1993.

SHAWMUT NATIONAL CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

The Corporation's subsidiary banks are also restricted under federal law
with respect to the transfer of funds from the subsidiary banks to the
Corporation and its nonbanking subsidiaries. Such transfers are limited
to certain percentages of the subsidiary bank's capital and surplus.
Loans and extensions of credit must be secured in specified amounts. The
Corporation had no borrowings outstanding from either of its subsidiary
banks at December 31, 1993.

NOTE 17 - FDIC ASSISTED TRANSACTIONS

New Dartmouth Bank was merged with Shawmut Bank NH concurrent with the
acquisition of New Dartmouth further discussed in "Note 2 -
Acquisitions". New Dartmouth, concurrent with its formation on October
10, 1991, acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of a
number of failed institutions from the FDIC as receiver of these failed
banks (the "1991 P&A Transaction"). New Dartmouth acquired from the FDIC
$1.7 billion in assets and assumed $2.1 billion in deposits. The FDIC
paid New Dartmouth $55.3 million in federal financial assistance to
complete the transaction in addition to a payment of $400.8 million for
the assumption of net liabilities. As part of the 1991 P&A Transaction,
the FDIC provided certain assistance to New Dartmouth that included the
ability to "put" classified loans to the FDIC upon certain conditions and
the sharing of losses on certain consumer and residential loans through
October 10, 1994.

New Dartmouth allocated approximately $39.0 million of the federal
financial assistance it received from the FDIC as a discount on the
acquired loan portfolio representing the estimate of potential future
losses in excess of the protection provided by the FDIC. In addition,
New Dartmouth allocated approximately $3.6 million of federal financial
assistance it received from the FDIC as part of another assisted
transaction as a discount on the acquired loan portfolio. The accretion
of these discounts commenced in the second half of 1993 based on the expected
future cash flows associated with these loans.

As discussed in "Note 2 - Acquisitions", the Corporation acquired
Gateway Financial Corporation and merged its banking subsidiary into
Shawmut Bank Connecticut. Previously, Gateway acquired certain assets
and assumed certain liabilities of a failed institution from the FDIC as
receiver of the failed bank. Under the terms of this acquisition, the
FDIC agreed to repurchase from Gateway any acquired commercial loans and
commercial mortgages that became delinquent, as defined, prior to
December 13, 1993. Through that date, approximately $58.1 million
of loans had been "put" to the FDIC, of which $21.1 million is
classified as a receivable from the FDIC and included in other assets at
December 31, 1993.
