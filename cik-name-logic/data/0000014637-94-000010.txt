Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company through its subsidiary Brown & 
Sharpe International Capital Corporation purchased, on March 24, 1994, the 
stock of the French company Ets. Pierre Roch, S.A. (Roch) and its German 
affiliate company, Mauser Prazisions - Messmittel GmbH, which together 
manufacture and market micrometers, calipers, height gages, digital indicators, 
and other similar precision measuring instrument products. The business is 
headquartered in Luneville, France which is its sole manufacturing site. The 
German operation is a sales office. These operations were purchased from 
Diehl GmbH & Co. of Nurnberg, Germany ("Diehl"). The Company intends to 
continue using the acquired assets in businesses in which they have been 
previously used.

The purchase price was delivery to Diehl of 175,000 shares of Brown & 
Sharpe Class A Common Stock, subject to certain post closing adjustments and 
granting Diehl the right to receive additional 50,000 shares of such stock in 
the event the Company's Class A Common Stock attains a market price of $15 or 
more per share for a total of 30 days or more during any twelve month period 
within the five years following the purchase. The purchase price was 
determined through negotiation by the parties subject to adjustment based on 
specified closing balance sheet changes. Roch entered into a nine year lease 
agreement to lease the Luneville facility from Societe Immobiliere Lunevilloise 
S.A.R.L., a subsidiary of Diehl, for about $34,000 annually and has options 
to purchase the facility during the lease term.

The acquisition has been accounted for by the purchase method of 
accounting, and accordingly, the purchase price has been allocated to assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed based on an estimate of their fair values at 
the date of acquisition. The book value of the net assets exceeded the 
purchase price before allocation by approximately $2,100. The estimated fair 
values of assets and liabilities after allocation are summarized as follows:

Cash $ 1,408,000
Accounts receivable 2,552,000
Inventory 3,398,000
Machinery and equipment 726,000
Other assets 259,000
Accounts payable and accruals 3,175,000
Pensions 516,000
Short-term debt 867,000
Long-term debt 1,250,000

ROCH S.A.
Notes to Financial Statements
(French francs in thousands; U.S. Dollars in thousands)

The main difference between French and U.S. results in 1991 consists in the 
booking of a retirement provision of FF 3,000. This provision is only a 
commitment in France. So, the French result in 1991 amounts to FF 117; the 
U.S. one to FF (2,993).The financial statements for the quarters ended March 
1993 and March 1994 are unaudited and do not form part of the opinion 
expressed by the auditors; it is management opinion that they include all 
adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for 
a fair presentation of the results of these periods.

Physical inventory count

A physical inventory count took place on December 31st 1993, 1992, and 1991.

Valuation principles

Raw materials and consumables and goods for sale are valued at purchasing 
cost. Purchasing cost is determined on a "weighted average cost" basis. 
Indirect purchasing costs amounting to 5 or 3% are also included, according 
to the geographic origin of the goods concerned.

Work in progress and finished goods are valued at manufacturing cost, which 
includes:

* Cost of raw materials and consumables consumed
* Individual and global costs based on an hourly rate applied to the 
average production time.

Report of Independent Accountants

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
Mauser Prazisionsmessmittel GmbH:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Mauser Prazisionsmessmittel 
GmbH as of December 31, 1992 and 1993, and the related statements of income 
(loss) and accumulated losses and cash flows for the period September 1, 1992 
through December 31, 1992 and for the year ended December 31, 1993. These 
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements 
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and 
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial 
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, 
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting 
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as 
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe 
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the financial position of Mauser Prazisionsmessmittel 
GmbH as of December 31, 1992 and 1993, and the results of its operations and 
its cash flows for the period September 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992 
and for the year ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles in the United States.

As explained in Note 1 to the financial statements, on March 24, 1994, 
Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company acquired all the common stock of the 
Company from Diehl GmbH & Co., the Company's parent. The accompanying
financial statements do not include any allocation of the purchase price
or other adjustments to the Company's historical carrying values of assets
and liabilities as a result of this transaction.

Notes to Combined Financial Statements
(Deutsch Marks in thousands; U.S. Dollars in thousands)

1. Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Business:

The Company distributes precision measuring instruments and associated 
tools throughout Germany.

Formation of the Company:

Mauser Prazisionsmessmittel GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Diehl 
GmbH & Co. ("Diehl"), was formed from its predecessor company, 
Elektrosil GmbH. On August 27, 1992, the Company's articles were 
rewritten in order to effect the change in name and business. With 
effect from September 1, 1992, the Company acquired certain assets of 
the former Oberndorf branch of Ets. Pierre Roch S.A., Luneville, 
France for DM 1,177.

Consequently, the fiscal periods included in these financial statements 
are for the period September 1, 1992 to December 31, 1992 and for the 
year ended December 31, 1993, and for the quarter ended March 31, 1994.

Sale of the Company:

On March 24, 1994, Brown & Sharpe Manufacturing Company acquired all 
the common stock of the Company from Diehl. The financial statments do not
include any allocation of the purchase price or other adjustments to the
Company's historical carrying values of assets and liabilities as a result
of this transaction.

Interim Financial Statements:

The financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 1994 and the 
related notes are unaudited and in the opinion of management, include 
all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments) 
necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the period. These 
results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected 
for the entire year.

Translation of Foreign Currencies:

The functional currency for the accounts of the Company is the local 
currency, the Deutschmark (DM). A translation of convenience has 
been applied in translating the financial statements into US Dollars 
at the rate prevailing at March 31, 1994, US $1 - DM 1.67. (DM 1 = 
US $0.60).

Revenue Recognition:

Revenue is recognized upon shipment of product.

Cash and Cash Equivalents:

The Company considers all debt instruments purchased with an original 
maturity of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash 
equivalents.

Inventories:

Inventories of finished measuring instruments are carried at the lower 
of average cost or market.

<PAGE> 30

Machinery and Equipment:

Machinery and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation 
and amortization. Depreciation is provided using the straight line 
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets of between two 
and six years. Depreciation expense was DM 8, DM 25 ($15), and 
DM 5 ($3) for the period September 1, 1992 through December 31, 1992, 
the year ended December 31, 1993, and the quarter ended March 31, 1994, 
respectively.

Repair and maintenance costs are expensed, while additions and 
betterments are capitalized. The cost and related accumulated 
depreciation of assets sold or retired are eliminated from the accounts 
and any gains or losses are reflected in earnings.

Goodwill:

The excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of a purchased 
business is recorded as goodwill, which is included in intangible 
assets. In 1993, an adjustment was made to the valuation of goodwill 
to take account of the adverse development of the business, which had 
not previously been expected. Consequently, DM 1,010 ($605) was 
written off in order to revalue the remaining goodwill at DM 100 
($60), which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over 10 years.

Income Taxes:

Due to losses in 1992 and 1993, no income taxes are payable. In 
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected 
future tax consequences of events that have been included in the 
financial statements or tax returns under the liability method. A 
valuation allowance is provided for when it is more likely than not 
that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized.

2. Accounts Payable to Affiliates

At December 31, the Company owed the following amounts to affiliates 
(excluding the long-term debt - see Note 4):

4. Long-term Debt due to Parent

Long-term debt amounting to DM 80 ($48) is due to the Company's parent, 
Diehl GmbH & Co., Nurnberg, Germany and bears interest at 7.5% per 
annum. It is repayable as follows: in 1994, DM 25, 1995, DM 25, and 
1996, DM 30.

5. Common Stock

As a "GmbH" - form of company incorporated in Germany, the Company's 
common stock is not divided into individual shares.

6. Income Taxes

Due to losses in 1992 and 1993, no income taxes are payable by the 
Company. At December 31, 1993, a deferred tax asset of DM 1,025 
($614) existed in connection with net German operating loss 
carryforwards, which do not expire. The Company has provided a 
valuation allowance in full for this asset due to the uncertainty 
of realizing the benefit of the loss carryforwards.

ProForma Combined Financial Statements

The following ProForma Combined Income Statements for the quarter ended 
April 2, 1994 and the year ended December 31, 1993 are unaudited and are 
based on the Consolidated Financial Statements of Brown & Sharpe, the 
Financial Statements fo Roch and the Financial Statements of Mauser.

These proforma financial statments have been adjusted to give effect to Roch 
and Mauser acquisitions as if such acquisitions had occurred on December 27,
1992. The proforma adjustments are based upon available information and 
certain assumptions that management of Brown & Sharpe believes are 
reasonable and are described in the notes to the Pro Forma Combined Income 
Statements. A proforma balance sheet has not been presented as the 
acquisitions of Roch and Mauser have been reflected in Brown & Sharpe's 
April 2, 1994 balance sheet filed previously on Form 10-Q. 

The Pro Forma Combined Income Statements do not purport to represent what the 
Company's results of operations would actually have been if the acquisitions
of Roch and Mauser had occurred on December 27, 1992 or to project the 
Company's results of operations for any future period.
