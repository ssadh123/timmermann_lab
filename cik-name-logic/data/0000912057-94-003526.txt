FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE October 24, 1994

GRUBB & ELLIS ANNOUNCES THIRD QUARTER PROFIT

SAN FRANCISCO -- Grubb & Ellis Company (NYSE:GBE) reported pre-tax income
of $685,000 and net income of $584,000 on gross revenues of $47.2 million
for the third quarter 1994. The third quarter 1994 profit compares
favorably to a pre-tax loss of $538,000 and a net loss of $638,000 on gross
revenues of $50.9 million for the third quarter of 1993.

Excluding those activities which, at the end of 1993, had been closed or
were expected to close, third quarter 1994 gross revenues increased 7.3%
over comparable third quarter 1993 revenues of $43.9 million. Third
quarter pre-tax income of $685,000 included a favorable adjustment of
$519,000 related to special charges and unusual items recorded in the prior
year.

The third quarter profit marks the first time since 1989 that the company
has reported two consecutive profitable quarters. Historically the
company's weakest quarter is the first quarter, and the last quarter is its
strongest. This trend is expected to continue this year. Year to date,
the company reported a net loss of $3.0 million, or $1.18 per common share,
compared to a net loss of $4.8 million, or $1.61 per common share, for the
same period in 1993.

The company recorded a third quarter loss of $.02 per common share, taking
into effect accrued dividends of $658,000 earned on redeemable convertible
senior and junior preferred stock for the quarter. If converted, the
preferred stock will be exchanged for common stock and accrued dividends
will no longer be payable.

With offices nationwide, Grubb & Ellis Company meets the real estate needs
of corporate users, institutional and private investors, providing real
estate brokerage and consulting, property and facilities management
(through its Axiom subsidiary), appraisal, mortgage brokerage and auction
services.
