ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

ACQUISITION OF WISCONSIN SOUTHERN GAS COMPANY, INC.

Effective at 12:01 a.m. on January 1, 1994, Wisconsin Southern Gas Company,
Inc. ("Wisconsin Southern") was acquired by Wisconsin Energy Corporation
("Wisconsin Energy") through a merger (the "Merger") of Wisconsin Southern
into Wisconsin Natural Gas Company ("Wisconsin Natural"), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy. In the transaction, structured as a tax-free
reorganization, all outstanding shares of Wisconsin Southern common stock were
converted into shares of Wisconsin Energy common stock based on an exchange
ratio (the "Exchange Ratio") of 1.6330 shares of Wisconsin Energy common stock
for each outstanding share of Wisconsin Southern common stock. In lieu of
issuing fractional shares, Wisconsin Energy will pay a sum in cash equal to
the value of such fractional shares based on the average closing price of
Wisconsin Energy common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the ten
trading days immediately preceding the closing date (the "Average Closing
Price"), which was $27.70. As of December 31, 1993, Wisconsin Southern had
1,003,392 shares outstanding.

On December 7, 1993, the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin issued an
order approving the Merger. 

The Merger was effected pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization,
dated as of July 30, 1993, by and among Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Natural
and Wisconsin Southern, including the related Plan and Agreement of Merger
between Wisconsin Southern and Wisconsin Natural (together, the
"Reorganization Agreement"). The Reorganization Agreement was approved by the
requisite vote of the stockholders of Wisconsin Southern at a special meeting 
of stockholders held on November 24, 1993.

Wisconsin Southern was a gas utility engaged in the purchase, distribution, 
transportation and sale of natural gas for residential, commercial and
industrial consumption in 37 cities, villages and unincorporated towns in
southeastern Wisconsin, having a population of approximately 104,000, and in
and around Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, a community of approximately 7,300
persons located in southwestern Wisconsin. Wisconsin Southern's service
territory in southeastern Wisconsin was contiguous to the Wisconsin Natural
service territory west and south of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Wisconsin Natural
will to continue to use the acquired facilities of Wisconsin Southern for the
distribution and transportation of natural gas.

The Exchange Ratio was determined by negotiations among the parties to the
Reorganization Agreement after Wisconsin Southern determined to negotiate
exclusively with Wisconsin Energy following two rounds of bidding by companies
who were solicited by Wisconsin Southern's financial advisor to submit offers
to enter into a business combination transaction with Wisconsin Southern. If
the Average Closing Price had been less than $25.7195 or more than $28.7814,
the Exchange Ratio would have been calculated by dividing $44.50 by the
Average Closing Price, but in no event would the Exchange Ratio have been more
than 1.8167 or less than 1.4830 shares of Wisconsin Energy common stock for
each share of Wisconsin Southern common stock.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Wisconsin Southern Gas
Company, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of WISCONSIN SOUTHERN GAS
COMPANY, INC. (a Wisconsin corporation) as of December 31, 1992 and 1991, and
the related statements of income, cash flows and common shareholders' equity
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1992. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial position of Wisconsin Southern Gas
Company, Inc. as of December 31, 1992 and 1991, and the results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1992, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

principally in portions of southeastern Wisconsin. It is subject to the
accounting and rate regulation of the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin
(PSCW). Significant accounting policies are as follows:

Revenue Recognition--The Company accrues revenues for service rendered but
not yet billed at each month end.

The Company is required to provide service (and grant credit) to customers
within its defined service territory and is precluded by statute from
discontinuing service to residential customers during certain periods of the
year. The Company continuously reviews its customers' credit worthiness and
requests deposits or refunds deposits based on that review.

The Company's rates provide for recovery from all classes of customers of
the cost of gas purchased from its suppliers.

Depreciation--Depreciation provisions are at composite straight-line
rates. The composite straight-line depreciation rate certified by the PSCW was
approximately 3.9% for 1992, 1991 and 1990.

Utility Plant--Utility plant is stated at the original cost of
construction.

Maintenance and repairs to property and replacements of minor items are
charged to maintenance expense. The cost of property retired plus removal
costs, less salvage, is charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation;
as a result, no profit or loss is recognized in connection with ordinary
retirements of depreciable property.

Substantially all of the Company's utility plant is subject to a first
mortgage lien. The Company has no material leases.

Statements of Cash Flows--The Company considers any highly liquid debt
instrument with an original maturity of three months or less at the time of
purchase to be a cash equivalent.

2. Common Stock

As of December 31, 1992, the Company has reserved 30,537 shares of common
stock for issuance under its automatic Dividend Reinvestment and Stock
Purchase Plan.

The Company issued a 3% common stock dividend in 1990. The weighted
average number of common shares outstanding and the earnings per share and
cash dividends per share of common stock, as presented in the Statements of
Income, have been adjusted to reflect the effects of this stock dividend. No
such common stock dividends were declared in 1991 or 1992.

----------- -----------
Net long-term debt ....................... $10,743,000 $11,842,000
=========== ===========

The bond indenture, as supplemented, contains restrictions on the payment
of cash dividends and certain other restrictions. At December 31, 1992, under
these provisions, none of the retained earnings were so restricted. In
addition to these restrictions, the Company follows guidelines as determined
by the PSCW for an optimum long-term capital structure, which can in turn
affect dividend policy.

Long-term debt maturities total $1,099,000, $669,000, $1,354,000, $570,000
and $1,270,000 for the years ending December 31, 1993 through 1997,
respectively.

4. Notes Payable and Lines of Credit

The Company normally maintains a $3 million bank line of credit to obtain
short-term borrowing flexibility, with an option to increase it to $5 million.
The Company has also arranged an additional $3.5 million line of credit to be
in effect until May 31, 1993, bringing total available lines to $8.5 million
for this period. The interest rate on these lines is the prime rate. Prior to
placement of long-term bonds in March 1991, the line was temporarily increased
to $7 million after which it was reduced back to $3 million. In accordance
with normal banking practices, unused lines of credit may generally be
withdrawn at the discretion of the lender. Certain cash balances represent
compensating balances for credit lines and bank services; however, there are
no legal restrictions as to withdrawal of these funds.

The following information relates to short-term borrowings and lines of
credit for the years indicated:
1992 1991 1990
---------- ----------- -----------
As of end of year--
Interest rate on notes payable ....... 6.0% 6.5% 10.0%
Unused lines of credit ............... $3,600,000 $1,200,000 $1,700,000

For the year ended--

Average amount of notes payable ....... $1,111,000 $1,069,000 $1,208,000
Average interest rate on notes payable .. 6.2% 9.2% 10.1%

5. Income Taxes

The Company records deferred income taxes on timing differences.

The Company followed the deferral method of accounting for investment tax
credits whereby such credits are being restored as a reduction of income tax
expense over the useful lives of the related property.

The effective income tax rate is computed by dividing total income tax
expense (including investment tax credit restored) by the sum of such expense
and net income. The following table reconciles the statutory
federal rate to the effective income tax rate:
1992 1991 1990
---- ---- ----

Certain book-tax property differences and other timing items that had not
previously been normalized are being recognized in rates over a 10-year period
that began on October 1, 1991. The remaining unrecorded deferred tax effect of
such items totalled approximately $735,000 as of December 31, 1992.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (SFAS 109), which is
effective in 1993. SFAS 109 requires adjustments to reflect accumulated deferred
income taxes relating to tax rate changes and temporary differences for which
deferred taxes were not previously recorded (as discussed above). The Company
will reflect the initial application of the statement as a cumulative adjustment
in 1993. It is expected that the additional net deferred income tax assets will
be offset by regulatory liabilities totalling $1.6 million, which represent the
expected future revenue requirement impact of these adjustments. As such,
management does not expect the new standard to have a significant impact on the
results of future operations or financial condition.

6. Employee Benefit Plans

The Company has two retirement plans (salaried and non-salaried) covering
substantially all employees. Benefits are based on years of service and
compensation. Contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits
attributed to service rendered to date, but also for those expected to be
earned in the future.

The following table sets forth the plans' funded status at December 31:

1992 1991
----------- -----------

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company provides certain
health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees. Until 
October 1, 1990, the cost of retiree health care and the cost of providing
life insurance were recognized as annual insurance premiums were incurred.
These costs totalled approximately $74,000 for 1990. In October 1990, the
Company formed two voluntary employee's beneficiary association (VEBA) trusts
to fund postretirement health and life insurance benefits. In connection with
a rate order effective October 1990, the Company began collecting amounts in
rates to fund such postretirement benefits. In 1992, 1991 and 1990,
$1,060,000, $940,000 and $224,000 were provided and expensed, for such
funding, respectively.

The FASB has issued a statement, SFAS No. 106, which establishes accounting
and reporting standards for retirement benefits other than pensions. The new
statement requires the accrual of the expected cost of such benefits during
the employees' years of service. The assumptions and calculations involved in
determining the accrual closely parallel pension accounting requirements.

The Company expects to prospectively adopt the standard effective 
January l, 1993 and to amortize the transition obligation to expense over a
twenty-year period. Management has engaged actuaries who have made a
preliminary review using 1992 data. Based on the actuaries' review, the
postretirement transition obligation at January 1, 1993, measured in
accordance with the new standard, is estimated to be $10.3 million. Had the
standard been adopted in 1992, the actuaries estimate that the additional
postretirement benefit cost charged to expense in 1992 would have been
approximately $758,000 (pre-tax). Management believes the effect of actual
adoption in 1993 will be similar, although it could be changed significantly
by changes in health care costs, work force demographics, interest rates, or
plan changes.

As prescribed by the PSCW, effective January 1, 1993, the Company has
adopted SFAS 106 for accounting and ratemaking purposes.

In November of 1992, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standard (SFAS) No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Post Employment Benefits."
SFAS No. 112 establishes standards of financial accounting and reporting for
the estimated costs of benefits provided by an employer to former or inactive
employees after employment but before retirement. The impact of adoption,
which must occur no later than 1994, is not expected to be significant.

The Company also has various deferred compensation and supplemental
retirement plans for directors and officers. Total expenses for such plans
were $251,000, $179,000, and $149,000 for 1992, 1991, and 1990, respectively.

7. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company's 1993 planned expenditures for utility plant additions are
estimated at $4.2 million, and certain commitments have been made in
connection therewith.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

To ensure an adequate supply of natural gas, the Company has entered into
certain long-term contracts. These contracts include a demand component
whereupon payments are required if contracted quantities are not purchased.
Certain conditions may arise that require the Company to make payments under
these demand clauses. The Company has contracts obligating purchases that
total approximately $35 million through 1996. Management believes it will meet
minimum purchase obligations under the contracts.

The Company has hired an environmental engineering firm to perform testing
on a former manufactured gas site previously operated by the Company. Such
testing has determined that remediation work is required at the site; however,
the extent of such work is subject to approval by the Wisconsin Department of
Natural Resources. Future site remediation costs are estimated to total $3-7
million. As of December 31, 1992, the Company has recorded a liability of $3
million for future estimated site remediation costs along with a deferred
charge of $3,171,475, which includes amounts expended through December 31,
1992. Management believes all costs associated with remediation are probable
for recovery in future rates based on correspondence with the PSCW and prior
regulatory treatment by the PSCW. Under current plans, significant
expenditures will not occur until at least 1994.

8. FERC Orders 636 and 636-A

In 1992, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued Orders 
No. 636 and No. 636-A. The 636 Orders require substantial restructuring of the
service obligations of interstate pipelines. Pipelines have initiated
proceedings to negotiate with customers all elements of restructured tariffs
to be in place by the 1993-1994 winter heating season. Among other things, the
636 Orders mandate "unbundling" of existing pipeline gas sales services and
will replace current statutory abandonment procedures, as applied to firm
transportation contracts of more than one year, with a right-of-first-refusal
mechanism. Mandatory unbundling will require pipelines to sell separately the
various components of their existing gas sales services (gathering,
transportation and storage services, and gas supply). These components are now
combined or "bundled" in gas services purchased by the Company. To address
concerns raised by utilities about reliability of service to their service
territories, the 636 Orders require pipelines to offer a "no-notice"
transportation service under which firm transporters can receive delivery of
gas up to their contractual capacity level on any day without prior
scheduling. In addition, the customer may appoint an agent, which may be the
pipeline, to rebundle the component services into a bundled service
substantially similar to existing pipeline service.

The right-of-first-refusal mechanism contained in the 636 Orders replaces
the current abandonment procedures under which a pipeline must, before
abandoning any service, obtain prior FERC approval that discontinuance of the
service is in the public interest. The 636 Orders authorize a pipeline's
abandonment of a long-term (one year or more) transportation service to a
customer whenever the customer fails to match the highest rate and longest
term, up to a maximum of 20 years, offered to the pipeline by other customers
for the particular capacity. Further, the 636 Orders provide for a mechanism
for pipelines to recover prudently incurred transition costs associated with
the restructuring process.

EXHIBIT (99)-2
WISCONSIN SOUTHERN GAS COMPANY, INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--(Continued)

The FERC has initiated individual restructuring proceedings for each
interstate pipeline. Each pipeline is required to submit a proposal to bring
it into compliance with the requirements of the 636 Orders. The Company has
intervened and is participating in the pipeline proceedings, including
settlement negotiations, that are of substantial interest to the Company. The
636 Orders may have transition costs totalling up to $8.1 million; however,
such costs are expected to be recoverable in future rates.

9. Potential Business Combination

In October 1992, the Company's Board of Directors engaged a financial
advisor to study a variety of strategic alternatives including contact with a
select group of companies to investigate their interest in a business
combination. In connection therein, the Company also entered into employment
agreements with certain of its officers and employees. These agreements, which
have terms from two to five years, outline conditions of employment and
specify severance payments which would be paid only after a change in Company
ownership occurs and certain other events take place. If such change in
ownership were to occur, the Company has the possibility of incurring costs
associated with the severance payments, as well as other vested benefits,
recognition of which could be accelerated. The maximum obligation associated
with these agreements would total $2.3 million if all employees subject to the
agreements terminated employment.

On July 30, 1993, Wisconsin Energy Corporation ("Wisconsin Energy"),
Wisconsin Natural Gas Company ("Wisconsin Natural") and the Company entered
into a definitive agreement for the acquisition of the Company by Wisconsin
Energy through the merger of the Company into Wisconsin Natural, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy. Subject to the receipt of various
approvals, the target date for this transaction to close is January 1, 1994.

10. Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

Seasonal factors significantly affect gas distribution utilities, and
therefore, the data presented below should not be expected to be comparable
between quarters. Quarterly data also is not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for an annual period.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL DATA

1. The financial statements have been prepared without audit, pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. This
report is presented generally on the same basis as Wisconsin Southern's
annual report, Form 10-K, filed with the Commission. Reference is also
made to Wisconsin Southern's, Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended
March 31, 1993 for a discussion of the adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard Nos. 106 and 109.

The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments which are, in
the opinion of management, necessary to a fair statement of the results
for the interim periods. Such adjustments are of a normal recurring
nature.

The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the year due to seasonal factors.

2. On July 30, 1993, Wisconsin Energy, Wisconsin Natural and Wisconsin
Southern entered into a definitive agreement for the acquisition of
Wisconsin Southern by Wisconsin Energy through the merger of Wisconsin
Southern into Wisconsin Natural, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Wisconsin
Energy. Subject to receipt of the various approvals, the target date for
the transaction to close is January 1, 1994.

Wisconsin Southern has entered into employment agreements with certain of
its officers and employees. These agreements, which have terms from two
to five years, outline conditions of employment and specify severance
payments which be paid only after a change in Wisconsin Southern ownership
occurs and certain other events take place. If such change in ownership
were to occur, Wisconsin Southern has the possibility of incurring costs
associated with the severance payments, as well as other vested benefits,
recognition of which could be accelerated. The maximum obligation
associated with these agreements would total $2.3 million if all employees
subject to the agreements terminated employment.

3. Wisconsin Southern has hired an environmental engineering firm to perform
testing on a former manufactured gas site previously operated by Wisconsin
Southern. Such testing has determined that remediation work is required
at the site; however, the extent of such work is subject to approval by
the Wisconsin Natural Department of Natural Resources. Wisconsin Southern
has recorded a liability of $3 million for future estimated site
remediation costs, based upon estimates that such costs will total $3 - 7
million in the future. Wisconsin Southern's management believes all costs
associated with remediation are probable for recovery in future rates
based on correspondence with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin
(PSCW) and prior regulatory treatment by the PSCW. Under current plans,
significant expenditures will not occur until at least 1994.
