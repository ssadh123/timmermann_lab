NOTES TO PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)

(a) The increase in cash and cash equivalents represents the cash
consideration received from the sale of the Gulfstream Division
assets after giving effect to the retirement of the Corporation's
7.05% Senior Notes and line of credit notes payable which were
attributable to the Gulfstream Division.

(b) The decrease in trade receivables represents the value of tooling
work in process included in the assets of the Gulfstream Division to
be sold subsequent to the preparation of the September 30, 1994,
financial statements. The consideration paid for these assets is
represented by the $4.0 million note receivable shown on the
accompanying pro forma balance sheet. Automotive Industries, Inc.
assumed the accounts payable liability for the purchased tooling work
in process. The assumed amount is shown as a pro forma adjustment to
the "Historical" accounts payable.

(c) The reduction in accrued expenses and long-term debt reflects the pro
forma repayment of the long-term debt attributable to the Gulfstream
Division.

(d) This designation represents the activity of the Gulfstream Division
for the period(s) presented including interest expense associated
with the debt attributable to the division. Operating expenses and
other income (expense) attributed to the division are reported in a
manner consistent with presentations for prior periods.

(e) Amounts reported as "O'Sullivan Corporation Historical" at
September 30, 1994, represent total consolidated corporate activity
without the effect of the disposal of the Gulfstream Division.
Amounts reported in the Form 10-Q for September 30, 1994, for
continuing operations have previously given effect for the disposal
of the division and correspond to the amounts reported as
"O'Sullivan Corporation Pro Forma" in the accompanying Statement
of Income for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 1994.

(E) "Estimated Excess Capitol Liabilities" means the excess, if any, of the
book value of the liabilities of Capitol (including, without limitation,
intercompany liabilities due to Seller (the "Intercompany Debt"), the book

compensation including, without limitation, with respect to Capitol's
retrospective insurance program with the State of Ohio for the period
beginning July 1, 1994 and ending on the Closing Date and accrued vacation
liabilities and obligations) over the net book value of Capitol's assets
(other than Capitol's Inventory and Capitol's property, plant and equipment
and goodwill (or similar intangible assets), but including, without
limitation, the book value of Capitol's tooling-in-process), in each case
as determined from the Estimated Closing Balance Sheets; provided, however,
that if Buyer and Seller are unable to agree on any of the Estimated
Inventory Value, Net Estimated PP&E Additions, Estimated Transition
Tooling, Estimated Assumed Liabilities and Estimated Excess Capitol
Liabilities, such disputed amounts shall be determined based on the amounts
set forth on Seller's and Capitol's unconsolidated balance sheets as of the
month-ending immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(ii) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, Buyer's
accountants will prepare unconsolidated balance sheets of Seller, with respect
to the Business, and Capitol as at the close of business on the Closing Date
(the "Closing Balance Sheets") for the purpose of establishing the Closing
Inventory Value, Net Closing PP&E Additions, Closing Transition Tooling,
Closing Assumed Liabilities and Closing Excess Capitol Liabilities. For
purposes hereof, (A) "Closing Inventory Value" means the book value of the
Inventory, (B) "Net Closing PP&E Additions" means the amount of capital
expenditures made by Seller, with respect to the Business, and by Capitol
in respect of property, plant and equipment plus, without duplication,
those items relating to approved training and expenses and deposits and
prepayments to the extent that Buyer obtains benefit therefrom after the
Closing Date set forth on Schedule 1(e)(i) attached hereto minus the
greater of (y) the book value of, or (z) the proceeds received from, any
sales, retirements or other dispositions made by Seller, with respect to
the Business, and by Capitol in respect of property, plant and equipment,
in each case, made during the period beginning after June 30, 1994 and
ending on the Closing Date, (C) "Closing Transition Tooling" means the book
value of the Transition Tooling, (D) "Closing Assumed Liabilities" means
the book value of the Dollar Liabilities (which shall include an accrual of
$40,000 for 1994 vacation pay liability for Seller's salaried employees and
an accrual for a pro rata portion of the annual bonus paid by Seller to its
employees involved in the Business), the book value of the Seller Tooling
Costs, and the book value of the Retrospective Workers' Compensation
("Seller's Retrospective WC Accrual") and (E) "Closing Excess Capitol
Liabilities" means the excess, if any, of the book value of the liabilities
of Capitol (including, without limitation, the intercompany liabilities due
to Seller, the Capitol Tooling Costs and the book value of Capitol's
accrued liabilities and reserves relating to workers' compensation,
including, without limitation, with respect to Capitol's retrospective
insurance program with the State of Ohio for the period beginning July 1,
1994 and ending on the Closing Date ("Capitol's Retrospective WC Accrual")
and accrued vacation liabilities and obligations) over the net book value
of Capitol's assets (other than Capitol's Inventory and Capitol's property,
plant and equipment and goodwill (or similar intangible assets), but
including, without limitation, the book value of Capitol's tooling-in-
process), in each case as determined from the Closing Balance Sheets. In
order for Buyer to properly prepare the Closing Balance Sheets, Seller
shall conduct a physical inventory on the Closing Date (or such other date
promptly thereafter as the parties may agree) and shall permit Buyer and
its accountants to observe such inventory. The Closing Balance Sheets and
the Estimated Closing Balance Sheets shall (a) reflect all Acquired Assets
and Assumed Liabilities and all assets and liabilities of Capitol as at the
close of business on the Closing Date, (b) be prepared in accordance with
GAAP (regardless of whether GAAP was applied in prior periods) and (c)
reflect all items and adjustments regardless of materiality. Within sixty
(60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to Seller the Closing
Balance Sheets.

(iii) If the sum of (A) Closing Inventory Value, (B) Net Closing PP&E
Additions (it being understood that Net Closing PP&E Additions may be a
negative number) and (C) Closing Transition Tooling, minus the sum of (Y)
Closing Assumed Liabilities and (Z) Closing Excess Capitol Liabilities (the
"Net Closing Amount") exceeds the sum of (A) Estimated Inventory Value, (B)
Net Estimated PP&E Additions and (C) Estimated Transition Tooling minus the
sum of (Y) Estimated Assumed Liabilities and (Z) Estimated Excess Capitol
Liabilities (the "Net Estimated Amount"), Buyer shall, subject to Section
7(b)(xi) hereof, within three (3) business days pay to Seller the amount of
such excess. If the Net Closing Amount is less than the Net Estimated
Amount, Seller shall within three (3) business days pay to Buyer the amount
of such shortfall. All amounts owed pursuant to this Section 1(e)(iii)
shall include interest, from the Closing Date to the date of payment, at
the Applicable Rate, calculated on the basis of a 365-day year.

(iv) If Seller disagrees with any item on the Closing Balance
Sheets, Seller shall notify Buyer in writing of such disagreement within thirty
(30) business days after Seller's receipt thereof (such notice setting
forth the basis for such disagreement in reasonable detail). Buyer shall
permit Seller access to such personnel and work papers involved with or
relating to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheets as may be
reasonably necessary to permit Seller to review in detail the manner in
which the Closing Balance Sheets were prepared. Buyer and Seller shall
thereafter negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disagreements;
provided, however, that Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, shall within
three (3) business days pay to Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, the
amount determined pursuant to Section 1(e)(iii) above which is not subject
to dispute, if any. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any such
disagreements in (A) respect of non-inventory items within thirty (30)
business days and (B) in respect of inventory items within six (6) months
after the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall engage the Auditor (as
defined in Section 1(e)(v) below) to resolve the disagreements in
accordance with Section 1(e)(v) below.

(v) The "Auditor" shall be KPMG Peat Marwick and shall be retained
solely to resolve the individual disputed line items. Buyer and Seller shall
use their best efforts to cause the Auditor to resolve all disagreements over
individual line items as soon as practicable. The resolution of such
disagreements by the Auditor shall be final and binding on Buyer and
Seller. The fees and expenses of the Auditor shall be shared equally by
Buyer and Seller.

(f) Determination of FN-116 Adjustment. If Buyer receives a
notification from Ford Motor Company ("Ford") confirming to the reasonable
satisfaction of Buyer that the FN-116 program or its successor program will
remain with the Business for the normal life of the program (the "Ford
Notification"), Buyer will, subject to Section 7(b)(xi) hereof, within
thirty (30) business days after determination of such amount in accordance
with the following terms, pay to Seller an amount equal to (i) $1.5 million
multiplied by (ii) the percentage obtained by dividing (a) the aggregate of
the annual gross profit (as determined below) associated with each
component awarded pursuant to the Ford Notification by (b) the aggregate of
the annual gross profit associated with each component relating to the
existing FN-116 program for the 12-month period ended September 30, 1994,
as set forth on Schedule 1(f) attached hereto; provided that in no event
shall Buyer be obligated to pay more than $1.5 million. For purposes
hereof, "annual gross profit," with respect to the new business, will be
determined by multiplying (y) the sales price of each component set forth
in the written notice from Ford containing such information for each such
component minus the production cost for each such component (determined in
good faith by Buyer in accordance with Buyer's estimated standard costs to
produce such parts and consistent with Buyer's past estimating practices)
by (z) the annual financial planning volume for each such component set
forth in the written notice from Ford containing such information.

(g) Allocation of the Purchase Price. A preliminary allocation
of the Purchase Price (plus the Assumed Liabilities) among the Acquired Assets
will be prepared by Buyer and delivered to Seller on or prior to the
Closing Date (the "Preliminary Allocation Schedule"). A final allocation
based substantially on the allocations set forth on the Preliminary
Allocation Schedule will be prepared by Buyer as promptly as practicable
after the Closing Date and, subject to approval by Seller (which approval
will not be unreasonably withheld), shall be the allocation used by the
Parties in preparing (a) Form 8594, Asset Acquisition Statement, for each
of Buyer and Seller, and (b) all Tax Returns. Buyer and Seller shall each
file Form 8594, prepared in accordance with this Section 1(g), with its
federal income Tax Return for its tax period including the Closing Date.
The Parties hereto agree that all allocations made pursuant to this Section
1(g) are binding upon them and upon each of their successors and assigns,
and that they will report the transaction herein in accordance with such
allocations.

(h) Tooling.

(i) With respect to all tooling completed and billed by Seller
including, without limitation, the design and engineering (with respect to the
pre-engineering release) tooling for the VN-127 platform and the design,
engineering and prototype tooling for the DN-101 platform (the "Completed
Tooling")), with respect to the Business, or Capitol on or prior to the
Closing Date, Seller shall be liable for all costs, expenses and
liabilities of any audit of such tooling and Seller shall indemnify Buyer
for any Losses (as defined in Section 7(b)(i)) Buyer may incur or become
subject to as a result of such audit.

(ii) With respect to tooling commenced and billed by Buyer,
with respect to the Business, or Capitol after the Closing Date, Buyer shall be
liable for all costs, expenses and liabilities of any audit of such tooling
and Buyer shall indemnify Seller for any Losses Seller may incur or become
subject to as a result of such audit.

(iii) As soon as practicable after the full program
approval by the customer of the DN-101 platform, Buyer will prepare an
accounting (the "DN-101 Accounting") for the purposes of determining the
Total Revenues, with respect to such platform (the "DN-101 Revenues") and
the Total Costs, with respect to such platform (the "DN-101 Costs").
Within 90 days following such program approval (the "DN-101 Date"), Buyer
will deliver to Seller the DN-101 Accounting. If the DN-101 Revenues equal
or exceed the DN-101 Costs (such excess, the "DN-101 Reserve"), Buyer will,
subject to Section 7(b)(xi) hereof, within three business days following
the DN-101 Date, pay to Seller $2.5 million. If the DN-101 Costs exceed
the DN-101 Revenues (such excess, the "DN-101 Shortfall"), Buyer will,
subject to Section 7(b)(xi) hereof, within three business days following
the DN-101 Date, pay to Seller an amount equal to $2.5 million less the DN-
101 Shortfall. If the DN-101 Shortfall exceeds $2.5 million, Seller will,
subject to Section 7(b)(xi) hereof, within three business days following
the DN-101 Date, pay to Buyer the amount of such excess. If there exists a
DN-101 Shortfall and Buyer receives additional DN-101 Revenues after the DN-
101 Date, then Buyer shall promptly pay, subject to Section 7(b)(xi)
hereof, such additional DN-101 Revenues to Seller up to an amount equal to
the DN-101 Shortfall.

(iv) On or prior to June 1, 1997, Buyer will, subject to
Section 7(b)(xi) hereof, pay to Seller the lesser of (A) $0.5 million
(plus interest accruing at the Applicable Rate from the Closing Date) plus
any DN-101 Reserve, minus any Seller Responsible Costs (not otherwise
included in the calculation of the DN-101 Costs above), with respect to
such platform, arising (whether by audit or otherwise) after the DN-101
Date or (B) $0.5 million (plus interest accruing at the Applicable Rate
from the Closing Date). If the computation set forth in clause (A) above
results in the negative amount ("Net Audit Cost"), Seller will, subject to
Section 7(b)(xi) hereof, promptly pay to Buyer an amount equal to the Net
Audit Cost.

(v) With respect to each of the WN-97 platform, the Honda
Civic platform and the Honda Accord platform, as soon as practicable after
the full program approval by the customer of each such platform, Buyer will
prepare an accounting (each, a "Tooling Accounting") for the purposes of
determining the Total Revenues and Total Costs, with respect to each
platform. Within 90 days following each such program approval (each, an
"Approval Date"), Buyer will deliver to Seller the relevant Tooling
Accounting. If the Total Costs set forth on any Tooling Accounting exceed
the Total Revenues set forth on such Tooling Accounting (each, a
"Shortfall"), the Seller will, subject to Section 7(b)(xi) hereof, within
three business days following the relevant Approval Date, pay to Buyer the
amount of any such Shortfall. Seller will, subject to Section 7(b)(xi)
hereof, promptly pay to Buyer any Seller Responsible Costs, with respect to
any such program, arising (whether by audit or otherwise) after the
relevant Approval Date. If, with respect to each such program, there
exists a Shortfall and Buyer receives additional revenues not reflected on
the applicable Tooling Accounting, then Buyer shall promptly pay, subject
to Section 7(b)(xi) hereof, such additional revenues to Seller up to an
amount equal to such Shortfall. If, with respect to each such program,
there exists a Shortfall, then 180 days after the relevant Approval Date,
Buyer will assign, at Seller's request, any claim, refund, right of
recovery, right of setoff or right of recoupment against its customer with
respect to any uncollected revenues relating to such program, to the extent
Buyer is not then pursuing any such claim, refund or right.

(vi) As soon as practicable after the full program approval
by the customer of the VN-127 platform, Buyer shall prepare an accounting
(the "VN-127 Accounting") for the purposes of determining the Total
Revenues, with respect to such platform (the "VN-127 Revenues"), and the
Total Costs, with respect to such platform (the "VN-127 Costs"). Within 90
days following such program approval (the "VN-127 Date"), Buyer will
deliver to Seller the VN-127 Accounting. If the VN-127 Revenues equal or
exceed the VN-127 Costs, Buyer will, subject to Section 7(b)(xi) hereof,
within three business days following the VN-127 Date, pay to Seller $1.0
million. If the VN-127 Costs exceed the VN-127 Revenues (such excess, the
"VN-127 Shortfall") Buyer will, subject to Section 7(b)(xi) hereof, within
three business days following the VN-127 Date, pay to Seller the excess of
$1.0 million over the VN-127 Shortfall. If the VN-127 Shortfall exceeds
$1.0 million, Seller will, subject to Section 7(b)(xi) hereof, within three
business days following the VN-127 Date, pay to Buyer the amount of such
excess. Seller will, subject to Section 7(b)(xi) hereof, promptly pay to
Buyer any Seller Responsible Costs, with respect to such platform, arising
(whether by audit or otherwise) after the VN-127 Date. If there exists a
VN-127 Shortfall and Buyer receives additional VN-127 Revenues after the VN-
127 Date, then Buyer shall, subject to Section 7(b)(xi) hereof, promptly
pay such additional VN-127 Revenues to Seller up to an amount of the VN-127
Shortfall.

(vii) On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller will deliver
to Buyer Schedule 1(h)(vii) (the "Tooling Projection Schedule") which sets
forth a projection of Total Revenues and Total Costs with respect to each
item of tooling described above. Seller represents to Buyer that the
projections set forth on the Tooling Projection Schedule contains no
intentional misstatement or intentional misrepresentation of the projected
revenues of any item of tooling. If, 180 days after the DN-101 Date,
Seller has not received $2.5 million pursuant to Section 1(h)(iii) above,
Buyer will assign, at Seller's request, any claim refund, right of
recovery, right of setoff or right of recoupment against its customer with
respect to any uncollected revenues relating to the DN-101 platform, to the
extent Buyer is not then pursuing any such claim. If, 180 days after the
VN-127 Date, Seller has not received $1.0 million pursuant to Section
1(h)(vi) above, Buyer will assign, at Seller's request, any claim, refund,
right of recovery, right of setoff or right of recoupment against its
customer with respect to any uncollected revenues relating to the VN-127
platform, to the extent Buyer is not then pursuing any such claim, refund
or right. If, with respect to any claim, refund or right that is not
assigned to Seller under this Section or Section 1(h)(v) because Buyer is
pursuing it, Buyer is no longer pursuing such claim, refund or right in
good faith, then Buyer shall assign promptly, at Seller's request, such
claim, refund or right.

(viii) If Seller disagrees with any item on the DN-101
Accounting, the VN-127 Accounting or any Tooling Accounting, or the items
constituting any Net Audit Costs, Seller shall notify Buyer in writing of
such disagreement within thirty (30) business days after Seller's receipt
thereof (such notice setting forth the basis for such disagreement in
reasonable detail). Buyer shall permit Seller access to such personnel and
work papers involved with or relating to the preparation of DN-101
Accounting, the VN-127 Accounting or any Tooling Accounting, or the items
constituting any Net Audit Costs, as the case may be, as may be reasonably
necessary to permit Seller to review in detail the manner in which the DN-
101 Accounting, the VN-127 Accounting or any Tooling Accounting, or the
items constituting any Net Audit Costs, as the case may be, were prepared.
Buyer and Seller shall thereafter negotiate in good faith to resolve any
such disagreements; provided, however, that Seller or Buyer, as the case
may be, shall within three (3) business days pay to Buyer or Seller, as the
case may be, the amount determined pursuant to Section 1(h)(iii), (iv), (v)
or (vi) above, as the case may be, which is not subject to dispute, if any.
If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve any such disagreements within
thirty (30) business days, Buyer and Seller shall engage the Auditor to
resolve the disagreements in accordance with Section 1(e)(v) above. Buyer
agrees to manage the Transition Tooling in a manner consistent with Buyer's
and its Affiliate's other similar tooling arrangements. The Parties also
agree to advise and consult with one another in respect of the management
of the Transition Tooling.

(ix) All amounts actually paid or setoff pursuant to this
Section 1(h) shall (A) be made in immediately available funds by wire
transfer and (B) (other than payments made to Seller pursuant to Section
1(h)(iv) above) include interest at the Applicable Rate, calculated on the
basis of a 365-day year, accruing from the Closing Date; provided, however,
that any such amounts paid to, or setoff by, Buyer shall accrue interest
from the date on which such amount became due until such amount is paid or
setoff.

(x) For purposes hereof, "Total Costs" means, with respect
to any item of tooling, the actual costs incurred by Buyer plus any Seller
Tooling Cost or Capitol Tooling Costs in respect of such item, except to
the extent any such cost is a Buyer Responsible Cost; "Total Revenues"
means, with respect to any item of tooling, actual revenues received by
Buyer (including, without duplication or limitation, the Closing Transition
Tooling) in respect of such item, except to the extent any such revenue is
received as a result of a Buyer Responsible Cost; "Seller Responsible
Costs" means, with respect to any item of tooling, any cost relating to (A)
a design or engineering mistake or inadequacy during the Seller's
management of the program causing failure in the production of a quality
part (B) excessive normal supplier costs in areas, such as testing,
resulting from Seller's or Capitol's (prior to the Closing Date) mistake or
inadequacy of design and engineering activity requiring re-testing (C)
check fixtures not constructed in accordance with customer specifications
calling for Gauge R & R with a 30% error factor, (D) modifications or
additional tooling necessary to produce a part within the cycle time and
process parameters anticipated in the determination by Seller of the target
piece price for the part, (E) prototype costs to the extent such costs are
not recoverable from the customers as a separate component of the piece
price on the purchase order received from the customer or (F) one-half of
costs incurred because of inconsistent customer specifications such as
CMM/test fixture upgrades; "Buyer Responsible Costs" means, with respect to
any item of tooling, any cost (A) associated with a change caused by the
customer regarding the original requirements of the part concerning fit,
form and function, (B) customarily expected to be absorbed by a supplier
and recovered through the piece price such as initial product testing, (C)
expected to produce a pay-back or return to the Buyer because of
manufacturing efficiency gains over and above what is necessary to produce
a part within the cycle time and process parameters anticipated in the
determination by Seller of target piece price for the part, (D) resulting
from the Buyer's preference for production methods or quality controls in
excess of what is specified by the customer, (E) one-half of costs incurred
because of inconsistent customer specifications such as CMM/test fixture
upgrades or (F) resulting from an error or mistake during Buyer's
management of the program.

(i) Intercompany Indebtedness. Immediately following the
acquisition of the Acquired Assets, Buyer will cause Capitol to pay to Seller
an amount equal to the Intercompany Debt, as reflected in the Estimated Closing
Balance Sheets. Upon final determination of the Closing Balance Sheets,
Buyer and Capitol will settle on the intercompany liabilities due to the
Seller as reflected in the Closing Balance Sheets in a manner consistent
with Section 1(e) and upon such settlement it will represent the discharge
in full of all intercompany indebtedness owed by Capitol to Seller.

(j) Workers' Compensation.

(i) On or prior to December 1 of each year commencing
December 1, 1995 until the final settlement of the Seller's and Capitol's

Program") with the State of Ohio, Buyer will prepare an annual accounting
(each, a "WC Accounting") for the purposes of determining Buyer's and
Capitol's actual costs incurred in connection with the Retrospective

"NAAO Credits" and collectively, with the PTPD credits, the "SPECS
Credits") from Ford Motor Company. Seller may, and after the Closing Buyer
may, use the excess PTPD Credits to offset NAAO SPECS credit requirements
set forth under the Ford Motor Company long term contract with Seller (the
"Ford LTA"). The PTPD SPECS saves required pursuant to the Ford LTA are
covered for each of fiscal 1994, 1995 and 1996 and the NAAO SPECS saves
required pursuant to the Ford LTA (after giving effect to the application
of excess PTPD SPECS saves) are covered for each of fiscal 1994 and 1995.

(ii) Pricing. Attached on Schedule 4(w) are (A) copies of letters
that Seller has received from Ford Motor Company with respect to the pricing of
the MN12, VN58 and VN127 platforms indicating for the MN12 platform an
increase in annual sales revenues by not less than $1.65 million and for
the VN58 and VN127 platforms an across-the-board 6% price increase and with
respect to the elimination of the 3.5% productivity requirement set forth
in Ford LTA for fiscal year 1996 and the decrease of the current commodity
price increase absorption rate set forth in the Ford LTA from 4% to 2% for
fiscal 1995 and 1996 in each case for that portion of the Business located
in Huron, Ohio and (B) a list of existing prices for the MN12 platform and
a list of the modified prices for such platform as disclosed in such
letters.

in this Section 4 and elsewhere in this Agreement will be true and correct on
the Closing Date as though then made, except for written disclosures made
by Seller to Buyer prior to the Closing.

with respect to the period between the execution of this Agreement and the
Closing.

(a) General. Each of the Parties will use reasonable efforts to
take all action and to do all things necessary in order to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Notices and Consents. Each Party will give any notice to

without limitation, those consents indicated as necessary pursuant to
Sections 4(m) and 4(p) and those notices as necessary pursuant to Sections

filings with, and use reasonable efforts to obtain any authorizations,
consents, and approvals of governments and governmental agencies in
connection with the matters referred to in Section 4(c) and Section 5(c)
above.

(c) Operation of the Business.

(i) Seller will not engage in any practice, take any action, or
enter into any transaction relating to the Business or to Capitol outside the
ordinary course of business, including the management of its working
capital other than in accordance with past custom and practice. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller will not, and will cause
Capitol to not, engage in any practice, take any action, or enter into any
transaction which would be required to be disclosed under Section 4(g)
above. Seller and Capitol may not make without Buyer's prior approval
capital expenditures in excess of $10,000 per item; provided that Seller or
Capitol may make capital expenditures on an emergency basis of up to
$20,000 per item.

(ii) Neither Capitol nor Seller will make any payments to any of
their respective tooling vendors, other than in accordance with its past custom
and practice.

(d) Preservation of the Business. Seller will, and will cause
Capitol to, make all commercially reasonable efforts to conduct their
respective businesses and maintain their respective properties in
accordance with past custom and practice, including their present
operations, physical facilities, equipment, working conditions, and
relationships with lessors, licensors, suppliers, customers, and employees.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller will, and will
cause Capitol to, make all commercially reasonable efforts to pay expenses
and payables, purchase inventory, perform all maintenance and repairs and
collect receivables in the ordinary course of business in accordance with
past custom and practice. Seller will not be deemed to be in breach under
this section if Buyer does not approve an expenditure pursuant to Section 6(c).

(e) Full Access. Seller will permit representatives of Buyer
(including its accountants, attorneys, consultants, lenders and other
agents) to have full access at all reasonable times, and in a manner so as
not to interfere with the normal business operations of Seller to all
premises, properties, personnel, books, records (including Tax records),
contracts, and documents of or pertaining to the Business and the business
of Capitol.

(f) Notice of Developments. Seller will give prompt written
notice to Buyer of any development causing, or reasonably likely to cause, a
breach in any material respect of any of the representations and warranties
in Section 4 above. Buyer will give prompt written notice to Seller of any
development causing, or reasonably likely to cause, a breach in any
material respect of any of its representations and warranties in Section 5
above. No disclosure by any Party pursuant to this Section 6(f), however,
shall be deemed to cure any breach of any representation or warranty
contained herein.

(g) Exclusivity. Seller will not, and will cause Capitol and
their respective officers, directors, agents and Affiliates to not, discuss a
possible sale or other disposition of all or any part of the assets of the
Business or the stock or assets of Capitol, other than inventory in the
ordinary course of business (whether by merger, reorganization,
recapitalization or otherwise) with any party other than Buyer (an
"Acquisition Proposal") or provide any information to any other party
regarding the Business or Capitol other than information which is
traditionally provided in the regular course of its business operations to
third parties where Seller and its officers, directors, agents and
Affiliates have no reason to believe that such information may be utilized
to evaluate a possible sale or other disposition of the Business or
Capitol. Seller and its officers, directors and Affiliates (i) do not have
any agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) will cease and cause to be terminated any and all
discussions with third parties regarding any Acquisition Proposal and (iii)
will promptly notify Buyer if any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or
contact with any person or entity with respect thereto, is made.

(h) Title Insurance. Seller will assist Buyer in obtaining an
Owner's Policy of Title Insurance reasonably acceptable to Buyer for each
parcel of real property set forth on Schedule 4(l)(i), in an amount equal
to the fair market value of such real property (including all improvements
located thereon), insuring title to such real property to be in Buyer as of
the Closing (subject only to the title exceptions described in
Schedule 4(l)(i) and Schedule 4(l)(ii)) and containing the special
endorsements set forth on Schedule 6(h) attached hereto; provided, however,
to the extent not obtained prior to the Closing Date, Seller will continue
to assist Buyer in obtaining any such special endorsement after the Closing
Date. Buyer and Seller will share equally the fees and expenses related to
obtaining such title insurance.

(i) Surveys. With respect to each parcel of real property as to
which a title insurance policy is to be procured pursuant to Section 6(h)
above, Seller will assist Buyer in procuring a current survey of such real
property certified to Buyer, prepared by a licensed surveyor and conforming
to current ALTA Minimum Detail Requirements for Land Title Surveys (the
"Survey"). The Survey shall not disclose any material survey defect or
encroachment from or onto the real property (other than those set forth on
Schedule 4(l)(ii)) which has not been cured or insured over prior to the
Closing. Seller and Buyer will share equally the fees and expenses related
to procuring the Surveys.

Section 7. Additional Agreements.

(a) Survival. Subject to Section 7(b) below, the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement or in any certificate or other writing delivered in connection with
this Agreemen will survive the Closing Date and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby notwithstanding any examination made for or on
behalf of Buyer or Seller or the knowledge of any of Buyer's or Seller's
officers, directors, shareholders, employees, Affiliates or agents.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4(v) (Environment, Health, and Safety) shall not survive the Closing
Date.

(b) Indemnification.

(i) Subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 7(b)(ii),
7(b)(iii), 7(b)(v), and 7(b)(vi) below, Seller agrees to indemnify and hold
Buyer, its officers, directors, shareholders, employees and Affiliates
(collectively, the "Buyer Group") harmless against any loss, liability, damage
or expense, including reasonable legal expenses and costs ("Losses"), which
they may suffer, sustain, or become subject to, as the result of:

(A) the breach of any representation or warranty contained
in this Agreement (other than a representation or warranty set forth in Section
4(v) above);

(B) the breach of any covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement;

(C) any Excluded Liability;

(D) any claim by any shareholder, or class or group of
shareholders, of Seller in respect of the transactions contemplated hereby;

(E) any Known Environmental Conditions; or

(F) any Unknown Environmental Conditions.

(ii) With respect to claims for breaches of representations and
warranties referred to in Section 7(b)(i)(A) above (other than representations
and warranties set forth in Section 4(w) (Business), in Section 4(j) (Tax
Matters) (to the extent relating to Capitol's obligations) above or Section
1(h)), (w) Seller will not be liable to the Buyer Group for any Loss
relating to any particular breach if such Loss is less than $10,000, (x)
Seller will be liable to the Buyer Group for Losses only if the aggregate
amount of all such Losses relating to all such breaches plus Losses
relating to Section 7(b)(i)(F) above, subject to the limitations set forth
in Section 7(b)(v) below, exceeds $500,000, in which case Seller will be
liable only for such excess, (y) Seller will not be liable for any Losses
arising therefrom unless written notice of such breach is given by the
Buyer Group to Seller within fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date,
except for: (A) Losses arising from the representations and warranties
contained in Sections 4(a) (Organization), 4(b) (Authority), 4(c)
(Noncontravention), 4(h) (Undisclosed Liabilities), 4(i) (Legal
Compliance), 4(m) (Intellectual Property), 4(s) (Litigation), 4(u)
(Employee Benefits), and 4(w) (Business) in which case written notice of
such breach may be given by the Buyer Group to Seller within three (3)
years after the Closing Date; (B) Losses arising from a breach of the
representation and warranty contained in Section 4(j) (Tax Matters) above
in which case written notice of such breach may be given by the Buyer Group
to Seller prior to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations;
and (C) Losses arising from a breach of the representation and warranty
contained in Sections 4(k) (Title to Personal Property) and 4(e)
(Subsidiaries, Investments and Capital Stock) above in which case Seller
shall remain liable forever; provided that in the case of a breach of any
representation or warranty set forth in Section 4(x) (Closing Date) where
the subject matter of such breach is addressed by one of the
representations and warranties referred to in the previous exceptions, the
time limitation set forth in such exceptions shall control when written
notice of such breach must be given and (z) Seller will be liable to the
Buyer Group for Losses relating to any breach of Section 4(n), 4(o) or 4(q)
only to the extent such Loss has not previously been collected by Buyer
pursuant to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheets. If any Loss
arising from a breach of representation or warranty referred to in Section
7(b)(i)(A) above also constitutes a Loss arising out of or relating to an
Excluded Liability, such Loss will be deemed to be an Excluded Liability
for purposes of Section 7(b)(i), and, thus, not subject to the limitations
set forth in the first sentence of this Section 7(b)(ii).

(iii) With respect to any matter for which indemnification is provided
pursuant to Section 7(b)(i)(E) or (F) hereof, Seller shall have sixty (60)
days after receipt of written notice thereof (with such notice stating with
reasonable specificity the nature and basis of the assertion and the amount
thereof to the extent known) from Buyer (such notice being deemed given for
any Known Environmental Conditions) (or such shorter period as exigent
circumstances may dictate in Buyer's sole but reasonable judgment) to
either (A) acknowledge in writing that it will indemnify (such
acknowledgement being deemed given for any Known Environmental Condition)
Buyer with respect to such matter, in which case Seller shall undertake,
conduct and control, through counsel, consultants and contractors of
Seller's own choosing (and reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) and expense,
the defense, investigation, remediation, and settlement thereof or (B) fail
to acknowledge in writing that it will indemnify Buyer with respect to such
matter, in which case Seller shall permit Buyer to assume the conduct and
control of the defense, investigation, remediation, and settlement thereof
through counsel, consultants and contractors of Buyer's own choosing (and
reasonably satisfactory to Seller); provided that if it is ultimately
determined that Seller is liable to Buyer with respect to such matter, the
fees and expenses of Buyer's counsel, consultants and contractors shall be
indemnified hereunder. If Seller does not notify Buyer within sixty (60)
days after the receipt of Buyer's notice of a claim of indemnity hereunder
(or such shorter period as exigent circumstances may dictate in Buyer's
sole but reasonable judgment) of its election pursuant to this Section
7(b)(iii), Buyer shall have the right to assume the defense, investigation,
remediation, and settlement thereof, and to contest, settle or compromise
any claim relating thereto, and shall not waive any right to indemnity
thereby. Upon acknowledging its indemnification obligations hereunder,
Seller shall have the right to conduct all Remedial Actions and other
activities necessary to comply with its obligations hereunder and Seller
shall have principal decision-making authority and control as to such
matters; provided that in exercising its rights and obligations, Seller
shall not take actions that would prevent or hinder Buyer from complying in
all material respects with Environmental, Health and Safety Laws, or
unreasonably interfere with any of Buyer's operations (taking into account
the scope of the Remedial Actions). Buyer shall have the right to review
all nonprivileged documents and other information relating to Seller's
investigations, studies, actions and activities in the performance of any
obligations hereunder and Buyer shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity
to attend all nonprivileged material meetings and conferences relating
thereto. Seller shall consult in good faith with Buyer with respect to
such matters. Seller will not, without the written consent of Buyer (which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld) consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to any matter
indemnified hereunder. A Remedial Action shall be deemed adequate for
purposes of satisfying Seller's obligations hereunder to the extent such
Remedial Action:

(Y) attains compliance in a reasonably cost effective
manner with Environmental, Health and Safety Laws and applicable or
relevant and appropriate action levels or cleanup standards promulgated
thereunder, and reasonably mitigates any substantial risk to human health
and the environment; and

(Z) complies with any lawful order or directive of an
appropriate governmental authority.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
with respect to Item 2 of Schedule 7(b) for which indemnification is provided
pursuant to Section 7(b)(i)(E) hereof, the following shall apply. Seller
shall draft a detailed plan to repair and/or replace the inadequate floor
and hydraulic oil collection system at the Harris facility in Winchester,
Virginia ("Floor and Oil Collection System Plan" or "System Plan"). The
Floor and Oil Collection System Plan shall be based on the Floor and Oil
Collection System Outline set forth in Schedule 7(b)(iv) hereto. The Floor
and Oil Collection System Plan shall: (i) describe how the floor and the
hydraulic oil collection system shall be repaired and/or replaced to
prevent hydraulic oil releases to soil or groundwater; (ii) identify the
personnel and/or contractors that will be used; (iii) describe how all
activities shall be carried out so as not to prevent or hinder Buyer from
complying in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules and
regulations or unreasonably interfere with any of Buyer's operations; (iv)
contain a schedule for implementation; (v) comply with all applicable laws,
rules and regulations; and (vi) be consistent with good engineering
practice. Seller shall promptly, and in any case within sixty (60) days
after the Closing Date, present the Floor and Oil Collection System Plan to
Buyer for approval by Buyer. Buyer shall promptly, and in any case within
twenty (20) days of receipt of the System Plan, indicate in writing whether
it approves the System Plan, with such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld by Buyer. If Buyer does not approve the System Plan, Buyer shall
provide Seller with the reasons for its disapproval and Buyer and Seller
shall cooperate in good faith to promptly resolve the reasons for such
disapproval. Promptly after Buyer approves the Floor and Oil Collection
System Plan, and in any case within one year after such approval, Seller
shall conduct and implement the Floor and Oil Collection System Plan. The
implementation of the System Plan shall be carried out pursuant to the
terms of the System Plan and shall not prevent or hinder Buyer from
complying in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules and
regulations nor shall it unreasonably interfere with any of Buyer's
operations. Upon completion of the actions called for in the System Plan,
Seller shall so notify Buyer in writing and Buyer shall be permitted to
inspect the completed work. Buyer shall promptly, and in any case within
twenty (20) days of receipt of a notice of completion, indicate in writing
whether it approves of the work, with such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld by Buyer. If Buyer does not approve of the work, Buyer shall
provide Seller with the reasons for its disapproval and Buyer and Seller
shall cooperate in good faith to promptly resolve the reasons for such
disapproval. Once Buyer approves of the work (the "Buyer Approval"), Item
2 shall be deemed to have been removed from Schedule 7(b).

(v) With respect to claims for Unknown Environmental Conditions
referred to in Section 7(b)(i)(F) above, (y) Seller will not be liable to Buyer
Group for any Loss arising therefrom unless written notice of an
Environmental Condition is given by the Buyer Group to Seller within five
(5) years after the Closing Date (with such notice stating with reasonable
specificity the nature and basis of the assertion and the amount thereof to
the extent known) and (z) Seller will be liable to the Buyer Group for
Losses only if the aggregate amount of all such Losses relating to all such
Unknown Environmental Conditions plus Losses relating to Section 7(b)(i)(A)
above, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 7(b)(ii) and Section
7(b)(vi), exceeds $500,000. If any Loss arising from a claim for an
Unknown Environmental Condition referred to in Section 7(b)(i)(F) above
also constitutes a Loss arising out of an Excluded Liability such Loss will
be deemed to be an Unknown Environmental Condition for purposes of Section
7(b)(i), and, thus, will be subject to the limitations set forth in this
Section 7(b)(v).

(vi) Seller's obligations under this Agreement in respect of Unknown
Environmental Conditions shall be reduced to the extent that any actual
knowing (without imputing knowledge) act or failures to act by, or gross
negligence of, Buyer or its Affiliates, successors or assigns after the
Closing substantially and adversely affect such obligations. Seller's
obligations under this Agreement in respect of Item 3 of Schedule 7(b)
shall be reduced to the extent that any act or failures to act by Buyer or
its Affiliates, successors or assigns occurring after the date of the Buyer
Approval adversely affects such obligations. Buyer agrees to act in a
reasonably prudent manner in respect of monitoring the existing pumping
facilities located at the Harris Facility and maintaining the hydraulic oil
collection system for the equipment located therein.

(vii) Notwithstanding any other provision herein, Seller's obligations
under this Agreement in respect to Item 6 of Schedule 7(b) shall be limited to
the following: (x) Seller shall be responsible for Losses arising from
exceedance of air permit limitations by Seller, at the Harris Facility
before the Closing Date, and (y) if the Permit Amendment (as defined below)
is not issued by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality ("DEQ"),
Seller shall indemnify Buyer for its reasonable costs incurred during the
one-year period following the Closing Date (a) in moving such portion of
its painting operations from the Harris Facility to another of Buyer's
locations and (b) of outsourcing any such operations in the event Buyer is
unable to move such operations to its other locations, each as is
sufficient to allow Buyer to conduct business at the Harris Facility under
the air permit limitations for the Harris Facility in existence on the
Closing Date. Buyer's obligations under clause (y) above shall be reduced
to the extent that changes in operations at the Harris Facility following
the Closing Date contribute to the exceedance of applicable air permit
limitations. The Parties agree to cooperate and work in good faith to
minimize the costs referred to in clause (y) if the Permit Amendment is not
obtained. "Permit Amendment" shall mean a revision of the current air
permit issued to Seller by the DEQ to provide for increases in permitted
emissions as requested by Seller in an application that has been submitted
to the DEQ and provided to the Buyer. The Parties agree to use their
reasonable efforts to obtain Ford's consent to accept parts painted with
water based paint to help avoid having to relocate the painting operations
at the Harris Facility.

(viii) Subject to Section 7(b)(xi) below, Buyer agrees to indemnify
and hold Seller, its officers, directors, shareholders, employees and
Affiliates (the "Seller Group") harmless against any Losses which they may
suffer, sustain or become subject to, as the result of:

(A) a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, or
agreement by Buyer contained in this Agreement;

(B) any Assumed Liability; or

(C) Buyer's failure to cause Capitol after the Closing Date
to honor any collective bargaining agreement to which Capitol is a party.

(ix) With respect to claims for breaches of representations and
warranties referred to in Section 7(b)(viii)(A) above, (w) Buyer will not
be liable to the Seller Group for any Loss relating to a particular breach
if such Loss is less than $10,000, (x) Buyer will be liable to Seller Group
for Losses arising therefrom only if the aggregate amount of all such
Losses resulting to the Seller Group from all such breaches or claims
exceeds $500,000, in which case Buyer will be liable only for such excess,
and (y) Buyer will not be liable for any Losses arising therefrom unless
written notice thereof is given by Seller to Buyer within three years after
the Closing Date.

(x) If any third party shall notify any Party (the "Indemnified
Party") with respect to any matter which may give rise to a claim for
indemnification against any other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") under
this Section 7(b), then the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify each
Indemnifying Party thereof, stating the nature and basis of the assertion
and the amount thereof to the extent known. Failure of the Indemnified
Party to give such prompt notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party
from any liability which it may have on account of this indemnification or
otherwise, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced
thereby. Once the Indemnified Party has given notice of the matter to all
of the Indemnifying Parties, the Indemnified Party may defend against the
matter in any manner it reasonably may deem appropriate. Within thirty
(30) days after receipt of notice of a particular matter, the Indemnifying
Party may assume the defense of such matter if the Indemnifying Party
admits responsibility and reaffirms its obligation for indemnification with
respect to such matter; provided, however, that (x) the Indemnifying Party
will retain counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, (y) the
Indemnified Party may participate at its own expense in the defense of such
claim with co-counsel of its choice to the extent that the Indemnified
Party believes in its sole discretion that such matter will materially and
adversely affect its ongoing business and (z) the Indemnifying Party will
not consent without written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld) to the entry of any judgment with
respect to the matter or enter into any settlement with respect to the
matter which does not include a provision whereby the plaintiff or claimant
in the matter releases the Indemnified Party from all liability with
respect thereto. If, within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party
does not assume the defense of such matter, the Indemnified Party may
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to the matter or enter
into any settlement with respect to matter without the consent of the
Indemnifying Party.

(xi) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Section
7(b), in the event that Seller or Buyer breaches any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, Buyer or Seller, as the
case may be, may, at its option, setoff all or any portion of the Losses
which the Buyer Group or the Seller Group, as the case may be, suffers,
sustains or becomes subject to as a result of such breach against any
amounts due or to become due to Seller, or Buyer, as the case may be,
including, without limitation, any amounts due or to become due to Seller
under Sections 1(e), 1(f), 1(h) and 1(j) hereof.

(c) Press Release and Announcements. No Party shall issue any
press release or make any public announcement relating to the subject matter of
this Agreement (including announcements to customers, suppliers, etc.)
prior to the Closing without the prior written approval of each of the
other Parties, except that any Party may make any announcement required by
law after notice to the other Party and consultation with such Party.

(d) Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, each of
Buyer and Seller will bear its own costs and expenses (including, without
limitation, all legal, accounting, consulting, investment banking, brokerage
and other fees and expenses) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that Buyer and Seller
shall share equally the filing fee relating to the filing required by the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.

(e) Tax Covenants.

(i) Seller shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and
filed, with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign governmental agencies
all Tax Returns required to be filed relating to Capitol for periods ending on
or prior to the Closing Date and all Tax Returns required to be filed for
which Seller and Capitol are members of an "affiliated group" (or other
group filing on a consolidated basis) (a "Pre-Closing Return"). Seller
shall deliver a copy of any Pre-Closing Return filed after the Closing Date
to Buyer promptly after filing if and to the extent such return relates to
Capitol. Seller shall be liable for, and indemnify Buyer for, all Taxes
due and payable (whether by audit, amended Tax Return or any other action)
by Seller, with respect to the Business, or Capitol for any period ending
on or prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to
be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns required to be filed by Capitol
covering a tax year commencing prior to the Closing Date and ending after
the Closing Date (a "Straddle Tax Return"). Buyer shall have the right to
receive from Seller that portion of the Taxes which relates to the portion
of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date to the extent such Taxes
are not accrued, with respect to Capitol, on the Closing Balance Sheets.
For purposes of this Section 7(e), in the case of any Taxes that are
imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date, the portion of such Tax
which relates to the portion of such taxable period ending on the Closing
Date shall be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the
relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date. If an audit, amended
Tax Return or other action results in a refund of Taxes with respect to any
period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, such refund (including any
interest paid thereon) shall be paid to Seller if and when received by
Capitol or Buyer. Seller will furnish to Buyer all information and records
reasonably requested by Buyer for use in preparation of any Straddle Tax
Returns. Buyer shall allow Seller to review, comment upon and reasonably
approve without undue delay any Straddle Tax Return at any time during the
forty-five (45) days immediately preceding the filing of such Straddle Tax
Return.

(ii) All transfer (including real estate transfer taxes),
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be shared equally by Buyer
and Seller when due, and each Party will, at its own expense, file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration taxes and fees, and, if
required by applicable law, each Party will, and will cause its Affiliates
to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

(f) Further Assurances. Each Party will execute and deliver
such further instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such additional
action as the other Party may reasonably request to effect, consummate,
confirm or evidence the transfer to each Party of the Acquired Assets
and/or Assumed Liabilities, as applicable, and Seller will execute such
documents as may be necessary to assist Buyer in preserving or perfecting
its rights in the Acquired Assets. For one year following the Closing Date,
Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain all third party consents
which Seller was unable to obtain prior to the Closing Date and will use
its reasonable efforts to obtain for Buyer the benefit of any Excluded
Intellectual Property.

(g) Confidentiality. Whether or not the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated, Buyer and Seller will keep confidential
all information and materials regarding the other Party, except that Buyer may
disclose such information and materials to its accountants, attorneys,
lenders and agents and each Party may disclose information or material
which was or becomes generally available to the public other than as a
result of a disclosure by such Party or which was or becomes available to
such Party on a nonconfidential basis from a third party. If the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, Seller will maintain
confidential and will not use or disclose, directly or indirectly (except
as required by law or as authorized in writing by Buyer prior to such
disclosure), any confidential or proprietary information or materials
regarding the Business or Capitol.

(h) Noncompetition and Nonsolicitation. Seller agrees as
follows: 
(i) During the period from the date hereof to and including the
fifth anniversary of the date hereof (the "Noncompete Period"), it shall not
have any affiliation with any corporation, partnership or other business entity
or enterprise (wherever located) with respect to injection molding for any
original equipment manufacturer of automotive component parts (a
"Competitor"); provided, however, Seller may enter into a transaction
(whether in the form of a sale, merger, share exchange or otherwise) in
which Seller's stock or all or substantially all of its assets are acquired
by a Competitor. For purposes of this Section 7(h), the term "affiliation"
shall mean any direct or indirect interest in such entity or enterprise,
whether as an investor, partner, stockholder, sole proprietor, trustee,
consultant, agent, representative, broker, finder or promoter; and

(ii) During the Noncompete Period, it shall not, and shall not permit
any of its officers, directors, shareholders, employees or Affiliates to, (i)
induce or attempt to induce any employee of Buyer (in respect of the
Business) or Capitol to leave the employ of Buyer (in respect of the
Business) or Capitol, respectively, or in any way interfere with the
relationship between Buyer (in respect of the Business) or Capitol and any
employee thereof, (ii) hire directly or through another entity any person
who was an employee at the manager level or above of Buyer (in respect of
the Business) or Capitol at any time prior to or during the Noncompete
Period until six months after such employee's employment terminates with
Buyer or Capitol, or (iii) induce or attempt to induce any customer,
supplier, licensee or other business relation of Buyer (in respect of the
Business) or Capitol to cease doing business with Buyer (in respect of the
Business), or in any way interfere with the relationship between any such
customer, supplier, licensee or business relation and Buyer (in respect of
the Business) or Capitol.

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7(h) to the contrary, if at
any time a court holds that the restrictions stated in Section 7(h)(i) or
Section 7(h)(ii) are unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable under
circumstances then existing, the Parties hereto agree that the maximum
period, scope or geographical area deter- mined to be reasonable under such
circumstances by such court will be substituted for the stated period,
scope or area. Seller acknowledges and agrees that money damages may not
be an adequate remedy for any breach or threatened breach of the provisions
of subparagraph (i) or (ii) and that, in such event, Buyer or its
successors or assigns may, in addition to any other rights and remedies
existing in its or their favor, apply to any court of competent
jurisdiction for specific performance, injunctive and/or other relief in
order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions of this
Section 7(h) (including the extension of the Noncompete Period by a period
equal to the length of court proceedings necessary to stop such violation
but not beyond the seventh anniversary of the Closing). Any injunction
shall be available without the posting of any bond or other security. In
the event of an alleged breach or violation by Seller of any of the
provisions of this Section 7(h), the Noncompete Period will be tolled until
such alleged breach or violation is resolved but not beyond the seventh
anniversary of the Closing. Seller agrees that the restrictions contained
in this Section 7(h) are reasonable in all respects.

(i) Use of Gulfstream Name. As of the Closing, Seller will not
use any corporate name or trade name similar in any way to its former division
name. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not in any way be
prohibited from using the name "O'Sullivan" or any of its derivatives.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall not directly
or indirectly use any corporate name or trade name containing "Gulfstream."

(j) Gulfstream Employees. At the Closing, either Buyer or one
of its Affiliates (including Capitol) will offer equivalent employment to each
employee of Seller, with respect to the Business, and of Capitol who is
employed by Seller or Capitol on the Closing Date; provided, however, that
with respect to members of senior management Buyer will only be obligated
to offer employment to such persons if each such person has been employed
by Seller or Capitol throughout the period commencing April 30, 1994 and
ending on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing set
forth herein shall limit Buyer or Capitol in any way from terminating, or
modifying the terms of employment of, any such employee after the Closing
Date, except as otherwise required by any applicable collective bargaining
agreement. Buyer shall extend employee benefits to each employee of the
Business which are consistent with those extended to other similarly
situated employees of Buyer, except as otherwise required by any applicable
collective bargaining agreement. If, prior to the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, Buyer or Capitol elects to terminate the employment of Thom
Bee and/or Bruce Tallmadge and Buyer is obligated to make any severance
payments pursuant to their employment letter agreements dated June 27, 1994
and June 22, 1994, respectively, then Seller will promptly reimburse Buyer
the amount of any such severance payment.

(k) Capitol Plastics Employees' Money Purchase Plan. Before the
Closing, Seller shall submit on Capitol's behalf the Capitol Plastics
Employees' Money Purchase Plan (the "Money Purchase Plan") to the Internal
Revenue Service for a determination letter. Seller will prepare any
amendments required by the Internal Revenue Service to cause a favorable
determination letter to be issued. After the Closing, Buyer will cause
Capitol to cooperate with Seller with respect to the Internal Revenue
Service submission and to have any Money Purchase Plan amendments required
by the Internal Revenue Service adopted and executed. Seller shall pay all
expenses related to the amendment and submission of the Money Purchase Plan
to the Internal Revenue Service. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause
Capitol to make a contribution to the Money Purchase Plan, in accordance
with the terms of the Money Purchase Plan, for the period before the
Closing Date.

(l) O'Sullivan Corporation Employees' Retirement Savings Plan.
With respect to the O'Sullivan Corporation Employees' Retirement Savings Plan
("Seller's Plan"), Seller shall fully vest the account balance of each
employee of the Business who is employed by the Buyer as of the Closing
Date and participates in Seller's Plan as of the Closing Date and shall
make a monthly contribution to Seller's Plan, on behalf of each such
participant based on the participant's compensation and elective deferrals
for the period ending on the Closing Date.

(m) Savings Plan.

(i) Seller shall cause Capitol to freeze all contributions under the
Capitol Plastics of Ohio, Inc. Tax-Deferred Savings Plan (the "Capitol
Savings Plan") as of the earlier of (i) November 30, 1994 or (ii) the
Closing Date. Seller shall cause Capitol to make all contributions required
to be made to the Capitol Savings Plan for the period ending on the date as
of which the Capitol Savings Plan is frozen.

(ii) Effective immediately before the Closing, Seller shall assume
all of Capitol's rights and obligations as plan sponsor, plan administrator and
named fiduciary with respect to the Capitol Savings Plan, and Capitol shall
transfer responsibility as plan sponsor, plan administrator and named
fiduciary of the Capitol Savings Plan to Seller. Capitol shall no longer
maintain or be plan sponsor, plan administrator or named fiduciary of the
Capitol Savings Plan on or after the Closing. Seller and Capitol shall
take all actions necessary in order for Seller to be substituted for
Capitol as plan sponsor, plan administrator and named fiduciary for the
Capitol Savings Plan before the Closing.

(iii) After the Closing, Seller intends to terminate the Capitol
Savings Plan and distribute the Capitol Savings Plan accounts to Capitol
Savings Plan participants, subject, however, to and conditioned on receipt of a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service with
respect to the Capitol Savings Plan termination and distribution. Seller
shall submit the Capitol Savings Plan to the Internal Revenue Service for a
favorable determination letter. Seller shall pay the expenses of freezing
and terminating the Capitol Savings Plan and the submission of the Capitol
Savings Plan to the Internal Revenue Service.

(n) Retention of documents. Buyer and Seller agree (i) to
retain, and permit each Party access to, all books and records with respect to
Tax matters reasonably pertinent to the Business or Capitol relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of
the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer or Seller,
any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by
all record retention agreement entered into with any taxing authority, (ii)
to retain, and permit each Party reasonable access to, all other corporate
books, records, ledgers, files and documents relating to the Business or
Capitol until the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date and (iii) to give
the other party reasonable notice prior to transferring, destroying or
discarding any such books and records and, if the other Party so requests,
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, shall allow the other Party to take
possession of such books and records.

(o) Financing. If Buyer does not consummate the transactions
set forth herein solely as a result of the failure of the condition set forth
in Section 3(a)(viii), Buyer shall promptly pay to Seller $750,000 in
immediately available funds by wire transfer.

(p) Vacation Pay. Buyer will assume liability for accrued
vacation pay for calendar year 1993, determined in a manner consistent with
Seller's past practices (the "Accrued Vacation Pay"), with respect to each of
Seller's salaried employees who are employed by Buyer or its Affiliate
immediately after the Closing (the "Salaried Employees"). If any Salaried
Employee's employment with Buyer and each of its Affiliates is terminated
by Buyer and its Affiliates for any reason within twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date and if Buyer is required to pay such employee
any Accrued Vacation Pay, Seller will reimburse Buyer for any such Accrued
Vacation Pay paid to such employee.

(q) Financial Information. Seller shall, and shall cause its
accountants to, assist Buyer and take all actions reasonably necessary to
enable the Buyer to prepare the pro forma financial information required to
be disclosed pursuant to Buyer's reporting obligations under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

provided below:

(a) Buyer and Seller may terminate this Agreement by mutual
written consent at any time prior to the Closing;

(b) Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice
to Seller at any time prior to the Closing (A) in the event Seller has
breached any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this Agree
ment in any material respect, or (B) if the Closing shall not have occurred
on or before December 31, 1994, by reason of the failure of any condition
precedent under Section 3(a) above; and

(c) Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice
to Buyer at any time prior to the Closing (A) in the event Buyer has breached

precedent under Section 3(b) above.

Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8 to the contrary,
no Party may terminate this Agreement if the circumstance giving rise to

breaching any representation, warranty, or covenant contained in this

liability of any Party then in breach.
