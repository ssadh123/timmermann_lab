Item 1. Changes in Control of Registrant

On July 13, 1994, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated
as of March 24, 1994 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among the Registrant, KNE
Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("KNE Acquisition") and K N
Energy, Inc., a Kansas corporation ("K N"), KNE Acquisition was merged with
and into Registrant. KNE Acquisition had been formed by K N in February 1994,
as its wholly owned subsidiary, for the purpose of participating in the merger.
As a result of the merger, the Registrant became a wholly owned subsidiary of K
N and each share of common stock, $0.04 par value, of the Registrant (the "AOG
Common Stock") outstanding immediately before the merger was converted into
0.47 of a share of common stock, $5.00 par value, of K N ("K N Common Stock")
and the right to receive in cash the value of any fractional share of K N
Common Stock. The stockholders of the Registrant and the shareholders of K N
approved the merger on July 13, 1994. The determination of the exchange ratio
of AOG Common Stock for K N Common Stock was the result of negotiations between
the managements of the Registrant and K N and the approval thereof by their
respective boards of directors.

In connection with the merger, and on the effective date thereof, four
persons designated by the Registrant, Messrs. David M. Carmichael, Edward H.
Austin, Jr., Edward Randall, III and James C. Taylor were elected to the Board
of Directors of K N. All of such persons, other than Mr. Taylor, were
previously directors of the Registrant. In addition, Mr. Carmichael was
elected Vice Chairman of the Board of K N and Chairman of the Management
Committee thereof. For additional information respecting the management of K N
and the Registrant after the merger and the interests of certain persons in the
merger, see "Management and Operations After the Merger" and "The Merger
Interests of Certain Person in the Merger" in the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus of K N and the Registrant dated June 10, 1994, which is
incorporated by reference herein.

Registrant operates principally in Texas in the mid-stream segment of
the natural gas industry, providing gathering, processing, transportation,
storage and marketing services between the wellhead and the end user. It is
expected that Registrant will continue such business as a wholly owned
subsidiary of K N.
