EXHIBIT 99(A)

ZAPATA CORPORATION TO SEPARATE FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
GAS, MARINE PROTEIN BUSINESSES JULY 11, 1994

HOUSTON--In recognition of the fundamental difference between its oil and 
gas and marine protein operations, Zapata Corporation's Board of Directors 
announced today that it will separate the two businesses, a process which will 
take a number of months.

In preparation for this separation, Zapata Protein, Inc., the company's 
menhaden fishing and marine protein subsidiary, will be operated autonomously 
within the Zapata group until separation. Headquartered in Houston, Zapata 
Protein has processing plants in Delaware, Louisiana, Mississippi and Virginia.

R.C. Lassiter, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Zapata Corporation 
since 1985, is being named Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Zapata 
Protein. Lassiter will remain a member of the Zapata Corporation's Board of 
Directors.

Zapata Director Kristian Siem has assumed the duties of President and Chief 
Executive Officer of Zapata Corporation with overall responsibility for the 
company's oil and gas operations. These include: Tulsa-based Cimarron Gas 
Companies, Inc., which gathers and processes natural gas; Energy Industries, 
Inc., headquartered in Corpus Christi, one of the nation's leading natural gas 
compression companies; and Houston-based Zapata Exploration Company, Zapata's 
oil and gas production subsidiary.

Malcolm I. Glazer, also a Zapata Director, is being named Chairman of the 
Zapata Corporation Board of Directors.

"Historically, Zapata was a maritime company with offshore drilling rigs and
other ocean-oriented operations. Zapata Protein made sense in that mix of 
businesses," Siem said.

"As we have repositioned Zapata into natural gas services and production and
shed the company's other maritime operations, however, that linkage has been 
lost. We now believe the interests of Zapata's stockholders would best be 
served by completely separating the two businesses," he said.
