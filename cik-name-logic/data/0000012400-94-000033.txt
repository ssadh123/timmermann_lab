Consent Bonds.
--------------
The Holders, including any successor Holders, of these Series AB 
Bonds to be issued under the terms of the Twenty Ninth Supplemental 
Indenture, by becoming such Holders shall be deemed to have consented to 
the Twenty Eighth Supplemental Indenture ("Proposed Supplement"), a copy 
of which is attached as Exhibit A to the Twenty Ninth Supplemental 
Indenture authorizing the Series AB Bonds. This provision does hereby 
constitute a written consent of the Holders, including all successor 
Holders, of the Series AB Bonds to the execution and adoption of the 
Proposed Supplement under the provisions of Section 18.11 of the 
Indenture, and such consent is received by the Trustee as a consent 
for the Trustee to execute the Proposed Supplement in lieu of the 
holding of a meeting of Bondholders pursuant to Article Eighteen of 
the Indenture.

Optional Redemption.
--------------------
The Series AB Bonds are subject to redemption, in whole or
in part, at the option of the Company on (but not before) September 1, 
2004 or at any time thereafter, upon at least thirty (30) days and not 
more than fifty (50) days notice, mailed to all registered owners of the 
Bonds of this Series to be redeemed, at their respective addresses as 
the same shall appear on the Bond register of the Company, all 
subject to the conditions and as more fully provided in the Indenture,
upon payment of accrued interest to the redemption date plus the 
applicable percentage of the principal amount thereof set forth below:

If Redeemed During If Redeemed During
12 Month Period 12 Month Period
Beginning Redemption Beginning Redemption 
September 1 Price September 1 Price 
----------- ----- ----------- -----

2004 104.040% 2010 101.616%
2005 103.636 2011 101.212
2006 103.232 2012 100.808
2007 102.828 2013 100.404
2008 102.424 2014 100.000
2009 102.020

and thereafter at 100 percent of the principal amount thereof.

Pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.05 of the Indenture,
the Company may request the Trustee to apply moneys deposited with the 
Trustee ("Trust Moneys") for various reasons toward the redemption of 
those Bonds, including payment of premium and accrued interest, 
selected by the Company. In the Twenty Ninth Supplemental Indenture, 
the Company has covenanted not to request the Trustee to apply any 
Trust Moneys to the redemption of the Series AB Bonds prior to 
September 1, 2004.

Pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.08 of the Indenture,
the Series AB Bonds are further subject to redemption, in whole or in 
part, by the Trustee applying certain Trust Moneys which have been held 
by the Trustee for a period of over two years. Any such redemption is
made pro rata among the series of Bonds then outstanding in the ratio of 
principal amount. Redemption is at 100 percent of principal, plus any 
premium due at the time of redemption and accrued interest to 
redemption date.

The particular Series AB Bonds to be redeemed from time to
time shall be selected by the Trustee in the amount of $1,000 or an 
integral multiple thereof and as nearly as practicable pro rata among 
the registered holders of such Series AB Bonds according to the 
respective principal amounts of such Bonds.

If this Bond or any portion thereof ($1,000 or a multiple) shall
be duly called for redemption as provided in the Indenture, this Bond or 
such portion thereof shall (unless the Company shall default in the 
payment of the redemption price) cease to bear interest from and after 
the date fixed for redemption.

Upon any partial redemption of this Bond, this Bond may, at
the option of the registered holder hereof, be either (a) surrendered to 
the Trustee in exchange for one or more new Bonds of this Series for the 
principal amount of the unredeemed portion of this Bond or (b) submitted
to the Trustee for notation hereon by the Trustee of the payment of the 
portion of the principal hereof so called for redemption.

If an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall
occur, the principal of this Bond may become or be declared due and 
payable, in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

This Bond is transferable by the registered owner hereof in
person or by attorney authorized in writing, at said principal corporate 
trust office of the Trustee, upon surrender for cancellation of this Bond 
and on payment of charges, and upon any such transfer a new Bond or 
Bonds, of the same series, for the same aggregate principal amount, will
be issued to the transferee in exchange herefor.

First Mortgage Bonds, Series AB, 8.30%, due September 1, 2024, 
are issuable as fully registered Bonds without coupons of the denomina-
tions of $1,000 and any multiple of $1,000 which may be executed by the
Company and delivered to the Trustee for authentication and delivery. 
The Series AB Bonds, upon surrender thereof to the Trustee at its 
principal corporate trust office in the Borough of Manhattan, The 
City of New York, are exchangeable for other Bonds of the same series 
in such authorized denomination or denominations in the same aggregate
principal amount, as may be requested by the holders surrendering the 
same.

The Company and the Trustee may deem and treat the person in
whose name this Bond is registered as the absolute owner hereof, for the 
purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal hereof and 
interest due hereon, and neither the Company nor the Trustee shall be 
affected by any notice to the contrary. Interest payable herein shall 
be paid to the person in whose name the Bond is registered at the close
of business on February 15 or August 15 (whether or not on a business day)
next preceding the interest payment date, except for defaulted interest and
unmatured accrued interest on the Series AB Bonds called for redemption 
on a date other than an interest payment date.

No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of
or the interest on this Bond, or for any claim based hereon or otherwise 
in respect hereof or of the Indenture or of any indenture supplemental 
thereto, against any incorporator, stockholder, director or officer, as 
such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any predecessor or 
successor corporation, either directly or through the Company or any
predecessor or successor corporation, whether by virtue of any 
constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any 
assessment or penalty or by any legal or equitable proceeding or 
otherwise howsoever; all such liability being, by the acceptance 
hereof and as a part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, 
expressly waived and released by every holder hereof, as more fully 
provided in the Indenture; provided, however, that nothing herein or 
in the Indenture contained shall be taken to prevent recourse to and 
the enforcement of the liability, if any, of any shareholder or any 
stockholder or subscriber to capital stock upon or in respect of
shares of capital stock not fully paid up.

This Bond shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose 
until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been signed by 
the Trustee, or its successor as Trustee, under the Indenture.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company has caused this Bond to be
signed in its name by its President or one of its Vice Presidents, and 
its corporate seal to be impressed or imprinted hereon and attested by 
its Secretary or one of its Assistant Secretaries.

If and whenever any Net Bondable Additions or Gross Bondable
Additions are certified or made a part of an application to the

revenues previously collected or accrued by the Company subject
to possible refund.

The Gross Operating Revenues of the Company shall consist of
Gross Utility Operating Revenues of the Company, plus the Net Non-Operating
Income of the Company. The term "Gross Utility Operating Revenues" of the
Company shall mean the aggregate gross operating revenues derived from the
operation of the utility properties owned or leased by the Company. The

Subsidiaries, shall not be taken into account in the calculation of Net 
Non-Operating Income.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section, all determinations
of earnings pursuant to this Indenture shall be made, and all balance sheets
and other financial statements to be delivered hereunder shall be prepared,
in accordance with the practice prescribed by any regulatory authority having
jurisdiction over the Company or other lawfully prescribed practice or, in
the absence of any practice prescribed by law, in accordance with sound 
accounting practice and, where consistent with such practice and with the 
foregoing provisions of this Section, on the same basis as that used in 
preparing the financial statements included in the annual report of the 
Company for the preceding fiscal year.

1.08. Property Additions Certificate--Amendment to Conform to Other 
Provisions. Clauses (10) and (12) of Paragraph B of Section 4.02 of 
Article Four of the Indenture is hereby amended so as to read as follows:

said Certificate is property the construction or acquisition of
which under the provisions of Section 4.01 is not permitted to be
made the basis of the authentication and delivery of Bonds under
this Article.

(12) Whether there is any unused Additions Credit which the
Company desires to use, in whole or in part, as a basis for the
authentication and delivery of the Bonds then applied for, and if
so, a statement of the entire amount which the Company so desires
to use, of each such unused Additions Credit.

1.09. Earnings-to-Interest Coverage Requirements. Paragraph F 
of Section 4.02 of Article Four of the Indenture as previously amended 
by Section 1.04 of the Nineteenth Supplemental Indenture is hereby 
amended so as to read as follows:

F. A Net Earnings Certificate of the Company, complying
with the provisions of Section 1.02, dated not more than 45 days
prior to the application for the authentication and delivery of
such Bonds, certified by an Accountant, and setting forth:

(1) The amount of the Certifiable Net Earnings of the
Company, for a period of 12 consecutive calendar months within
the 18 calendar months immediately preceding the date on which
the application for the authentication and delivery of the Bonds
is made, and stating separately the Gross Utility Operating
Revenues and the Net Non-Operating Income and the operating
expenses of the Company and other deductions from such Gross
Utility Operating Revenues and Net Non-Operating Income pursuant
to Paragraph O of Section 4.01, with the principal subdivisions
thereof.

(2) The aggregate amount of the annual "Interest Charges on 
Bonds and Prior Lien Debt" of the Company, which term shall mean 
the annual interest charges on 

(a) all Bonds outstanding hereunder at the date
of said Certificate, provided, however, that in the case of any
Bonds which shall at such time be pledged as security for any
indebtedness of the Company, the amount of the annual interest
charges on such pledged Bonds shall be deemed to be either the
amount of the annual interest charges on such indebtedness or the
amount of the annual interest charges on such pledged Bonds,
whichever shall be greater; and

(b) all Bonds the authentication and delivery of
which is applied for in such application and in any other pending
application; and

(c) all indebtedness secured by a lien upon the
Trust Estate, or any part thereof, prior to the lien of this
Indenture, other than a Prepaid Lien;

provided, however, that there shall be excluded from such
computation the annual interest charges on any Bonds or
indebtedness which is to be paid, redeemed or otherwise retired,
or provision for the retirement of which is to be made, so that
the same will cease to be outstanding prior to or concurrently
with the authentication and delivery of the Bonds then applied
for.

(3) That the amount of the Certifiable Net Earnings of
the Company set forth as provided by Clause (1) of this Paragraph
have been at least equal to two (2) times the aggregate amount of
the annual Interest Charges on Bonds and Prior Lien Debt of the
Company as provided by Clause (2) of this Paragraph.

(4) That such Certifiable Net Earnings have been
computed and ascertained as provided in Paragraph O of Section
4.01.

If the annual Interest Charges on Bonds and Prior Lien Debt
shall be increased after the date of the Earnings Certificate hereinabove 
in this Paragraph described, and before the authentication and delivery 
of the Bonds then applied for, the Company will file with the Trustee a 
new Earnings Certificate showing the amount of said annual Interest 
Charges on Bonds and Prior Liens as so increased--it being the intention 
hereof that no Bonds shall be authenticated and delivered under the
provisions of this Article, unless the ratio provided for by Clause (3) 
of this Paragraph shall have been established with respect to the 
aggregate amount of the annual Interest Charges on Bonds and Prior Liens 
of the Company as constituted at the time of the authentication and 
delivery of the Bonds then applied for; but the Trustee shall, subject 
to the provisions of Section 15.02, be entitled to assume, in the 
absence of such new Earnings Certificate, that the aggregate amount of 
the annual Interest Charges on Bonds and Prior Lien Debt of the Company, as
constituted at the time of the authentication and delivery of the Bonds 
then applied for, are as stated in the Earnings Certificate filed with 
the Trustee as aforesaid.

The Earnings Certificate provided for in this Paragraph shall be 
certified by an Independent Public Accountant selected by the Company and 
approved by the Trustee, in the exercise of reasonable care, if, but 
only if, the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds to be authenticated 
and delivered on the basis thereof and of other Bonds authenticated 
and delivered since the commencement of the then current calendar year 
(other than those with respect to which an Earnings Certificate is not 
required or with respect to which an Earnings Certificate verified by an
Independent Public Accountant has previously been furnished) is 10% or 
more of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds at the time outstanding.

1.10. Summary Certificate. Paragraph G of Section 4.02 of Article 
Four of the Indenture is hereby amended so as to read as follows:

the summary certificate and computation filed pursuant to
Paragraph G of Section 4.02.

1.12. Additional Authorization to Issue Bonds. The Indenture is 
amended by the addition of the following Section 4.04 to Article Four of 
the Indenture.

SECTION 4.04. Notwithstanding anything in this Indenture to
the contrary, upon the Written Order of the Company, the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver Bonds in an aggregate principal

A. the total amount of Property Additions which the
Company certifies to the Trustee as of May 1, 1994 and as of each
May 1 thereafter to meet the requirements of Section 9.06 until
such time that Section 9.06 is deleted by the execution of the
Twenty Eighth Supplemental Indenture; and

B. fourteen and two-tenths percent (14.2%) of the total
amount of all Property Additions certified to the Trustee and
used as Bondable Additions for the issuance of Bonds during the
period beginning May 1, 1994 and ending on the execution date of

The Company shall furnish the Trustee a Certificate of the Company 
referencing and documenting the amount of Property Additions previously 
certified and used as provided at Paragraphs A and B of this Section, a 
summary certificate and computation determining the amount of Bonds that 
may be issued under this Section 4.04 and an Opinion of Counsel as 
required by Paragraph I of Section 4.02; provided that subparagraph (1) 
thereunder shall refer to the basis of this Section 4.04 rather than Net 
Bondable Additions and subparagraphs (2), (3), (4) and (5) are not to be
included in such opinion.

1.13. Release of Property from Indenture. Section 7.02 of Article 
Seven of the Indenture is hereby amended so as to read as follows:

SECTION 7.02.

A. Definition of "Fair Value." For the purposes of this

provided, however, that in lieu of all or any part
