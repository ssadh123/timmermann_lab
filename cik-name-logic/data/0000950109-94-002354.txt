PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

INTRODUCTION

On December 5, 1994, SDI Operating Partners L.P., a subsidiary limited
partnership of Sun Distributors L.P. ("the Company") sold certain assets of its
three Electrical Group Divisions for an aggregate consideration of approximately
$30.0 million (subject to certain post-closing adjustments) and the assumption
of certain liabilities. The accompanying pro forma consolidated balance sheet
and pro forma consolidated statements of income give effect to these
divestitures.

The pro forma financial information is unaudited and assumes that the
transaction for which pro forma effects are shown occurred as of September 30,
1994 for the pro forma consolidated balance sheet and as of January 1, 1993 for
the pro forma consolidated statements of income (the "pro forma financial
information").

The pro forma financial information presented herein is not necessarily
indicative of what the financial position or results of operations would have
been had the transaction occurred on those dates, nor are they necessarily
indicative of the future results of operations of the Company. Management
believes the pro forma adjustments reflected in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet and consolidated statements of income give effect to all material
changes arising from the divestment of the three Electrical Group Divisions.
The pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction with the
historical consolidated financial information and related notes included in the
Company's report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993 and report on
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 1994.

THE ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS GROUP DIVISION

OF

BY 

CONSOLIDATED ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTORS, INC.

Dated as of October 4, 1994
<PAGE>

ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT

AGREEMENT dated as of October 4, 1994 between SDI OPERATING PARTNERS, L.P.,
a Delaware limited partnership (the "Seller") and CONSOLIDATED ELECTRICAL
DISTRIBUTORS, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Buyer").

The Electrical Products Group Division of the Seller (the "Division") is
engaged principally in the business of distribution of electrical products and
components in the Midwestern and Southern United States. The Seller desires to
sell certain assets and properties of the Seller, comprising the Division, to
the Buyer, and the Buyer desires to acquire the same from the Seller, upon and
subject to the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby,
agree as follows:

1. Sale and Purchase of Assets.
---------------------------

1.1 Assets to be Purchased. At the Closing hereunder, the Seller will
sell to the Buyer, and the Buyer will purchase from the Seller, (a) all of
Seller's right, title and interest in and to those assets reflected in the
Division's June 30 Balance Sheet (as hereinafter defined), with only such
changes therein as shall have occurred between June 30, 1994 and the Closing
Date (as hereinafter defined) in the ordinary course of business or as are
permitted or contemplated by this Agreement, (b) all rights of Seller with
<PAGE>

respect to the business of the Division under all trade names, agreements,
contracts, commitments, leases, plans, bids, quotations, proposals, licenses,
permits, authorizations, instruments and other documents to which it is a party
or by which it has rights, but only to the extent that such items relate
specifically and directly to the Division, and (c) the business and operations
of the Division as a going concern; provided, however, that the assets to be
-----------------
sold shall not include (i) cash and cash items other than petty cash and bonds
or deposits with suppliers or customers, (ii) tax refunds and (iii) insurance
policies and claims thereunder.

All of the assets and business to be sold by the Seller are hereinafter
referred to collectively as the "Purchased Assets".

1.2 Determination and Payment of Purchase Price. The Seller and the
-------------------------------------------
Buyer shall cause a physical inventory (under the observation of Coopers &
Lybrand, the Seller's accountants, and Price Waterhouse, the Buyer's
accountants) and valuation (herein called the "Closing Valuation") to be made
with respect to the Division as of the close of business on the Transfer Date
(the Thursday preceding the Closing) to determine the value of the Purchased
Assets and the consideration to be paid by the Buyer to the Seller, on the
following basis:

- 2 -
<PAGE>

(a) Inventory. Inventory shall be priced on an item-by-item basis
---------
at the lower of cost or market. For purposes of the preceding sentence "cost"
shall be determined with reference to the inventory valuation systems used by
the Division in the ordinary course of its business, and "market" shall be
determined by using current manufacturers' price sheets to distributors and
applying all discounts available to the Division. The inventory obsolescence
reserve shall equal the greater of 5% of total gross inventory value or
$675,000.

(b) Trade Accounts Receivable. All of the Seller's trade accounts
-------------------------
receivable which are outstanding at the close of business on the Transfer Date
shall be valued at the face amount thereof, except those which at the Transfer
Date (i) constitute inter-company accounts, (ii) have been assigned or
otherwise turned over for collection, (iii) are the subject matter of any then
outstanding litigation, (iv) have been on the Seller's books for more than 90
days, irrespective of whether there is collateral security therefor, or (v) have
heretofore been written off as uncollectible by the Seller.

(c) Other Assets. All of the Purchased Assets, other than those
------------
specifically valued in the preceding subparagraphs hereof, shall be valued
based on generally accepted accounting principles adopted by the Division, on a

- 3 -
<PAGE>

consistent basis, except that Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets shall be
valued at zero. 

The cash consideration payable to the Seller by the Buyer
hereunder shall be $12,300,000 plus the value of the Seller's Purchased Assets
as hereinabove determined, reduced by the amount of the Seller's liabilities
and credit balances to be assumed by the Buyer pursuant to Section 1.3 hereof.

(d) Liabilities Not Assumed. The Buyer shall not assume or be
-----------------------
liable for any liabilities or obligations of the Seller other than those herein
expressly agreed to by the Buyer. All other liabilities and obligations of the
Seller shall be paid, performed and discharged by it in due course as such
liabilities and obligations become due.

(e) Payment, Escrow and Post-Closing Adjustments. At the Closing,
--------------------------------------------
the Buyer shall pay to the Seller by wire transfer in accordance with the
Seller's written instructions the estimated aggregate cash consideration for the
Purchased Assets, calculated as set forth in this Section 1.2, less $2,500,000.
The Buyer shall deposit said sum of $2,500,000 in escrow with CoreStates Bank,
N.A., Philadelphia, from which the Seller shall be paid any balance of said
consideration after effecting post-closing adjustments, including adjustments
for (x) inventory valuation pursuant to this Section 1.2 and (y) the accounts
receivable adjustments provided for in Section 1.2(f) hereof, (the "Post-Closing
Adjustments"), and the satisfaction of

- 4 -
<PAGE>

claims against the escrow as provided in Section 13 of this Agreement. The
Escrow Agreement shall be substantially in the form attached hereto as 
Exhibit A. Post-closing Adjustments shall be prepared by the Buyer and 
submitted to the Seller and its accountants within sixty days following the
closing. The Seller's accountants shall be entitled to have the same access to
the Division's records and personnel as they would have in conducting an annual
audit. The Seller shall have thirty days thereafter within which to object to
the Buyer's calculation of Post-closing Adjustments. Upon objection the matter
of the Post-closing Adjustments shall be submitted to the firm of Deloitte
Touche which shall act as arbitrator to conclusively determine the Post-closing
Adjustments in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Upon
determination of the Post-closing Adjustments as herein provided, the amount of
the escrow shall be reduced to $400,000, and the parties shall give appropriate
written instructions to the Escrow Holder to that effect.

(f) Uncollected Accounts Receivable. At any time within thirty days
-------------------------------
after four months from the Closing Date, the Buyer may notify the Seller of any
accounts receivable of the Seller which were included in the Closing Valuation
and are then unpaid, and the Seller shall thereupon pay to the Buyer the amount
of such accounts less any collections received after the Transfer Date on 
accounts

- 5 -
<PAGE>

which were not included in the Closing Valuation. If the collections should
exceed the amount of unpaid accounts, the excess shall be paid by the Buyer to
the Seller. For purposes of this Section, all payments received after the
Transfer Date from a customer of the Seller shall, unless application to a
specified account is otherwise directed by the customer, be applied first to
the oldest account owing by such customer as of the Transfer Date. The Buyer
shall use its best efforts and exercise due diligence to collect all accounts
receivable of the Seller shown on the Closing Valuation; provided that any
collection or attorneys' fees or other costs incurred in connection therewith
shall be charged to the Seller; and provided further that the Buyer shall not be
required to take any action against an account debtor if, in the opinion of the
Buyer, it would be detrimental to the business relationship between any such
debtor and Buyer to do so.

The Buyer shall provide the Seller with reports as of the first day of each
month with respect to the collection of the accounts receivable. Upon payment
by the Seller pursuant to this Section 1.2(f), the Buyer shall transfer and
assign to the Seller, without recourse, all accounts receivable which are
uncollected.

1.3 Assumption of Liabilities and Obligations.
-----------------------------------------

(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b) of this Section
1.3 at and effective as of the Closing,

- 6 -
<PAGE>

the Buyer shall assume and agree to pay, discharge and perform, as appropriate,
the following liabilities and obligations of the Seller relating to the
Division:

(i) all liabilities and obligations of the Seller relating to
the Division as of the Closing reflected or reserved against in the
Closing Valuation and not paid or discharged prior to the Closing;

(ii) all liabilities and obligations of the Seller relating to
the Division arising in the ordinary course from and after the Closing
Date;

(iii) all liabilities and obligations of the Seller relating to
the Division arising from and after the Closing Date in respect of
contracts, agreements, leases, mortgages and commitments that are (A)
specifically identified as being assumed by the Buyer hereunder in the
Schedule (as hereinafter defined) called for by Section 3.8 or (B) not
required to be identified in the Schedule in accordance with the
provisions of that Section; and

1. Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement or the Schedule to the
contrary or in any way limiting Seller's liability to Buyer, such as the
"basket" provision contained in Section 13.2 of the Agreement:

Liabilities or otherwise, and Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold Buyer
harmless, with respect to:

<PAGE>

the amounts accrued in the Closing Valuation) relating to any period prior to
the date hereof;

(e) Sales returns and chargebacks in connection with material
supplied by Seller prior to the date hereof.

1.2 With respect to disputes between Seller and vendors, as well as
sales returns and chargebacks, Buyer shall have the right to settle all such
matters on behalf of Seller in compliance with custom, usage and standards
applicable to the electrical distribution industry. Such right of Buyer shall
continue for the period following the Closing up to and including April 30,
1996. Any amounts payable by Seller as a consequence of the resolution of such
matters shall be paid promptly by Seller to the vendor, customer or Buyer, as
the case may be; provided that the foregoing provisions are not intended to
duplicate the provisions of Section 1.2(f) of the Agreement. Buyer shall inform
Seller in writing of any such matter involving more than $2,500 promptly upon
learning of it.

1.3 Seller shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify, defend and

2. Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement or the Schedule to the
contrary, merchandise credits or rebates from suppliers shall not be included in

3. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 1.1 and 3.7(c) of the

the date hereof shall be valued at cost times the lesser of the number of items
on hand or the number of units sold during said twelve (12) month period.

6. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 1.1 and 3.7(c) of the
Agreement, the Real Property shall not be purchased until commitments for title
