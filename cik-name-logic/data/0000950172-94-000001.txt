NATIONAL STEEL CORPORATION ANTICIPATES
RECORDING ADJUSTMENT OF $120-$135 MILLION

Mishawaka, IN, January 10, 1994 -- National Steel Corporation s
(NYSE: NS) Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Richard E.
Newsted, said today that the corporation anticipates recording
fourth quarter adjustments which are expected to range between
$120-$135 million.

The largest portion of these adjustments, approximately $90-100
million, relates to the recognition of certain liabilities
resulting from the corporation s intention to temporarily idle
National Steel Pellet Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary.

Mr. Newsted also noted two other planned adjustments that would
have a lesser financial impact:

* A LIFO inventory adjustment of approximately $15
million caused by the depletion of higher cost iron ore
pellet inventory levels resulting from the temporary
idling of National Steel Pellet Company, along with the
shift in cost and mix of the corporation s steel
inventory levels; and

* Early adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 112, Employers Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits of $15-20 million.

Finally, Mr. Newsted said the corporation will lower the discount
rate used to calculate its pension liabilities to 7.50% from
8.75% in order to reflect the current interest rate environment. 
He said the discount rate adjustment would have no impact on
National s income statement and could minimally impact
shareholders equity.

The company intends to announce its 1993 results on or about
January 26, 1994.

National is the nation s fourth largest integrated steel producer
with annual shipments of about 5 million tons of flat rolled
products. The company has steel mills in Ecorse, Michigan, near
Detroit; Granite City, Illinois, near St. Louis; and Portage
Indiana, near Chicago. The company is headquartered in
Mishawaka, Indiana, and employs about 10,000 people.
