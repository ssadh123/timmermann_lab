We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Product Components,

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and

assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Product

NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES

General:
The primary business activity of Product Components, Inc. (PROCOM) is
the development, marketing, sale and extrusion of sheet, roll stock
and various products through the extrusion process from plastic
polymer and proprietary reclaimed rubber products. PROCOM
manufactures this product from locations in Richmond and Elkhart,
Indiana and in Clare, Michigan. Customers are located in various
geographical areas of the United States while some new international
markets are being developed and expected to grow.

Inventories:
Substantially all raw materials are valued at the lower of actual
cost on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or market. Finished
goods are valued at estimated costs which approximate the lower of
cost, determined by the FIFO method, or market.

Property and Equipment:
PROCOM provides for depreciation on the historical cost basis. 
Expenditures for additions, improvements and replacements are added
to the property and equipment accounts. Repairs and maintenance are
charged to expense as incurred. Upon sale of equipment, the values
are eliminated from the respective accounts and the resulting gain or
loss is included in current income.

PROCOM provides for depreciation using the straight-line method for
financial accounting purposes. Accelerated methods are used for
income tax purposes.

Bond Issue Costs:
Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of economic
development revenue bonds have been deferred and are amortized on a
straight-line basis over a period of ten years.

Bad Debts:

The Company uses the reserve method of accounting for bad debts on
receivables.

Organizational Costs:

The Company has facility startup costs of $114,972 associated with
its acquisition of the Elkhart, Indiana equipment. Amortization is
computed using the straight-line method over a five-year life.

NOTE 2--INCOME TAXES:

The components of income taxes are as follows:
1993 1992
Federal:
Current $ 57,875 $ 73,433
Deferred (34,177) ( 8,034)
State 44,262 40,232

$ 67,960 $105,631

Following is a reconciliation of income tax expense as compared to
the federal statutory rate:
1993 1992

Federal tax expense at statutory rate(34%) $ 45,842 $105,828
Tax effect of:
Investment tax credits --- (28,260)
Graduated tax rates (10,008) ( 2,681)
Other 2,913 4,191
State income tax, net of federal effect 29,213 26,553 

$ 67,960 $105,631

PROCOM provides for deferred income taxes to give recognition to
timing differences between financial statements pretax income and
taxable income. Deferred taxes applicable to timing differences
relate primarily to differences in methods of book depreciation and
tax depreciation and when bad debts are deductible for book purposes
as compared to tax purposes. Beginning in the year ended May 31,
1993, there are timing differences between when accrued property
taxes may be deducted for book purposes versus tax purposes.

Deferred income taxes have been partially absorbed by tax credits
utilized for accounting purposes. When these credits are utilized
for tax purposes, in future years, the deferred income tax liability
will be reinstated for the applicable timing differences.

For tax purposes only, investment tax credits in the amount of $7,188
are available to reduce future federal income taxes. The expiration
date of such unused carryforwards on a tax basis is May 31, 2001.

PRODUCT COMPONENTS, INC.
Notes to Financial Statements

In February, 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
FASB) issued Statement No. 109 (SFAS 109) on accounting for income
taxes which requires an asset and liability approach rather than the
current method which uses the income statement approach. This
Statement is effective for the fiscal year ending May 31, 1994, but
earlier application is permitted. The changes required by SFAS 109
are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial
position.

At May 31, 1993, the Company had a minimum tax credit carryforward of
$77,180 for income tax purposes. The minimum tax credit is available
to reduce the excess of regular tax over alternative minimum tax in
future years.

problems associated with the Elkhart subcontractor relationship. 
These costs were to have been reimbursed by the subcontractor but
were not as a result of the subcontractor's insolvency. These costs
have been included in the total results of operations on the
Statement of Income and Retained Earnings.

Notes to Financial Statements

NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

General:
The primary business activity of Product Components, Inc. (PROCOM) is
the conversion of raw plastic to extruded plastic products. 
Customers are located in various geographical areas of the United
States while some new international markets are being developed and
expected to grow.

Inventories:
Substantially all raw materials are valued at the lower of actual
cost on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method or market. Finished
goods are valued at estimated costs which approximate the lower of
cost, determined by the FIFO method, or market.

Property and Equipment:
PROCOM provides for depreciation on the historical cost basis. 
Expenditures for additions, improvements and replacements are added
to the property and equipment accounts. Repairs and maintenance are
charged to expense as incurred. Upon sale of equipment, the values
are eliminated from the respective accounts and the resulting gain or
loss is included in current income.

PROCOM provides for depreciation using the straight-line method for
financial accounting purposes. Accelerated methods are used for
income tax purposes.

Bond Issue Costs:
Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of economic
development revenue bonds have been deferred and are amortized on a
straight-line basis over a period of ten years.

NOTE 2--INCOME TAXES:

The components of income taxes are as follows:
1992 1991
Federal:
Current $ 73,433 $ 11,931
Deferred ( 8,034) --- 
State 40,232 6,954

$105,631 $ 18,885<PAGE>
PRODUCT COMPONENTS, INC.
Notes to Financial Statements

Following is a reconciliation of income tax expense as compared to
the federal statutory rate:
1992 1991

Federal tax expense at statutory rate (34%) $105,828 $ 21,807
Tax effect of:
Investment tax credits (28,260) ( 3,977)
Graduated tax rates ( 2,681) (10,773)
Other 4,191 7,238
State income tax, net of federal effect 26,553 4,590 

$105,631 $ 18,885

PROCOM provides for deferred income taxes to give recognition to
timing differences between financial statements pretax income and
taxable income. Deferred taxes applicable to timing differences
relate primarily to differences in methods of book depreciation and
tax depreciation.

Deferred income taxes have been partially absorbed by tax credits
utilized for accounting purposes. When these credits are utilized
for tax purposes, in future years, the deferred income tax liability
will be reinstated for the applicable timing differences.

Investment tax credits are available to reduce future federal income
taxes. Expiration of such unused carryforwards at May 31, 1992 on a
tax basis is as follows:
Investment

Credits
Expiration date:

2000 $10,223

In February, 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the
FASB) issued Statement No. 109 (SFAS 109) on accounting for income
taxes which requires an asset and liability approach rather than the
current method which uses the income statement approach. This
Statement is effective for the fiscal year ending May 31, 1994, but
earlier application is permitted. The changes required by SFAS 109
are not expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial
position.

At May 31, 1992, the Company had a minimum tax credit carryforward of
$77,142 for income tax purposes. The minimum tax credit is available
to reduce the excess of regular tax over alternative minimum tax in
future years.<PAGE>

stockholders.

cost, determined by the FIFO method, or market.

Property and Equipment:
PROCOM provides for depreciation on the historical cost basis. 
Expenditures for additions, improvements and replacements are added
to the property and equipment accounts. Repairs and maintenance are
charged to expense as incurred. Upon sale of equipment, the values
are eliminated from the respective accounts and the resulting gain or
loss is included in current income.

PROCOM provides for depreciation using the straight-line method for
financial accounting purposes. Accelerated methods are used for
income tax purposes.<PAGE>

(Dollars in Thousands)

Basis of Presentation

Spartech Corporation's (the Company's) historical amounts shown
for the consolidated condensed statement of operations for the fiscal
year ended October 30, 1993 represent its audited results for that
period. The Company's historical amounts shown for the consolidated
condensed balance sheet as of January 29, 1994 and for the
consolidated condensed statement of operations for the thirteen weeks
ended January 29, 1994, represent its unaudited results for those
periods. ProCom's historical amounts shown for the consolidated
condensed statements of operations for the fiscal year ended October
30, 1993 and for the thirteen weeks ended January 29, 1994 represent
its unaudited results for those periods.

The acquired assets of ProCom have been recorded at their
estimated fair market values or net realizable values with the excess
purchase price over the fair market values and net realizable values
recorded as goodwill. Spartech Corporation assumed ProCom's accounts
payable and accrued liabilities incurred as of January 31, 1994. The
purchase price for ProCom's net assets, exclusive of working capital
purchased, totalled approximately $6,700, subject to post-closing
adjustments. The purchase price was financed through the Company's
amended credit arrangement with Chemical Bank and was recorded in the
pro forma consolidated condensed balance sheet as senior long-term
debt.

Elkhart Plant

ProCom's operation located in Elkhart, Indiana was shut-down
during December, 1993. As such, this plant was not included in the
net assets purchased by the Company. Therefore, the sales and
related costs and expenses generated by this operation were adjusted
out of the results of the pro forma consolidated condensed statements
of operations for the fiscal year ended October 30, 1993 and for the
thirteen weeks ended January 29, 1994.

Rubber Products

Sales and related costs and expenses of manufactured rubber
products, produced by ProCom, were included in ProCom's historical
amounts in the pro forma consolidated condensed statements of
operations for the fiscal year ended October 30, 1993 and the
thirteen weeks ended January 29, 1994. These amounts have also been
adjusted out of the pro forma consolidated condensed statements of
operations, since this product line was not included in the net
assets purchased by the Company.

NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in Thousands)

Selling and Administrative Expenses

Prior to the acquisition, ProCom maintained a centralized
corporate office designed to fully support its operations. 
Subsequent to acquisition, the Company merged or eliminated several
of the office functions, thereby reducing salary and overhead
expenses. In addition, the former owner resigned as of the
acquisition date. The pro forma consolidated condensed statement of
operations for the fiscal year ended October 30, 1993 and for the
thirteen weeks ending January 29, 1994 reflect reductions in selling
and administrative expenses related to these items of $350 and $90.

Depreciation and Amortization

The pro forma consolidated condensed statement of operations for
the fiscal year ended October 30, 1993 and for the thirteen weeks
ended January 29, 1994 reflect an increase in depreciation resulting
from the write-up of property, plant and equipment to its estimated
fair market value. The statements also include additional
amortization expense incurred from the Goodwill purchased with this
acquisition. The increase in depreciation and amortization total
approximately $64 and $16 for the fiscal year ended October 30, 1993
and for the thirteen weeks ended January 29, 1994, respectively.

Interest Expense

The pro forma consolidated condensed statement of operations for
the fiscal year ended October 30, 1993 reflects additional interest
expense of $100 related to the debt incurred to finance the
acquisition. However, no such adjustment was needed for the pro
forma consolidated condensed statement of operations for the thirteen
weeks ended January 29, 1994, since the Company's borrowing rates
were approximately 1 1/2% lower during this period as compared to the
rates incurred during fiscal year 1993.

Income Taxes

No provision for Federal income taxes was recognized for the
fiscal year ended October 30, 1993 and for the thirteen weeks ended
January 29, 1994 due to the Company's existing operating loss
carryforwards.
