RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, April 21, 1994 -- James River Corporation
today reported results for its first quarter which ended March 27,
1994. Net sales for the quarter were $1.1 billion, equivalent to
the prior year's first quarter. The company reported a net loss of
$7.1 million, representing a 30% improvement over the loss of $10.1
million reported in the first quarter of 1993. On a per share
basis after preferred dividends, losses were $0.19 per share in
1994's first quarter compared to losses of $0.22 per share in the
prior year.
Income from operations totalled $20.3 million in the first
quarter of 1994, a 15% improvement over the prior year's first
quarter, despite the severe winter weather conditions, reduced
sales from the California earthquake, and depressed paper and board
prices, which hampered many of the company's operations. Results
for the Consumer Products Business increased by over 20%, to $28.3
million from $23.2 million, principally from strong retail volume
and the benefits realized from productivity improvements. 
Operating results for the Food and Consumer Packaging Business
increased 14%, to $26.6 million in 1994 from $23.3 million in 1993. 
In the Communications Papers Business, operating losses increased
24%, to $25.1 million from $20.3 million last year, as pricing in
most white paper grades continued to decline due to additional
industry capacity and substantially higher levels of imports. 
In commenting on operating results, Robert C. Williams,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of James River noted, "We are
encouraged by the strong relative results of our Consumer Products
and Food and Consumer Packaging Businesses, that were achieved in
what are still difficult markets. These businesses have built
better value into their brands and product lines while reducing
costs. Similar efforts in Communications Papers have been
insufficient to offset higher wood costs in the Northwest and
severe price erosion in printing and business papers."
During the first quarter, the company continued to implement
its restructuring and cost reduction programs. In March, James
River sold its 50% interest in Coastal Paper Company, a
Mississippi-based producer of lightweight papers. Staffing
reductions of approximately 200 employees were also realized during
the quarter, bringing total staffing reductions to over 2,400
during the past year.
During the quarter, the company announced the nomination of
Anne M. Whittemore, a Partner with the law firm of McGuire, Woods,
Battle & Boothe and a former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank
of Richmond, to the Board of Directors. James River also announced
that Richard H. Catlett, Jr., one of the company's founding
Directors, William S. Woodside, who joined the Board in 1982, and
W. J. Bowen, a Director since 1986, will be retiring in April, at
the end of their current terms.
Looking ahead, Mr. Williams concluded, "We are encouraged by
the recent pricing strength in market pulp which should lead to
improved pricing in many of James River's product lines and
improved margins relative to less integrated competitors. While
the profitability of our white papers business will likely remain
under pressure for the near term, the company's recently announced
price increases for uncoated free sheet, if sustained, will reduce
the losses. In the meantime, the company is continuing its basic
strategy to increase value and reduce cost, while managing capital
spending to generate free cash flow during 1994."
