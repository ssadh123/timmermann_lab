BALL CORPORATION CEO
DELMONT A. DAVIS TO RETIRE

"MUNCIE, Ind., April 29, 1994--Delmont A. Davis announced today he plans
to take early retirement from his position as president and chief executive
officer of Ball Corporation.

"I've poured my heart and soul into Ball Corporation for the past 25
years," Davis said. "The last couple of years have been the most difficult,
but I feel we have turned the corner and the company is getting back on the
right track. Now I will be taking some time off to spend quality time with my
family and friends while I'm still young enough to do so and fortunate enough
to have my good health."

"We deeply appreciate Del Davis' many contributions to Ball Corporation,
and we wish him the best," said Alvin Owlsey, chairman of the board. Owsley
added that Davis, who is 58, has agreed to continue serving the company for
the near term, and that the Ball board of directors will begin immediately the
process of selecting Davis' successor.

Ball Corporation manufacturers metal and glass containers for the beverage
and food industries and provides aerospace systems and professional services to
government and commercial customers.
