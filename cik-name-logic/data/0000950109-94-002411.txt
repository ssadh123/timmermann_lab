Target Program. 

5.1.3. WELLCOME will establish a project team (the
"Project Team") to be led by a project leader (the "Project

CENTOCOR not later than the date ninety (90) days following the
date on which CENTOCOR gives written notice to WELLCOME of the
existence of the applicable Termination Event, such notice
containing a statement of the facts giving rise to such Termination
Event. WELLCOME'S remedies under this Agreement shall be
cumulative. If CENTOCOR shall terminate its performance under this
Agreement or the Supply Agreement other than by reason of a
material default under, or voluntary termination of, this Agreement
or the Supply Agreement by WELLCOME, WELLCOME shall continue to

---------
there shall be a material breach by a party hereto, the other party
(CNTO and CBV being deemed one party for purposes of this Section 8.4
----------- 
and WFL and BW being deemed one party for purposes of this
Section 8.4) shall give written notice to the breaching party to
- ----------- 
cure. Upon receipt of such notice, such breaching party shall have
ninety (90) days to respond by curing such default or by delivering
to the other party a certificate that such breach is not capable of
being cured within such ninety (90) days and that the breaching
party is working diligently to cure such breach. If the breaching
party does not so respond or fails so to work diligently, then the
other party may terminate this Agreement.

the licenses, registrations, permits and approvals contemplated by
this Section 10 are solely those required by local law for the
---------- 
distributor of a finished product the use of which for the
applicable indications is fully approved and licensed. WELLCOME
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and
maintain all such licenses, registrations, permits and approvals
contemplated by this Section 10 in those countries in which

<PAGE>

otherwise than by an act or omission of the Receiving Party in

from the Disclosing Party. Disclosures made prior to the date of
this Agreement pursuant to that certain Confidentiality Agreement
between CNTO and WFL dated September 14, 1993 shall be governed by
such Confidentiality Agreement and to the extent not inconsistent
therewith this Section 13; other disclosures prior to the date of
----------
this Agreement of Proprietary Information shall be governed by the
terms of this Section 13.
----------

13.3. Nothing in this Section 13 shall prevent any party
---------- 
hereto from disclosing its own information relating to its

confidentiality and use, any party hereto may disclose Proprietary
Information which is disclosed to it hereunder to any of its
Affiliates which agrees to be bound by the terms of this Section 13.
---------- 

13.4. Nothing in this Section 13 shall prevent or restrict
----------
WELLCOME and its Affiliates from using and/or disclosing
Proprietary Information received from CENTOCOR or CBV where such
use and/or disclosure is reasonably regarded by WELLCOME or its

obligations under the Target Program or the Post Target Program,
provided that WELLCOME and its Affiliates shall take all reasonable
steps to ensure that disclosure of any such Proprietary Information
is as limited as possible and disclosed on a confidential basis.

14. OTHER ANTIBODIES
----------------

14.1. During the term of this Agreement and the Supply

19
<PAGE>

14.2. If WELLCOME determines that it is not scientifically
or commercially feasible to continue the Target Program with the
17-1A Product, or a Termination Event occurs, WELLCOME may, but is
under no obligation to, substitute under this Agreement for the 17-
1A Product another product that is or contains a Derivative 17-1A
Antibody.

15. JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY
---------------------------

15.1. Each obligation and liability of CENTOCOR under this
Agreement shall be an independent, joint and several obligation of
CNTO and CBV. Each of CNTO and CBV shall be fully liable for
performance under this Agreement notwithstanding (a) the voluntary
or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale or other disposition
of all, or substantially all of the assets, marshalling of assets
and liabilities, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment
for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement,
composition with creditors or readjustment of, or other similar
proceedings affecting CBV or CNTO or any contest of the validity of
this Agreement in any such proceeding; or (b) any Law or Court
Order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction which might in
any manner affect any of such terms or provisions or any of the
rights of WFL or BW with respect thereto or which might cause or
permit CBV or CNTO to invoke any defense to, or any alteration in
the time, amount or manner of performance of any or all of their
respective obligations under this Agreement except to the extent
such Law or Court Order renders such obligations unlawful or to the
extent such Court Order constitutes a remedy for a breach by WFL or
BW. The invalidity or unenforceability of this Agreement as to
either of CNTO or CBV shall not render this Agreement invalid or
unenforceable as to the other. The invalidity or unenforceability
of this Agreement in any jurisdiction shall not in itself render
this Agreement unenforceable in another jurisdiction. If any
obligation hereunder of either CBV or CNTO is not performed by such
party punctually, the other of CBV or CNTO, as applicable, will,
without demand being made by WELLCOME, immediately perform such
obligation.

15.2. To the extent that BW has an obligation hereunder,
either expressly or by assignment by WFL, WFL hereby guarantees the
full payment and performance of such obligation. Each of WFL and
BW shall be fully liable for performance of their obligations under
this Agreement notwithstanding (a) the voluntary or involuntary
liquidation, dissolution, sale or other disposition of all, or
substantially all of the assets, marshalling of assets and
liabilities, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for
the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition
with creditors or readjustment of, or other similar proceedings
affecting BW or WFL or any contest of the validity of this
Agreement in any such proceeding; or (b) any Law or Court Order now
or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction which might in any
manner affect any of such terms or provisions or any of the rights
of CENTOCOR with respect thereto or which might cause or permit BW 

20
<PAGE>

or WFL to invoke any defense to, or any alteration in the time,
amount or manner of performance of any or all of their respective
obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent such Law or
Court Order renders such obligations unlawful or to the extent such
Court Order constitutes a remedy for a breach by CNTO or CBV. The
invalidity or unenforceability of this Agreement as to either of
WFL or BW shall not render the respective obligations of the other
under this Agreement invalid or unenforceable. The invalidity or
unenforceability of this Agreement in any jurisdiction shall not in
itself render this Agreement unenforceable in another jurisdiction. 
If any obligation hereunder of BW is not performed by it
punctually, WFL will, without demand being made by CENTOCOR,
immediately perform such obligation.

16. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
------------------------------

Product. The inception, development and reduction to practice of
any of the Intellectual Property in connection with the

Product has not constituted or involved the misappropriation by
CENTOCOR or its Affiliates or, to the best of its knowledge, by
Third Parties, of trade secrets or other rights of any other Person
(including, without limitation, any Governmental Entity). In
connection with the development, production, testing and sale

CENTOCOR nor any of its Affiliates (and in connection with their
resale of the 17-1A Product, neither WELLCOME nor any of its
Affiliates), to the best of CENTOCOR'S knowledge, is or may be
infringing on or otherwise acting adversely to the rights of any
Person under or in respect of any of the Intellectual Property of
such Person. To the best of CNTO'S and CBV'S knowledge, no Person
is or may be infringing on or otherwise acting adversely to the
rights of CENTOCOR or any of its Affiliates under or in respect of
any of the Intellectual Property which is used in connection with
the development, production, testing and sale by them of the 17-1A
Product.

--------------
Wistar License, which is valid, binding and enforceable, and,
pursuant to such license, is the exclusive licensee of the Wistar
Rights, has not sublicensed the Wistar Rights to any Person
excluding Ajinomoto pursuant to the Ajinomoto Agreement, and no
Person other than CENTOCOR is entitled, either currently or during
the term of the Supply Agreement, to license the Wistar Rights. 
CENTOCOR holds such Wistar Rights free and clear of all Liens,
claims and other encumbrances, covenants, conditions, or
restrictions. There are no licenses, options, rights of first
refusal, conditional sales agreements or other arrangements,
whether oral or written, which affect any portion of or all such
Wistar Rights.

22
<PAGE>

16.2.3. Cell Line. The cell line from which CNTO and
---------
CBV obtain the 17-1A Antibody is the Centocor Hybridoma. To the
extent that such cell line differs from the Wistar Hybridoma, CNTO
and CBV own all right, title and interest in such cell line, free
and clear of all Liens, claims and other encumbrances, conditions,
covenants or restrictions.

16.2.4. Conducted Clinical Trials. The Conducted
-------------------------
Clinical Trials were conducted solely and exclusively by the
Persons identified on Schedule 16.2.4 hereto, and CENTOCOR owns all
--------------- 
data, information, and results of the Conducted Clinical Trials
free and clear of all Liens, claims and other encumbrances,
conditions, covenants or restrictions except applicable patient
confidentiality rights. There are no licenses, options, rights of
first refusal, conditional sales agreements or other arrangements,
whether oral or written, which affect any portion of or all the
data, information, and results of the Conducted Clinical Trials, or
that would limit the ability of the parties to incorporate any of
the foregoing in submissions by the parties hereto to Regulatory
Authorities and Regulatory Adjuncts as contemplated by this
Agreement. 

16.2.5. Capacity. CNTO and CBV own or lawfully
--------
