NATIONAL EDUCATION CORPORATION ANNOUNCES
DISCONTINUANCE OF ITS NATIONAL EDUCATION CENTERS

IRVINE, CALIFORNIA, JUNE 28, 1994 -- National Education Corporation (NYSE:NEC)
announced today plans to discontinue the operations of its National Education
Centers subsidiary which operates 33 post-secondary career training schools
throughout the United States.

Jerome W. Cwiertnia, president and chief executive officer, said that the
company will record a loss on disposal of the Education Centers of
approximately $40 million ($1.35 loss per share). The company has not provided
any tax benefit from the loss. The loss includes a write-down of assets,
estimated gain/loss of the sale of certain schools, and the estimated costs of
closing certain schools. Estimated proceeds from the sale of schools are
expected to offset expenses incurred to teach-out students at the schools to be
closed.

Cwiertnia said that, after an extended period of attempting to restructure the
business to operate in the increasingly restrictive regulatory environment,
management concluded that it was inappropriate to continue to incur financial
losses at this subsidiary in view of the diminished strategic outlook for the
business. Accordingly, the Education Centers will immediately cease
enrollments at 6 schools. A letter of intent to purchase all of the schools,
including schools with teach-out obligations, has been executed with an
interested buyer, Cwiertnia said. All students presently enrolled at those
schools to be phased out will be given the opportunity to complete their
educational programs.
