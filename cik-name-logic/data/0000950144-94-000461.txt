ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

Effective January 31, 1994, Spelling Entertainment Group Inc. (the
"Registrant") and certain subsidiaries of the Registrant entered into a Credit
Agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation
("Blockbuster") pursuant to which Blockbuster has agreed to advance to the
Registrant and/or certain subsidiaries of the Registrant an aggregate of
$175,000,000, consisting of revolving loans in an aggregate principal amount of
$75,000,000 (the "Revolving Loans") and a term loan in the amount of
$100,000,000 (the "Term Loan"). The Registrant and certain of its subsidiaries
also entered into a Pledge and Security Agreement dated as of January 31, 1994
(the "Security Agreement") with Blockbuster and a Copyright Mortgage and
Assignment; Power of Attorney (the "Assignment") and a Guaranty (the
"Guaranty"), each dated as of January 31, 1994 and each in favor of
Blockbuster. On December 22, 1993, the Registrant entered into a related
Guaranty (the "Spelling Guaranty") in favor of Bank of America National Trust
and Savings Association, as agent.

Under the Credit Agreement, Blockbuster is obligated to make Revolving
Loans to the Registrant for a term of 38 months. Outstanding amounts under the
Revolving Loans, if any, and under the Term Loan, if any, will become payable
on March 31, 1997.

As previously reported in its Current Report on Form 8-K dated
December 8, 1993, on December 8, 1993, the Registrant entered into an Agreement
and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Republic Pictures Corporation
("Republic") and DE Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Registrant ("Merger Sub"), which provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and
into Republic (the "Merger"). The Merger Agreement provides, among other
things, that, at the effective time of the Merger, each share of common stock,
$0.01 par value per share, of Republic outstanding immediately prior to the
effective time of the Merger will be, without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, converted into the right to receive $13.00 in cash, without
interest (the "Cash Merger Consideration"). The proceeds of the Term Loan may
be used only to pay all or a portion of the Cash Merger Consideration. The
closing of the Merger is currently anticipated to occur in early 1994.

Pursuant to the Security Agreement and the Assignment, borrowings
under the Credit Agreement are secured by all of the assets (tangible and
intangible) of the Registrant and its subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Guaranty,
the Registrant and certain of the Registrant's subsidiaries have guaranteed the
amounts borrowed, if any, under the Credit Agreement.

Pursuant to the Spelling Guaranty, the Registrant has agreed to
guarantee the obligations of Blockbuster under Blockbuster's credit facility
(the "Blockbuster Credit Facility") up to the amount of the Registrant's
borrowings under the Credit Agreement outstanding at the time enforcement of
the Spelling Guaranty is sought.

The Credit Agreement includes customary provisions defining what
constitutes default by the Registrant and its subsidiaries, including failure to
pay any principal, interest or other amount due to Blockbuster as such becomes
due; failure to pay other indebtedness when due; judgments, attachments,
dissolution, receivership, insolvency and bankruptcy. A default shall also occur
under the Credit Agreement if (i) Blockbuster and its affiliates cease to
beneficially own and control a majority of the issued and outstanding voting
stock of the Registrant or (ii) Blockbuster fails to make any payment when due
in respect of or should otherwise be in breach or default of (in each case,
after giving effect to any applicable grace period) the Blockbuster Credit
Facility. In the latter case, Blockbuster may not declare unpaid borrowings
under the Credit Agreement to be immediately due and payable until such time, if
ever, that indebtedness under the Blockbuster Credit Facility has been
accelerated.

If, prior to March 31, 1997, the Blockbuster Credit Facility is
terminated, repaid or restructured (other than due to acceleration of
Blockbuster's obligations thereunder) so as to result in an increased cost of
funds to Blockbuster, then the Credit Agreement requires Blockbuster and the
Registrant and its subsidiaries to negotiate in good faith for up to 120 days
thereafter to reset the interest rates and fees applicable to the Revolving
Loans in order to take into account Blockbuster's increased cost of funds.

As of January 31, 1994, Blockbuster beneficially owned approximately
70.5% of the outstanding common stock, $0.10 par value per share, of the
Registrant. The Registrant believes that the terms of the Credit Agreement,
the Security Agreement, the Assignment, the
<PAGE> 3
Guaranty, and the Spelling Guaranty are as favorable to the Registrant as those
which could be obtained from an unaffiliated party.

The descriptions contained herein of the Credit Agreement, the
Security Agreement, the Assignment, the Guaranty and the Spelling Guaranty are
modified in their entirety by the terms of such agreements, copies of which are
attached hereto as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3, 99.4 and 99.5, respectively, and
which are incorporated herein by reference.

Company.

(b) The Company or any of its Subsidiarie shall 
fail to perform or observe the terms of any agreement relating to such

their respective Affiliates party thereto shall so assert in a judicial or

<PAGE> 25
to take other similar administrative steps within its sole control.

8.1.6 A final judgment:

(a) which, with other outstanding final

8.1.9 Lender shall fail to make any payment when due in
respect of or should otherwise be in breach or default of (in each case, after
giving effect to any applicable grace period) the Blockbuster Credit Facility.

8.2 Certain Actions Following an Event of Default. If any one or
more Events of Default shall occur and be continuing, then in each and every
such case:

8.2.1 No Obligation to Extend Credit. Lender may terminate
the obligations of Lender to make any further extensions of credit under the
Credit Documents by furnishing notice thereof to the Borrowers; provided,
however, that the obligations of Lender to make any further extensions of
credit under the Credit Documents shall automatically terminate without notice
to the Borrowers upon the occurrence of a Bankruptcy Default.

8.2.2 Specific Performance; Exercise of Rights. Lender may
proceed to protect and enforce Lender's rights by suit in equity, action at law
and/or other appropriate proceeding, either for specific performance of any
covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or any other Credit Document
or in any instrument or assignment delivered to the Lender pursuant to this
Agreement or any other Credit Document, or in aid of the exercise of any power
granted in this Agreement or any other Credit Document or any such instrument
or assignment.

8.2.3 Acceleration. Lender may, by notice in writing to
the Borrowers, declare all or any part of the unpaid balance of the Credit
Obligations then outstanding to be immediately due and payable, and thereupon
such unpaid balance or part thereof shall become so due and payable without
presentation, protest or further demand or notice of any kind, all of which are
hereby expressly waived; provided, however, that if a Bankruptcy Default shall
have occurred, the unpaid balance of the Credit Obligations shall automatically
become immediately due and payable; provided, however, that if an Event of
Default described

20
<PAGE> 27
in Section 8.1.9 has occurred and is continuing but at the applicable time of
determination the Indebtedness incurred under the Blockbuster Credit Facility
has not been accelerated, then Lender may not by reason of such Event of
Default, declare all or any part of the unpaid balance of the Credit
Obligations then outstanding to be immediately due and payable until such time,
if ever, that the Indebtedness under the Blockbuster Credit Facility is
accelerated.

8.2.4 Enforcement of Payment; Setoff. Lender may proceed
to enforce payment of the Credit Obligations in such manner as it may elect and
to realize upon any and all rights in the Credit Security. Lender may offset
and apply toward the payment of the Credit Obligations (and/or toward the
curing of any Event of Default) any Indebtedness from Lender to the respective
Obligors, regardless of the adequacy of any security for the Credit
Obligations. Lender shall have no duty to determine the adequacy of any such
security in connection with any such offset.

8.2.5 Cumulative Remedies. To the extent not prohibited by
applicable law which cannot be waived, all of the Lender's rights hereunder and
under each other Credit Document shall be cumulative.

8.3 Annulment of Defaults. Any Default or Event of Default shall
be deemed to exist and to be continuing for any purpose of this Agreement until
such Default or Event of Default has been completely cured in every respect or
the Lender shall have waived such Default or Event of Default in writing or
entered into an amendment to this Agreement which by its express terms cures
such Default or Event of Default. No such action by the Lender shall extend to
or affect any subsequent Default or Event of Default or impair any rights of
the Lender upon the occurrence thereof. The making of any extension of credit
during the existence of any Default or Event of Default shall not constitute a
waiver thereof.

8.4 Waivers. Each of the Borrowers waives to the extent not
prohibited by the provisions of applicable law that cannot be waived:

(a) all presentments, demands for performance,
notices of nonperformance (except to the extent required by the
provisions of this Agreement or any other Credit Document), protests,
notices of protest and notices of dishonor;

(b) any requirement of diligence or promptness
in the part of Lender in the enforcement of its rights under this
Agreement, the Notes or any other Credit Document;

21
<PAGE> 28
(c) any and all notices of every kind and
description which may be required to be given by any statute or rule
of law.

9. Expenses; Indemnity.

9.1 Expenses. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be consummated (unless such transactions are not consummated solely by
reason of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lender), the Borrowers
will pay:

(a) all reasonable expenses of Lender
(including the reasonable fees, expenses and disbursements of counsel
to Lender including allocated costs of internal counsel) in connection
with the preparation, negotiation, execution, delivery and
administration of this Agreement, each other Credit Document, the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and operations hereunder
and thereunder;

(b) all recording and filing fees and transfer
and documentary stamp and similar taxes at any time payable in respect
of this Agreement, any other Credit Document, any Credit Security or
the incurrence of the Credit Obligations; and

(c) to the extent not prohibited by applicable
law that cannot be waived, all other reasonable expenses incurred by
Lender or the holder of any Credit Obligation in connection with the
enforcement of any rights hereunder or under any other Credit
Document, including costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees
(including a reasonable allowance for the hourly cost of attorneys
employed by Lender on a salaried basis) and expenses.

9.2 General Indemnity. The Borrowers will, jointly and severally,
indemnify Lender and hold Lender harmless from any liability, loss or damage
resulting from the violation by the Borrowers of Section 2.3. The Borrowers
will also, jointly and severally, indemnify Lender, each of the Lender's
directors, officers, employees, attorneys, and Affiliates and each Person, if
any, who controls Lender (Lender and each of such directors, officers,
employees and Affiliates and control Persons is referred to as an "Indemnified
Party") and hold each of them harmless from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments,
suits, claims, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature
whatsoever (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel (including allocated costs of internal counsel) for
such Indemnified Party in connection with any investigative, administrative or
judicial proceeding commenced or threatened, whether or not such Indemnified
Party shall be designated a party thereto), that may be imposed on, incurred
by, or asserted against that Indemnified Party, in any

22
<PAGE> 29
manner relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the other Credit
Documents, Lender's agreement to make the Loans as provided herein, or the use
or intended use of the proceeds of any of the Loans hereunder (the "Indemnified
Liabilities"); provided that Borrowers shall have no obligation to an
Indemnified Party hereunder with respect to Indemnified Liabilities arising
from (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnified Party
or (ii) an investigative proceeding related primarily to the activities of
Lender. To the extent that the undertaking to indemnify, pay and hold harmless
set forth in the preceding sentence may be unenforceable because it is
violative of any law or public policy, and Borrower shall contribute the
maximum portion that it is permitted to pay and satisfy under applicable law,
to the payment and satisfaction of all Indemnified Liabilities incurred by the
Indemnified Parties or any of them. The indemnities contained in this
subsection shall survive the termination of the other provisions of this
Agreement, shall constitute separate and independent obligations of each
Borrower from its other obligations under this Agreement and shall give rise to
separate and independent causes of action against each Borrower.

10. Successors and Assigns. Any reference in this Agreement to any of the
parties hereto shall be deemed to include the successors and assigns of such
party, including without limitation any assignee or transferee of any of the
Loans, and all covenants and agreements by or on behalf of the Borrowers or
Lender that are contained in this Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit
of their respective successors and assigns; provided, however, that the Company
and its Subsidiaries may not assign their rights or obligations under this
Agreement.

11. Notices. Except as otherwise specified in this Agreement, any notice
required to be given pursuant to this Agreement shall be given in writing. Any
notice, demand or other communication in connection with this Agreement shall
be deemed to be given if given in writing (including telex, telecopy or similar
teletransmission) addressed as provided below (or to the addressee at such
other address as the addressee shall have specified by notice actually received
by the addressor), and if either (a) actually delivered in fully legible form
to such address (evidenced in the case of a telex by receipt of the correct
answer back) or (b) in the case of a letter, five days shall have elapsed after
the same shall have been deposited in the United States mails, with first-class
postage prepaid and registered or certified.

If to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to it in care of the
Company at its address set forth on the signature page hereof, to the attention
of the chief financial officer.

If to Lender, to it at its address set forth on the signature page of
this Agreement, to the attention of the chief

23
<PAGE> 30
financial officer with a copy to the assistant treasurer and director of cash
management.

12. Course of Dealing; Amendments and Waivers. No course of dealing
between Lender, on one hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
their respective Affiliates, on the other hand, shall operate as a waiver of
any of Lender's rights under this Agreement or any other Credit Document or
with respect to the Credit Obligations. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries acknowledges that if the Lender, without being required to do so
by this Agreement or any other Credit Document, gives any notice or information
to, or obtains any consent from, any of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Affiliates, Lender shall not by implication have amended,
waived or modified any provision of this Agreement or any other Credit
Document, or created any duty to give any such notice or information or to
obtain any such consent on any future occasion. No delay or omission on the
part of Lender in exercising any right under this Agreement or any other Credit
Document or with respect to the Credit Obligations shall operate as a waiver of
such right or any other right hereunder or thereunder. A waiver on any one
occasion shall not be construed as a bar to or waiver of any right or remedy on
any future occasion. No waiver, consent or amendment with respect to this
Agreement or any other Credit Document shall be binding unless it is in writing
and signed by Lender.

13. Venue; Service of Process. Each of the Borrowers:

(a) Irrevocably submits to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the States of
New York, Florida and California for the purpose of any suit, action
or other proceeding arising out of or based upon this Agreement or any
other Credit Document or the subject matter hereof or thereof.

(b) Waives to the extent not prohibited by
applicable law, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a
defense or otherwise, in any such proceeding brought in any of the
above-named courts, any claim that it is not subject personally to the
jurisdiction of such court, that its property is exempt or immune from
attachment or execution, that such proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of such proceeding is improper, or
that this Agreement or any other Credit Document, or the subject
matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or by such court.

Each of the Borrowers and the Lender consents to service of process in any such
proceeding in any manner permitted by applicable state or federal law and
agrees that service of process by registered or certified mail, return receipt

24
<PAGE> 31
requested, at its address specified in or pursuant to Section 11 is reasonably
calculated to give actual notice.

14. General. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties
made in this Agreement or any other Credit Document or in certificates
delivered pursuant hereto or thereto shall be deemed to have been relied on by
Lender, notwithstanding any investigation made by Lender on its behalf, and
shall survive the execution and delivery to the Lender hereof and thereof. The
invalidity or unenforceability of any other provision hereof shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof. The headings in
this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or
otherwise affect the meaning hereof. This Agreement and the other Credit
Documents constitute the entire understanding of the parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior and current
understandings and agreements, whether written or oral. Section 9 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts which together shall constitute one instrument.
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
INTERNAL LAWS (OTHER THAN THE CONFLICT OF LAWS RULES) OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

15. Negotiations Regarding Possible Extension of Final Revolving Loan
Maturity Date. If prior to March 31, 1997, the Blockbuster Credit Facility is
terminated, repaid or restructured (other than due to an acceleration of
Blockbuster's obligations thereunder) so as to result in an increased cost of
funds to Lender, then for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days thereafter
Lender and Borrowers will negotiate in good faith to reset the interest rates
and fees applicable to the Revolving Loans hereunder in order to take into
account Lender's increased cost of funds.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENTS:

(1) Lender has entered into a Credit Agreement dated as
of January 31, 1994 (said Agreement, as it may hereafter be amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, including, without
limitation, by the joinder of additional present or future subsidiaries of SEGI
as borrowers thereunder, being the "CREDIT AGREEMENT," the terms defined
therein and not otherwise defined herein being used herein as therein defined)
with the Grantors thereunder pursuant to which Lender has made certain
commitments, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Credit
Agreement, to extend certain credit facilities to the Grantors.

(2) Grantors have executed and delivered a Guaranty dated
as of even date herewith (said Guaranty, as it may hereafter be amended,
supplemented or modified from time to time, including, without limitation, by
the joinder of additional present or future subsidiaries of SEGI as guarantors
thereunder, being the "GUARANTY") in favor of Lender, pursuant to which, inter
alia, the Grantors have guaranteed the Guaranteed Obligations (as that term is
defined in the Guaranty).

(3) The Credit Agreement requires Grantors to enter into
this Agreement prior to the making of the initial Loans thereunder and the
Grantors shall have granted the security interests and undertaken the
obligations contemplated by this Agreement.

Lender as follows:

SECTION 1. ASSIGNMENT AND PLEDGE. Each Grantor hereby
mortgages, pledges, assigns and grants to Lender a continuing security interest
in all of such Grantor's right, title and interest in and to (but none of its
obligations or liabilities with respect to) all of its personal property
including, without limitation, the items and type of present and future
property of such Grantor described in Sections 1(A) through 1(O) (subject,
however, to Section 1(P)), whether now or hereafter existing or in which any
Grantor now has or hereafter acquires an interest and wherever the same may be
located including, without limitation, the following (the "COLLATERAL"):

(A) Rights to Payment of Money. All rights to receive
the payment of money, including accounts (as defined in the UCC), receivables,

(C) Documents. All documents of title, including any
bill of lading, dock warrant, dock receipt, laboratory pledgeholder agreement,
laboratory access agreement, warehouse receipt or order for the delivery of

Product in the Copyright Office. Each such Grantor shall use and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to use best efforts to comply with all requirements of the
federal Copyright Act, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and any
other applicable laws or regulations, and shall take all steps necessary to
validly register the ownership of the copyright to such item of Product or to
record the instrument of transfer transferring distribution, exploitation or
other rights to such item of Product, as applicable, in the United States
Copyright Office. Concurrently with the filing of the copyright registration
application or the instrument of transfer, as applicable, such Grantor will
file, or, if ownership of such item of Product or distribution, exploitation or
other rights are held by its Subsidiary, such Grantor will cause such
Subsidiary to file with the Copyright Office, a Copyright Mortgage and
Assignment in form and substance satisfactory to Lender, duly executed,
notarized and in proper form for recordation in the Copyright Office. Except
as otherwise set forth in the Credit Agreement, each Grantor will submit and

United States of America;

(2) With respect to each item of Product produced or

the application for copyright registration, the Copyright Mortgage and
Assignment and any other documents required to effect the valid

pursuant to which the Grantor or any of its Subsidiaries acquired
rights in such item of Product; provided, however, with respect to
each item of Product intended for initial exhibition on television
such filings will be made not later than thirty (30) days following
delivery to the Grantor or any of its Subsidiaries of such item of
Product.

Copies of all such applications for copyright registration,
instruments of transfer and Copyright Mortgage and Assignments and all other
documents filed with the Copyright Office pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 6(C) by any Grantor and/or any Subsidiary of any Grantor shall be sent
to Lender concurrently with the submission to the Copyright Office of the
applicable documents. Copies of all such documents when validly registered or
recorded, as applicable, in the Copyright

16
<PAGE> 18
Office shall be promptly sent to Lender when received by any Grantor or any
Subsidiary of any Grantor from the Copyright Office.

SECTION 7. PLEDGED SECURITIES.

(A) So long as no Event of Default or Potential Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing:

(1) Each Grantor shall be entitled to exercise
any and all voting and other consensual rights pertaining to the
Pledged Securities or any part thereof for any purpose not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or the Credit Agreement.

(2) Each Grantor shall be entitled to receive and
retain any and all dividends and interest paid in respect of the
Pledged Securities.

(B) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an
Event of Default or a Default all rights of any Grantor to exercise the voting
and other consensual rights which it would otherwise be entitled to exercise
pursuant to Section 7(A)(1) and to receive the dividends and interest payments
which it would otherwise be authorized to receive and retain pursuant to
Section 7(A)(2) shall cease, and all such rights shall thereupon become vested
in Lender who shall thereupon have the sole right to exercise such voting and
other consensual rights and to receive and hold as Collateral such dividends
and interest payments.

SECTION 8. COVENANTS; FURTHER ASSURANCES.

(A) Each Grantor agrees that from time to time, at the
expense of such Grantor, such Grantor will promptly execute and deliver all
further instruments and documents, and take all further action, that may be
necessary or desirable, or that Lender may reasonably request, in order to
perfect and protect the assignment and security interest granted or purported
to be granted hereby or to enable Lender to enforce its rights and remedies
hereunder with respect to any Collateral.

(B) Each Grantor will (1) if any Collateral shall be
evidenced by a promissory note or other instrument or chattel paper, deliver
and pledge to Lender hereunder all executed originals of such note, instrument
or chattel paper duly endorsed and accompanied by duly executed instruments of
transfer or assignment, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Lender; and (2) mark conspicuously each copy of an agreement, document,
instrument or other writing which constitutes chattel paper and, at the request
of Lender, each of its records pertaining to such Collateral, with a legend, in
form and substance satisfactory to Lender, indicating that such

17
<PAGE> 19
Collateral, as the case may be, has been assigned and is subject to the
security interest granted pursuant to this Agreement.

(C) Each Grantor will execute and file such financing or
continuation statements, or amendments thereto, and such other instruments or
notices, as may be necessary or desirable, or as Lender may reasonably request,
in order to perfect and preserve the assignment and security interest granted
or purported to be granted hereby. Each Grantor hereby authorizes Lender to
file one or more financing or continuation statements, and amendments thereto,
relative to all or any part of the Collateral without the signature of any
Grantor where permitted by law. A carbon, photographic or other reproduction
of this Agreement or any financing statement concerning the Collateral or any
part thereof shall be sufficient as a financing statement where permitted by
law.

(D) Each Grantor will comply with all laws, rules and
regulations relating to, and shall pay prior to delinquency all license fees,
registration fees, taxes and assessments, and all other charges, including
without limitation non- governmental levies or assessments, which may be levied
upon or assessed against, or which may become security interests, liens or
other encumbrances on, the ownership or possession, of any material part of the
Collateral, or which create or may create a lien upon any material part of the
Collateral; provided, however, that Grantors shall not be required to comply
with any such law, rule or regulation, or to pay any such tax, fee, assessment
or other charge, the validity of which is being contested by such Grantor in
good faith by appropriate proceedings promptly instituted and diligently
conducted.

(E) Each Grantor will at all times keep accurate records
with respect to the Collateral which are as complete and comprehensive as those
customarily maintained by others engaged in businesses of the type in which
Grantors engage, and agrees that Lender or its representatives shall have the
right, at any time during normal working hours or any other reasonable time and
from time to time, to call at its place or places of business or where the
Collateral or any part thereof may be held or located or its records pertaining
to the Collateral may be kept and to inspect the Collateral and/or examine or
cause to be examined such records and to make abstracts therefrom or copies
thereof. In addition, upon Lender's request, if Lender deems it necessary or
desirable to perfect or preserve Lender's security interest in the Collateral,
and at the cost and expense of each Grantor, Grantor will make or stamp on, or
otherwise affix to, each material item of Collateral and each of its individual
ledger sheets, cards and other records pertaining thereto, a legend or plaque
in form and content reasonably satisfactory to Lender indicating that such
Collateral is subject to a security interest in favor of Lender.

18
<PAGE> 20
(F) At such time or times as Lender may request, each
Grantor will, at its cost and expense, prepare a list, statement, schedule or
report in such form as shall be reasonably satisfactory to Lender, certified by
duly authorized officers of such Grantor, describing in such detail as Lender
shall require, the Collateral, and specifying the location of such Collateral,
each Grantor's records pertaining thereto and such other information as Lender
may reasonably request. No Grantor shall change the location of any Collateral
described on any list furnished pursuant to this subsection (H) or (except
insofar as the change of location is within the same county to another office
or plant of such Grantor or to a laboratory or other commercial storage
facility in the United States so long as such laboratory or facility has
executed and delivered to Lender a Pledgeholder Agreement) the location of such
Grantor's records pertaining to such Collateral, except upon ten (10) Business
Days' prior written notice to Lender of such change and of the new location of
such Collateral or the records pertaining thereto, and, in the case of change
in location of any Collateral, such Grantor shall duly perfect Lender's
security interest in any such item by preparing, executing and, if required by
Lender, filing a Uniform Commercial Code financing statement with respect
thereto in any new jurisdiction where such item has been removed and may remain
for three months or more and/or taking such other actions as may be required or
desirable to duly perfect Lender's security interest in any such items of
Collateral.

SECTION 9. REMEDIES UPON DEFAULT. If any Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing:

(A) (1) Lender may exercise in respect of the
Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies, all the rights
and remedies of a secured party in default under the UCC in effect in
the State of New York at that time, and the Lender may also without
notice, except as specified below, sell the Collateral or any part
thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale, at any
exchange, broker's board or at any of the Lender's offices or
elsewhere, for cash, on credit or for future delivery, and at such
price or prices and upon such other terms as the Lender may deem
commercially reasonable irrespective of the impact of any such sales
on the market price of the Collateral. Lender may be the purchaser of
any or all of the Collateral at any such sale and shall be entitled,
for the purpose of bidding and making settlement or payment of the
purchase price for all or any portion of the Collateral sold at any
such public sale, to use and apply any of the Secured Obligations as a
credit on account of the purchase price of any Collateral payable by
Lender at such sale. Each purchaser at any such sale shall hold the
property sold absolutely free from any claim or right on the part of
any Grantor and each Grantor hereby waives (to the extent

19
<PAGE> 21
permitted by law) all rights of redemption, stay and/or appraisal
which it now has or may at any time in the future have under any rule
of law or statute now existing or hereafter enacted. Each Grantor
agrees that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by law, at
least ten days' notice of sale to the Grantor whose Collateral is to
be sold of the time and place of any public sale or the time after
which any private sale is to be made shall constitute reasonable
notification. Lender shall not be obligated to make any sale of
Collateral regardless of notice of sale having been given. Lender may
adjourn any public or private sale from time to time by announcement
at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without
further notice, be made at the time and place to which it was so
adjourned. Each Grantor hereby waives any claims against Lender
arising by reason of the fact that the price at which any Collateral
may have been sold at such a private sale was less than the price
which might have been obtained at a public sale, even if Lender
accepts the first offer received and does not offer such Collateral to
more than one offeree.

(2) Each Grantor recognizes that, by reason of certain
prohibitions contained in the Securities Act of 1933, as from time to
time amended (the "SECURITIES ACT"), and applicable state securities
laws, Lender may be compelled, with respect to any sale of all or any
part of the Collateral, to limit purchasers to those who will agree,
among other things, to acquire the Collateral for their own account,
for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale
thereof. Each Grantor acknowledges that any such private sales may be
at prices and on terms less favorable to Lender than those obtainable
through a public sale without such restrictions (including, without
limitation, a public offering made pursuant to a registration
statement under the Securities Act), and notwithstanding such
circumstances agrees that any such private sale shall be deemed to
have been made in a commercially reasonable manner and that Lender
shall not have any obligation to engage in public sales and no
obligation to delay the sale of any Collateral for the period of time
necessary to permit the issuer thereof to register it for a form of
public sale requiring registration under the Securities Act or under
applicable state securities laws, even if the applicable Grantor would
agree to do so.

(B) If Lender determines to exercise its right to sell
any or all of the Collateral, upon written request, each Grantor shall and
shall cause each issuer of any Pledged Shares or other Pledged Securities to be
sold hereunder from time to time to furnish to Lender all such information as
Lender may request in order to determine the number of shares and other
instruments included in the Collateral which may be sold by Lender as exempt

20
<PAGE> 22
transactions under the Securities Act and the rules of the Securities and
Exchange Commission thereunder, as the same are from time to time in effect.

(C) Lender may exercise any and all rights and remedies
of each Grantor under or in connection with the agreements which otherwise
constitute Collateral hereunder, including, without limitation, any and all
rights of any Grantor to demand or otherwise require payment of any amount
under, or performance of any provision of, any such agreements.

(D) All payments received by any Lender under or in
connection with any other agreements which constitute Collateral shall be
received in trust for the benefit of Lender, shall be segregated from other
funds of such Grantor and shall be forthwith paid over to Lender in the same
form as so received (with any necessary endorsement).

SECTION 10. APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. After and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, any cash held by Lender as Collateral and
all cash proceeds received by Lender (all such cash being "PROCEEDS") in
respect of any sale of, collection from, or other realization upon all or any
part of the Collateral pursuant to the exercise by Lender of its remedies as a
secured creditor as provided in Section 9 of this Agreement shall be applied
promptly from time to time by Lender:

First, to the payment of the costs and expenses of such sale,
collection or other realization, including reasonable compensation to
Lender and its agents and counsel, and all expenses, liabilities and
advances made or incurred by Lender in connection therewith;

Second, to the payment of the Secured Obligations (it being
agreed that with respect to any Proceeds derived from any Collateral
owned by a Borrower/Grantor, such proceeds shall first be applied to
such Borrower/Grantor's Primary Secured Obligations and after the
payment of such Borrower/Grantor's Primary Secured Obligations then to
such Borrower/Grantor's Secondary Secured Obligations); and

Third, only after payment in full of all Secured Obligations,
to the Grantors, or other successors or assigns, or to whomsoever may
be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a court of competent
jurisdiction may direct, of any surplus then remaining from such
Proceeds.

SECTION 11. REGISTRATION RIGHTS WITH RESPECT TO PLEDGED
SHARES.

If Lender shall determine to exercise its right to sell all or
any of the Collateral pursuant to Section 9, each Grantor

21
<PAGE> 23
agrees that, upon request of Lender, each Grantor will, at its own expense:

(A) execute and deliver, and cause each issuer of the
Pledged Shares contemplated to be sold and the directors and officers thereof
to execute and deliver, all such instruments and documents, and do or cause to
be done all such other acts and things, as may be necessary or, in the opinion
of Lender, advisable to register such Pledged Shares under the provisions of
the Securities Act and to cause the registration statement relating thereto to
become effective and to remain effective for such period as prospectuses are
required by law to be furnished, and to make all amendments and supplements
thereto and to the related prospectus which, in the opinion of Lender, are
necessary or advisable, all in conformity with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission applicable thereto;

(B) use its best efforts to qualify the Pledged Shares
under the state securities or "Blue Sky" laws and to obtain all necessary
governmental approvals for the sale of the Pledged Shares, as requested by
Lender;

(C) cause each such issuer to make available to its
security holders, as soon as practicable, an earning statement which will
satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act; and

(D) do or cause to be done all such other acts and things
as may be necessary to make such sale of the Pledged Shares or any part thereof
valid and binding and in compliance with applicable law.

SECTION 12. SECURITY INTEREST ABSOLUTE. All rights of Lender
and the assignment and security interest hereunder, and all obligations of each
Grantor hereunder, shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of:

(A) any lack of validity, enforceability, genuineness or
regularity of the Credit Agreement, the Notes, the Guaranty, any agreements
constituting collateral, any other Credit Document or any other agreement or
instrument relating thereto;

(B) any change in the time, manner or place of payment
of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Secured Obligations, or any
other amendment or waiver of or any consent to any departure from the Credit
Agreement, the Notes, the Guaranty, any agreements constituting collateral or
any other Credit Document;

22
<PAGE> 24
(C) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any other
collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure
from any guaranty, for all or any of the Secured Obligations; or

(D) any other circumstance which might otherwise
constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Grantor, or a third
party grantor of a security interest.

SECTION 13. LENDER APPOINTED ATTORNEY-IN-FACT. Each Grantor
hereby irrevocably appoints Lender as such Grantor's attorney-in-fact, with
full authority in the place and stead of such Grantor and in the name of such
Grantor or otherwise, from and after the occurrence of any Event of Default and
so long as an Event of Default shall be continuing, from time to time in
Lender's discretion to take any action and to execute any instrument which
Lender may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, to accept and/or release Collateral
as provided in this Agreement, to ask, demand, collect, sue for, recover,
compound, receive and give acquittance and receipts for moneys due and to
become due under or in connection with the Collateral, to receive, endorse, and
collect any drafts or other instruments, documents, letters of credit and
chattel paper in connection therewith or representing any interest payment,
dividend or other distribution or payment in respect of the Collateral or any
part thereof and to give full discharge for the same, and to file any claims or
take any action or institute any proceedings which Lender may deem to be
necessary or desirable for the collection thereof or to enforce compliance with
the terms and conditions of any Collateral.

SECTION 14. LENDER MAY PERFORM. If any Grantor fails to
perform any agreement contained herein, Lender may itself perform, or cause
performance of, such agreement, and the reasonable expenses of Lender incurred
in connection therewith shall be payable by Grantors under Section 16.

SECTION 15. LENDER'S DUTIES. The powers conferred on Lender
hereunder are solely to protect its interest in the Collateral and shall not
impose any duty upon it to exercise any such powers. Except for the safe
custody of any Collateral in its possession and the accounting for moneys
actually received by it hereunder with respect to which Lender shall act with
reasonable care, Lender shall have no duty as to any Collateral or as to the
taking of any necessary steps to preserve rights against prior parties or any
other rights pertaining to any Collateral. Lender shall be deemed to have
exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in
its possession if the Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equal to
that which Lender accords its own property, it being understood that Lender
shall not have any responsibility for ascertaining or taking action with
respect to calls, conversions,

23
<PAGE> 25
exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relative to any Collateral,
whether or not Lender has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters.

SECTION 16. INDEMNITY AND EXPENSES.

(A) Each Grantor agrees to indemnify Lender from and
against any and all claims, losses and liabilities growing out of or resulting
from this Agreement (including, without limitation, enforcement of this
Agreement and any misstatements or omissions contained in any prospectus
prepared by such Grantor pursuant to Section 11; provided, however, that
Grantors shall have no obligation to provide indemnification under this Section
16 to a Person to the extent that such claims, losses or liabilities arise from
such Person's gross negligence or willful misconduct.

(B) Each Grantor will upon demand pay to Lender the
amount of any and all reasonable expenses, including the reasonable fees and
expenses of its counsel and of any experts and agents, which Lender may incur
in connection with (1) the administration of this Agreement, (2) the custody or
preservation of, or the collection from or other realization upon, any of the
Collateral, (3) the exercise or enforcement of any of the rights of Lender
hereunder or (4) the failure by any Grantor to perform or observe any of the
provisions hereof.

SECTION 17. AMENDMENTS; ETC. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement nor consent to any departure by any Grantor
herefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by Lender and, in the case of such an amendment, signed by Grantors,
and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

SECTION 18. NOTICES. Unless otherwise specifically provided
herein, any notice or other communication herein required or permitted to be
given shall be in writing and may be personally served, telecopied, telexed or
sent by United States mail and shall be deemed to have been given when
delivered in person, receipt of telecopy or telex or four Business Days after
deposit in the United States mail, registered or certified return receipt
requested, with postage prepaid and properly addressed; provided that notices
to Lender shall not be effective until received. For the purposes hereof, the
addresses of the parties hereto (until notice of a change thereof is delivered
as provided in this Section 18) shall be as set forth below each party's name
on the signature pages of this Agreement.

SECTION 19. CONTINUING ASSIGNMENT AND SECURITY INTEREST;
TRANSFER OF NOTES. This Agreement shall create a continuing assignment of and
security interest in the Collateral and shall (A) remain in full force and
effect until indefeasible payment in full of the Secured Obligations, (B) be
binding upon

24
<PAGE> 26
each Grantor and its successors and assigns and (C) inure, together with the
rights and remedies of Lender hereunder, to the benefit of Lender and their
respective successors, transferees and assigns. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing clause (C), Lender may assign or otherwise transfer
any Note held by it to any other person or entity, and such other person or
entity shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof
granted to Lender herein or otherwise. Upon the indefeasible payment in full
of the Secured Obligations and the termination of all of the Commitments, the
security interest granted hereby shall terminate, all rights to the Collateral
pledged or assigned by each Grantor shall revert to such Grantor. Upon any
such termination, Lender will, at Grantors' expense, execute and deliver to the
applicable Grantor such documents as such Grantor shall reasonably request to
evidence such termination.

SECTION 20. ASSIGNMENT. Lender may assign, endorse or
transfer any instrument evidencing all or any part of the Credit Obligations,
and the holder of such instrument shall be entitled to the benefits of this
Agreement. Grantors' rights, obligations or any interest therein under this
Agreement may not be assigned without the written consent of Lender.

SECTION 21. SEVERABILITY. In case any provision in or
obligation under this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
provisions or obligations, or of such provision or obligation in any other
jurisdiction, shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

SECTION 22. GOVERNING LAW; TERMS. This Agreement shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York,
except to the extent that the validity or perfection of the security interest
hereunder, or remedies hereunder, are governed by the laws of a jurisdiction
other than the State of New York. Unless otherwise defined herein or in the
Credit Agreement, terms used in Article 9 of the UCC in effect in the State of
New York are used herein as therein defined.

SECTION 23. CONSENT TO JURISDICTION AND SERVICE OF PROCESS.
All judicial proceedings brought against any Grantor, with respect to this
Agreement, the Guaranty or any other Credit Document may be brought in any
state or federal court of competent jurisdiction in the State of New York,
Florida or California and by execution and delivery of this Agreement each
Grantor accepts for itself and in connection with its properties, generally and
unconditionally, the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts, without
any objection to the venue chosen by Lender based on forum non conveniens or
otherwise, and irrevocably agrees to be bound by any judgment rendered thereby
in connection with this Agreement, the Guaranty or any other Credit Document.
The Grantors designate and appoint Spelling

25
<PAGE> 27
Entertainment Group Inc., c/o Worldvision Enterprises, Inc., 660 Madison
Avenue, New York, New York 10021, and such other Persons as may hereafter be
selected by the Grantors, as Grantors' agent to receive on Grantors' behalf
service of all process in any such proceeding in any such court, such service
being hereby acknowledged by Grantors to be effective and binding service in
every respect. A copy of any such process so served shall be mailed by
registered mail to each Grantor at its address provided in the applicable
signature page hereto, except that unless otherwise provided by applicable law,
any failure to mail such copy shall not affect the validity of service of
process. If any agent appointed by any Grantor refuses to accept service, the
Grantors hereby agree that service upon it by mail shall constitute sufficient
notice. Nothing herein shall affect the right to serve process in any other
manner permitted by law or shall limit the right of Lender to bring proceedings
against any Grantor in the courts of any other jurisdiction.

SECTION 24. ADDITIONAL SUBSIDIARY GRANTORS. The initial
Grantors hereunder shall be the Borrowers and such other of the Subsidiaries of
SEGI as are signatories hereto on the date hereof. From time to time
subsequent to the date hereof, additional present or future Subsidiaries of
SEGI may become parties hereto, as additional Grantors, by executing a
counterpart of this Agreement. Upon delivery of any such counterpart to
Lender, notice of which is hereby waived by Grantors, each such additional
Grantor shall be as fully a party hereto as if such Grantor were an original
signatory hereof. Each Grantor expressly agrees that its obligations arising
hereunder shall not be affected or diminished by the addition or release of any
other Grantor hereunder, nor by any election of Lender not to cause any present
or future Subsidiary of SEGI to become an additional Grantor hereunder. This
Agreement shall be fully effective as to any Grantor that is or becomes a party
hereto regardless of whether any other Person becomes or fails to become or
ceases to be a Grantor hereunder. Each Guarantor shall from time to time cause
any present or future wholly owned Material Subsidiary, within 30 days after
any such Person becomes a Material Subsidiary, that is not a Grantor to join
this Agreement as a Grantor pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and
substance satisfactory to the Lender unless such Subsidiary is a Subsidiary
organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States and
under applicable foreign law such Subsidiary is not permitted to guarantee the
Credit Obligations. Each Grantor will, promptly upon the request of Lender
from time to time, execute, acknowledge and deliver, and file and record, all
such instruments, and take all such action, as Lender deems necessary or
advisable to carry out the intent and purposes of this Section 24.

SECTION 25. COUNTERPARTS; EFFECTIVENESS. This Agreement and
any amendments, waivers, consents, or supplements may be executed in any number
of counterparts, and by different

26
<PAGE> 28
parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and
delivered shall be deemed an original, but all such counterparts together shall
constitute but one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective upon the execution of a counterpart hereof by each of the parties
hereto and written or telephonic notification of such execution and
authorization of delivery thereof has been received by Lender.

(Remainder of page intentionally left blank)

be duly executed and delivered by its officer thereunto duly authorized as of
the date first above written.

1
<PAGE> 3
NOW, THEREFORE, based upon the foregoing and other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, and in order to induce Lender to enter into the Credit Agreement
and to make the Loans thereunder, Guarantors hereby agree as follows:

SECTION 1. DEFINITION.

1.1 CERTAIN DEFINED TERMS. As used in this Guaranty, the
following terms shall have the following meanings unless the context otherwise
requires:

"GUARANTIED OBLIGATIONS" has the meaning assigned to that term
in subsection 2.1.

"GUARANTY" means this Guaranty dated as of January 31, 1994,
as it may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to
time.

"PAYMENT IN FULL", "PAID IN FULL" or any similar term means
payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations including, without
limitation, all principal, interest, costs, fees and expenses
(including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses) of Lender as
required under the Credit Documents.

1.2 INTERPRETATION.

(a) References to "Sections" and "subsections" shall be
to Sections and subsections, respectively, of this Guaranty unless
otherwise specifically provided.

(b) In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between
the terms, conditions and provisions of this Guaranty and the terms,
conditions and provisions of the Credit Agreement, the terms,
conditions and provisions of this Guaranty shall prevail.

SECTION 2. THE GUARANTY

2.1 GUARANTY OF THE GUARANTIED OBLIGATIONS. Subject to the
provisions of subsection 2.2(a), Guarantors jointly and severally hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally guaranty, as primary obligors and not merely as
sureties, the due and punctual payment in full of all Guarantied Obligations
when the same shall become due, whether at stated maturity, by required
prepayment, declaration, acceleration, demand or otherwise (including amounts
that would become due but for the operation of the automatic stay under Section
362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. Section 362(a)). The term
"GUARANTIED OBLIGATIONS" is used herein in its most comprehensive sense and
includes:

2

<PAGE> 4
(a) any and all Credit Obligations now or hereafter made,
incurred or created, whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or
unliquidated, whether due or not due, and however arising under or in
connection with the Credit Agreement and the other Credit Documents,
including those arising under successive borrowing transactions under
the Credit Agreement which shall either continue the Credit
Obligations or from time to time renew them after they have been
satisfied; and

(b) those expenses set forth in subsection 2.9 hereof.

2.2 LIMITATION ON AMOUNT GUARANTIED; CONTRIBUTION BY GUARANTORS.

(a) Anything contained in this Guaranty to the contrary
notwithstanding, the obligations of each Guarantor hereunder (other than the
obligations of SEGI hereunder) shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount
equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder
subject to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548
of Title 11 of the United States Code or any applicable provisions of
comparable state law (collectively, the "FRAUDULENT TRANSFER LAWS"), in each
case after giving effect to all other liabilities of such Guarantor, contingent
or otherwise, that are relevant under the Fraudulent Transfer Laws
(specifically excluding, however, any liabilities of such Guarantor (x) in
respect of intercompany indebtedness to Borrowers or other affiliates of
Borrowers to the extent that such indebtedness would be discharged in an amount
equal to the amount paid by such Guarantor hereunder and (y) under any guaranty
of Indebtedness which by its terms is subordinated to the Credit Obligations
and which guaranty contains a limitation as to maximum amount similar to that
set forth in this subsection 2.2(a), pursuant to which the liability of such
Guarantor hereunder is included in the liabilities taken into account in
determining such maximum amount) and after giving effect as assets to the value
(as determined under the applicable provisions of the Fraudulent Transfer Laws)
of any rights to subrogation, reimbursement or contribution of such Guarantor
pursuant to (i) applicable law or (ii) any agreement providing for an equitable
allocation among such Guarantor and other affiliates of Borrowers of
obligations arising under guaranties by such parties.

(b) Guarantors under this Guaranty together desire to
allocate among themselves (collectively, the "CONTRIBUTING GUARANTORS"), in a
fair and equitable manner, their obligations arising under this Guaranty.
Accordingly, in the event any payment or distribution is made on any date by
any Guarantor under this Guaranty (a "FUNDING GUARANTOR") that exceeds its Fair
Share (as defined below) as of such date, that Funding Guarantor shall be
entitled to a contribution from each of the other Contributing Guarantors in
the amount of such other Contributing

3
<PAGE> 5
Guarantor's Fair Share Shortfall (as defined below) as of such date, with the
result that all such contributions will cause each Contributing Guarantor's
Aggregate Payments (as defined below) to equal its Fair Share as of such date.
"FAIR SHARE" means, with respect to a Contributing Guarantor as of any date of
determination, an amount equal to (i) the ratio of (x) the Adjusted Maximum
Amount (as defined below) with respect to such Contributing Guarantor to (y)
the aggregate of the Adjusted Maximum Amounts with respect to all Contributing
Guarantors, multiplied by (ii) the aggregate amount paid or distributed on or
before such date by all Funding Guarantors under this Guaranty in respect of
the obligations guarantied. "FAIR SHARE SHORTFALL" means, with respect to a
Contributing Guarantor as of any date of determination, the excess, if any, of
the Fair Share of such Contributing Guarantor over the Aggregate Payments of
such Contributing Guarantor. "ADJUSTED MAXIMUM AMOUNT" means, with respect to
a Contributing Guarantor as of any date of determination, the maximum aggregate
amount of the obligations of such Contributing Guarantor under this Guaranty,
determined as of such date in accordance with subsection 2.2(a); provided that,
solely for purposes of calculating the "Adjusted Maximum Amount" with respect
to any Contributing Guarantor for purposes of this subsection 2.2(b), any
assets or liabilities of such Contributing Guarantor arising by virtue of any
rights to subrogation or reimbursement or any rights to or obligations of
contribution hereunder shall not be considered as assets or liabilities of such
Contributing Guarantor. "AGGREGATE PAYMENTS" means, with respect to a
Contributing Guarantor as of any date of determination, an amount equal to (i)
the aggregate amount of all payments and distributions made on or before such
date by such Contributing Guarantor in respect of this Guaranty (including,
without limitation, in respect of this subsection 2.2(b) minus (ii) the
aggregate amount of all payments received on or before such date by such
Contributing Guarantor from the other Contributing Guarantors as contributions
under this subsection 2.2(b). The amounts payable as contributions hereunder
shall be determined as of the date on which the related payment or distribution
is made by the applicable Funding Guarantor. The allocation among Contributing
Guarantors of their obligations as set forth in this subsection 2.2(b) shall
not be construed in any way to limit the liability of any Contributing
Guarantor hereunder.

2.3 LIABILITY OF GUARANTORS ABSOLUTE. Each Guarantor agrees that
its obligations hereunder are irrevocable, absolute, independent and
unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance which constitutes a
legal or equitable discharge of a guarantor or surety other than indefeasible
payment in full of the Guarantied Obligations. In furtherance of the foregoing
and without limiting the generality thereof, each Guarantor agrees as follows:

4
<PAGE> 6
(a) This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment when due and
not of collectibility.

(b) Lender may enforce this Guaranty upon the occurrence
of an Event of Default under the Credit Agreement notwithstanding the
existence of any dispute between Lender and Borrowers with respect to
the existence of such Event of Default.

(c) The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are
independent of the obligations of Borrowers under the Credit Documents
and the obligations of any other guarantor (including any other
Guarantor) of the obligations of Borrowers under the Credit Documents,
and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against
such Guarantor whether or not any action is brought against Borrowers,
or any of them, or any of such other guarantors and whether or not
Borrowers are joined in any such action or actions.

(d) Payment by any Guarantor of a portion, but not all,
of the Guarantied Obligations shall in no way limit, affect, modify or
abridge any Guarantor's liability for any portion of the Guarantied
Obligations which has not been paid. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, if Lender is awarded a judgment in any suit brought
to enforce any Guarantor's covenant to pay a portion of the Guarantied
Obligations, such judgment shall not be deemed to release such
Guarantor from its covenant to pay the portion of the Guarantied
Obligations that is not the subject of such suit, and such judgment
shall not, except to the extent satisfied by such Guarantor, limit,
affect, modify or abridge any other Guarantor's liability hereunder in
respect of the Guarantied Obligations.

(e) Lender, upon such terms as it deems appropriate,
without notice or demand and without affecting the validity or
enforceability of this Guaranty or giving rise to any reduction,
limitation, impairment, discharge or termination of any Guarantor's
liability hereunder, from time to time may (i) renew, extend,
accelerate, increase the rate of interest on, or otherwise change the
time, place, manner or terms of payment of the Guarantied Obligations,
(ii) settle, compromise, release or discharge, or accept or refuse any
offer of performance with respect to, or substitutions for, the
Guarantied Obligations or any agreement relating thereto and/or
subordinate the payment of the same to the payment of any other
obligations; (iii) request and accept other guaranties of the
Guarantied Obligations and take and hold security for the payment of
this Guaranty or the Guarantied Obligations; (iv) release, surrender,
exchange, substitute, compromise, settle, rescind, waive, alter,
subordinate or modify, with or without consideration, any security for

5
<PAGE> 7
payment of the Guarantied Obligations, any other guaranties of the
Guarantied Obligations, or any other obligation of any Person
(including any other Guarantor) with respect to the Guarantied
Obligations; (v) enforce and apply any security now or hereafter held
by or for the benefit of Lender in respect of this Guaranty or the
Guarantied Obligations and direct the order or manner of sale thereof,
or exercise any other right or remedy that Lender may have against any
such security, as Lender in its discretion may determine consistent
with the Credit Agreement and any applicable security agreement,
including foreclosure on any such security pursuant to one or more
judicial or nonjudicial sales, whether or not every aspect of any such
sale is commercially reasonable, and even though such action operates
to impair or extinguish any right of reimbursement or subrogation or
other right or remedy of any Guarantor against Borrowers, or any of
them, or any security for the Guarantied Obligations; and (vi)
exercise any other rights available to it under the Credit Documents.

(f) This Guaranty and the obligations of Guarantors
hereunder shall be valid and enforceable and shall not be subject to
any reduction, limitation, impairment, discharge or termination for
any reason (other than indefeasible payment in full of the Guarantied
Obligations), including without limitation the occurrence of any of
the following, whether or not any Guarantor shall have had notice or
knowledge of any of them: (i) any failure or omission to assert or
enforce or agreement or election not to assert or enforce, or the stay
or enjoining, by order of court, by operation of law or otherwise, of
the exercise or enforcement of, any claim or demand or any right,
power or remedy (whether arising under the Credit Documents, at law,
in equity or otherwise) with respect to the Guarantied Obligations or
any agreement relating thereto, or with respect to any other guaranty
of or security for the payment of the Guarantied Obligations; (ii) any
rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or any consent to
departure from, any of the terms or provisions (including without
limitation provisions relating to events of default) of the Credit
Agreement, any of the other Credit Documents or any agreement or
instrument executed pursuant thereto, or of any other guaranty or
security for the Guarantied Obligations, in each case whether or not
in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement or such Credit
Document or any agreement relating to such other guaranty or security;
(iii) the Guarantied Obligations, or any agreement relating thereto,
at any time being found to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any
respect; (iv) the application of payments received from any source
(other than payments received pursuant to the other Credit Documents
or from the proceeds of any security for the Guarantied Obligations,
except to the extent such security also serves as collateral

6
<PAGE> 8
for indebtedness other than the Guarantied Obligations) to the payment
of indebtedness other than the Guarantied Obligations, even though
Lender might have elected to apply such payment to any part or all of
the Guarantied Obligations; (v) Lender's consent to the change,
reorganization or termination of the corporate structure or existence
of SEI or any of its Subsidiaries and to any corresponding
restructuring of the Guarantied Obligations; (vi) any failure to
perfect or continue perfection of a security interest in any
collateral which secures any of the Guarantied Obligations; (vii) any
defenses, set-offs or counterclaims which Borrowers, or any of them,
may allege or assert against Lender in respect of the Guarantied
Obligations, including but not limited to failure of consideration,
breach of warranty, payment, statute of frauds, statute of
limitations, accord and satisfaction and usury; and (viii) any other
act or thing or omission, or delay to do any other act or thing, which
may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of any
Guarantor as an obligor in respect of the Guarantied Obligations.

2.4 WAIVERS BY GUARANTORS. Each Guarantor hereby waives, for the
benefit of Lender:

(a) any right to require Lender, as a condition of
payment or performance by such Guarantor, to (i) proceed against
Borrowers, or any of them, any other guarantor (including any other
Guarantor) of the Guarantied Obligations or any other Person, (ii)
proceed against or exhaust any security held from Borrowers, or any of
them, any other guarantor (including any other Guarantor) of the
Guarantied Obligations or any other Person, (iii) proceed against or
have resort to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the
books of Lender in favor of Borrowers, or any of them, or any other
Person, or (iv) pursue any other remedy in the power of Lender
whatsoever;

(b) any defense arising by reason of the incapacity, lack
of authority or any disability or other defense of Borrowers, or any
of them, including, without limitation, any defense based on or
arising out of the lack of validity or the unenforceability of the
Guarantied Obligations or any agreement or instrument relating thereto
or by reason of the cessation of the liability of Borrowers, or any of
them, from any cause other than indefeasible payment in full of the
Guarantied Obligations;

(c) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law
which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither larger

principal;

7
<PAGE> 9
(d) any defense based upon Lender's errors or omissions
in the administration of the Guarantied Obligations, except behavior
which amounts to bad faith;

(e) (i) any principles or provisions of law, statutory or
otherwise, which are or might be in conflict with the terms of this
Guaranty and any legal or equitable discharge of such Guarantor's
obligations hereunder, (ii) the benefit of any statute of limitations
affecting such Guarantor's liability hereunder or the enforcement
hereof, (iii) any rights to set-offs, recoupments and counterclaims,
and (iv) promptness, diligence and any requirement that Lender

including acceptance of this Guaranty, notices of default under the
Credit Agreement or any agreement or instrument related thereto,
notices of any renewal, extension or modification of the Guarantied
Obligations or any agreement related thereto, notices of any extension
of credit to the Borrowers, or any of them, and notices of any of the
matters referred to in subsection 2.3 and any right to consent to any
thereof; and

(g) any defenses or benefits that may be derived from or
afforded by law which limit the liability of or exonerate guarantors
or sureties, or which may conflict with the terms of this Guaranty,
including without limitation if and to the extent applicable, the
provisions of California Civil Code Sections 2809, 2810, 2819, 2839,
2845, 2846, 2849, 2850, 2899 and 3433.

2.5 PAYMENT BY GUARANTORS; APPLICATION OF PAYMENTS. Subject to
the provisions of subsection 2.2(a), Guarantors hereby jointly and severally
agree, in furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right
which Lender or any other Person may have at law or in equity against any
Guarantor by virtue hereof, that upon the failure of Borrowers, or any of them,
to pay any of the Guarantied Obligations when and as the same shall become due,
whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, declaration, acceleration,
demand or otherwise (including amounts that would become due but for the
operation of the automatic stay under Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11
U.S.C. Section 362(a) or the operation of any other provision of law or any
jurisdiction which would otherwise cause a stay of the payment of such
amounts), Guarantors will upon demand pay, or cause to be paid, in cash, to
Lender, an amount equal to the sum of the unpaid principal amount of all
Guarantied Obligations then due as aforesaid, accrued and unpaid interest on
such Guarantied Obligations (including, without limitation, interest which, but
for the filing of a petition in bankruptcy with respect to

8
<PAGE> 10
Borrowers, or any of them, would have accrued on such Guarantied Obligations,
whether or not a claim is allowed against Borrowers, or any of them, for such
interest in any such bankruptcy proceeding) and all other Guarantied
Obligations then owed to Lender as aforesaid. All such payments shall be
applied promptly from time to time by Lender:

First, to the payment of the costs and expenses of any
collection or other realization under this Guaranty, including
reasonable compensation to Lender and its agents and counsel, and all
expenses, liabilities and advances made or incurred by Lender in
connection therewith;

Second, to the payment of all other Guarantied Obligations; and

Third, after payment in full of all Guarantied Obligations, to
the payment to Guarantors, or their respective successors or assigns,
or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to receive the same or as a
court of competent jurisdiction may direct, of any surplus then
remaining from such payments.

2.6 GUARANTORS' RIGHTS OF SUBROGATION, CONTRIBUTION, ETC. Each
Guarantor hereby waives any claim, right or remedy, direct or indirect, that
such Guarantor now has or may hereafter have against Borrowers, or any of them,
or any of their assets in connection with this Guaranty or the performance by
such Guarantor of its obligations hereunder, in each case whether such claim,
right or remedy arises in equity, under contract, by statute, under common law
or otherwise and including without limitation (a) any right of subrogation,
reimbursement or indemnification that such Guarantor now has or may hereafter
have against any Borrower, (b) any right to enforce, or to participate in, any
claim, right or remedy that Lender now has or may hereafter have against
Borrowers, or any of them, and (c) any benefit of, and any right to participate
in, any collateral or security now or hereafter held by Lender. In addition,
until the Guarantied Obligations shall have been indefeasibly paid in full and
the Commitment shall have terminated, each Guarantor shall withhold exercise of
any right of contribution such Guarantor may have against any other guarantor
(including any other Guarantor) of the Guarantied Obligations (including
without limitation any such right of contribution under subsection 2.2(b).
Each Guarantor further agrees that, to the extent the waiver or withholding of
its rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification and contribution as
set forth herein is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or
voidable for any reason, any rights of subrogation, reimbursement or
indemnification such Guarantor may have against Borrowers, or any of them, or
against any collateral or security, and any rights of contribution such
Guarantor may have against any such other guarantor, shall be junior and
subordinate to any rights Lender

9
<PAGE> 11
may have against Borrowers, or any of them, to all right, title and interest
Lender may have in any such collateral or security, and to any right Lender may
have against such other guarantor. Lender may use, sell or dispose of any item
of collateral or security as it sees fit without regard to any subrogation
rights any Guarantor may have, and upon any such disposition or sale any rights
of subrogation such Guarantor may have shall terminate. If any amount shall be
paid to any Guarantor on account of any such subrogation, reimbursement or
indemnification rights at any time when all Guarantied Obligations shall not
have been paid in full, such amount shall be held in trust for Lender and shall
forthwith be paid over to Lender to be credited and applied against the
Guarantied Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the
terms hereof.

2.7 SUBORDINATION OF OTHER OBLIGATIONS. Any indebtedness of
Borrowers, or any of them, now or hereafter held by any Guarantor is hereby
subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantied Obligations, and any such
indebtedness of Borrowers, or any of them, to such Guarantor collected or
received by such Guarantor after an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing shall be held in trust for Lender and shall forthwith be paid over
to Lender to be credited and applied against the Guarantied Obligations but
without affecting, impairing or limiting in any manner the liability of such
Guarantor under any other provision of this Guaranty.

2.8 REAL PROPERTY SECURITY. Each Guarantor agrees that, if all or
a portion of the Guarantied Obligations are at any time secured by a deed of
trust or mortgage covering interests in real property, Lender or its designee,
in its sole discretion, without notice or demand and without affecting the
liability of any Guarantor under this Guaranty, may foreclose, pursuant to the
terms of the Credit Documents or otherwise, on such deed of trust or mortgage
and the interests in real property secured thereby by nonjudicial or other
sale. Each Guarantor understands (i) that the exercise by Lender, or any of
them, of certain rights and remedies contained in the Credit Agreement and
Borrowers, or any of them, such deed of trust or mortgage, including the right
to conduct such a nonjudicial foreclosure sale, may affect or eliminate such
Guarantor's right of subrogation against Borrowers, or any of them, (ii) that
such Guarantor may therefore incur a partially or totally nonreimbursable
liability hereunder, and (iii) that such actions by Lender that affect or
eliminate such right of subrogation may give rise to a defense by such
Guarantor to any liability under this Guaranty, absent a waiver of such defense
by such Guarantor. Nevertheless, each Guarantor hereby waives any such defense
and hereby authorizes and empowers Lender to exercise, in its sole discretion,
any rights and remedies, or any combination thereof, which may then be
available, since it is the intent and purpose of each Guarantor that the
obligations hereunder shall be absolute, independent and unconditional under
any and all circumstances. To the extent

10
<PAGE> 12
permitted by law, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if and to
the extent found applicable, each Guarantor hereby expressly waives any and all
benefits under California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 580a, 580d and 726.
Notwithstanding any foreclosure of the lien of such deed of trust or mortgage
with respect to any or all real or personal property secured thereby, whether
by the exercise of the power of sale contained therein, by an action for
judicial foreclosure or by an acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, each
Guarantor shall remain bound under this Guaranty, including its obligation to
pay any deficiency after a nonjudicial foreclosure, even though such Guarantor
may have no right of subrogation against Borrowers, or any of them, as a result
thereof.

2.9 EXPENSES. Guarantors jointly and severally agree to pay, or
cause to be paid, on demand, and to save Lender harmless against liability for,
any and all costs and expenses (including fees and disbursements of counsel and
allocated costs of internal counsel) incurred or expended by Lender in
connection with the enforcement of or preservation of any rights under this
Guaranty.

2.10 CONTINUING GUARANTY. This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty
and shall remain in effect until all of the Guarantied Obligations shall have
been indefeasibly paid in full and the Commitment shall have terminated. Each
Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any right (including without limitation if
and to the extent applicable, any such right arising under California Civil
Code Section 2815) to revoke this Guaranty as to future transactions giving
rise to any Guarantied Obligations.

2.11 AUTHORITY OF GUARANTORS OR BORROWERS. It is not necessary for
Lender to inquire into the capacity or powers of any Guarantor or any Borrower
or the officers, directors or any agents acting or purporting to act on behalf
of any of them.

2.12 FINANCIAL CONDITION OF BORROWERS. Any Loans may be granted to
Borrowers or continued from time to time without notice to or authorization
from any Guarantor regardless of the financial or other condition of Borrowers,
or any of them, at the time of any such grant or continuation. Lender shall
have no obligation to disclose or discuss with any Guarantor their assessment,
or any Guarantor's assessment, of the financial condition of Borrowers, or any
of them. Each Guarantor has adequate means to obtain information from
Borrowers on a continuing basis concerning the financial condition of Borrowers
and their ability to perform their obligations under the Credit Documents, and
each Guarantor assumes the responsibility for being and keeping informed of the
financial condition of Borrowers and of all circumstances bearing upon the risk
of nonpayment of the Guarantied Obligations. Each Guarantor hereby waives and
relinquishes any duty on the part of Lender to disclose any matter, fact or
thing relating to the business,

11
<PAGE> 13
operations or conditions of Borrowers, or any of them, now known or hereafter
known by Agent or any Lender.

2.13 RIGHTS CUMULATIVE. The rights, powers and remedies given to
Lender by this Guaranty are cumulative and shall be in addition to and
independent of all rights, powers and remedies given to Lender by virtue of any
statute or rule of law or in any of the other Credit Documents or any agreement
between any Guarantor and Lender between Borrowers, or any of them, and Lender.
Any forbearance or failure to exercise, and any delay by Lender in exercising,
any right, power or remedy hereunder shall not impair any such right, power or
remedy or be construed to be a waiver thereof, nor shall it preclude the
further exercise of any such right, power or remedy.

2.14 BANKRUPTCY; POST-PETITION INTEREST; REINSTATEMENT OF GUARANTY.

(a) So long as any Guarantied Obligations remain
outstanding, no Guarantor shall, without the prior written consent of Lender in
accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement, commence or join with any
other Person in commencing any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency
proceedings of or against Borrowers, or any of them. The obligations of
Guarantors under this Guaranty shall not be reduced, limited, impaired,
discharged, deferred, suspended or terminated by any proceeding, voluntary or
involuntary, involving the bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership,
reorganization, liquidation or arrangement of Borrowers, or any of them, or by
any defense which Borrowers, or any of them, may have by reason of the order,
decree or decision of any court or administrative body resulting from any such
proceeding.

(b) Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that any
interest on any portion of the Guarantied Obligations which accrues after the
commencement of any proceeding referred to in clause (a) above (or, if interest
on any portion of the Guarantied Obligations ceases to accrue by operation of
law by reason of the commencement of said proceeding, such interest as would
have accrued on such portion of the Guarantied Obligations if said proceedings
had not been commenced) shall be included in the Guarantied Obligations because
it is the intention of Guarantors and Lender that the Guarantied Obligations
which are guarantied by Guarantors pursuant to this Guaranty should be
determined without regard to any rule of law or order which may relieve
Borrowers, or any of them, of any portion of such Guarantied Obligations.
Guarantors will permit any trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, debtor in
possession, assignee for the benefit of creditors or similar person to pay
Lender, or allow the claim of Lender in respect of, any such interest accruing
after the date on which such proceeding is commenced.

12
<PAGE> 14
(c) In the event that all or any portion of the
Guarantied Obligations are paid by any Borrower, the obligations of Guarantors
hereunder shall continue and remain in full force and effect or be reinstated,
as the case may be, in the event that all or any part of such payment(s) are
rescinded or recovered directly or indirectly from Lender as a preference,
fraudulent transfer or otherwise, and any such payments which are so rescinded
or recovered shall constitute Guarantied Obligations for all purposes under
this Guaranty.

2.15 SET OFF. In addition to any other rights Lender may have
under law or in equity, if any amount shall at any time be due and owing by any
Guarantor to Lender under this Guaranty, such Lender is authorized at any time
or from time to time, without notice (any such notice being hereby expressly
waived), to set off and to appropriate and to apply any and all indebtedness of
Lender owing to such Guarantor and any other property of such Guarantor held by
Lender to or for the credit or the account of such Guarantor against and on
account of the Guarantied Obligations and liabilities of such Guarantor to
Lender under this Guaranty.

SECTION 3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

Person including, without limitation, stockholders and creditors of such
Guarantor, and no license, permit, approval or authorization of, exemption by,
notice or report to, or registration, filing or declaration with, any

13
<PAGE> 15
moratorium or other similar laws or equitable principles relating to or
limiting creditors' rights generally.

3.2 NO LEGAL BAR TO THIS GUARANTY. The execution, delivery and
performance of this Guaranty and the documents or instruments required
hereunder, and the use of the proceeds of the borrowings under the Credit
Agreement, will not violate any provision of any existing law or regulation
binding on such Guarantor, or any order, judgment, award or decree of any
court, arbitrator or governmental authority binding on such Guarantor, or the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of such Guarantor or any securities
issued by such Guarantor, or any mortgage, indenture, lease, contract or other
agreement, instrument or undertaking to which such Guarantor is a party or by
which such Guarantor or any of its assets may be bound, the violation of which
would have a material adverse effect on the business, operations, assets or
financial condition of such Guarantor and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
and will not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on
any of its property, assets or revenues pursuant to the provisions of any such
mortgage, indenture, lease, contract or other agreement, instrument or
undertaking.

3.3 CERTAIN GUARANTOR REPRESENTATIONS. Each Guarantor represents
that (a) it is in its best interest and in pursuit of its corporate purposes as
an integral part of the business conducted and proposed to be conducted by SEGI
and its Subsidiaries (including such Guarantor), and reasonably necessary and
convenient in connection with the conduct of the business conducted and
proposed to be conducted by it, to induce the Lender to enter into the Credit
Agreement and to extend credit to each Borrower by making the Guaranties
contemplated by this Guaranty, (b) the credit available under the Credit
Agreement will directly or indirectly inure to its benefit, and (c) by virtue
of the foregoing it is receiving at least reasonably equivalent consideration
from the Lender for its Guaranty. Each Guarantor acknowledges that it has been
advised by Lender that the Lender is unwilling to enter into the Credit
Agreement unless the Guaranties contemplated by this Guaranty are given by it.
Each Guarantor represents that (i) it will not be rendered insolvent as a
result of entering into this Guaranty, (ii) after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Guaranty, it will have assets having a fair
saleable value in excess of the amount required to pay its probable liability
on its existing debts as they have become absolute and matured, (iii) it has,
and will have, access to adequate capital for the conduct of its business and
(iv) it has the ability to pay its debts from time to time incurred in
connection therewith as such debts mature.

GUARANTY MAY BE BROUGHT IN ANY STATE OR FEDERAL COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION
IN THE STATES OF NEW YORK, FLORIDA AND CALIFORNIA, AND BY EXECUTION AND

right of Lender to bring proceedings against any Guarantor in the courts of any
other jurisdiction.

4.9 NO OTHER WRITING. This writing is intended by Guarantors and
Lender as the final expression of this Guaranty and is also intended as a
complete and exclusive statement of the terms of their agreement with respect
to the matters covered hereby. No course of dealing, course of performance or

or modify any terms of this Guaranty. There are no conditions to the full

shall be as fully a party hereto as if such Guarantor were an original
signatory hereof. Each Guarantor expressly agrees that its obligations arising
hereunder shall not be affected or diminished by the addition or release of any
other Guarantor hereunder, nor by any election of Lender not to cause any
Subsidiary of SEGI to become an additional Guarantor hereunder. This Guaranty
shall be fully effective as to any Guarantor that is or becomes a party hereto

present wholly owned subsidiary of Guarantor or future wholly owned subsidiary
of Guarantor, within 30 days after any such Person becomes a Subsidiary, that
is not a Guarantor to join this Guaranty as a Guarantor pursuant to a joinder
agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Lender unless such
Subsidiary is a Subsidiary organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside
of the United States and under applicable foreign law; such Subsidiary is not
permitted to guarantee the Credit Obligations. Each Guarantor will, promptly
upon the request of Lender from time to time, execute, acknowledge and deliver,
and file and record, all such instruments, and take all such action, as Lender
deems necessary or advisable to carry out the intent and purposes of this
Section 4.11.

any other Guarantor) and receipt by Lender of written or telephonic
notification of such execution and authorization of delivery thereof.

favor of Bank of America National Trust and Savings
Association, as agent.

EXHIBIT 99.5
GUARANTY

This GUARANTY (this "Guaranty"), dated as of December 22,
1993, is made by SPELLING ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC., a Florida corporation (the
"Guarantor"), in favor of BANK OF AMERICA NATIONAL TRUST AND SAVINGS
ASSOCIATION as agent (the "Agent") for its benefit and for the ratable benefit
of the Banks party to the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.

WHEREAS, BLOCKBUSTER ENTERTAINMENT CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"), the Designated Subsidiaries of the Company, the
Banks and Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association as Agent, and
BA Securities, Inc., as Arranger have entered into an Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement dated as of the date hereof (such Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement, as it may hereafter be amended, restated, supplemented, or otherwise
modified from time to time, the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement"); and

WHEREAS, each Subsidiary is a subsidiary of the Company and is
engaged in related businesses and each of the Subsidiaries will derive direct
and indirect economic benefit from all of the Loans (as defined in the Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement) made to the Company;

WHEREAS, the Guarantor and the Company have agreed that
following the execution of this Guaranty, the Guarantor and the Company will
enter into a credit agreement (the "Intercompany Credit Agreement"), pursuant
to which the Company will make certain loans to the Guarantor from time to
time.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and in order
to induce the Banks to make Loans under the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement, the Guarantor hereby agrees for the benefit of the Agent and for the
ratable benefit of the Banks (all such beneficially interested parties being
hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as the "Secured Parties") as
follows:

1. Defined Terms. Unless otherwise defined herein,
terms defined in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement are used herein as
therein defined.

2. Guaranty. The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and
irrevocably, guarantees the prompt performance and payment in full by the
Company when due (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of
all the Company's obligations arising under, pursuant to or in connection with,
the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents (all
such obligations being hereinafter referred to as the "Obligations"), and the
Guarantor further agrees to pay all reasonable costs, fees and expenses
(including counsel fees, including the allocated cost of in-house counsel)
incurred by any Secured Party in enforcing any rights under this Guaranty;
provided, however, that the Guarantor shall be liable under this Guaranty only
for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without
rendering this Guaranty voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent
conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount; provided
further that in no event shall the

<PAGE> 3
Guarantor's liability under this Section 2 exceed the amount of the Guarantor's
obligations to the Company under the Intercompany Credit Agreement at the time
of enforcement hereof.

3. Guaranty Absolute.

(a) This Guaranty is an unconditional and absolute
guaranty of payment and of performance. It shall be enforceable against the
Guarantor, its successors and assigns, without the necessity of resorting to
any suit against any other party or exhausting any other security or
collateral. The Guarantor waives the right to have the Banks or the Agent
pursue any other remedy, enforce any other rights, and the right to receive
notice of non-payment, non-performance or non-observance, non-acceptance,
demand or any other notice or demand to which the Guarantor might otherwise be
entitled. The Guarantor guarantees that all amounts payable by the Company will
be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents, regardless of any law,
regulation or order, now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting
any of such terms or the rights of the Agent or the Banks with respect thereto.

(b) This Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and the
obligations of the Guarantor contained herein shall be primary obligations and
debts of the Guarantor. Accordingly, the Banks or the Agent shall not be
obliged before enforcing such obligations to make any demand of the Company, to
take any action or proceedings or obtain judgment in any court against the
Company or to make or file any proof of claim in a liquidation or insolvency of
the Company and the Guarantor hereby expressly waives presentment, acceptance,
demand for payment, protest and notice of dishonor.

(c) The Guarantor shall not be exonerated or
discharged from liability hereunder by any time or grace period given to the
Company or by any other indulgence or concession granted to the Company or by
any other dealing or thing including, without limitation, any circumstances
whatsoever affecting or preventing a recovery of amounts due under the Amended
and Restated Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents which, but for this
provision, might operate to exonerate or discharge the Guarantor from its
obligations hereunder.

(d) This Guaranty shall be a continuing guaranty, and
the obligations and liability of the Guarantor hereunder shall in no way be
affected, impaired, released, reduced or discharged by reason of the occurrence
of any of the following, although without further notice to or consent of the
Guarantor:

(i) the amendment, modification or supplement
(whether material or otherwise) of the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents;

(ii) the assertion of any of the rights or remedies
of the Banks or the Agent under the Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents;

2
<PAGE> 4
(iii) the failure, omission or delay on the part of
the Banks or the Agent to enforce, assert or exercise any
right, power or remedy conferred on or available to the Banks
or the Agent under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement
or the other Loan Documents;

(iv) any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
arrangement, assignment for the benefit of creditors,
receivership or trusteeship affecting the Company;

(v) any lack of validity or enforceability of the
Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the other Loan
Documents or any other agreement or instrument relating
thereto;

(vi) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any
collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or
consent to departure from any other guaranty, for all or any
of the Obligations; or

(vii) any other circumstances which might otherwise
constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the
Guarantor.

(e) This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or
be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time, any payment of any amounts
payable by the Company is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Agent
or any Bank upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of the Company or
otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.

(f) If an event permitting the acceleration of any of
the Obligations shall any time have occurred and be continuing and such
acceleration shall at such time be prevented by reason of the pendency against
the Company of a case or proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency law, the
Guarantor agrees that, for purposes of this Guaranty and its obligations
hereunder, the Obligations shall be deemed to have been accelerated and the
Guarantor shall forthwith pay such Obligations, and the other obligations
hereunder, without any further notice or demand, (including interest which but
for the filing of a petition in bankruptcy with respect to the Company, would
accrue on such Obligations).

4. Taxes and payments.

(a) Subject to the requirements of Section 3.01(g) of
the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, each payment to be made by the
Guarantor under this Guaranty or in connection herewith to any Person shall be
made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on account
of any tax, reserve, levy or duty of, or imposed by, any governmental or taxing
authority in any jurisdiction unless the Guarantor is required to make such a
payment subject to the deduction or withholding of such tax, in which case the
amount payable by the Guarantor in respect of which such deduction or
withholding is required to be made shall be increased to the extent necessary
to ensure that, after the making of such deduction or withholding (to the
extent provided in Section 3.01(d)(ii) the Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement), such other party receives and retains (free from any liability in
respect of any such deduction or withholding) a net amount equal to the amount
which it would have

3

<PAGE> 5
received and so retained had no such deduction or withholding been made or
required to be made.

(b) All payments made by the Guarantor shall be made
free and clear of and without any deduction for or on account of any set-off or
counterclaim or any other matter.

5. Waivers.

(a) The Guarantor expressly waives any and all rights
of subrogation, reimbursement and contribution, exoneration and indemnity
(contractual, statutory or otherwise), including without limitation, any claim
or right of subrogation under the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of the U.S. Code)
or any successor statute, arising from the existence or performance of this
Guaranty and the Guarantor irrevocably waives any right to enforce any remedy
which the Banks now have or may hereafter have against the Company, and waives
any benefit of, and any right to participate in, any security now or hereafter
held by the Banks. The provisions of this Section 5 shall survive the
termination of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and the payment in
full of the Obligations.

(b) The Guarantor hereby waives promptness,
diligence, notice of acceptance and any and all other notices with respect to
any of the Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that the Agent or
any Bank protect, secure, perfect or insure any security interest in or any
Lien on any property subject thereto or exhaust any right or take any action
against the Company, any other guarantor or any other obligor or any other
Person or any collateral or security or to any balance of any deposit accounts
or credit on the books of any Bank in favor of the Company or the guarantor.

6. Representations and Warranties. The Guarantor
represents and warrants to each Secured Party as follows:

(a) the Guarantor:

(i) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation;

(ii) has the power and authority and all material
governmental licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals
to own its assets, carry on its business and to execute,
deliver, and perform its obligations under, this Guaranty;

(iii) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation,
licensed and in good standing under the laws of each
jurisdiction where failure to qualify would have a Material
Adverse Effect; and

(iv) is in compliance in all material respects with 
all Requirements of Law.

(b) The execution, delivery and performance by the
Company of this Guaranty have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action, and do not and will not:

4

<PAGE> 6
(i) contravene the terms of any of the Guarantor's
Organization Documents;

(ii) conflict with or result in any breach or
contravention of, or the creation of any Lien under, any
document evidencing any Contractual Obligation to which the
Guarantor is a party or any order, injunction, writ or decree
of any Governmental Authority to which the Guarantor or its
Property is subject; or

(iii) violate any Requirement of Law.

(c) No approval, consent, exemption, authorization,
or other action by, or notice to, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is
necessary or required in connection with the execution, delivery or performance
by, or enforcement against, the Guarantor of this Guaranty.
