Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets ($ in thousands)

The following section amends, in its entirety, Item 2 of Form 8-K previously 
filed on June 3, 1994.

On January 4, 1994, Jordan Industries, Inc. ("The Company"), through its 
newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary, J2, Inc., bought substantially all of the 
net assets of Valmark Industries, Inc. ("Valmark"), a manufacturer of membrane 
switches, graphic panel overlays, labels, and bar codes.

The purchase price of $18,016, including costs incurred directly related to the 
transaction, was allocated to working capital of $2,105, property, plant and 
equipment of $1,358, non-compete agreements of $1,500, other assets of $58, and 
the assumption of a long-term capital lease obligation of $4 and resulted in an 
excess purchase price over net identifiable assets of $12,999. The acquisition 
was financed with the issuance of a $4,000 Subordinated Note to a former 
shareholder, and cash.

On May 20, 1994, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, J2, Inc., 
bought all of the common stock of Pamco Printed Tape and Label Co., Inc. 
("Pamco"), a manufacturer of printed labels.

The purchase price of $25,500, including costs incurred directly related to the 
transaction, was allocated to working capital of $2,237, property, plant and 
equipment of $2,690, non-compete agreements of $1,000, and the assumption of a 
mortgage note of $731 and resulted in an excess purchase price over net 
identifiable assets of $20,304. The acquisition was financed with the issuance 
of a $4,000 Subordinated Note to a former shareholder, and cash.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits

The following sections (a) and (b) amend, in their entirety, sections (a) and 
(b) of Item 7 of Form 8-K previously filed on June 3, 1994.

(a) Financial Statements

See Exhibits 28(a) - 28(b) of Item 7(c).

(b) Pro Forma Financial Information

The following unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated statements of 
operations are based on the historical statements of operations of the Company, 
adjusted to give effect to the following transactions: (a) the acquisitions 
in 1994 of Valmark Industries, Inc. ("Valmark"), and Pamco Printed Tape and 
Label Company, Inc. ("Pamco"), and (b) certain recurring administrative costs 
and taxes of the Company, and the depreciation of the preliminary purchase 
price allocated to the fair value of net assets acquired. The Valmark 
acquisition is described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the 
year ended December 31, 1993, filed March 30, 1994, and on Form 10-Q for the 
three months ended March 31, 1994, filed May 13, 1994. The pro forma condensed 
consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 1993 and 
for the three months ended March 31, 1994 were derived from the audited 
historical statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 1993 and 
the unaudited historical statement of operations for the three months ended 
March 31, 1994, adjusted to give effect to such transactions as if they 
occurred as of the beginning of each period.
</PAGE>

<PAGE>
The pro forma adjustments included in the pro forma condensed consolidated 
statements of operations are based upon available information and certain 
assumptions that management believes are reasonable. With respect to the pro 
forma acquisition adjustments described in the notes accompanying the pro forma 
condensed consolidated statement of operations, the allocation of the purchase 
price of Valmark and Pamco is preliminary and subject to final determination by 
the Company's management. The unaudited pro forma condensed consolidated 
statement of operations do not purport to represent what the Company's results 
of operations would actually have been had the transactions in fact occurred as 
of the beginning of each period presented. In addition, the unaudited pro 
forma condensed consolidated statements of operations do not purport to project 
the Company's results of operations for any future date or period.

The pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations should be read in 
connection with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements which 
are included in the Company's Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year 
ended December 31, 1993 and the Company's unaudited interim condensed 
consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Form 10-Q for the 
quarter ended March 31, 1994.

Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Valmark Industries, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Valmark Industries, Inc. as 
of December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the related statements of operations and 
retained earnings, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial 
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on 
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the financial position of Valmark Industries, Inc. at 
December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of its operations and its cash 
flows for the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles.

Notes to Financial Statements

December 31, 1993

1. The Company and its Significant Accounting Policies

Valmark Industries, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in California in 
April 1980. The Company manufactures and markets labels, panel overlays, 
membrane switches and shielding devices and markets these products primarily to 
electronics manufacturers in the United States. The Company performs periodic 
credit evaluations of its customers, maintains an allowance for doubtful 
accounts for potential credit losses and generally does not require collateral. 
One customer accounted for 21% and 24% of net sales for the years ended 
December 31, 1993 and 1992, and 13% and 10% of accounts receivable at December 
31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

On January 4, 1994, Jordan Industries, Inc., through a newly-formed wholly 
owned subsidiary, J2, Inc. purchased substantially all of the assets of the 
Company, and assumed certain liabilities of the Company for a purchase price of 
$18.0 million.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid short-term cash 
investments with original maturities of three months or less.

Inventories

Raw material inventory is valued at the lower of cost, determined on the 
first-in, first-out basis, or market. Finished goods inventory is valued at 
the lower of cost, determined under the retail method, or market.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is provided over the 
estimated useful lives of the respective assets, generally three to ten years, 
on a straight-line basis. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a 
straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or the life of the 
respective asset.

Income Taxes

The Company has elected to be treated as an S Corporation for federal income 
tax purposes. As a result of this election, income tax attributes of the 
Company are passed through to the shareholders.

Notes to Financial Statements
(continued)

1. The Company and its Significant Accounting Policies (continued)

Income Taxes (continued)

In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement 
("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (Standard). The Company 
adopted the provisions of the Standard effective January 1, 1993. Under SFAS 
No. 109, the liability method is used in accounting for income taxes. Under 
this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on 
differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect 
when the differences are expected to reverse. Because the Company has elected 
S Corporation status, the adoption of SFAS No. 109 had no impact on the 
Company's financial position or results of operations.

2. Bank Borrowings

Long-term debt at December 31, 1993 consists of two notes payable to a bank 
with principal and interest due in monthly installments. Interest is payable 
at the bank's reference rate plus 1% (effective rate of 7% at December 31, 
1993). Notes payable at December 31, 1993 mature as follows:

1994 $221,876
1995 221,876
1996 115,738
1997 23,266
-----------
$582,756
===========

The Company also has a revolving loan agreement with a bank that allows for 
borrowings of 80% of eligible accounts receivable (as defined) up to 
$1,500,000. Outstanding borrowings at December 31, 1993 and 1992 totalled 
$653,205 and $818,843, respectively. All borrowings under the revolving loan 
agreement, including any interest thereon, become due and payable June 15, 
1995. Advances under this agreement accrue interest at the bank's reference 
rate plus 1% (effective rate of 7% at December 31, 1993) and are secured by the 
accounts receivable of the Company. Additionally, the Company has an available 
$247,110 line of credit for equipment purchases through June 15, 1994. Under 
the terms of this equipment line, the Company must convert any outstanding 
balances to 48-month term loans at June 15, 1994 and 1995. All advances under 
the equipment line are secured by the equipment purchased and bear interest at 
the bank's reference rate plus 1%.

2. Bank Borrowings (continued)

All bank borrowings are secured by substantially all of the Company's assets 
and are guaranteed by the shareholders.

3. Commitments and Contingencies

The Company leases its office, manufacturing facility and certain equipment 
under operating leases that require the Company to pay operating costs, 
including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. Rent expense for 
operating leases was $431,800 and $304,837 for the years ended December 31, 
1993 and 1992, respectively.

The Company also has leased certain furniture and equipment under capital lease 
agreements. Future minimum rental payments under noncancellable operating 
leases of real property with initial terms in excess of one year and capital 
leases are due as follows:

4. Employee Benefit Plan

The Company has a defined contribution savings plan that qualifies under the 
provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees are 
eligible to participate upon completion of one full year of service and 
reaching 21 years of age. The Company contributes to the plan based on a 
percentage of the participating employee's earnings as determined by the Board 
of Directors, but not in excess of such amounts as may be deductible under the 
provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Company contributions of $65,000 and 
$22,000 were charged to operations for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 
1992, respectively.

Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors
Pamco Printed Tape & Label Co., Inc.

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Pamco Printed Tape & Label 
Co., Inc. as of December 31, 1993 and June 30, 1993 and 1992, and the related 
statements of income and retained earnings and cash flows for the six months 
ended December 31, 1993 and the years ended June 30, 1993 and 1992. These 
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on 
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to 
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in 
all material respects, the financial position of Pamco Printed Tape & Label 
Co., Inc. at December 31, 1993 and June 30, 1993 and 1992, and the results of 
its operations and its cash flows for the six months ended December 31, 1993 
and the years ended June 30, 1993 and 1992, in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles.

7. Income Taxes

The provisions for income taxes consist of the following:

Six months 
ended 
December 31 Year ended June 30
-------------------
1993 1993 1992
---------------------------------

Currently payable: 
Federal $115, 051 $1,896,385 $251,521
State 8,617 444,374 68,789
----------------------------------
123,668 2,340,759 320,310
Deferred - (1,483,000) 317,000
----------------------------------
$123,668 $ 857,759 $ 637,310
===================================

Effective July 1, 1993, the stockholders of the Company elected under 
Subchapter S of the Internal Revenue Code to include the Company's income in 
their own income for federal tax purposes. Accordingly, except for federal 
income taxes related to built-in gains tax of $115,051, the Company is not 
subject to federal income taxes. Therefore, the deferred tax asset of $85,000 
at June 30, 1993 was reversed into income tax expense for the year ended June 
30, 1993.

For the year ended June 30, 1993 and 1992, differences between income for 
financial reporting and income tax purposes, which give rise to deferred tax 
accounts, relate principally to an investment in a Limited Partnership, uniform 
capitalization rules for inventory, allowance for doubtful accounts, and 
depreciation.

8. Capital Stock

During the year ended June 30, 1993, the Board of Directors of the Company 
reorganized the capital structure of the Company to eliminate the preferred 
stock, eliminate its two classes of old common stock and authorize the Company 
to issue 1,000 new shares of no par value common stock. The Company entered 
into a plan of reorganization whereby the old preferred stock was exchanged for 
the new common stock, and each share of old Class A common stock which was 
issued and outstanding prior to the effective date of the reorganization was 
converted into one share of new common stock.
