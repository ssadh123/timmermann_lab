Item 5. Other Events.

In a Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 1994 filed on 
November 14, 1994, the Registrant disclosed that it had entered into a 
definitive agreement to sell the Varo Inc. and Baird Optical Systems 
operations of its Electro-Optical Systems business to a subsidiary of 
Texas Pacific Group for approximately $70 million in cash, subject to 
the fulfillment of various conditions, including receipt of certain 
government approvals and assurances. The agreement between the parties 
was filed as an exhibit thereto.

On December 19, 1994, the subsidiary of Texas Pacific Group terminated 
the agreement to acquire the Electro-Optical Systems business on the basis 
that assurances that the business would not be impacted after closing 
as a result of certain pending investigations had not been received
from various US government agencies by the contractually required date.

The Registrant intends to reopen discussions with other prospective 
buyers and expects to be successful in its plan to divest this business, 
and will therefore continue to account for this business as a 
discontinued operation in accordance with Accounting Principles Board 
Opinion No. 30.

The Registrant's press release announcing such information is filed 
herewith as an exhibit.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF IMO'S
ELECTRO-OPTICAL SYSTEMS TERMINATED

Lawrenceville, NJ, December 22, 1994 - Imo Industries Inc. (NYSE - IMD) 
announced today that Texas Pacific Group has terminated its proposed 
acquisition of Imo's Electro-Optical Systems business. Texas Pacific 
Group stated that assurances that it would not be impacted after 
closing, as a result of pending investigations related to the business, 
were not forthcoming from various US government agencies by the 
contractually required date. Imo stated that the investigations have 
previously been publicly disclosed, and are not expected to have a 
material impact on the business in the future.

Donald K. Farrar, chairman and CEO of Imo, stated, "While we regret 
Texas Pacific Group's decision to terminate our contract, we intend to 
reopen discussions with other prospective buyers and expect to be 
successful in our plan to divest this business."

Mr. Farrar further noted that this decision by Texas Pacific Group did 
not affect the Company's previously announced agreements to divest its 
Turbomachinery and Analytical Instruments businesses. Both transactions 
are expected to close early in the first quarter of 1995.
