FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
- - ---------------------

THE CIT GROUP REPORTS RECORD EARNINGS OF $51.0 MILLION IN 1994 SECOND QUARTER;
- - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9.4 PERCENT INCREASE OVER 1993 SECOND QUARTER;
----------------------------------------------

SIX MONTH NET INCOME OF $99.0 MILLION, ALSO A RECORD;
----------------------------------------------------

NEW YORK, NEW YORK, JULY 14, 1994 --- The CIT Group Holdings, Inc., one
of the nation's leading asset-based finance companies, today reported record
net income of $51.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 1994, an increase
of 9.4 percent from the $46.6 million reported for the second quarter of 1993. 
Net income for the first six months of 1994 was $99.0 million, also a record
and a 9.8 percent increase over the prior year. The record earnings were
principally due to improved fees and other revenue, coupled with increased net
interest revenue from higher financing and leasing assets in 1994. These
improvements benefited from the revenues of Barclays Commercial Corporation
(BCC) which was acquired on February 28, 1994.
"CIT's performance is a reflection of the generally expanding economy we
are experiencing," said Albert R. Gamper, Jr., CIT president and CEO. "This
strength is broad-based and hopefully will not be impacted by dampening tax or
monetary actions," he added.
"The recent upgrade of our senior debt rating by Duff & Phelps to AA- and
the announcement last week that Moody's is reviewing our A1 rating for
possible upgrade are tangible evidence that CIT's consistent growth and
earnings improvement is recognized in the marketplace," noted Gamper.
"On the lending side, we are now seeing aggressive practices relative to
rates and structure in the marketplace. We are concerned that this may be a
revival of practices characteristic of the '80s when lenders forgot the
concept of risk/reward," said Gamper.

OTHER HIGHLIGHTS:
- Financing and leasing assets totaled $14.5 billion, up 1.3 percent
from $14.3 billion at March 31, 1994 and 14.3 percent from $12.7
billion at June 30, 1993. The increase from last year includes the
acquisition of BCC and continued growth in most operating units.
- Net interest revenue rose to $193.2 million in the second quarter
of 1994, up 14.7 percent from $168.5 million in the second quarter
of 1993, reflecting the improved fee income and interest from the
higher levels of financing and leasing assets, offset in part by a
rise in short-term market interest rates during 1994.
- Operating expenses before the provision for credit losses totaled
$86.4 million, 2.58 percent of average financing and leasing
assets, versus $68.9 million, 2.24 percent of average financing and
leasing assets in the second quarter of 1993. The increases are
largely attributable to incremental expenses of the recently
acquired BCC factoring unit and the expanded Consumer Finance
operation.
- Net charge-offs for the second quarter of 1994 were $23.1 million,
0.67 percent of average finance receivables, compared to $22.2
million, 0.72 percent of average finance receivables for the second
quarter of 1993.
- Finance receivables past due 60 days or more declined to $187.8
million (1.36 percent of finance receivables) at June 30, 1994
from $198.2 million (1.46 percent of finance receivables) at
March 31, 1994 and $216.1 million (1.71 percent of finance
receivables) at December 31, 1993. Past due receivables
on nonaccrual status were $117.0 million (0.85 percent of finance
receivables) at June 30, 1994 up from $105.6 million (0.78 percent
of finance receivables) at March 31, 1994 but improved from
$139.9 million (1.11 percent of finance receivables) at year-end
1993.
- Assets received in the settlement of loans were $67.6 million at
June 30, 1994, compared to $79.5 million at March 31, 1994 and
$87.0 million at December 31, 1993.
