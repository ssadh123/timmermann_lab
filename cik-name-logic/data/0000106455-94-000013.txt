Westmoreland and its Lenders
Extend Debt Maturities

Philadelphia, PA --September 9, 1994 -- Westmoreland Coal 
Company (NYSE:WCX) today announced that lenders associated with 
Westmoreland's three principal credit facilities have agreed to 
extend maturity dates for the repayment of these facilities to 
November 1, 1994 in recognition of the previously announced sale 
of the assets of Kentucky Criterion Coal Company to CONSOL of 
Kentucky, Inc., a member of the CONSOL coal group. The 
agreement also provides for pre-payment from proceeds of any 
other asset sales.

The three principal credit facilities have an aggregate balance 
of $44,385,000 as of today. They are summarized as follows:

1. A Revolving Credit Agreement with a total commitment and
outstanding balance of $8,000,000.

2. 10% Senior Notes with an outstanding balance of $11,325,000.

3. The Reimbursement Obligation with an outstanding balance of 
$25,060,000 as a result of an original draw of $26,560,000
on June 9, 1994 under a letter of credit issued by a group
of banks in connection with Westmoreland's interest in the 
Dominion Terminal Associates coal export terminal.

It is anticipated that these credit facilities will be fully 
paid from the proceeds of the sale of the Kentucky Criterion 
assets for $85 million. This sale is expected to close prior to 
November 1, 1994.

Christopher K. Seglem, Westmoreland's President and Chief 
Executive Officer said "This achieves one of the principal goals 
we set in our effort to turn Westmoreland around. Negotiations 
with our lenders have been long and difficult but we are pleased 
that this agreement has not been reached. Resolving this issue 
of debt repayment with our principal lenders is a major step 
forward in the implementation of Westmoreland's repositioning 
and growth strategy to achieve meaningful and sustainable long 
term profitability."
