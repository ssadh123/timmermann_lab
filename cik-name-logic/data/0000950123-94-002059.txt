PRESS RELEASE

GREY ANNOUNCES NON-CASH, GOODWILL WRITE-OFF

New York, December 13, 1994 -- Grey Advertising Inc.
(NASDAQ NMS: Grey) today announced that it will be taking
a non-cash write-off almost entirely of goodwill
associated with past acquisitions. The amount of the
write-off is expected to be in the range of $35,000,000 to
$40,000,000 (or between $27.00 and $31.00 per share) on an
after-tax basis.

The company indicated that, as part of the continuing
review of the carrying value of its assets, it had
determined the write-off would be appropriate. The
company emphasized that this is entirely a non-cash charge
and the write-off relates almost exclusively to goodwill
associated with numerous international acquisitions
principally made in the 1980's.

As a result of the non-cash write-off, Grey will record a
substantial loss for the year. Absent the non-cash write-
off, Grey expects net income for 1994 to be at or about
its 1993 results. For the nine months ended September 30,
1994, Grey reported net income of $11,638,000 or $8.52 per
share.

Grey also announced that, for the 20th consecutive year,
it is increasing its annual dividend. The Board of
Directors increased the annual dividend payout from $3.25
to $3.50 per share. The increased rate will be effective
with the quarterly dividend ($.875 per share) payable on
December 29, 1994 to holders of record on December 22,
1994.

Edward H. Meyer, Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer of Grey, commented, "This charge relates to our
experience in coming out of the advertising recession in
Europe and other markets. The charge has no impact on our
cash resources or our cash flow. On an operating basis,
our international operations as a group are strong and are
a major contributor to the company's profits."
Grey is the eighth largest advertising agency in the world
with 231 offices in 106 cities in 52 countries.
