GFC FINANCIAL CORPORATION

ANNOUNCES INCREASES OF 25% IN 1993 FOURTH QUARTER

AND 19% IN YEAR TO DATE OPERATING EARNINGS PER SHARE

PHOENIX, Arizona, January 18, 1994 -- GFC Financial Corporation (NYSE:GFC)

today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31,

1993.

Income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 1993 was

$12.2 million ($0.60 per common and equivalent share) compared to $10.5

million ($0.48 per common and equivalent share) for the fourth quarter of

1992, a 16% increase in earnings from continuing operations and a 25%

increase in earnings per common and equivalent share. Excluding a one-time

$4.9 million third quarter adjustment for deferred taxes applicable to

leveraged leases, income from continuing operations for 1993 rose to $42.7

million ($2.04 per common and equivalent share) from $36.8 million ($1.71

per common and equivalent share) in 1992, a 16% increase in earnings from

continuing operations and a 19% increase in earnings per common and

equivalent share. The $4.9 million adjustment in 1993 represented the

effects of the recent increases in federal and state income tax rates as

they applied to deferred income taxes generated by the company's leveraged

lease portfolio. Income from continuing operations, including the

adjustment for deferred taxes, was $37.8 million ($1.80 per common and

equivalent share).

Net income for the fourth quarter of 1993 was $7.5 million ($0.37 per

common and equivalent share), down from $14.6 million ($0.68 per common and

equivalent share) for the fourth quarter of 1992. This reduction in

earnings is attributable to discontinued operations which reported a loss of

$4.7 million ($0.23 per common and equivalent share) for the fourth quarter

of 1993 compared to income of $4.1 million ($0.20 per common and equivalent

share) for the fourth quarter of 1992.

On July 16, 1993, the company announced the sale of Verex Corporation

("Verex"), its discontinued residential mortgage insurance unit to General

Electric Capital Mortgage Corporation ("GECMC"). The loss from discontinued

operations of $4.7 million includes $3.4 million of additional charges to

Verex's operations for 1993 and a $1.3 million loss on the sale of Verex

after accounting for all transaction costs and providing for additional

liabilities. Net income for 1993 was $37.3 million ($1.77 per common and

equivalent share) after the one-time $4.9 million ($0.24 per common and

equivalent share) adjustment for deferred income taxes. Excluding the $4.9

million deferred tax adjustment, net income for 1993 was $42.2 million

($2.01 per common and equivalent share) compared to $49.0 million ($2.31 per

common and equivalent share) in 1992. The primary reason for the lower

earnings in 1993 is the loss of $0.5 million ($0.03 per common and

equivalent share) reported from discontinued operations in 1993 compared to

income of $12.2 million ($0.60 per common and equivalent share) in 1992.

The $0.5 million loss for the year consists of $0.8 million of income from

operations and the loss of $1.3 million on the sale of Verex.

Sam Eichenfield, GFC Financial Corporation Chairman, said that "1993

was an outstanding year for the company because its core finance operations

had a record year, both in terms of earnings, even after the one-time charge

for taxes, and in new business volume, which reached $1 billion.

Additionally, funds employed grew by 17% with margins and the quality of

assets continuing to meet or exceed expectations." Nonaccruing assets,

including Europe, declined as a percentage of funds employed to 3.6% at year

end 1993 from 4.1% at year end 1992.

Eichenfield went on to say that he was pleased with the significant

goals that the company achieved in 1993. "We helped build the foundation

for the future by the successful sale of Verex, along with the acquisition

of the Asset Based Finance operations, the start up of the Consumer

Rediscount business and the pending purchase of Ambassador Factors. With

these endeavors, the company is positioned to expand its financial service

operations into three new niche-businesses."

As previously announced on November 29, 1993, GFC Financial Corporation

and Fleet Financial Group, Inc. announced an agreement in principle for GFC

to acquire Fleet Financial's factoring and asset-based lending subsidiary,

Fleet Factors Corp., operating under the trade name Ambassador Factors.

Interest earned from financing transactions, increased to $64.6 million

for the fourth quarter of 1993 from $59.6 million for the fourth quarter of

1992 and to $248.7 million for the year 1993 from $240.8 million in 1992.

These increases primarily were driven by the growth in funds employed,

partially offset by the runoff of high yielding assets in the European

portfolio and the effects of foreign exchange gains and other items recorded

in 1992.

Interest margins earned increased by 23% to $33.6 million for the

fourth quarter of 1993 from $27.3 million for the fourth quarter of 1992 and

by 19% to $124.8 million for 1993 from $104.7 million in 1992. These

margins were helped significantly by more favorable debt costs in 1993 when

compared to 1992 (approximately a 1.0% reduction in the aggregate cost of

debt). Also contributing to the improved margins were the growth of the

portfolio and higher prepayment fees.

Provisions for possible credit losses were lower in 1993 primarily due

to lower write-offs. Reserve coverage (reserves for possible credit losses

divided by nonaccruing assets) still remains strong at approximately 63% of

nonaccruing assets and five times 1993 write-offs of $12.6 million.

Also contributing to the improved results were higher gains on sale of

assets in 1993, both for the fourth quarter and the year, primarily due to

the amount and type of assets sold.

Selling, administrative and other operating expenses were higher by

15%, both for the quarter and year ended December 31, 1993, due to the

addition of the Asset Based Finance operations (purchased in February 1993),

expenses previously charged to discontinued operations and legal expenses

incurred in connection with certain problem accounts.

Income taxes, excluding the $4.9 million adjustment, were higher in

1993 and more in the range of an ongoing effective tax rate for the company,

both for the fourth quarter and the year. In the fourth quarter of 1992

income taxes were reduced by $3.1 million representing tax adjustments

related to the refinancing of the company's debt (when it was spun-off from

The Dial Corp in March 1992).

Earnings per common and equivalent share for the fourth quarter and

year ended December 31, 1993 were aided by a reduction in dividends on

preferred stock as a result of the acquisition of Greyhound Financial

Corporation's preferred stock by GFC Financial Corporation on July 30, 1993.

GFC Financial Corporation is a major domestic commercial finance

company that provides secured financing of selected commercial and real

estate activities.
