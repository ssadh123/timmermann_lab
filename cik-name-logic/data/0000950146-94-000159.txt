CORNING UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION 

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information (the "Unaudited Pro 
Forma Information") is presented to reflect the estimated impact on Corning's 
Financial Statements of the Corning Transactions as follows: 

* The acquisition of Nichols Institute ("Nichols") for 7.5 million Corning 
Common Shares and options to purchase approximately 1.1 million Corning 
Common Shares. The acquisition will be accounted for as a pooling of 
interests. 

* The acquisition of Damon Corporation ("Damon") in August 1993, at a total 
purchase price of approximately $405 million, including acquisition expenses. 
The transaction has been accounted for as a purchase. 

* The acquisition of Costar Corporation ("Costar") in September 1993, the 
transaction with Unilab Corporation ("Unilab") in November 1993, and other 
acquisitions completed in 1993 (collectively, the "Other 1993 Transactions") 
which individually and in the aggregate are not significant. The Costar 
merger and the Unilab transaction are described in Notes 4 and 5, 
respectively. 

* The acquisition of the optical-fiber and optical-cable businesses of 
Northern Telecom Limited ("NTL") by Corning and Siecor Corporation ("Siecor") 
for $131 million in February 1994, the Vitro, S.A. ("Vitro") transaction 
completed in January 1994 and the merger with Maryland Medical Laboratory, 
Inc. ("Maryland Medical") for 4.5 million Corning Common Shares in June 1994 
(collectively, the "Completed 1994 Acquisitions"). The NTL transaction has 
been accounted for as a purchase and the Maryland Medical transaction will be 
accounted for as a pooling of interests. The Vitro transaction is described 
in Note 6. 

The NTL and Vitro transactions were financed by the issuance of 8.0 million 
Corning Common Shares in February 1994. 

* The issuance (the "MIPS Offering") by Corning Delaware L.P. ("Corning 
Delaware") of $373.8 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible 
Monthly Income Preferred Securities (the "Preferred Securities") completed in 
July 1994 and the expected use of the net proceeds thereof by Corning to 
retire the indebtedness incurred in connection with the Damon transaction. 

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of Income for the year ended 
January 2, 1994, and the twenty- four weeks ended June 19, 1994, assume that 
the Corning Transactions had been completed on January 4, 1993. The Unaudited 
Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet at June 19, 1994, assumes that the Corning 
Transactions had been completed by that date. Corning's consolidated 
financial statements for periods prior to the pooling of interests 
transactions will not be restated since the acquisitions are not material to 
Corning's financial position or results of operations. 

The Unaudited Pro Forma Information gives effect only to the adjustments set 
forth in the accompanying notes and does not reflect any synergies 
anticipated by Corning's management as a result of these acquisitions. The 
Unaudited Pro Forma Information is not necessarily indicative of the results 
of operations or financial position which would have been achieved had the 
Corning Transactions been completed as of the beginning of the earliest 
period presented, nor is it necessarily indicative of Corning's future 
results of operations or financial position. 

Corning has completed or has pending several business dispositions in 1994 
which individually and in the aggregate are not significant to Corning's 
consolidated financial statements. As such, pro forma data on these 
transactions are not presented. 

The Unaudited Pro Forma Information should be read in conjunction with the 
historical financial statements of Corning and Damon. Damon's historical 
financial statements are included in Corning's Current Reports in Form 8-K 
dated August 4, 1993 and August 13, 1993.

CORNING 
Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Information 

Note 1.--Basis of Presentation: 

The Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of Income reflect Corning's 
results of operations for the year ended January 2, 1994, and the twenty-four 
weeks ended June 19, 1994, on a pro forma basis assuming the Corning 
Transactions had been completed as of January 4, 1993. The Unaudited Pro 
Forma Combined Balance Sheet at June 19, 1994, assumes that the Corning 
Transactions had been completed by that date. 

Corning's management believes that the assumptions used in preparing the 
Unaudited Pro Forma Information provide a reasonable basis for presenting all 
of the significant effects of the Corning Transactions, that the pro forma 
adjustments give appropriate effect to those assumptions and that the pro 
forma adjustments are properly applied in the Unaudited Pro Forma 
Information. 

Note 2.--Pro Forma Adjustments: 

Statement of Income 

(a) The pro forma adjustment to cost of sales represents the increase in 
amortization of the excess of cost over fair value of tangible net assets 
acquired in the Damon transaction, the Other 1993 Transactions and the 
Completed 1994 Acquisitions of $6.5 million, $1.8 million, and $6.0 million, 
respectively, for the year ended January 2, 1994, and $1.3 million for the 
Completed 1994 Acquisitions for the twenty-four weeks ended June 19, 1994. 

The excess of cost over fair value of tangible net assets acquired in the 
Damon transaction is $603 million. The excess of cost over fair value of 
tangible net assets acquired has been allocated to goodwill with a life of 
forty years. Management believes that fair value approximates book value for 
all tangible assets acquired in the Damon transaction. 

Goodwill totaling $258 million and $190 million resulted from the Other 1993 
Transactions and the Completed 1994 Acquisitions, respectively, and is being 
amortized over 25 to 40 years. 

(b) The pro forma adjustment represents the elimination of one-time 
restructuring costs of $40.6 million related to closing MetPath facilities as 
a result of the integration of Damon and MetPath and $7.9 million of Costar 
transaction costs recorded in Corning's results for the year ended January 2, 
1994. 

(c) The pro forma adjustment to interest expense represents the interest on 
the debt incurred in connection with the Damon transaction and the Other 1993 
Transactions of $11.9 million and $2.3 million, respectively, for the year 
ended January 2, 1994. The weighted average interest rate on the debt 
incurred in connection with the Damon transaction is 4.9% and on the Other 
1993 Transactions ranges from 3.5% to 6.7%. 

Corning financed the Damon acquisition and the refinancing of approximately 
$167 million of indebtedness of Damon under short-term financing agreements 
entered into with certain banks to effect this transaction. During the third 
quarter of 1993, Corning refinanced a portion of this short-term financing by 
issuing approximately $200 million of longer-term debt. During the fourth 
quarter of 1993, Corning extended the terms of the financing agreements to 
December 31, 1995. The pro forma adjustment to interest expense related to 
the Damon transaction is calculated as the weighted average of short-term and 
longer-term interest rates. 

(d) The pro forma adjustment to interest expense reflects the decrease in 
interest expense assuming the issuance by Corning Delaware on January 4, 
1993, of $373.8 million of Preferred Securities pursuant to the MIPS Offering 
(net of an estimated $8.4 million of underwriting commissions and expenses), 
and the expected use of the net proceeds thereof by Corning to retire the 
indebtedness incurred in connection with the Damon transaction. 

(e) The pro forma adjustment represents the elimination of approximately $1 
million of one-time costs incurred by Damon in connection with a terminated 
merger agreement with National Health Laboratories Incorporated which were 
charged to results of operations for the seven months ended July 31, 1993. 

(f) The pro forma adjustment to tax expense represents the tax effect of the 
adjustments detailed in notes (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) above. In addition, 
tax expense has been adjusted to provide taxes on the income of one of the 
Completed 1994 Acquisitions which was previously a Subchapter S corporation. 
These adjustments are calculated at Corning's historical effective tax rate. 

(g) The pro forma adjustment to minority interest represents the applicable 
minority interest on the historical earnings and pro forma adjustments of the 
Other 1993 Transactions and the Completed 1994 Acquisitions. 

(h) The pro forma adjustment to dividends on convertible preferred 
securities of subsidiary represents the after-tax dividends payable on the 
$373.8 million of Preferred Securities pursuant to the MIPS Offering. 

8

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

(i) The pro forma adjustment to weighted average shares outstanding 
represents the issuance of 5.5 million shares to complete the Costar 
acquisition in September 1993, 12.5 million shares in conjunction with the 
Completed 1994 Acquisitions and 7.5 million shares issued in conjunction with 
the Nichols transaction. 

Balance Sheet 

(j) The pro forma adjustment to loans payable beyond one year and preferred 
securities of subsidiaries assumes the issuance on June 19, 1994, of $373.8 
million of Preferred Securities pursuant to the MIPS Offering (net of an 
estimated $8.4 million of underwriting commissions and expenses), and the 
expected use of the net proceeds thereof by Corning to retire the 
indebtedness incurred in connection with the Damon transaction. 

Note 3.--Earnings Per Share: 

Earnings per common share are computed by dividing net income less preferred 
dividends on Corning's Series B Preferred Stock by the weighted average of 
common shares outstanding during each period. Preferred dividends amounted to 
$2.1 million and $1.0 million during the year ended January 2, 1994, and the 
twenty-four weeks ended June 19, 1994, respectively. 

Note 4.--Costar Merger: 

In September 1993, Corning acquired all of the outstanding shares of common 
stock and options to purchase common stock of Costar for approximately 5.5 
million Corning Common Shares and options to purchase approximately 300,000 
Corning Common Shares. This acquisition has been accounted for as a pooling 
of interests. Corning's consolidated financial statements for periods prior 
to the acquisition have not been restated since the acquisition is not 
material to Corning's financial position or results of operations. 

Note 5.--Unilab Transaction: 

Corning, through a wholly owned subsidiary, owned 43% of Unilab. In November 
1993, Corning acquired 100 percent of certain Unilab facilities in exchange 
for a majority of the Unilab shares owned by Corning, the assumption of 
approximately $70 million of Unilab debt and Corning's investment in J.S. 
Pathology PLC ("J.S. Pathology"). Corning retained a 12% equity investment in 
Unilab. 

Note 6.--Vitro Transaction: 

On January 2, 1992, Corning entered into an alliance with Vitro, by 
transferring 49% of its consumer- housewares businesses to Vitro, in exchange 
for 49% of Vitro's consumer-products businesses and approximately $137 
million in cash. The alliance consisted of two jointly owned companies. 
Corning owned 51% of Corning Vitro Corporation ("Corning Vitro") and 
consolidated its financial statements and 49% of Vitro Corning, S.A. de C.V. 
("Vitro Corning") and accounted for its investment under the equity method. 

In December 1993, Vitro and Corning reached an agreement whereby, in two 
separate transactions, Vitro purchased in December 1993, the shares of 
capital stock of Vitro Corning owned by Corning and Corning purchased in 
February 1994 the shares of capital stock of Corning Vitro held by Vitro. The 
net cost to Corning of the two transactions was $131 million. Corning and 
Vitro are continuing their consumer products alliance through cross- 
distribution and supply agreements.
