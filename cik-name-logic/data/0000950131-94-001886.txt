2/FCB FORMS TRUE NORTH COMMUNICATIONS INC.

"The revolution in multinational business and technology demands a new structure
designed to better anticipate and meet our clients' changing communications 
needs in the new global communications environment they now face," Mr. Mason 
said. "True North's architecture will enable us to capitalize on the staggering 
opportunities new technologies are providing to compete in today's rapidly 
evolving business arena. We believe this new structure will improve not only our
creativity, but also the speed with which we can service our clients' needs 
anywhere in the world."

A NEW CORPORATE ARCHITECTURE
- ----------------------------

True North Communications Inc.'s architecture includes the formation of three 
new major corporate subsidiaries:

TN Technologies Inc.
- --------------------

True North Communications Inc. and R/GA Media Group have established a new 
strategic joint venture in digital and interactive technologies called TN 
Technologies Inc.

R/GA Media Group is a new independent unit of R/GA Digital Studios, the 
high-tech, leading edge multimedia production company, established by Robert M. 
Greenberg in 1977. He serves as Chairman and CEO of the studios, with offices on
both coasts.

TN Technologies Inc. will use state of the art digital technology to design and 
produce all forms of communications: television, radio, print, outdoor, 
promotion and point of sale advertising. It will have offices in New York and 
Los Angeles.

This proprietary digital technology soon will link the FCB network allowing the 
simultaneous creation of fully-integrated communications campaigns, including 
on-line, real-time video production, from multiple locations around the globe.

3/FCB FORMS TRUE NORTH COMMUNICATIONS INC.

A separate unit, TN Technologies Interactive, will focus on creating new 
interactive communications platforms and entertainment programming.

Mr. Greenberg is an acknowledged leader and innovator in digital design and 
production, including special effects, computer generated imagery, 2D and 3D 
animation. His company was the first to pioneer the creative integration of 
film, video and computer-imaging technologies, and is currently leading the race
to bring the capabilities of the digital studio to the desktop computer. R/GA is
best known for its special visual effects for the advertising community and 
Hollywood. It has worked with every major studio and ad agency.

Mr. Mason said, "Digital technology, in the skilled hands of Bob Greenberg, 
will blunt the barriers of time, distance and redundant production. It will 
allow our clients immediate access to the best talent around the globe and 
enhance the resources and responsiveness of our entire organization in serving 
all our clients."

TN Media Inc.
- -------------

True North Communications Inc. is launching a global network of media buying 
operations under the banner of TN Media Inc. This new subsidiary will be 
comprised of all existing media buying services of the Company around the world.

As TN Media Inc. is rolled out, it will serve regions that account for 80% of 
the world's advertising billings, to become one of the largest independent 
forces in global media buying.

Mr. Mason said, "TN Media Inc. is designed to maximize our clients' control over
media investments, on a global as well as local basis. It will provide our 
clients with formidable buying power that is second to none."

4/FCB FORMS TRUE NORTH COMMUNICATIONS INC.

TN Services Inc.
- ----------------

True North Communications Inc. has made a significant capital investment to 
establish a worldwide agency support service company. TN Services Inc. will 
provide and manage a comprehensive array of operational services for all the 
Company's agency brands, leveraging proprietary applied IS technologies and 
rapid communications links.

This subsidiary will be the first truly global back shop operation, handling all
financial transactions including bill paying, payroll, accounts receivable, 
collections; all human resources tasks from insurance to employee stock purchase
plans and other operational support in the areas of legal services, travel and 
real estate.

Mr. Mason said, "Effective global back shop management will free up local agency
management from these specialties so they can devote their full energy and 
creativity to our most important endeavor--growing our clients' business."

*****

"With True North, we know where we're going and why," Mr. Mason said. "We have 
intentionally avoided hype about the information highway or hyperbole about the 
interactive age. We ask that our clients and our shareholders judge us today and
into the future by performance, not promises, an unchanging standard that has 
served us well for over 120 years."

True North Communications Inc. will rank as the 7th largest global 
communications company, with operations in 56 countries, and billings totaling 
$7 billion. The Company's agency brands include Foote, Cone & Belding; 
Publicis-FCB, its European joint venture; Mojo; Borders Perrin & Norrander, as 
well as many other related communications companies.
