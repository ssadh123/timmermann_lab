SALOMON INC REPORTS A QUARTERLY NET LOSS OF $204
MILLION

New York, July 21, 1994 - As previously indicated, Salomon Inc today 
announced a net loss of $204 million, or $2.08 per share, for the 1994 
second quarter. Salomon Inc reported net income of $433 million in the 
comparable 1993 quarter, or $3.32 per share on a fully diluted basis. 
The Company's net loss for the six months ended June 30, 1994 was 
$138 million, or $1.54 per share, compared with net income of 
$331 million, or $2.52 per share (fully diluted), in the 1993 six-month 
period.

Salomon Brothers, the Company's global investment banking and securities 
business, reported a $410 million pretax loss for the quarter, largely 
attributable to a pretax loss of $291 million for Client-Driven Businesses. 
Proprietary Trading Businesses reported a pretax loss of $119 million. In 
the 1993 second quarter, Salomon Brothers earned $783 million before taxes, 
including pretax earnings of $383 million for Client-Driven Businesses and 
$400 million for Proprietary Trading Businesses.

The poor second quarter results for Salomon Brothers' Client-Driven 
Businesses reflect the impact of inventory losses and declines in customer 
trading volume and underwriting activity. As a market intermediary, 
Salomon Brothers' Client-Driven Businesses maintain securities inventories 
both to facilitate client-related market making activities and, in some 
cases, to express short-term views about changes in price and volatility. 
During the second quarter, liquidity and prices of certain products, 
particularly fixed income products, declined significantly, contributing to 
inventory losses.

The second quarter pretax loss of $119 million for Salomon Brothers' 
Proprietary Trading Businesses followed strong first quarter earnings of 
$212 million before taxes. Earnings volatility is not unusual for these 
businesses and, therefore, results are better evaluated over longer term 
periods of at least one year. For the four quarters ended June 30, 1994, 
Proprietary Trading Businesses' pretax profits were $428 million.

The Phibro Division, which is the Company's commodities trading business, 
had pretax earnings of $82 million in the 1994 second quarter compared 
with earnings of $3 million in the 1993 second quarter. Trading results 
were again very strong as the Division continued to take advantage of 
opportunities created by the volatility in oil prices. For the six months 
ended June 30, 1994, the Division earned $132 million before taxes compared 
with $9 million in the comparable 1993 period.

Phibro USA, the Company's oil refining business, incurred a second 
quarter pretax loss of $10 million compared with a $2 million loss in the 
1993 second quarter. In the most recent quarter, prices 
for refined products did not rise in line with higher crude oil prices. 
Consequently, spreads tightened significantly, particularly as compared 
with the first quarter when margins benefited from strong weather-related 
demand for refined products. Despite the second quarter loss, Phibro
USA generated pretax earnings of $17 million for the six months ended 
June 30, 1994, compared with a $15 million pretax loss in the comparable 
1993 period.

Total assets, excluding collateralized short-term financing agreements, 
were $117 billion at June 30, 1994 compared with $123 billion at the end 
of the first quarter and $136 billion at year end 1993. As a result of the
second quarter loss, book value per common share declined from $38.23 at 
March 31 to $35.51 at June 30, 1994. The Company's common share repurchases 
were modest in the second quarter. Approximately 300,000 shares were 
repurchased at an aggregate cost of approximately $15 million, or $48.94 
per share. Shares authorized for additional repurchase by the Company's 
Board of Directors totaled 9.8 million at June 30, 1994.

Selected financial information and the unaudited consolidated statement of 
income follow.
