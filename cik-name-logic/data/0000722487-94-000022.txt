* Included in the third quarter financials is a one-time adjustment for 
key-man life insurance proceeds of $20 million. This adjustment increased 
"other" revenue by $20 million. The $20 million revenue effect is offset
through the establishment of a $10 million litigation expense reserve, and
a contribution of $10 million to the Comdisco Foundation. The $10 million 
foundation contribution is included in selling, general and administrative
expenses and the litigation expense reserve is a separate line item 
(litigation charge) on the income statement.
