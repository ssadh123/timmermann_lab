ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.
- ----------------------

Description of Terms of Proposed Agreement with
TCBankshares, Inc. On December 2, 1994, Mercantile
Bancorporation Inc., a Missouri corporation ("MBI"), and
TCBankshares, Inc., an Arkansas corporation ("TCB"), executed an
Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the "Merger Agreement"),
whereby TCB will be merged with and into a wholly owned
subsidiary of MBI to be incorporated under the laws of the State
of Arkansas.

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the holders of
TCB common stock, $50.00 par value ("TCB Common Stock"), will
receive an aggregate of 4,750,000 shares of MBI common stock,
$5.00 par value ("MBI Common Stock"), the holders of TCB Series A
preferred stock, $10.00 par value, will receive an aggregate of
5,306 shares of MBI Series B-1 preferred stock, no par value, and
the holders of TCB Series B preferred stock, $10.00 par value,
will receive an aggregate of 9,500 shares of MBI Series B-2
preferred stock, no par value.

Consummation of the Merger is subject to certain
conditions, including: (i) receipt of requisite approval of the
shareholders of TCB of the Merger Agreement as required under
Arkansas law and the charter documents of TCB; (ii) receipt of
the approval of the Federal Reserve Board and various other
federal and state regulatory authorities; (iii) registration of
the shares of MBI Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the
Merger under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and all
applicable state securities laws; (iv) receipt of an opinion of
counsel that the Merger will qualify as a tax-free reorganization
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and (v)
satisfaction of certain other closing conditions. Each of the
shareholders of the TCB Common Stock and the shareholders
of the TCB Preferred Stock have executed an agreement with
MBI whereby each such shareholder has agreed to vote all shares
of TCB Common Stock and TCB Preferred Stock owned by him in favor
of the approval of the Merger Agreement.

TCB is a multi-bank holding company located in North
Little Rock, Arkansas and owns all or substantially all of the
outstanding capital stock of six banks situated throughout north,
central and eastern Arkansas. At September 30, 1994, TCB
reported approximately $1.4 billion in consolidated total assets.

Agreement, please refer to the exhibits to this Current Report on

Report of Independent Auditors

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
TCBankshares, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
TCBankshares, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and
1992, and the related consolidated statements of income,
shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 1993. These financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of TCBankshares, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31,
1993 and 1992, and the consolidated results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1993 in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 1993

1. Accounting Policies

Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
TCBankshares, Inc. and its six majority-owned banking subsidiaries
(the "Company"). All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Investment Securities

Investment securities are stated at cost adjusted for amortization
of premiums and accretion of discounts. The adjusted cost of the
specific security sold is used to compute gain or loss on the sale
of investment securities.

Management determines the appropriate classification of investment
securities at the time of purchase. Management has the intent and
the Company has the ability to hold investment securities to
maturity or on a long-term basis. As such, these securities are
carried at amortized historical costs. If securities are acquired
with the intent of holding for an indefinite period or for sale
prior to maturity, the securities would be carried at the lower of
cost or market. (See "Future Application of Accounting Standards"
later in Note 1.)

Revenue Recognition

Interest on loans is accrued and credited to operations generally
based upon the principal amount outstanding. Interest on loans is
not accrued when amounts are considered doubtful of collection. If
the ultimate collectibility of principal is in doubt, any payment
received on a loan, on which the accrual of interest has been
suspended, is applied to reduce principal to the extent necessary
to eliminate such doubt. When interest accruals are discontinued,
interest credited to income on the loan in the current year is
reversed, and interest accrued in the prior year is charged to the
allowance for loan losses.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level management
believes is adequate to absorb potential losses in the loan
portfolio. Management's determination of the adequacy of the
allowance is based on an evaluation of potential losses in the
loan portfolio considering current economic conditions, past loan
loss experience, volume, growth and composition of the loan
portfolio, nonperforming loans, and other relevant factors. The
allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses charged
against income and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

1. Accounting Policies (continued)

Premises and Equipment

The Company's premises and equipment are stated at cost, less
accumulated depreciation and amortization. The provision for
depreciation and amortization is computed generally by the
straight-line method based upon the estimated useful lives of the
assets. The carrying amount of assets sold, retired or disposed of
and the related accumulated depreciation and amortization are
eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is
recorded in operating results.

First Mortgage Real Estate Loans Held for Resale

First mortgage real estate loans held for resale ($10,741,693 at
December 31, 1993 and $5,511,716 at December 31, 1992) are
classified with real estate mortgage loans in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet and are carried at the lower of cost or
fair market value on a net aggregate basis. These loans are
generally pre-sold or subject to firm purchase commitments.

Other Real Estate

Other real estate consists of properties acquired through
foreclosure proceedings or acceptance of a deed in lieu of
foreclosure. These properties are initially recorded at the lower
of cost or estimated fair market value based on appraised value at
the date acquired or transferred from loans less estimated selling
expenses. Losses arising from the acquisition of such property are
charged against the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent
valuation adjustments, if any, and gains or losses resulting from
sales are recorded in operating results.

The Company's state banking subsidiary is required to amortize
other real estate over sixty months, in accordance with state
banking regulations. The regulators may grant deferrals of this
required amortization, if requested by the Company. Net expenses
relating to other real estate (included in other expenses) were
$101,000, $211,000, and $249,000 during the years ended December
31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. These amounts include the
state regulators mandated amortization expense. Loans aggregating
approximately $(184,000), $643,000, and $5,131,000 were
transferred to (from) other real estate during 1993, 1992, and
1991, respectively.

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets consist of the unamortized excess cost of
purchased banking subsidiaries and premiums paid for the
acquisition of deposits from failed financial institutions.
Unamortized costs of purchased subsidiaries in excess of the fair
value of underlying net tangible assets acquired are being
amortized over 25 years using the straight-line method. Premiums
associated with the future earnings potential of acquired deposits
are being amortized, using the straight-line method, over the
estimated five to ten year life of the deposits. The net costs
associated with acquired deposits were $763,000 at December 31,
1993, $856,000 at December 31, 1992 and $81,500 at December 31,
1991.

Income Taxes

The Company and its subsidiaries file consolidated income tax
returns. It is the Company's practice to have its subsidiaries pay
to or receive from the Company and other affiliates amounts based
on the taxable income (or loss) of the subsidiary. Certain items,
primarily additions to the allowance for loan losses, are
recognized as income or expense in different periods for financial
and for income tax reporting purposes. Deferred taxes are provided
for such timing differences.

In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." The Company
adopted the provisions of the new standard in its consolidated
financial statements as of January 1, 1993. As permitted by the
Statement, prior year financial statements have not been restated
to reflect the change in accounting method. The effect as of
January 1, 1993 of adopting Statement 109 increased consolidated
net income by approximately $126,000. This amount is included as a
reduction of the provision for income taxes in the 1993
consolidated statement of income.

Under Statement 109, the liability method is used in accounting
for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on differences between financial
reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured
using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when
the differences are expected to reverse. Prior to the adoption of
Statement 109, income tax expense was determined using the
deferred method. Deferred tax expense was based on items of income
and expense that were reported in different years in the financial
statements and tax returns and were measured at the tax rate in
effect in the year the difference originated.

Statement of Cash Flows

Cash equivalents include amounts due from banks and federal funds
sold. Generally, federal funds are purchased and sold for one day
periods.

Future Application of Accounting Standards

In May 1993 the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB")
issued Statement on Financial Accounting Standard No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities". Statement 115 will be adopted by the Company on
January 1, 1994 and requires that investments in debt and equity
securities be classified as held to maturity, trading, or
available for sale. Investments in debt securities classified as
held to maturity are to be reported at amortized cost. Investments
in debt and equity securities classified as trading are to be
reported at fair value with related unrealized gains and losses
included in net income. Investments in debt and equity securities
classified as available for sale are to be reported at fair value
with related unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings
and reported as a separate component of shareholders' equity.
Management plans to classify its municipal securities as
investments held to maturity and the majority of the remainder of
its investment securities as available for sale. At December 31,
1993, adoption of Statement 115 would have increased shareholders'
equity by approximately $5,666,000 and have no impact on the
Companys net income for 1993.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 112,
"Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" requires
employers to recognize the obligation to provide postemployment
benefits if the obligation is attributable to employees services
already rendered, employees' rights to those benefits accumulate
or vest, payment of the benefits is probable, and the amount of
benefits can be reasonably estimated. The Company will be required
to adopt Statement 112 in 1994. The Company's initial assessment
is that the adoption of this new standard will not have a material
impact on its financial position or results of operations.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting
by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan" requires that impaired
loans that are within the scope of the Statement be measured based
on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at
the loan's effective rate, or, as a practical expedient, at the
loan's observable market price or the fair value of the collateral
if the loan is collateral dependent. The Company will be required
to adopt Statement 114 in 1995. Management does not believe the
adoption of this new standard will have a material impact on the
Company's financial position or results of operations.

Reclassifications

Certain amounts in the 1991 and 1992 consolidated financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the reporting
format used for the 1993 consolidated financial statements.

2. Mergers and Acquisitions

On January 30, 1992, the Board of Directors of the Company
approved a plan of exchange with Twin City Bank whereby the
Company issued common and preferred stock in exchange for 267,395
shares of common stock and all of the preferred stock of Twin City
Bank based on an exchange ratio which valued the common stock of
the Company at 1.1 times book value per share and which valued
Twin City Bank's common stock at 1.09 times book value per share
on the date of exchange. As a result, Twin City Bank became a 99%-
owned subsidiary of TCBankshares, Inc.

The plan of exchange provided that Twin City Bank's outstanding
perpetual, nonvoting, 8.5% cumulative preferred stock be exchanged
for shares of perpetual, nonvoting, 8.5% cumulative preferred
stock of TCBankshares, Inc., with dividends and terms of
preference similar to the Twin City Bank's preferred stock
previously held. The plan of exchange was approved by the Federal
Reserve Bank of St. Louis and other appropriate regulatory
agencies and was accounted for as a pooling-of-interests. Twin
City Bank's financial statements are included in the consolidated
financial statements for all periods presented.

In March 1992, the Company was the successful bidder on
approximately $142 million of deposit accounts, previously held by
Home Federal Savings and Loan, in a liquidation sale conducted by
the Resolution Trust Corporation. The Company paid a deposit
premium of approximately $925,000, which will be amortized over 5
to 10 years. In conjunction with the purchase of the deposit
accounts, Twin City Bank paid a $2,500,000 special dividend of
which $2,475,880 was paid to the Company to enable the Company to
make an initial capital contribution to a newly chartered national
bank, The Community Bank of Batesville, Arkansas (Batesville).
Batesville was formed to purchase certain assets and assume
certain liabilities from the Resolution Trust Corporation in
connection with the Company's successful bid to acquire the
Batesville Branch of the former Home Federal Savings and Loan.

The Company maintains an allowance for permanent declines in value
on obligations of state and political subdivisions and the SLMA
preferred stock. The allowance was $90,000 and $2,240,000 at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. During 1992 and 1991,
provisions for permanent declines in value of $567,643 and
$955,837, respectively, were recorded and included in net
securities gains and losses. No such provisions were made in 1993.

Proceeds from sales of investments in debt securities during 1993,
1992 and 1991 were $4,779,402, $105,529,913 and $107,786,441,
respectively. Gross gains of $1,382,963, $3,178,678 and $1,640,375
and gross losses of $(3,561), $(544,827) and $(1,072,824) in 1993,
1992 and 1991, respectively, were realized on those sales.

Investment securities with a book value of approximately
$240,235,000 and $223,241,000 were pledged to secure public
deposits and for other purposes as required by law, at December
31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

======================================
</TABLE>

Maturities of long-term debt are $5,459,500 in 1994 and $2,035,000
in 1995.

The loan agreements for both notes include, among other things,
provisions relative to additional borrowings, maintenance of
capital, and restrictions on the payment of cash dividends, which
are no more restrictive than those required by the bank regulators
(see Note 12). The amortizing revolving line of credit increased
to $8 million effective January 1, 1993 making $5,710,500
available to the Company at December 31, 1993.

Capital Notes are unsecured obligations which bear interest at
9.5% and are payable serially through June 30, 1995. Principal
payments are $17,500 in 1994 with the remaining balance of
$140,000 payable in 1995.

8. Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes includes income taxes applicable
to investment securities gains of $541,139 in 1993, $1,008,502 in
1992, and $210,696 in 1991.

The Company made income tax payments of approximately $5,208,000,
$4,474,000, and $1,921,000 during 1993, 1992, and 1991,
respectively.

9. Commitments

At December 31, 1993 future minimum payments under noncancelable
operating leases for branch or office locations with initial or
remaining terms of one year or more are $978,551, $954,941,
$904,859, $707,990, and $398,276 for l994 through 1998,
respectively, and $1,454,661 thereafter. Net rental expense for
all operating leases amounted to $1,031,538 in 1993, $735,780 in
1992 and $652,577 in 1991. The lease

<PAGE> 23

TCBankshares, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

9. Commitments (continued)

agreements contain options to renew at various dates for periods
ranging from five to twenty-one years. Eight of the locations,
with future minimum lease payments totaling approximately
$2,537,000, are leased from officers and/or directors of the
Company.

At December 31, 1993, future minimum payments due under
noncancelable data processing agreements are approximately
$1,392,000, $1,479,000, $1,553,000, $1,630,000, and $1,712,000
for 1994 through 1998, respectively. Additional amounts may be
due based on the number of transactions processed by the servicer
and annual payments may increase by up to 5% based on the
Consumer Price Index.

In the normal course of business there are various commitments
outstanding, such as guarantees and commitments to extend credit,
including standby letters of credit to assure performance or to
support debt obligations, and loans sold subject to repurchase
agreements, which are not reflected in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements. These arrangements have credit
risk essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to
customers.

<TABLE>
The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the other party to financial instruments for
commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and
loans sold subject to repurchase agreements is represented by the
contractual amount of those instruments. The Company uses the
same credit policies in making commitments and conditional
obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.
Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit
risk were as follows:

<CAPTION>
December 31
1993 1992
--------------------------------------
<S> <C> <C>
Commitments to extend credit $89,714,114 $66,278,842
Standby letters of credit 5,064,195 3,204,951
Loans sold subject to repurchase agreement 21,721,000 15,201,000
</TABLE>

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer
as long as there is no violation of any condition established in
the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or
other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since
some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn
upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent
future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customers
credit-worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The

<PAGE> 24

TCBankshares, Inc.

9. Commitments (continued)

amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by the Company
upon extension of credit is based on management's credit
evaluation of the counter-party. Collateral held varies but may
include real estate, accounts receivable, inventory, property,
plant and equipment, and income-producing commercial properties.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by
the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third
party. Those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and
private borrowing arrangements and similar transactions.

In 1993, the Company sold approximately $30,000,000 of loans to
third parties subject to repurchase agreements. These agreements
generally require the Company to repurchase loans that do not meet
the standards of the related sale agreements or that become 90
days delinquent within a stated period of time (90 to 365 days)
after being sold to the permanent investor. At December 31, 1993,
the Company did not hold any loans which it had been required to
repurchase.

10. Concentration of Credit Risk

Most of the Company's lending activity is with customers located
within the state of Arkansas. The loan portfolio is diversified
with no industry comprising greater than 10% of total loans. The
Company's subsidiary banks require collateral on most loans and
generally maintain loan to value ratios of no greater than 80%.

11. Transactions with Related Parties

The Company's bank subsidiaries have had, and expect to have in
the future, banking transactions in the ordinary course of
business with officers and directors of the Company and its
subsidiaries. Such transactions have been on similar terms,
including interest rates and collateral on loans, as those
prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with others,
and have involved no more than normal risk or other potential
unfavorable aspects. Loans made to such borrowers (including
companies in which they are principal owners) amounted to
approximately $15,171,000 at December 31, 1993 and $18,455,000 at
December 31, 1992.

12. Dividend Restrictions

The Company has five national bank subsidiaries and one state bank
subsidiary. National and state banking regulations place certain
restrictions on the ability of banks to pay dividends without
regulatory approvals. The approval of the Comptroller of the
Currency is required for national banks to pay dividends in excess
of earnings retained in the

<PAGE> 25

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

12. Dividend Restrictions (continued)

current year plus retained net profits for the preceding two
years. State-chartered banks may pay dividends up to 50% of
current year net income without obtaining regulatory approval.

13. Supplemental Cash Flow Information

The Company paid $33,458,989, $36,825,378, and $43,561,498 in
interest on deposits and other borrowings during 1993, 1992, and
1991, respectively.

14. Pension Plan

The Company provides a defined benefit pension plan which covers substantially
all employees of the Company meeting certain age and length of service
requirements. The benefits are based on years of service and the employee's
average compensation during the last five years of employment. The Company's
funding policy is to contribute annually the maximum that can be deducted
for federal income tax purposes. Contributions are intended to provide not
only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected
to be earned in the future.

<TABLE>
The following table sets forth the plan's funded status:

</TABLE>

In 1993, the Company approved a defined contribution 401(k) plan
which covers all eligible employees who attain the age of eighteen
and are employed by the Company. The Company's policy is to match
employee contributions up to three percent of each participant's
annual compensation. Plan contribution expense for the year ended
December 31, 1993 was approximately $138,000.

15. Restrictions on Cash and Due from Banks

The Company is required to maintain reserve balances with the
Federal Reserve Bank. The average amount of those reserve balances
was approximately $10,764,000 in 1993 and $9,443,500 in 1992.

16. Fair Values of Financial Instruments

FASB Statement No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial
Instruments," requires disclosure of fair value information about
financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance
sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. In
cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values
are based on estimates using

<PAGE> 27

TCBankshares, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

16. Fair Values of Financial Instruments (continued)

present value, discounted cash flows, or other valuation
techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the
assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of
future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value
estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent
markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate
settlement of the instrument. Statement 107 excludes certain
financial instruments and all nonfinancial instruments from its
disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value
amounts presented do not represent the underlying value to the
Company.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in
estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:

Cash and cash equivalents: The carrying amounts reported in the
balance sheet for cash and short-term instruments approximate the
fair values of these assets.

Investment securities (including mortgage-backed securities): Fair
values of investment securities are primarily based on quoted
market prices (see Note 3).

Loans receivable: For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently
and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values
approximate carrying amounts. The fair values for construction and
mortgage real estate, installment and commercial, financial and
agricultural loans, with fixed rates, are estimated using
discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently
being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar
credit quality.

<TABLE>
The carrying amount and estimated fair value of loans net of the
allowance for loan losses consisted of the following:

<CAPTION>
Carrying Estimated Fair
Amount Value
---------------------------------------
<S> <C> <C>
December 31, 1993 $554,074,813 $553,575,000
December 31, 1992 456,052,990 458,414,000
</TABLE>

Deposit liabilities: The fair values for demand deposits (e.g.,
interest and noninterest checking, passbook savings, and certain
types of money market accounts), are, by definition, equal to the
amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their
carrying amounts). The carrying amounts for variable-rate, fixed
term money market

<PAGE> 28

TCBankshares, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)

16. Fair Values of Financial Instruments (continued)

accounts approximate their fair values at the reporting date. Fair
values for fixed rate certificates of deposit are estimated using
a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates
currently being offered to a schedule of aggregated expected
monthly maturities of certificates of deposit.

<TABLE>
For deposits with no defined maturities, fair value is the amount
payable on demand. The carrying amounts reported in the balance
sheet for demand deposits, money market and passbook savings
accounts approximate their fair values. The carrying amount and
estimated fair value of certificates of deposit consisted of the
following:

<CAPTION>
Carrying Estimated Fair
Amount Value
---------------------------------------
<S> <C> <C>
December 31, 1993 $629,222,210 $630,984,000
December 31, 1992 567,488,907 568,723,000
</TABLE>

Short-term borrowings: The carrying amounts of federal funds
purchased, borrowings under repurchase agreements, and other
short-term borrowings approximate their fair values.

Off-balance sheet financial instruments: The Company has two types
of off-balance sheet financial instruments--commitments to extend
credit and standby letters of credit. These types of credit are
made at market rates; therefore, there would be no market risk
associated with these credits which would create a significant
fair value liability for the Company.

transmittal that Buyer shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to such holders. Such letters of transmittal
shall specify that risk of loss and title to Certificates
shall pass only upon delivery of such Certificates to Buyer.

(b) Subject to Section 1.09, after the Effective
Time, each previous holder of a Certificate that surrenders
such Certificate to the Buyer will, upon acceptance thereof
by Buyer be entitled to a certificate or certificates rep-
resenting the number of full shares of Buyer Common Stock or
Buyer New Preferred Stock, as appropriate, into which the
Certificate so surrendered shall have been converted
pursuant to this Agreement and any distribution theretofore
declared and not yet paid with respect to such shares of
Buyer Common

Stock or Buyer New Preferred Stock, as appropriate, without
interest.

ance with such reasonable terms and conditions as Buyer may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance
with customary exchange practices. Certificates shall be
appropriately endorsed or accompanied by such instruments of
transfer as Buyer may require.

(d) Each outstanding Certificate shall until duly
surrendered to Buyer be deemed to evidence ownership of the
consideration into which the stock previously represented by
such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement.

(e) After the Effective Time, holders of Certif-
icates shall cease to have rights with respect to the stock
previously represented by such Certificates, and their sole
rights shall be to exchange such Certificates for the con-
sideration provided for in this Agreement. After the Ef-
fective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the
records of Seller of Certificates, and if such Certificates
are presented to Seller for transfer, they shall be
cancelled against delivery of the consideration provided
therefor in this Agreement. Buyer shall not be obligated to
deliver the consideration to which any former holder of
Seller Common

-8-
<PAGE> 10
Stock or Seller Preferred Stock is entitled as a result of
the Merger until such holder surrenders the Certificates as
provided herein. No dividends declared will be remitted to
any person entitled to receive Buyer Common Stock or Buyer
New Preferred Stock under this Agreement until such person
surrenders the Certificate representing the right to receive
such Buyer Common Stock and Buyer New Preferred Stock, at
which time such dividends shall be remitted to such person,
without interest and less any taxes that may have been
imposed thereon. Certificates surrendered for exchange
shall not be exchanged until Buyer has received a written
agreement from such person in the form attached as Exhibit
B. No party to this Agreement nor any affiliate thereof
shall be liable to any holder of stock represented by any
Certificate for any consideration paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws. Buyer shall be entitled to rely upon the
stock transfer books of Seller to establish the identity of
those persons entitled to receive consideration specified in
this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with respect
thereto. In the event of a dispute with respect to
ownership of stock represented by any Certificate, Buyer
shall be entitled to deposit any consideration represented
thereby in escrow with an independent third party and
thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims thereto.

<PAGE> 11
1.09. No Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any
--------------------
other provision of this Agreement, neither certificates nor
scrip for fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock shall be
issued in the Merger. Each holder who otherwise would have
been entitled to a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock
shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an
amount determined by multiplying the fractional share in-
terest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled by
the Closing Price per share of Buyer Common Stock on the
last business day preceding the Effective Time. With
respect to a share of stock, "Closing Price" shall mean:
the closing price as reported on the Consolidated Tape (as
reported in The Wall Street Journal or in the absence
-----------------------
thereof, by any other authoritative source). No such holder
shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other
rights in respect of any fractional share.

1.10. Anti-Dilution Adjustments. If prior to the
-------------------------
Effective Time Buyer shall declare a stock dividend or make
distributions upon or subdivide, split up, reclassify or
combine Buyer Common Stock or declare a dividend or make a
distribution on Buyer Common Stock in any security convert-
ible into Buyer Common Stock, appropriate adjustment or ad-
justments will be made to the Exchange Ratio.

------------------------------------------
Buyer may at any time change the method of effecting the ac-
quisition of Seller or Seller's Subsidiaries by Buyer
(including without limitation the provisions of this Article
I) if and to the extent it deems such change to be desirable,
including without limitation to provide for a merger of Seller
directly into Buyer, in which Buyer is the surviving
corporation, provided, however, that no such change shall (A)
-------- -------
alter or change the amount or kind of consideration to be is-
sued to holders of Seller Common Stock and Seller Preferred
Stock as provided for in this Agreement (the "Merger Consid-
eration"), (B) adversely affect, in the reasonable opinion of
Seller, the tax treatment to Seller shareholders as a result
of receiving the Merger Consideration, (C) materially impede
or delay receipt of any approval referred to in Section
6.01(b), (D) conflict with any other provision of this
Agreement, or (E) impede or prevent satisfaction of any
condition set forth in Article VI.

--------------------------
corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Arkansas is duly
qualified to do business and is in good standing in all ju-

and has corporate power and authority to own its properties
and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Seller is registered as a bank holding company
with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(the "Board") under the Holding Company Act. True and com-

------------
among other things, a complete and correct list of all of
Seller's Subsidiaries (each a "Seller Subsidiary" and col-
lectively the "Seller Subsidiaries"), all outstanding Equity
Securities of each of which, except as set forth on Schedule
2.02, are owned directly or indirectly by Seller. "Equity

-12-

to subscribe to, calls or commitments of any character
whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible

arrangements by which such issuer is or may become bound to
issue additional shares of its capital stock or other Equity
Securities of such issuer, or options, warrants, scrip or
rights to purchase, acquire, subscribe to, calls on or com-
mitments for any shares of its capital stock or other Equity
Securities. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.02, all of
the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Seller
Subsidiaries are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable, and those shares owned by Seller are owned
free and clear of any lien, claim, charge, option,

incorporated or organized, validly existing, and in good
standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation
or organization, and has corporate power and authority to

Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business in each ju-
risdiction where its ownership or

-13-
<PAGE> 15
leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires
it so to be qualified, except where the failure to so
qualify would not have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition, results of operations or business
(collectively, the "Condition") of Seller and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Except as set forth on
Schedule 2.02, Seller does not own beneficially, directly or
indirectly, any shares of any class of Equity Securities or

trust, association or similar organization. All of the
Banks are national banking associations chartered by the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, except for The
Twin City Bank which is a state banking association
chartered under the laws of the State of Arkansas. The
deposits of each of the Banks are insured by the Bank
Insurance Fund ("BIF") or, to the extent transferred to a
Bank by the Resolution Trust Corporation, by the Savings
Association Insurance Fund, of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (the "FDIC"). Each of the Banks (other than The
Twin City Bank) is a member in good standing of the Federal

holder of Seller. Seller maintains no dividend reinvestment
or similar plan.

Agreement, nor the consummation by Seller of the

required by, or result in a right of termination or
acceleration of, or result in the creation of, any Lien upon
any of the material properties or assets of Seller or any
Seller Subsidiary under any of the terms, conditions or

tion or bylaws or (y) any material note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, deed of trust, license, lease, agreement or other

sidiary is a party or by which it may be bound, or to which

three-year period

-17-
<PAGE> 19
ended December 31, 1993, together with the notes thereto,
audited by Ernst & Young LLP, Seller's independent
accountants ("Seller Auditors"), as previously provided to
Buyer, and the unaudited consolidated condensed balance
sheets of Seller and its Subsidiaries as of March
31, June 30, and September 30, 1994, and the related
unaudited consolidated condensed statements of income for
the periods then ended as previously provided to Buyer
(collectively, the "Seller Financial Statements"), have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved ("GAAP") (except that the interim statements do not
include statements of cash flows or notes), present fairly
the consolidated financial position of Seller and its
Subsidiaries at the dates and the consolidated results of
operations, cash flows and changes in shareholders' equity
of Seller and its Subsidiaries for the periods stated
therein and are derived from the books and records of Seller
and its Subsidiaries, which are complete and accurate in all
material respects and have been maintained in all material
respects in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
Except as set forth on Schedule 2.05, neither Seller nor any
of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities of any nature
(whether or not required to be disclosed or accrued under
SFAS No. 5) other than (i) those which have arisen in the
ordinary course since the date of the latest

-18-
<PAGE> 20
financial statements described above, (ii) those which are
reflected in the financial statements described above and
(iii) those that individually do not amount to more than
$750,000.

2.06. Seller Reports. Since January 1, 1991, each
--------------
of Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries has filed all material
reports, registrations and statements, together with any
required material amendments thereto, that it was required
to file with (i) the Board, (ii) the FDIC, (iii) the State
Bank Regulators, and (iv) any other federal, state,
municipal, local or foreign government, securities, banking,
savings and loan, insurance and other governmental or
regulatory authority and the agencies and staffs thereof
(the entities in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iv)
together with the SEC, being referred to herein collectively
as the "Regulatory Authorities" and individually as a
"Regulatory Authority"). All such reports and statements
filed with any such Regulatory Authority are collectively
referred to herein as the "Seller Reports." As of its
respective date, each Seller Report complied in all material
respects with all the rules and regulations promulgated by
the applicable Regulatory Authority and did not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements

-19-
<PAGE> 21
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading.

2.07. Properties and Leases. Except as may be
---------------------
reflected in the Seller Financial Statements, except for any
Lien for current taxes not yet delinquent and except with
respect to assets classified as real estate owned, Seller
and its Subsidiaries have good title free and clear of any
material Lien to all the real and personal property
reflected in Seller's consolidated balance sheet as of
September 30, 1994 and, in each case, all real and personal
property acquired since such date, except such real and
personal property as has been disposed of in the ordinary
course of business. All leases material to Seller or any
Seller Subsidiary pursuant to which Seller or any Seller
Subsidiary, as lessee, leases real or personal property, are
valid and effective in accordance with their respective
terms, and there is not, under any of such leases, any
material existing default by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary
or any event which, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute such a material default. Substantially all
of Seller's and Seller Subsidiaries' buildings, structures
and equipment in regular use have been well maintained and
are in substantially good and serviceable condition, normal
wear and tear excepted.

-20-
<PAGE> 22
2.08. Taxes. Except as previously disclosed to
-----
Buyer, Seller and each Seller Subsidiary have timely filed
or will timely (including extensions) file all material tax
returns required to be filed at or prior to the Closing Date
("Seller Returns"). Each of Seller and its Subsidiaries has
paid, or set up adequate reserves on the Seller Financial
Statements for the payment of, all taxes required to be paid
in respect of the periods covered by such returns and has
set up adequate reserves on the most recent financial
statements Seller has provided to Buyer for the payment of
all taxes anticipated to be payable in respect of all
periods up to and including the latest period covered by
such financial statements. Except as previously disclosed
in writing to Buyer, neither Seller nor any Seller Sub-
sidiary will have any liability material to the Condition of
Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, for
any such taxes in excess of the amounts so paid or reserves
so established and no material deficiencies for any tax, as-
sessment or governmental charge have been proposed, asserted
or assessed (tentatively or definitely) against any of
Seller or any Seller Subsidiary which would not be covered
by existing reserves. Neither Seller nor any Seller
Subsidiary is materially delinquent in the payment of any
material tax, assessment or governmental charge, nor, except
as previously disclosed, has it requested any extension of
time within which to file any tax returns in

-21-
<PAGE> 23
respect of any fiscal year which have not since been filed
and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any tax
are pending. The federal and state income tax returns of
Seller and the Seller Subsidiaries have been audited and
settled by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") or
appropriate state tax authorities for all periods ended
through December 31, 1986. Except as previously disclosed
in writing to Buyer, there is no deficiency or refund
litigation or matter in controversy with respect to Seller
Returns. Except as previously disclosed in writing to
Buyer, neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has extended
or waived any statute of limitations on the assessment of
any tax due that is currently in effect.

2.09. Material Adverse Change. Since September 30,
-----------------------
1994, there has been no material adverse change in the Con-
dition of Seller and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
except as may have resulted or may result from changes to
laws and regulations or changes in economic conditions
applicable to banking institutions generally or in general
levels of interest rates that affect Seller and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, consistent with the manner
in which changes in the general levels of interest rates
since December 31, 1993 have affected Seller and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

on its business (other than as may be required by
law or any applicable Regulatory Authority); or

(v) any lease with annual rental payments
aggregating $250,000 or more;

except in case for those documents that are identified on

violation of its charter documents or bylaws or in default
under any material agreement, commitment, arrangement,
lease, insurance policy, or other instrument, whether
entered into in the ordinary course of business or otherwise
and whether written or oral, and there has not occurred any
event that, with the lapse of time or giving of notice or
both, would constitute such a default, except, in all cases,
where such default would not have a material adverse effect
on the Condition of Seller and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, except as set forth on Schedule
2.11, there are no actions, suits, or proceedings pending
or, to the best knowledge of Seller, threatened against
Seller or any Seller Subsidiary or any of their respective
officers or directors by any shareholder of Seller or any

lease their properties and assets and to carry on their
business as presently conducted and that are material to the
business of Seller and its Subsidiaries; all such permits,
licenses, certificates of authority, orders and approvals
are in full force and effect and, to the best knowledge of
Seller, no suspension or cancellation of any of them is
threatened; and all such filings, applications and regis-
trations are current.

(b) Except for failures to comply or defaults
which individually or in the aggregate would not have a
material adverse effect on the Condition of Seller and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i) each of Seller and its
Subsidiaries has complied with all laws, regulations and
orders (including without limitation zoning ordinances,
building codes, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and securities, tax, envi-
ronmental, civil rights, and occupational health and safety

statements pertaining to the conduct of a banking, deposit-
taking, lending or related business, or to the exercise of
trust powers) and governing instruments applicable to them
and to the conduct of their business, and (ii) neither
Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary is in default under, and no
event has occurred which, with the lapse of time or notice
or both, could result in the default under, the terms of any
judgment, order, writ, decree, permit, or license of any
Regulatory Authority or court, whether federal, state,
municipal, or local and whether at law or in equity. Except
for liabilities which individually or in the aggregate
reasonably could not be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Condition of Seller and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary
is subject to or reasonably likely to incur a liability as a
result of its ownership, operation, or use of any Property
(as defined below) of Seller (whether directly or, to the

Seller Subsidiary) (A) that is contaminated by or contains
any hazardous waste, toxic substance, or related materials,

including without limitation property under foreclosure,
property held by such person or any Subsidiary of such
person in its capacity as a trustee and property in which
any venture capital or similar unit of such person or any
Subsidiary of such person has an interest. No claim,
action, suit, or proceeding is pending against Seller or any
Seller Subsidiary relating to Property of Seller before any
court or other Regulatory Authority or arbitration tribunal
relating to hazardous substances, pollution, or the
environment, and there is no outstanding judgment, order,
writ, injunction, decree, or award against or affecting
Seller or any Seller Subsidiary with respect to
the same. Except for statutory or regulatory restrictions
of general application, no Regulatory Authority has placed
any restriction on the business of Seller or any Seller
Subsidiary which reasonably could be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Condition of Seller and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(c) From and after January 1, 1991, neither
Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has received any
notification or communication which has not been resolved
from any Regulatory Authority (i) asserting that any Seller
or any Subsidiary of

-28-
<PAGE> 30
Seller, is not in substantial compliance with any of the
statutes, regulations or ordinances that such Regulatory
Authority enforces, except with respect to matters which (A)
are set forth on Schedule 2.13C or in any writing previously
furnished to Buyer and (B) reasonably could not be expected
to have a material adverse effect on the Condition of Seller
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (ii) threatening to
revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental
authorization that is material to the Condition of Seller
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including without
limitation such company's status as an insured depositary
institution under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or
(iii) requiring or threatening to require Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries, or indicating that Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries may be required, to enter into a cease and desist
order, agreement or memorandum of understanding or any other
agreement restricting or limiting or purporting to direct,
restrict or limit in any manner the operations of Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries, including without limitation any restriction
on the payment of dividends. No such cease and desist
order, agreement or memorandum of understanding or other
agreement is currently in effect.

(d) Neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary is
required by Section 32 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act
to give prior notice to any federal banking agency of the

-29-
<PAGE> 31
proposed addition of an individual to its board of directors
or the employment of an individual as a senior executive
officer.

2.14. Labor. No work stoppage involving Seller or
-----
any Seller Subsidiary, is pending or, to the best knowledge
of Seller, threatened. Neither Seller nor any Seller Sub-
sidiary is involved in, or, to the best knowledge of Seller,
threatened with or affected by, any labor dispute, arbitra-
tion, lawsuit or administrative proceeding which reasonably
could be expected to have a material adverse affect on the
Condition of Seller and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
Employees of neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary, are
represented by any labor union or any collective bargaining
organization.

Except as set forth on Schedule 2.15A, to the best knowledge
of Seller, no officer or director of Seller or any
Subsidiary of Seller, or any "associate" (as such term is
defined in Rule l4a-1 under the Exchange Act) of any such
officer or director, has any material interest in any
material contract or property (real or personal, tangible or
intangible), used in, or pertaining to the business of,
Seller or any Subsidiary of Seller, which would be required
to be disclosed

-30-
<PAGE> 32
by Item 404 of Regulation S-K if such company had a class of
securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act.

(b) Set forth on Schedule 2.15B is a list of all

("Insider Loans"). All outstanding Insider Loans from
Seller or any Seller Subsidiary were approved by or reported
to the appropriate board of directors in accordance with
applicable law and regulations.

2.16. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses; Non-
-----------------------------------------
performing Assets. (a) The allowances for loan and lease
- ------------------
losses contained in the Seller Financial Statements were
established in accordance with the past practices and expe-
riences of Seller and its Subsidiaries, and the allowance
for loan losses shown on the consolidated condensed balance
sheet of Seller and its Subsidiaries dated September 30,
1994 is adequate in all material respects under the
requirements of GAAP to provide for possible losses on loans
(including without limitation accrued interest receivable)
and credit commitments (including without limitation stand-
by letters of credit) outstanding as of the date of such
balance sheet.

-31-

Assets (as defined below) on the books of Seller and its
Subsidiaries does not exceed $6,000,000. "Nonperforming
Assets" shall mean (i) all loans (A) that are contractually
past due 90 days or more in the payment of principal and/or
interest, (B) that are on nonaccrual status, (C) where a
reasonable doubt exists, in the reasonable judgment of Seller,
as to the timely future collectibility of principal and/or in-
terest, whether or not interest is still accruing or the loan
is less than 90 days past due, (D) where the interest rate
terms have been reduced and/or the maturity dates have been
extended subsequent to the agreement under which the loan was
originally created due to concerns regarding the borrower's
ability to pay in accordance with such initial terms, or (E)
where a specific reserve allocation exists in connection
therewith, and (ii) all assets classified as real estate
acquired through foreclosure or repossession and other assets
acquired through foreclosure or repossession.

2.17. Employee Benefit Plans. (a) There are no
----------------------
existing stock option, stock purchase, stock ownership or
stock appreciation right plans or arrangements maintained by
or contributed to by Seller or any Seller Subsidiary.
Except as set forth in Schedule 2.17A, neither Seller nor
any Seller Subsidiary is a party to any existing employment,
management,

-32-
<PAGE> 34
consulting, deferred compensation, change-in-control or other
similar contract. Schedule 2.17A lists all pension, retirement,
supplemental retirement, savings, profit sharing, deferred
compensation, consulting, bonus, medical, disability, workers'
compensation, vacation, group insurance, severance and other
material employee benefit, incentive and welfare policies,
contracts, plans and arrangements, and all trust agreements
related thereto, maintained (currently or at any time in the last
five years) by or contributed to by Seller or any Seller
Subsidiary in respect of any of the present or former directors,
officers, or other employees of and/or consultants to Seller or
any Seller Subsidiary (collectively, "Seller Employee Plans").
Seller has furnished Buyer with the following documents with
respect to each Seller Employee Plan: (i) a true and
complete copy of all written documents comprising such
Seller Employee Plan (including amendments and individual
agreements relating thereto) or, if there is no such written
document, an accurate and complete description of the Seller
Employee Plan; (ii) the most recent Form 5500 or Form 5500-C
(including all schedules thereto), if applicable; (iii) the
most recent financial statements and actuarial reports, if
any; (iv) the summary plan description currently in effect
and all material modifications thereof, if any; and (v) the
most recent Internal Revenue Service determination letter,
if any.

-33-
<PAGE> 35
(b) All Seller Employee Plans have been
maintained and operated materially in accordance with their
terms and with the material requirements of all applicable
statutes, orders, rules and final regulations, including
without limitation ERISA and the Internal Revenue Code. All
contributions required to be made to Seller Employee Plans
have been made.

(c) With respect to each of the Seller Employee
Plans which is a pension plan (as defined in Section 3(2) of
ERISA) (the "Pension Plans"): (i) each Pension Plan which is
intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section
401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code has been determined to
be so qualified by the Internal Revenue Service and, to the
knowledge of Seller, such determination letter may still be
relied upon, and each related trust is exempt from taxation
under Section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code; (ii) the
present value of all benefits vested and all benefits
accrued (Accumulated Benefit Obligation) under each Pension
Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA, valued using the
assumptions in the actuarial report dated as of December 31,
1993, did not, in each case, exceed the value of the assets
of the Pension Plan allocable to such vested or accrued
benefits dated as of December 31, 1993; (iii) to the best
knowledge of Seller, there has been no "prohibited

-34-
<PAGE> 36
transaction," as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the
Internal Revenue Code or Section 406 of ERISA, which could
subject any Pension Plan or associated trust, or the Seller
or any Seller Subsidiary, to any material tax or penalty; (iv)
except as set forth on Schedule 2.17C, no Pension Plan or
any trust created thereunder has been terminated, nor have
there been any "reportable events" with respect to any
Pension Plan, as that term is defined in Section 4043 of
ERISA on or after January 1, 1985; and (v) no Pension Plan or
any trust created thereunder has incurred any "accumulated
funding deficiency", as such term is defined in Section 302
of ERISA (whether or not waived). No Pension Plan is a
"multiemployer plan" as that term is defined in Section
3(37) of ERISA. With respect to each Pension Plan that is
described in Section 4063(a) of ERISA (a "Multiple Employer
Pension Plan"): (i) neither Seller nor any Seller
Subsidiary would have any liability or obligation to post a
bond under Section 4063 of ERISA if Seller and all Seller
Subsidiaries were to withdraw from such Multiple Employer
Pension Plan; and (ii) neither Seller nor any Seller Sub-
sidiary would have any liability under Section 4064 of ERISA
if such Multiple Employer Pension Plan were to terminate.

(d) Neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has
any liability for any post-retirement health, medical or

-35-
<PAGE> 37
similar benefit of any kind whatsoever, except as required
by statute or regulation.

(e) Neither Seller nor any Seller Subsidiary has
any material liability under ERISA or the Internal Revenue
Code as a result of its being a member of a group described
in Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Internal Revenue
Code.

(f) Except as set forth on Schedule 2.17F,
neither the execution nor delivery of this Agreement, nor
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, will (i) result in any material payment (including
without limitation severance, unemployment compensation or
golden parachute payment) becoming due to any director or
employee of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary from any of such
entities, (ii) materially increase any benefit otherwise
payable under any of the Seller Employee Plans or (iii)
result in the acceleration of the time of payment of any
such benefit. Seller shall use its best efforts to insure
that no amounts paid or payable by Seller, Seller
Subsidiaries or Buyer to or with respect to any employee or
former employee of Seller or any Seller Subsidiary will fail
to be deductible for federal income tax purposes by reason
of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.

Buyer represents, and warrants to and covenants
with Seller as follows:

--------------------------
of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, bank, trust company or
other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of organization,
is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in

or the conduct of its business requires it to be so
qualified and has corporate power and authority to own its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted, except, in the case of the Buyer
Subsidiaries, where the failure to be so qualified would not
have a material adverse effect on the Condition of Buyer and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Buyer is registered as
a bank holding company with the Board under the Holding
Company Act. True and complete copies of the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Buyer, each in effect on the

and programs, or conversion of the Convertible Notes. Buyer
continually evaluates possible acquisitions and may prior to
the Effective Time enter into one or more agreements
providing for, and may consummate, the acquisition by it of
another bank, association, bank holding company, savings and
loan holding company or other company (or the assets
thereof) for consideration that may include equity
securities. In addition, prior to the Effective Time, Buyer
may, depending on market conditions and other factors, oth-
erwise determine to issue equity, equity-linked or other
securities for financing purposes. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer will not take any action that would (i)
prevent the transactions contemplated hereby from qualifying
(A) for pooling-of-interests accounting treatment or (B) as a

-46-

reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Internal Revenue Code or (ii) materially impede or delay re-
ceipt of any approval referred to in Section 6.01(b) or the

assessable, and will not be issued in violation of any
preemptive right of any stockholder of Buyer.

rized by all requisite corporate action of Buyer. This
Agreement is a valid and binding obligation of Buyer en-
forceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms.

(b) Neither the execution, delivery and perfor-
mance by Buyer of this Agreement, nor the consummation by
Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by Buyer with any of the provisions hereof, will

provisions of, or constitute a default (or an event which,
with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default) or result in the termination of, or accelerate the
performance required by, or result in a right of termination
or acceleration of, or result in the creation of, any Lien

judgment, ruling, order, writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule
or regulation applicable to Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective material properties or assets.

balance sheets of Buyer and its Subsidiaries as of March 31, June
30, and September 30, 1994 and the related unaudited consolidated
statements of income and cash flows for the periods then ended
included in quarterly reports on Form 10-Q as filed with the SEC
(collectively, the "Buyer Financial Statements"), have been

financial position of Buyer and its Subsidiaries at the dates and
the consolidated results of operations, changes in stockholders'
equity and cash flows of Buyer and its Subsidiaries for the
periods stated therein and are derived from the books and
records of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, which are complete
and accurate in all material respects and have been
maintained in all material respects in accordance with
applicable laws and regulations. Neither Buyer nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any material liabilities of any nature
(whether or not required to be disclosed or accrued under
SFAS No. 5) other than (i) those which have arisen in the
ordinary course since the date of the latest financial
statements described above, (ii) those which are reflected
in the financial statements described above and (iii) those
that do not individually amount to more than $750,000.

3.05. Buyer Reports. Since January 1, 1991, each
-------------
of Buyer and the Buyer Subsidiaries has filed all material

-50-
<PAGE> 52
reports, registrations and statements, together with any
required material amendments thereto, that it was required
to file with any Regulatory Authority. All such reports and
statements filed with any such Regulatory Authority are
collectively referred to herein as the "Buyer Reports." As
of its respective date, each Buyer Report complied in all
material respects with all the rules and regulations pro-
mulgated by the applicable Regulatory Authority and did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or nec-
essary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

3.06. Material Adverse Change. Since September 30,
-----------------------
1994, there has been no material adverse change in the Con-
dition of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
except as may have resulted or may result from changes to
laws and regulations or changes in economic conditions
applicable to banking institutions generally or in general
levels of interest rates affecting banking institutions
generally.

3.07. Commitments and Contracts. Neither Buyer nor
-------------------------
any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of its charter
documents or bylaws or in default under any material agree-
ment, commitment, arrangement, lease, insurance policy, or

-51-
<PAGE> 53
other instrument, whether entered into in the ordinary
course of business or otherwise and whether written or oral,
and there has not occurred any event that, with the lapse of
time or giving of notice or both, would constitute such a
default, except, in all cases, where such default would not
have a material adverse effect on the Condition of Buyer and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

3.08. Litigation and Other Proceedings. Neither
--------------------------------
Buyer nor any Buyer Subsidiary is a party to any pending or,
to the best knowledge of Buyer, threatened claim, action,
suit, investigation or proceeding, or is subject to any or-
der, judgment or decree, except for matters which, in the
aggregate, will not have, or reasonably could not be
expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Condition
of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or which
purports or seeks to enjoin or restrain the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, there are no actions, suits, or
proceedings pending or, to the best knowledge of Buyer,
threatened against Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary or any of
their respective officers or directors involving claims
under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended, or
the fair lending laws. No claim, action, suit, or
proceeding is pending against Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary
relating to Property of Buyer before any court or Regulatory
Authority or

-52-
<PAGE> 54
arbitration tribunal relating to hazardous substances, pollution,
or the environment, and there is no outstanding judgment, order,
writ, injunction, decree, or award against or affecting Buyer or
any Buyer Subsidiary with respect to the same. Except as
previously disclosed to Seller, since January 1, 1991, neither
Buyer nor any Buyer Subsidiary has received any notification or
communication which has not been resolved from any Regulatory
Authority (i) asserting that Buyer or any Subsidiary of Buyer, is
not in substantial compliance with any of the statutes,
regulations or ordinances that such Regulatory Authority
enforces, except with respect to matters which reasonably
could not be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the Condition of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, (ii) threatening to revoke any license, franchise,
permit or governmental authorization that is material to the
Condition of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
including without limitation such company's status as an
insured depositary institution under the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act or (iii) requiring or threatening to require
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries, or indicating that Buyer
or any of its Subsidiaries may be required, to enter into a
cease and desist order, agreement or memorandum of
understanding or any other agreement restricting or limiting
or purporting to direct, restrict or limit in any manner the
operations of Buyer or any of its

-53-
<PAGE> 55
Subsidiaries, including without limitation any restriction on the
payment of dividends and no such cease and desist order,
agreement or memorandum of understanding or other agreement is
currently in effect.

3.09. Compliance with Laws. Each of Buyer and its
--------------------
Subsidiaries has complied with all laws, regulations, and
orders (including without limitation zoning ordinances,
building codes, ERISA, and securities, tax, environmental,
civil rights, and occupational health and safety laws and
regulations and including without limitation in the case of
any Buyer Subsidiary that is a bank, banking organization,
banking corporation or trust company, all statutes, rules
and regulations, pertaining to the conduct of a banking,
deposit-taking or lending or related business or to the
exercise of trust powers) and governing instruments
applicable to them and to the conduct of their business,
except where such failure to comply would not have a
material adverse effect on the Condition of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and (ii) neither Buyer nor
any Buyer Subsidiary is in default under, and no event has
occurred which, with the lapse of time or notice or both,
could result in the default under, the terms of any
judgment, order, writ, decree, permit, or license of any
Regulatory Authority or court, whether federal, state,
municipal, or local and whether at law or in equity, except
where such default would not have a material

-54-
<PAGE> 56
adverse effect on the Condition of Buyer and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. Neither Buyer nor any Buyer Subsidiary is
subject to or reasonably likely to incur a liability as a result
of its ownership, operation, or use of any Property of Buyer
(whether directly or, to the best knowledge of Buyer, as a
consequence of such Property being part of the investment
portfolio of Buyer or any Buyer Subsidiary) (A) that is
contaminated by or contains any Toxic Substance, or (B) on
which any Toxic Substance has been stored, disposed of,
placed, or used in the construction thereof; and which, in
each case, reasonably could be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Condition of Buyer and its Subsidiar-
ies, taken as a whole. Except for statutory or regulatory
restrictions of general application, no Regulatory Authority
has placed any restriction on the business of Buyer or any
Buyer Subsidiary which reasonably could be expected to have
a material adverse effect on the Condition of Buyer and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

3.10. Registration Statement, etc. None of the
---------------------------
information regarding Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries sup-
plied or to be supplied by Buyer for inclusion or included
in (i) the Registration Statement, (ii) the Proxy Statement,
or (iii) any other documents to be filed with any Regulatory
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby will, at the respective times such documents are filed

-55-
<PAGE> 57
with any Regulatory Authority and, in the case of the
Registration Statement, when it becomes effective and, with
respect to the Proxy Statement, when mailed (or furnished to
shareholders of Seller), be false or misleading with respect
to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements therein not
misleading or, in the case of the Proxy Statement or any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto, at the time of the
Meeting, be false or misleading with respect to any material
fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to
correct any statement in any earlier communication with
respect to the solicitation of any proxy for the Meeting.
All documents which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries are
responsible for filing with any Regulatory Authority in
connection with the Merger will comply as to form in all
material respects with the provisions of applicable law.

3.11. Brokers and Finders. Neither Buyer nor any
-------------------
of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers,
directors or employees has employed any broker or finder or
incurred any liability for any financial advisory fees,
brokerage fees, commissions or finder's fees, and no broker
or finder has acted directly or indirectly for Buyer or any
of its Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

-56-
<PAGE> 58
3.12. Accounting, Tax and Regulatory Matters.
--------------------------------------
Neither Buyer nor any Buyer Subsidiary has taken or agreed
to take any action or has any knowledge of any fact or
circumstance that would (i) prevent the transactions
contemplated hereby from qualifying (A) for pooling-of-
interests accounting treatment or (B) as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue
Code or (ii) materially impede or delay receipt of any
approval referred to in Section 6.01(b) or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

3.13. Accuracy of Information. The statements of
-----------------------
Buyer contained in this Agreement, the Schedules and in any
other written document executed and delivered by or on behalf
of Buyer pursuant to the terms of this Agreement are true and
correct in all material respects, and such statements and
documents do not omit any material fact necessary to make the
statements contained herein or therein not misleading.

Each of Buyer and Seller agrees to not take any action that
would materially impede or delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the ability

Dear Sirs:

Mercantile Bancorporation Inc. ("Buyer") and
TCBankshares, Inc. ("Seller") are entering into an Agreement and
Plan of Reorganization (the "Agreement") providing for, among
other things, a merger between a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer
and Seller (the "Merger"), in which all of the outstanding shares
of capital stock of Seller will be exchanged for capital stock of
Buyer.

The undersigned is a stockholder of Seller ("Stock-
holder") and is entering into this letter agreement to induce
Buyer to enter into the Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby. All capitalized terms used
herein and not otherwise defined shall have the meaning ascribed
thereto in the Agreement.

Stockholder confirms its agreement with Buyer as
follows:

1. Stockholder represents, warrants and agrees that
Schedule I annexed hereto sets forth the shares of the capital
stock of Seller of which Stockholder is the record or beneficial
owner (the "Shares") and that Stockholder is on the date hereof
the lawful owner of the number of shares set forth in Schedule I,
free and clear of all liens, charges, encumbrances, voting
agreements and commitments of every kind. Except as set forth in
Schedule I, Stockholder does not own or hold any rights to
acquire any additional shares of the capital stock of Seller or
of any Seller Subsidiary (by exercise of stock options or
otherwise) or any interest therein or any voting rights with
respect to any additional shares, other than as previously
disclosed to Buyer.

<PAGE> 2
2. Stockholder agrees that Stockholder will not, and
will not permit any company, trust or other entity controlled by
Stockholder to, contract to sell, sell or otherwise transfer or
dispose of any of the Shares or any interest therein or
securities convertible thereinto or any voting rights with
respect thereto, other than (i) pursuant to the Merger or (ii)
with Buyer's prior written consent.

3. Stockholder agrees that all of the Shares
beneficially owned by Stockholder, or over which Stockholder has
voting power or control, directly or indirectly, in each case at
the record date for any meeting of stockholders of Seller called
to consider and vote to approve the Agreement and/or the
transactions contemplated thereby will be voted by the
undersigned in favor thereof.

4. Stockholder agrees to, and will cause any company,
trust or other entity controlled by Stockholder to, cooperate
with Buyer in connection with the Agreement and the transactions
contemplated thereby. Stockholder agrees that Stockholder will
not, and will not permit any such company, trust or other entity
directly or indirectly (including through its officers,
directors, employees or other representatives) to initiate,
solicit or encourage any discussions, inquiries or proposals with
any third party relating to the disposition of any significant
portion of the business or assets of Seller or any Seller
Subsidiary or the acquisition of Equity Securities of Seller or
any Seller Subsidiary or the merger of Seller or any Seller
Subsidiary with any person (other than Buyer) or any similar
transaction (each such transaction being referred to herein as an
"Acquisition Transaction"), or provide any such person with
information or assistance or negotiate with any such person with
respect to an Acquisition Transaction or agree to or otherwise
assist in the effectuation of any Acquisition Transaction.

5. Stockholder agrees that he will execute and deliver a
certificate containing such representations as are reasonably
necessary and customary for tax counsel to each of Buyer and
Seller to render an opinion to the effect that the Merger will
constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and that no gain or loss will
be recognized by the shareholders of Seller to the extent they
receive Buyer Common Stock and Buyer New Preferred Stock solely
in exchange for shares of Seller Common Stock and Seller
Preferred Stock.

MERCANTILE BANCORPORATION TO ENTER ARKANSAS
THROUGH MERGER WITH TCBANKSHARES

Mercantile Bancorporation Inc., of St. Louis, today announced that it will
enter the Arkansas banking market by merging with TCBankshares Inc., the
state's third largest bank holding company.

TCBankshares, based in North Little Rock, had approximately $1.4 billion in
assets as of September 30, 1994, and owns six banks with 36 offices in central,
northern and western Arkansas. The company's lead bank, The Twin City Bank, is
the third largest bank in Little Rock/North Little Rock, the state's largest
metropolitan area. Its five other banks are among the top three institutions
in seven of the eight counties they serve.

Mercantile, one of the premier banking organizations in the U.S., had
September 30, 1994 assets of $12.2 billion. The corporation operates 41
Mercantile Banks located throughout the state of Missouri, and in eastern
Kansas, southern Illinois and northern Iowa.

MERCANTILE TO MERGE WITH TCBANKSHARES--FIRST ADD

"Merging with TCBankshares will allow Mercantile to assume a solid market
share in the state's capital, and strong positions in several other attractive
and growing communities in Arkansas," explained Thomas H. Jacobsen, Mercantile's
chairman and chief executive officer. "TCBankshares' network adjoins existing
Mercantile markets north of the state line in Missouri, making it an excellent
complement to Mercantile's franchise. Mercantile's strength has always been its
strong sense of community banking and the involvement of local people as
directors of those banks."

"Mercantile's strong commitment to banking fundamentals and its tradition
of supporting the communities that it serves fit perfectly with the philosophy
that TCBankshares has followed over the years," noted Frank Lyon, Jr., chairman
of TCBankshares. "Further, it allows my family an expanded and more diversified
interest in the banking industry in addition to providing TCB with the
wherewithal to more aggressively pursue its growth and acquisition strategies to
better serve the financial needs of our customers."

"As we become part of the Mercantile organization, it is with the assurance
that Twin City Bank will continue to offer the quality of service and care to
our customers and employees that we have traditionally offered," said T.E.
Renaud, chairman and chief executive officer of the bank.

MERCANTILE TO MERGE WITH TCBANKSHARES--SECOND ADD

"We will immediately begin to take advantage of the capital strength, range
of services and increased efficiency that this affiliation will provide, while
at the same time keeping Twin City Bank's present management structure, customer
service culture, and commitment to customers, employees and communities intact,"
Renaud said. He plans to remain as chairman and chief executive officer of
Twin City Bank and the local boards of directors of the banks within
TCBankshares will remain, Renaud added. Renaud is also chief executive officer
of TCBankshares.

In addition to North Little Rock-based Twin City Bank, TCBankshares owns
First National Bank of Crawford County, in Van Buren; The First National Bank
of Conway County, in Morrilton; First National Bank of Cleburne County, in Heber
Springs; 1st Ozark National Bank, in Flippin; and TCB--The Community Bank of
Arkansas, in Batesville.

According to the terms of the merger agreement, Mercantile will issue 4.75
million shares of its common stock in exchange for the common stock of
TCBankshares. In addition, Mercantile will assume, through an exchange,
outstanding, non-convertible preferred stock of TCBankshares with a value of
$12.1 million. The merger is subject to the approval of all appropriate
regulatory authorities.
