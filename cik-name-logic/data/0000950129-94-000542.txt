Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Triton Engineering Services Company:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Triton
Engineering Services Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992,
and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and
cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Triton Engineering
Services Company and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Notes 2 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes to adopt the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting
for Income Taxes," as of January 1, 1993.

As discussed in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's
Board of Directors have executed a letter of intent to sell all of the
outstanding shares of common stock of the Company. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to
the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts
and classifications of liabilities that might result from the sale.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

December 31, 1993 and 1992

(1) CONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

Triton Engineering Services Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries
("Triton" or the "Company") provide specialized technical services to the
upstream segment of the petroleum industry. The Company drills oil and gas
wells worldwide, onshore and offshore, for clients on a fixed-fee turnkey
basis, providing all engineering, equipment, materials, services and
management required. In addition, it provides project management,
engineering for drilling and production projects, daywork services,
operations supervision, consulting and supply services. The Company's
subsidiaries are:

Triton USA, Inc.
Triton International, Inc.
Triton Tool and Supply, Inc.
Triton International Limited
Triton Engineering Services Company, S.A.
Triton Engineering Services Company Limited
Triton Turn-Key, Inc.
Threadneedle Oil Company
1201 Dairy Ashford, Inc.
Triton/Faja de Oro Joint Venture

(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company's 50% interest in
Triton/Faja de Oro Joint Venture has also been consolidated in 1993; in
1992 such investment was accounted for under the equity method (see note
3). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates are
accounted for under the equity method.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

As described in note 6, the consolidated financial statements for 1993
reflect the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" (Statement 109), effective January 1,
1993.

RECOGNITION OF REVENUE FROM SERVICE AND TURNKEY DRILLING CONTRACTS

The Company performs engineering services under contractual arrangements
and recognizes revenues as services are rendered or as reimbursable
expenses are incurred.

Revenues on turnkey drilling contracts are recorded using the
completed-contract method for financial reporting purposes. The
completed-contract method recognizes income only if the contract is
completed, or substantially completed, unless the contract is estimated to
result in a loss, whereby provision is made immediately for the entire
anticipated loss.

TRITON ENGINEERING SERVICES COMPANY
AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

CASH EQUIVALENTS

For presentation of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid
debt instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months
or less to be cash equivalents.

INVENTORY

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost, determined on a
weighted-average basis, or market. No valuation allowance was deemed
necessary at December 31, 1993 or 1992.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Furniture, Fixtures and Equipment, Drilling Equipment and Leasehold 
Improvements

Furniture, fixtures and equipment, drilling equipment and leasehold 
improvements are stated at cost. Depreciation is calculated on the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives ranging from three to
seven years. Leasehold improvements are amortized straight-line over the
shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.
Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. When property
is retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the respective accounts with any gain or
loss on disposal included in income.

Oil and Gas Properties

The Company utilizes the full-cost method to account for its investment in
oil and gas properties. Under this method, all costs of
acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas reserves
(including such costs as leasehold acquisition costs, geological
expenditures, dry hole costs and tangible and intangible development
costs) are capitalized as incurred. Oil and gas properties are depleted
and charged to operations using the unit-of-production method based on
the ratio of current production to proved oil and gas reserves.
Dispositions of oil and gas properties are recorded as adjustments to
capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized unless such adjustments
would alter significantly the relationship between capitalized costs and
proved reserves of oil and gas. During 1993, the Company sold a
significant portion of its oil and gas properties, resulting in the
recognition of a gain of $63,776; the Company had no significant
dispositions during 1992. To the extent that capitalized costs of oil and
gas properties, net of accumulated depreciation and depletion, exceed the
discounted future net revenues of proved oil and gas reserves, such excess
capitalized costs would be charged to operations. A valuation provision of
$228,340 was required for the year ended December 31, 1992, and is
included in operating expenses; no such provision was required in 1993.

ASSETS HELD FOR SALE

During 1993, the Company transferred approximately $320,000 and $325,000
of jar parts classified as assets held for sale at December 31, 1992
to property and equipment and inventory, respectively, as the Company no
longer intends to actively market the jar parts for sale, instead, using
such items in its drilling operations.

IMPACT OF RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued Statements of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement
Benefits Other Than Pensions," ("Statement 106") and No. 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" ("Statement 112"). Statement 106
focuses principally on accounting for postretirement health care benefits,
requiring accrual of the expected cost of those benefits during the period
in which the employee provides service, and for the Company is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994. Statement 112 requires
employers to recognize the obligation to provide postemployment benefits
unless the amount cannot be reasonably estimated; Statement 112 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993. The Company
does not believe the implementation of Statement 106 or Statement 112, 
will have a material impact on its financial position.

(3) JOINT VENTURE OPERATIONS

During 1992, the Company entered into a 50/50 joint venture agreement (the
"Joint Venture") with Perforadora Faja de Oro, S.A. de C.V. ("Faja") to
perform four turnkey drilling contracts ("the Contracts") for Petroleos
Mexicanos ("Pemex"), the government-owned Mexican oil company.

In exchange for a 50% share of the profits of the Joint Venture, the
Company agreed to provide technical support and advice to Faja with
respect to the preparation of bids, the preparation of drilling programs,
and engineering and supervisory support during operations.

Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Faja provided initial funding of
up to $4,000,000 per well to cover expenses that were paid prior to
collection from Pemex. The advance from Faja was repaid during January
1993.

In 1992, the investment in the Joint Venture was accounted for using the
equity method.

At December 31, 1992 the Joint Venture had completed two of the four
contracts.

As Triton has significant influence over the activities of the Joint
Venture and as the advances made by Faja were settled by the Joint Venture
during January 1993, the Company began accounting for the investment in
the Joint Venture through consolidation of its operations and financial
position.

The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Triton Tool and Supply,
Inc. (TTS), furnishes the Joint Venture with supplies, services and
rentals of equipment at prices comparable to those TTS offers its best
customers. The Joint Venture has no obligation to purchase from TTS.
Included in the Company's revenues and gross profits at December 31, 1992
were $3,058,990 and $626,987, respectively, related to sales from TTS to
the Joint Venture.

(4) INVESTMENT IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES

The Company has a 10.44% investment in 1201 Dairy Ashford, Ltd. (the
Partnership) through its wholly-owned subsidiary, 1201 Dairy Ashford,
Inc., which serves as the general partner for the Partnership. An officer
and certain directors of the Company are limited partners in the
Partnership. Profits are to be allocated 100% to the partners, according
to their respective percentage interest, until the limited partners are
reimbursed in full for their initial and supplemental, if any, capital
contributions. The remaining profits shall be allocated 50% to the limited
partners and 50% to the general partner until the aggregate balance of all
limited partner accounts equals $250,000 (the initial limited partners'
aggregate investment), less any distributions to the limited partners
after February 26, 1987. Any remaining profits shall be allocated 100% to
the general partner. All losses are to be allocated 100% to the general
partner.

The Company leases office space from the Partnership. Rental expense
related to the lease was $404,684 for 1993 and 1992. Minimum annual
rentals of $404,684 are due under the lease, which expires on January 31,
2006. In addition, the Company is obliged to pay the operating costs, as
defined, of the property subject to the lease. Such operating costs were
$302,481 and $322,889 for 1993 and 1992, respectively.

The Company holds two noninterest-bearing notes issued by the Partnership.
One note in the original amount of $1,701,215 is secured by a lien on the
land and building owned by the Partnership, and the second note in the
original amount of $1,000,000 is unsecured. A note payable to a third
party in the original amount of $2,600,000 is also secured by a lien on
the land and building. The third party note, which matures on February 1,
2016, is callable by the lenders on February 1, 2001. The Company's lien
is subordinate to the third party lien.

The Company's 1993 operations include a loss of $94,336 representing the
Company's equity in the Partnership's loss. The Company's 1992 operations
include a loss of $93,131 representing the Company's equity in the
partnership's loss and a charge of $334,162 to write down the Company's
investment in the Partnership to its estimated net realizable value, as
the liabilities of the Partnership exceed the appraised value of the
Partnership's assets. No additional impairment was recorded during 1993.

accounted for using the equity method, at December 31, 1993 and 1992:

(5) DEBT AND CREDIT AGREEMENTS

On June 2, 1992, the Company obtained a working capital line of credit in
the amount of $1,500,000 maturing on May 2, 1993. The line of credit was
extended during 1993 to June 1, 1994. The line of credit is secured by
assignment of accounts receivable and inventory owned and subsequently
acquired. The Company was not in compliance with certain covenants at
December 31, 1993. Borrowings outstanding under the line of credit bear
interest at the prime rate (as published by the Wall Street Journal) plus
1/2 of one percentage point (6.5% at December 31, 1993). At December 31,
1993, $1,500,000 was outstanding under the line of credit.

(6) INCOME TAXES

As discussed in Note 2, the Company adopted Statement 109 effective
January 1, 1993. Statement 109 requires a change from the deferred method
to the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under
the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for
the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted
statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets
and liabilities. Under Statement 109, the effect on deferred taxes of a
change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes
the enactment date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

(Continued)

<PAGE> 16

TRITON ENGINEERING SERVICES COMPANY
AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The cumulative effect on prior years of the adoption of Statement No. 109
increased net earnings by $66,285 and is reported separately in the
consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 1993. Prior
year financial statements were not restated.

The income tax provision consists of the following for the years ended December
31, 1993 and 1992.

1993 1992
---- ----

Current provision - U.S. $ 937,106 376,428
Current provision - Foreign 592,040 1,286,998
Deferred provision - U.S. (894,908) 1,874,569
Foreign withholding taxes 1,587,769 687,372
---------- ---------
Income tax provision $2,222,007 4,225,367
---------- ---------
---------- ---------

The primary reasons for the difference in the statutory tax rate and the
effective tax rate are the taxation of foreign earnings at rates in excess of,
and in addition to, the U.S. statutory rate and the limitation of foreign tax
credit utilization. The Company utilized foreign tax credits of $1,044,612 and
$887,113 in 1993 and 1992, respectively.

The tax effects of temporary differences that result in significant portions of
the deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 1993 and a
description of the financial statement items creating these differences are as
follows:

Deferred tax assets:
Foreign tax credit carryforwards $ 2,243,515
Alternative minimum tax credit 66,022
UNICAP 85,351
-----------
Total deferred tax assets 2,394,888
-----------
Deferred tax liabilities:
Property and equipment (34,990)
Accrual to cash (3,321,776)
Other (483,520)
-----------
Total deferred tax liabilities (3,840,286)

Less valuation allowance (1,216,957)
-----------
Net deferred tax liability $(2,662,355)
-----------

The foreign tax credit carryforwards begin to expire in 1997.

(7) COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

The Company leased an operating facility with a lease termination date of
February 28, 1994. The minimum rental commitments under the lease are
$40,000 in 1994. The Company exercised its option under the agreement to
purchase the facility during 1994 for approximately $500,000 in cash and
the issuance of a note payable to the seller for approximately $1.6
million. The related rental expense was $236,000 and $200,000 during 1993
and 1992, respectively.

The Company is a defendant in litigation arising in the normal course of
business. Management believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters
will not have a materially adverse effect on the consolidated financial
position of the Company.

(8) SHAREHOLDERS' AGREEMENT

Effective February 27, 1987, the Company executed a Shareholders'
Agreement which placed certain restrictions on the transferability of
substantially all of the Company's common shares. In the event an employee
shareholder, as defined in the Shareholders' Agreement, dies, retires,
becomes permanently or totally disabled, or is terminated involuntarily
without cause, such shareholder may offer all or any part of the shares
owned to the Company. The Company is obligated to purchase all of the
shares offered, at a purchase price equal to the per share book value. In
the event such a shareholder is terminated for reasons other than the
aforementioned reasons, the Company has the option to purchase all or any
part of the shares owned by such shareholder at 85% of the per share book
value.

(9) RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

On January 1, 1993, the Company entered into an employment agreement (the
Agreement) with an executive (the Executive or Stockholder) of the
Company. The Agreement is in effect for seven years with automatic
one-year extensions unless the Company or the Executive terminates the
Agreement in accordance with contract provisions.

During 1992, the Company entered into an Agreement with the Stockholder to
pay the premiums on a life insurance policy for the benefit of the
Stockholder's estate. The advances made by the Company in payment of the
premiums are secured by assignment of the policy to the Company solely to
recover the amounts advanced by the Company.

(10) INCENTIVE STOCK OPTION PLAN

The Company's 1987 Incentive Stock Option Plan, as revised, provides for
the granting of qualified stock options to purchase 1,000 shares of common
stock to eligible employees.

(Continued)

<PAGE> 18

TRITON ENGINEERING SERVICES COMPANY
AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The options are exercisable over a period determined by the Board of
Directors, but no longer than ten years after the date they are granted,
subject to the individual being an employee of the Company. However,
options granted to individuals who own 10% or more of the combined voting
power of all classes of stock of the Company have five years to exercise
the option. The option price will be determined by the Company's Board of
Directors but shall in no event be less than 100% of the fair market 
value on the date of grant.

At December 31, 1993, 830 options are outstanding with exercise prices of
$1,148 and $2,545 per share for 500 and 330 of the options, respectively.
No options were exercised during 1993. The options begin to expire between
1997 and 2002.

(11) PROFIT SHARING PLAN

The Company has a noncontributory profit-sharing plan (the Plan) covering
substantially all domestic employees. The Company incurred Plan expenses
totaling $697,602 and $761,973 during 1993 and 1992, respectively. The
Company makes discretionary contributions to the Plan in amounts
determined annually by management.

(12) INSURANCE

The Company was self-insured for employee health claims up to $25,000 per
individual from January 1, 1992 through April 30, 1992 and for up to
$35,000 per individual from May 1, 1992 through December 31, 1993. Expense
for employee health benefit claims and stop loss reinsurance premiums
totaled $503,127 and $382,572 during 1993 and 1992, respectively.

At December 31, 1993, a receivable of $2,379,585, net of an allowance of
$2,790,000 related to disputed claims, was recorded related to the
Company's claims under its insurance policy. The net insurance proceeds
anticipated to be recovered are reflected as a reduction of turnkey
drilling expenses as such proceeds represent reimbursements of redrilling
and other costs incurred by the Company. Management believes the net
receivable recorded as of December 31, 1993 is collectible.

(13) CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Company's sales and accounts receivable relate primarily to turnkey
drilling activities. At December 31, 1993, $22,064,593 of accounts
receivable related to drilling activities in Central and South America. An
allowance of $290,000 has been recorded as of December 31, 1993 for
doubtful accounts. The net receivable balance is deemed to be collectible
by management.

(14) SUBSEQUENT EVENTS (UNAUDITED)

The Company has recorded an accrual for $1,466,999 ($953,549 net of tax)
related to a loss incurred on a domestic turnkey drilling contract in
progress at December 31, 1993. The Company is vigorously pursuing
recovery of the loss from a drilling company from whom it rented equipment
for the drilling of the well. The Company believes it will ultimately be
able to recover a portion of this loss.

During January 1994, the Company entered into negotiations to sell all of
the outstanding stock of Triton Engineering Services Company to Noble
Drilling Corporation. A letter of intent has been signed by both parties.
The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset
amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might
result from the sale.
