On March 17, 1994, Litton Industries, Inc. (the "Registrant", "Litton" or the
"Company") distributed all of the issued and outstanding shares of
Common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of its wholly-owned subsidiary
Western Atlas Inc., a Delaware corporation ("WAI"). The distribution
("Distribution") was made in the form of a dividend to holders of record of
Litton Common stock at the close of business on March 14, 1994. Litton
shareholders of record are entitled to receive one share of WAI Common stock
for each share of Litton Common stock owned.

The Registrant retains its defense/electronics and marine operations and
interconnect products businesses, but no longer holds an interest in either
the oilfield information services or industrial automation systems
businesses. As a result of the Distribution, WAI is now an independent
publicly-owned company.

In connection with the Distribution, the Registrant and WAI entered into
a number of agreements including a Distribution and Indemnity Agreement and a
Tax Sharing Agreement, copies of which are included as exhibits hereto.
Additional information concerning WAI and the Distribution is contained

LITTON INDUSTRIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
INTRODUCTION TO PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

On March 4, 1994, the Company's Board of Directors declared a dividend in the
form of a distribution of 100 percent of the Common stock of WAI to holders of
record of Litton Common stock on March 14, 1994, payable on March 17, 1994.
This transaction will be reported by Litton as a tax-free dividend for tax
reporting purposes. WAI comprises the Company's former oilfield information
services and industrial automation systems businesses. The Company's
continuing operations are composed of the defense/electronics and marine
operations and the interconnect products businesses. The Company's historical
financial statements as of January 31, 1994 and for the six months then ended
and as of July 31, 1993 and for the fiscal year then ended presented WAI as
discontinued operations.

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed statements of
operations of the Company make adjustments to the historical statements of
operations for the six months ended January 31, 1994 and for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 1993, in order to present the consolidated results of continuing
operations, as if the Distribution had occurred at the beginning of the
respective periods.

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed balance sheet of the
Company makes adjustments to the historical balance sheet at January 31, 1994,
as if the Distribution had occurred on January 31, 1994. The pro forma balance
sheet gives effect to the Distribution, reimbursement by WAI to Litton for
certain intercompany indebtedness and repayment by Litton of borrowings incurred
in connection with certain transactions entered into by WAI (see Notes 2 and 3
of Notes to Pro Forma Consolidated Condensed Financial Information for further
information).

The pro forma consolidated condensed balance sheet and statements of operations
of the Company should be read in conjunction with the historical financial
statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report to
Shareholders for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1993 and the Company's Form
10-Q for the period ended January 31, 1994. The pro forma consolidated
condensed financial information presented herein is for informational purposes
only and may not necessarily reflect the results of operations or financial
position of the Company which would have occurred had the Distribution occurred
at the beginning of the financial periods presented or as of January 31, 1994,
nor is the pro forma consolidated condensed financial information necessarily
indicative of future results of operations or financial position of the Company.

Section 3.06 INSURANCE.

(a) Since at least the early 1970s, Litton has provided insurance and
self-insurance coverage to Western Atlas and the Western Atlas Subsidiaries
(except that, with respect to the period commencing on and after April 30, 1987,
WAII and its subsidiaries have participated in only parts of the Litton
Insurance Program) through various policies of insurance and Litton's
self-insurance programs, maintained by Litton for the benefit of itself and its
subsidiaries for workers' compensation, general liability, aircraft liability,
other liability, property and other insurable business risks and losses. Such
insurance policies and self-insurance programs are referred to as the "Litton
Insurance Program." Western Atlas and the Western Atlas Subsidiaries have paid
premiums and premium-like charges to Litton to provide such insurance and
self-insurance coverage, with deductibles, and for varying limits of liability.
Litton will continue to provide such coverage to Western Atlas and the Western
Atlas Subsidiaries for all such insured and Litton corporate self-insured
incidents, acts or occurrences occurring from the date such coverage first
commenced until 12:00 midnight on the Distribution Date or such later date as
may be agreed to in writing by Litton and Western Atlas, and Western Atlas and
the Western Atlas Subsidiaries shall pay Litton the costs, fees and expenses for
such coverage in accordance with the past and current practices established be-
tween Litton, Western Atlas and the Western Atlas Subsidiaries; provided,
however, that WRH shall not be obligated for any further payments to Litton
under the Litton Insurance Program with respect to periods ending on or before
April 30, 1987. Such costs include, but are not limited to, premiums, deducti-
bles, retrospective rating adjustments, assessments paid and audit adjustments
completed.

(b) Litton shall use reasonable efforts to assist Western Atlas and
the Western Atlas Subsidiaries in obtaining their own separate, initial
insurance and self-insurance coverage for Western Atlas and the Western Atlas
Subsidiaries, effective with respect to incidents, acts or omissions occurring
from and after the Distribution Date in such amounts as are agreed upon by the
parties. Following the Distribution Date, each of the parties shall cooperate
with and assist the other party in the prevention of conflicts or gaps in
insurance coverage and/or collection of Insurance Proceeds.

(c) Litton and Western Atlas agree that Western Atlas and the Western
Atlas Subsidiaries shall have the right to present claims to Litton or Litton's
insurers under the Litton Insurance Program for insured and self-insured inci-
dents, acts or occurrences occurring from the date said coverage first

9

<PAGE>

commenced until the Distribution Date. Any such claims shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of the Litton Insurance Program which for this purpose
shall include the so-called "tail" coverage referred to below in this subsection
(c). All such claims by Western Atlas or the Western Atlas Subsidiaries against
Litton or Litton's insurers shall be presented promptly when known to Litton's
Corporate Risk Management Department. The parties acknowledge that any such
policies written on a "claims made" rather than "occurrence" basis may not, in
their present form, provide coverage to Western Atlas and the Western Atlas
Subsidiaries for incidents, acts or occurrences occurring prior to the
Distribution Date but which are first reported after the Distribution Date and,
accordingly, the parties have agreed that Litton shall acquire "tail" insurance
coverage, effective upon the Distribution Date, with respect to such "claims
made" policies on behalf of Western Atlas and the Western Atlas Subsidiaries so
that insurance and self-insurance coverage for all incidents, acts or
occurrences occurring prior to the Distribution Date shall be the responsibility
of Litton or its insurers. Western Atlas shall promptly reimburse Litton for
the cost of such "tail" insurance coverage. The terms and costs of such "tail"
coverage shall be mutually agreed to by Litton and Western Atlas.

(d) With respect to any insured or self-insured Losses or retroactive
premium adjustments relating to assets and/or operations of Western Atlas and/or
the Western Atlas Subsidiaries prior to the Distribution Date (other than any
such Losses or retroactive insurance premium adjustments with respect to WRH for
periods ending on or before April 30, 1987): (i) Litton shall pay over to
Western Atlas within 60 days of receipt any Insurance Proceeds it receives on
account of such Losses and any such retroactive premium reductions; and (ii)
Western Atlas and the Western Atlas Subsidiaries shall reimburse Litton within
60 days of Litton's request for all costs, expenses or payments made by Litton
after the Distribution Date to insurers on account of such Losses and any such
retroactive premium increases. The defense of and the responsibility for any
litigation pending at the Distribution Date, or commenced after the Distribution
Date, relating to Western Atlas or the Western Atlas Subsidiaries and covered by
the Litton Insurance Program shall continue to be managed in accordance with
current practice notwithstanding the Distribution.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to the self-insured
property program for the first $250,000 of losses for the United States and
Canada operations of Litton and Western Atlas which is maintained by Litton (the
"Litton

10

<PAGE>

Property Loss Program"), an accounting shall be made as of 12:00 midnight of the
Distribution Date and there shall be paid to Western Atlas by Litton, or Western
Atlas shall pay to Litton, as the case may be, any pool excess or deficiency
attributable to loss experience and premiums of Western Atlas and the Western
Atlas Subsidiaries through the Distribution Date. Western Atlas and the Western
Atlas Subsidiaries shall have no coverage under the Litton Property Loss Program
after such accounting.

(f) Litton maintains various bonding facilities on behalf of itself
and its various subsidiaries, including Western Atlas and the Western Atlas
Subsidiaries. Western Atlas and the Western Atlas Subsidiaries shall have the
right to continue to have the benefit of such bonding facilities after the
Distribution Date until Western Atlas is able to arrange its own bonding
facilities; provided, however, that Western Atlas shall reimburse Litton for the
amount of any Losses on Litton bonds covering Western Atlas and the Western
Atlas Subsidiaries and shall also reimburse Litton for all fees and costs
incurred by Litton with respect to Litton bonds covering Western Atlas and the
Western Atlas Subsidiaries.

(g) For purposes of this Section 3.06, the term Western Atlas
Subsidiaries shall include WAII and its subsidiaries only to the extent that
WAII and its subsidiaries have participated in the Litton Insurance Program, and
the term Distribution Date means 12:00 midnight on the later of the date
determined by the Litton Board on which the Distribution shall be effected or
the later date agreed upon pursuant to subsection 3.06(a).

(h) In recognition that premiums, premium adjustments, retrospective
rating adjustments, assessments and audit adjustments have been paid or charged
to Western Atlas and the Western Atlas Subsidiaries prior to the Distribution
Date, and that similar such payments and charges will be made by and to Western
Atlas and the Western Atlas Subsidiaries after the Distribution Date (other than
with respect to WRH for periods ending on or before April 30, 1987), Litton
agrees to coordinate and consult with Western Atlas and the Western Atlas
Subsidiaries concerning the strategy to be pursued in insured litigation, and to
provide access to all litigation pleadings, and other documents and
correspondence, and copies thereof as requested by Western Atlas and the Western
Atlas Subsidiaries, with respect to all litigation and claims against or related
to Western Atlas and the Western Atlas Subsidiaries tendered pursuant to the
Litton Insurance Program, whether before or after the Distribution Date. Litton
further agrees to reasonably consult with Western Atlas

11

<PAGE>

prior to the commencement of any third-party action proposed in any such
litigation and to reasonably consider any objections to such action expressed by
Western Atlas; however, in circumstances in which the reasonable expectation is
that Western Atlas and or Western Atlas Subsidiaries will be financially
responsible for the entire result in the litigation, Litton shall not commence
any third-party action over the objections of Western Atlas or the Western Atlas
Subsidiaries. Further, Litton agrees that Western Atlas shall have full and
complete access, during normal business hours, to all insurance policies which
are or were included within the Litton Insurance Program at any time, including
the right to copy the same.

ARTICLE IV

Section 4.01 INDEMNIFICATION BY LITTON. Except with respect to
employee benefits or other Liabilities to employees, which shall be governed by
the Benefits Agreement, and except with respect to insurance and self-insurance
claims (other than insurance and self-insurance claims with respect to WRH for
periods ending on or prior to April 30, 1987), which shall be governed by
Sections 3.06 and 4.03 hereof, Litton shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Western Atlas, each Affiliate of Western Atlas and each of their respective
directors, officers, employees and agents (in their capacities as directors,
officers, employees and agents of Western Atlas and its Affiliates) and each of
the heirs, executors, successors and assigns of any of the foregoing (the
"Western Atlas Indemnitees") from and against any and all Losses of the Western
Atlas Indemnitees arising out of or due to the failure of Litton or any of its
Affiliates to pay, perform or otherwise discharge in due course any item set
forth on Schedule A. Anything in this Section 4.01 to the contrary not-
withstanding, neither Litton nor any Litton Subsidiary shall have any liability
whatsoever to either Western Atlas or any Western Atlas Subsidiary in respect of
any Tax (as such term is defined in the Tax Sharing Agreement), except as
otherwise provided in Schedule A hereto or in the Tax Sharing Agreement and the
Agreement between Litton and Western Research Holdings, Inc., dated March 17,
1994, referred to in Section 5.04 of the Tax Sharing Agreement (the "Western Tax
Agreement").

Section 4.02 INDEMNIFICATION BY WESTERN ATLAS. Except with respect
to employee benefits or other Liabilities to employees, which shall be governed
by the Benefits Agreement,

12

<PAGE>

and except with respect to insurance and self-insurance claims (other than
insurance and self-insurance claims with respect to WRH for periods ending on or
prior to April 30, 1987), which shall be governed by Sections 3.06 and 4.03
hereof, Western Atlas shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Litton, each
Affiliate of Litton and each of their respective directors, officers, employees
and agents (in their capacities as directors, officers, employees and agents of
Litton and its Affiliates) and each of the heirs, executors, successors and
assigns of any of the foregoing (the "Litton Indemnitees") from and against any
and all Losses of the Litton Indemnitees arising out of or due to the failure of
Western Atlas or any of its Affiliates to pay, perform or otherwise discharge in
due course any item set forth on Schedule B. Anything in this Section 4.02 to
the contrary notwithstanding, neither Western Atlas nor any Western Atlas
Subsidiary shall have any liability whatsoever to either Litton or any Litton
Subsidiary in respect of any Tax, except as otherwise provided in Schedule B
hereto or in the Tax Sharing Agreement or the Western Tax Agreement.

Section 4.03 LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS. The amount
that any party (an "Indemnifying Party") is or may be required to pay to any
other party (an "Indemnitee") pursuant to Section 4.01 or Section 4.02 shall be
reduced (including, without limitation, retroactively) by any Insurance Proceeds
or other amounts actually recovered by or on behalf of such Indemnitee, in
reduction of the related Loss. If an Indemnitee shall have received the payment
required by this Agreement from an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Loss and
shall subsequently actually receive Insurance Proceeds or other amounts in
respect of such Loss, then such Indemnitee shall pay to such Indemnifying Party
a sum equal to the amount of such Insurance Proceeds or other amounts actually
received (up to but not in excess of the amount of any indemnity payment made
hereunder). An insurer who would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall
not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto, or, solely by virtue
of the indemnification provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights with
respect thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer or any
other third party shall be entitled to a "windfall" (I.E., a benefit they would
not be entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions
hereof) by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof.

Section 4.04 PROCEDURES FOR INDEMNIFICATION OF THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS.
Procedures for Indemnification of Third-Party Claims shall be as follows:

13

<PAGE>

(a) If an Indemnitee shall receive notice or otherwise learn of the
assertion or probable assertion by a person (including, without limitation, any
governmental entity) who is not a party to this Agreement or to any of the
agreements in the form of Annexes A through G hereto or to the Western Tax
Agreement (hereinafter referred to as the "Other Agreements") of any claim or of
the commencement by any such person of any Action (a "Third-Party Claim") with
respect to which an Indemnifying Party may be obligated to provide
indemnification pursuant to Section 4.01, 4.02 or any other Section of this
Agreement or pursuant to the Other Agreements, such Indemnitee shall give such
Indemnifying Party written notice thereof promptly after becoming aware of such
Third-Party Claim; PROVIDED that the failure of any Indemnitee to give notice as
provided in this Section 4.04(a) shall not relieve the related Indemnifying
Party of its obligations under this Article IV, unless the notice was
intentionally withheld and such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure
to give notice. Such notice shall describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable
detail and, if ascertainable, shall indicate the amount (estimated if necessary)
of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by such Indemnitee.

(b) An Indemnifying Party may elect to defend or to seek to settle or
compromise, at such Indemnifying Party's own expense and by such Indemnifying
Party's own counsel, any Third-Party Claim. Within 30 days of the receipt of
notice from an Indemnitee in accordance with Section 4.04(a) (or sooner, if the
nature of such Third-Party Claim so requires), the Indemnifying Party shall
notify the Indemnitee of its election whether the Indemnifying Party will assume
responsibility for defending such Third-Party Claim, which election shall
specify any reservations or exceptions. After notice from an Indemnifying Party
to an Indemnitee of its election to assume the defense of a Third-Party Claim,
such Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnitee under this
Article IV for any legal or other expenses (except expenses approved in advance
by the Indemnifying Party) subsequently incurred by such Indemnitee in
connection with the defense thereof; PROVIDED that if the defendants in any such
claim include both the Indemnifying Party and one or more Indemnitees and in any
Indemnitee's reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between one or more of
such Indemnitees and such Indemnifying Party exists in respect of such claim or
if the Indemnifying Party shall have assumed responsibility for such claim with
any reservations or exceptions, such Indemnitees shall have the right to employ
separate counsel to represent such Indemnitees and in that event the reasonable
fees and expenses of such separate counsel (but not more than one separate
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the

14

<PAGE>

Indemnifying Party) shall be paid by such Indemnifying Party; provided, however,
if and to the extent that there is a conflict of defenses or positions among the
Indemnitees, the Indemnitees shall have the right to retain such number of
additional separate counsel, reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying Party,
as is reasonably necessary to avoid such conflicts, and the Indemnifying Party
shall be responsible for the reasonable fees and expenses of such additional
separate counsel. If an Indemnifying Party elects not to assume responsibility
for defending a Third-Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnitee of its
election as provided in this Section 4.04(b), such Indemnitee may defend or
(subject to the remainder of this Section 4.04(b)) seek to compromise or settle
such Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither an Indemnifying
Party nor an Indemnitee may settle or compromise any claim over the objection of
the other; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that consent to settlement or compromise shall not
be unreasonably withheld; and PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, if the Indemnifying
Party has not affirmatively elected by written notice to the Indemnitee within
30 days of notice from the Indemnitee to assume the defense of, or to seek to
settle or compromise the Third-Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party has not
similarly acknowledged, within such 30-day period, its responsibility to
indemnify the Indemnitee against the Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitee may
settle or compromise the Third-Party Claim over the objections of the
Indemnifying Party without prejudice to the Indemnitee's claim against the
Indemnifying Party. Neither an Indemnifying Party nor an Indemnitee shall
consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of any Third-Party
Claim which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the
claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnitee, in the case of a consent or settlement
by an Indemnifying Party, or the Indemnifying Party, in the case of a consent or
settlement by the Indemnitee, of a written release from all liability in respect
to such Third-Party Claim.

(c) If an Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or to seek to
compromise or settle any Third-Party Claim, the related Indemnitee shall make
available to such Indemnifying Party any personnel or any books, records or
other documents within its control or which it otherwise has the ability to make
available that are necessary or appropriate for such defense, settlement or
compromise, and shall otherwise cooperate in the defense, settlement or
compromise of such Third-Party Claims. The Indemnifying Party shall promptly
reimburse the Indemnitee its out-of-pocket costs incurred in providing
assistance pursuant to the foregoing sentence and for the Indemnitee's personnel
costs on any occasion on which

15

<PAGE>

personnel of the Indemnitee spend one full day or more in providing such
assistance.

(d) Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 4.04 to the
contrary, if an Indemnifying Party notifies the related Indemnitee in writing of
such Indemnifying Party's desire to settle or compromise a Third-Party Claim on
the basis set forth in such notice (provided that such settlement or compromise
includes as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or
plaintiff of a written release of the Indemnitee from all liability in respect
thereof) and the Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnifying Party in writing that
such Indemnitee declines to accept any such settlement or compromise, such
Indemnitee may continue to contest such Third-Party Claim, free of any
participation by such Indemnifying Party, at such Indemnitee's sole expense. In
such event, the obligation of such Indemnifying Party to such Indemnitee with
respect to such Third-Party Claim shall be equal to (i) the costs and expenses
of such Indemnitee prior to the date such Indemnifying Party notifies such
Indemnitee of the offer to settle or compromise (to the extent such costs and
expenses are otherwise indemnifiable hereunder) PLUS (ii) the lesser of (A) the
amount of any offer of settlement or compromise that such Indemnitee declined to
accept and (B) the actual out-of-pocket amount such Indemnitee is obligated to
pay subsequent to such date as a result of such Indemnitee's continuing to
pursue such Third-Party Claim.

(e) Any claim on account of a Loss that does not result from a
Third-Party Claim shall be asserted by written notice given by the Indemnitee to
the related Indemnifying Party. Such Indemnifying Party shall have a period of
30 days after the receipt of such notice within which to respond thereto. If
such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such 30-day period, such
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have refused to accept responsibility to
make payment. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such 30-day
period or rejects such claim in whole or in part, such Indemnitee shall be free
to pursue such remedies as may be available to such party under this Agreement
or under applicable law.

(f) In addition to any adjustments required pursuant to Section 4.03,
if the amount of any Loss shall, at any time subsequent to the payment required
by this Agreement, be reduced by recovery, settlement or otherwise, the amount
of such reduction that has been received by the Indemnitee, less any expenses
incurred in connection therewith, shall promptly be repaid by the Indemnitee to
the Indemnifying Party.

16

<PAGE>

(g) In the event of payment by an Indemnifying Party to any
Indemnitee in connection with any Third-Party Claim, such Indemnifying Party
shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such Indemnitee as to any

(a) At the discretion of the Arbitrator, an administrative conference
with the Arbitrator and the parties and/or their representatives will be
scheduled in appropriate cases to expedite the Arbitration proceedings.
(b) It is intended that the Arbitration be conducted in an
expeditious manner and without evidentiary hearing or oral presentation and
argument, unless the Arbitrator determines that an evidentiary hearing, and/or
oral presentation or argument is required for the rendition of an award or a
decision. However, any such evidentiary hearing shall be limited to not more
than fifteen days, and oral presentation and argument shall be limited to eight
hours, with time equally divided between the parties.
(c) On such schedule as may be established by the Arbitrator, each of
the parties shall submit simultaneous briefs, including exhibits, to the

the number of pages included in such briefs or to the number of exhibits. Each
party shall have a reasonable opportunity, as determined by the Arbitrator, to
reply to the brief of the other. The Arbitrator shall have the right to request
additional written

<PAGE>

statements of all or any of the parties; provided that each party shall have the
reasonable opportunity to reply to any such additional statements submitted in

be final and binding.

3. DATE, TIME AND PLACE OF HEARING. The Arbitrator shall set the date,
time, and place for any hearing. The Arbitrator shall mail to each party notice
thereof at least ten days in advance, unless the parties by mutual agreement

<PAGE>

testify under oath administered by any duly qualified person and, if it is
required by law, shall do so.

6. ORDER OF PROCEEDINGS AND COMMUNICATION WITH ARBITRATOR.
(a) A hearing shall be opened by the filing of the oath of the
Arbitrator, where required, and by the recording of the date, time, and place of
the hearing, and the presence of the Arbitrator, the parties, and their
representatives, if any.

law provides to the contrary, the Arbitration may proceed in the absence of any
party or representative who, after due notice, fails to be present or fails to
obtain a postponement ("absent in default"). An award shall not be made solely
on the default of a party. The Arbitrator shall require the party who is
present to submit such evidence as the Arbitrator may require for the making of
an award.

8. EVIDENCE.
(a) The parties may offer such evidence as is relevant and material
to the dispute and shall produce such evidence as the Arbitrator may deem
necessary to an understanding and determination of the dispute.

materiality of the evidence offered, and conformity to legal rules of evidence
shall not be necessary. All evidence shall be taken in the presence of the
Arbitrator and all of the parties, except where any of the parties is absent in

4

<PAGE>

9. EVIDENCE BY AFFIDAVIT AND POST-HEARING FILING OF DOCUMENTS OR OTHER

other evidence be submitted to the Arbitrator after the hearing, the documents
or other evidence shall be filed with the Arbitrator. All parties shall be

later than that set for the receipt of briefs, the later date shall be the date
of closing of the hearing.

11. REOPENING OF HEARING. The hearing may be reopened on the Arbitrator's
initiative at any time before the award is made. If reopening the hearing would
prevent the making of

5

<PAGE>

the award within the specified time limit, the matter may not be reopened unless
the parties agree on an extension of time.

12. WAIVER OF ORAL HEARING. The parties may provide, by written
agreement, for the waiver of oral hearing in any case.

briefs, statements and proofs to the Arbitrator.

the course of the Arbitration, the Arbitrator may set forth the terms of the
agreed settlement in an award. Such an award is referred to as a consent award.

addressed to a party or its representative at the last known address, personal
service of the award, or the filing of the award in any other manner that is
permitted by law.

resolution of such disputed Litton Adjustment as soon as
practicable, and, if such resolution differs from the manner in
which the disputed Litton Adjustment was reflected on Litton's

federal income tax liability of the Litton Group for any taxable year after
fiscal 1982 and that certain members of the Western Atlas Group were included in
the Litton Consolidated Group from the beginning of fiscal 1983 through the
Distribution Date. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Litton and
each member of the Litton Group shall jointly and severally indemnify Western
Atlas and each member of the Western Atlas Group against and hold them harmless
from federal income taxes for all periods beginning before the Distribution Date
and shall be entitled to receive and retain all refunds of federal income taxes
with respect to periods beginning before the Distribution Date.

(b) If as a result of any audit, amendment or other change in a
consolidated federal income tax return as filed by Litton with respect to any
period beginning before the Distribution Date, the Final Determination of an
adjustment to any Tax Item generates a Tax Detriment for any period beginning
before the Distribution Date and a corresponding Tax Benefit for Western Atlas
or any of the Western Atlas Businesses for any period beginning after the
Distribution Date (a "Reimbursable Adjustment"), then Litton shall notify
Western Atlas of such Reimbursable Adjustment.

-19-

<PAGE>

(c) Within ninety (90) days of receiving notice of a Reimbursable
Adjustment that generates a Tax Benefit for Western Atlas or any member of the
Western Atlas Group for any taxable period(s) with respect to which (i) a
federal income tax return has been filed, and (ii) the applicable statute of
limitations has not expired, Western Atlas (or the appropriate member of the
Western Atlas Group) shall file a refund claim pursuant to Code Section 6511
reflecting such Tax Benefit. Western Atlas shall, within 10 days after receipt,
pay to Litton any refunds received by Western Atlas resulting from the filing of
a refund claim pursuant to the preceding sentence, together with any interest
refunded with respect thereto. In the event that Western Atlas would have
received a refund with respect to such claim had such refund not been offset by
the United States Government against deficiencies, interest or penalties
assessed against Western Atlas or any member of the Western Atlas Group, Western
Atlas shall pay to Litton, within 10 days after receipt of written notice of
such offset, an amount equal to the amount of such offset, together with
interest at the overpayment rate established under Section 6621 of the Code. If,
for any taxable year, Western Atlas is required to and does make a repayment to
the IRS of any portion of a refund described herein, then Litton shall pay to
Western Atlas, within 10 days following the date Western Atlas notifies Litton
of such repayment, the amount of such repayment, including related interest.

<PAGE>

(d) In the event that Western Atlas receives notice of a Reimbursable
Adjustment that generates a Tax Benefit for Western Atlas or any member of the
Western Atlas Group for any taxable period(s) with respect to which a federal
income tax return has not been filed, then Western Atlas (or the appropriate
member of the Western Atlas Group) shall file federal Form 1120(s) reflecting
such Tax Benefit and shall pay to Litton, no later than thirty (30) days after
the filing of such return(s), the amount by which such Tax Benefit actually
reduces the federal income taxes payable by Western Atlas or such member of the
Western Atlas Group with respect to such taxable period(s), using the
appropriate statutory income tax rate applicable to such period(s). If, pursuant
to a Final Determination for any taxable year, Western Atlas is required to and
does make a payment to the IRS representing any portion of the amount paid to
Litton pursuant to the preceding sentence, then Litton shall pay to Western
Atlas, within 10 days following the date Western Atlas notifies Litton of such
payment to the IRS, the amount of such payment, including related interest.

(e) Litton may notify Western Atlas of a Reimbursable Adjustment prior
to the Final Determination of such adjustment if Litton, in its sole discretion,
determines that such Reimbursable Adjustment may, upon Final Determination,
generate a Tax Benefit for Western Atlas with

-21-

<PAGE>

respect to which a refund claim may be barred by the applicable statute of
limitations. If Litton so requests, Western Atlas shall file a refund claim for
the appropriate taxable period(s) reflecting such Tax Benefit, and shall pay to
Litton any Tax and interest refunded with respect thereto under the terms and
conditions set forth in subsection (c) of this Section 3.03. All refund claims
filed by Western Atlas pursuant to this Section 3.03(e) shall be prepared in
cooperation with Litton, shall fully explain the circumstances giving rise to
the claim and shall be identified with the notation "Protective Claim".

(f) If as a result of any audit, amendment or other change in a
federal income tax return filed by Western Atlas with respect to any period
beginning after the Distribution Date, an adjustment to any Tax Item generates a
Tax Detriment to Western Atlas or any Western Atlas Business and a corresponding
Tax Benefit for Litton or any Litton Business for any taxable period, then the
provisions of subsections (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 3.03 shall be
applied by substituting Litton for Western Atlas and Western Atlas for Litton,
as the context requires.

(g) Any payment not made on or before the last day on which such
payment could be timely made under this Section 3.03 shall thereafter bear
interest at the rate established for large corporate underpayments pursuant to
Section 6621(c)(1) of the Code.

-22-

(h) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
(1) the total amount payable by Western Atlas to Litton with respect to any
Reimbursable Adjustment pursuant to subsections (c), (d) and/or (e) of this
Section 3.03, together with the amount (if any) paid to Litton pursuant to
Section 3(a) of the Dresser Agreement with respect to the same adjustment, shall
not exceed the amount of the Taxes (excluding penalties) paid by Litton with
respect to such adjustment; and (2) no payment shall be made under this Section
3.03 by either party in respect of a Tax Benefit recognized by such party as a
result of (i) a stock for stock exchange; (ii) a statutory merger; or (iii) a
sale of assets for consideration other than cash, cash equivalents (within the
meaning of Rev. Rul. 66-290, 1966-2 C.B. 112) ("Cash Equivalents") and/or notes
or other obligations which provide for ultimate payment in cash or Cash
Equivalents.

any audit, amendment or other change in a state or local tax return or any Other
Tax Return filed with respect to any period beginning before the Distribution
Date, there is an adjustment to any Tax Item, then Litton shall be responsible
for and shall hold Western Atlas harmless from any such adjustment generated by
or attributable to Litton or any Litton

-23-

<PAGE>

Business (a "Litton Issue"), and Western Atlas shall be responsible for and
shall hold Litton harmless from any such adjustment generated by or attributable
to Western Atlas or any Western Atlas Business (a "Western Atlas Issue"). If a
Western Atlas Issue arises with respect to a Joint Return, then (1) any contest
of such Western Atlas Issue shall be controlled by Litton and (2) any amounts
payable by or to Western Atlas in respect of such Western Atlas Issue shall be
determined in a manner consistent with past practice by Litton, whose good faith
determination shall be binding on the parties hereto.

(b) Any payment required to be made under this Section 3.04 shall be
exclusive of interest and penalties and shall be made no later than 10 days
after the party required to make such payment receives written notice of a Final
Determination of the Litton Issue or Western Atlas Issue, as the case may be,
giving rise to such payment; provided, however, that no payment shall be due
under this Section 3.04 unless the total amount payable with respect to any
individual state or local return or Other Tax Return by Litton or by Western
Atlas, as the case may be, equals or exceeds $5,000. Any payment not made within
the 10-day period described in the preceding sentence shall thereafter bear
interest at the rate established for large corporate underpayments pursuant to
Section 6621(c)(1) of the Code.

the payment of all Taxes, penalties and interest whenever assessed, due or
payable in connection therewith and shall be entitled to all refunds, whenever
granted, attributable thereto, regardless of whether such legal entity is a
member of the Litton Group or the Western Atlas Group before or after the

provision of this Agreement to the contrary, and except as otherwise provided in

and severally indemnify Western Atlas and each member of the Western Atlas Group
against and hold them harmless from any payment of Restructuring Taxes in excess

-25-

<PAGE>

(b) In the event that any Restructuring Taxes are attributable to the
acquisition ("Acquisition") of fifty percent (50%) or more of the stock or
assets of Litton or Western Atlas by an Unrelated Person, then the party so
acquired, or the party whose assets were so acquired, as the case may be, shall
pay and shall indemnify and hold harmless the other party to this Agreement from
and against any and all Restructuring Taxes and from and against any costs
whatsoever connected with such taxes, including, but not limited to, fees,

to such member) incurs a net operating loss that may be carried back to a
Pre-Distribution Year in which such member was a member of the Litton
Consolidated Group, such member shall make an election pursuant to Section
172(b)(3) of the Code, unless Litton, in its sole discretion, consents to treat
such net operating loss as a Carryback Item pursuant to paragraph (b) of this

the United States Government against deficiencies, interest or penalties
assessed against the Litton Consolidated Group or any member thereof (other than
deficiencies, interest or penalties attributable to (i) the operations of the
Western Atlas Group and with respect to which the Western Atlas Group would
otherwise be responsible under the terms of this Agreement or (ii) a taxable

with interest at the overpayment rate established under Section 6621 of the
Code. To the extent that a member of the Litton Group or a member of the Western
Atlas Group receives a double benefit as a result of this Section 3.08(b) and
the operation of the Code, Litton or Western Atlas, respectively, will
compensate

-28-

<PAGE>

foreign tax receipts with respect to periods beginning before the Distribution

However, neither party or its employees shall make any voluntary disclosures to

promptly of any such Final Determination.

the case may be, fails to provide any information requested pursuant to Section
3.01(b)(1), Section 3.02(a) or this Section 4.02 by (i) the date(s) specified in
such Section or (ii) if no date is specified, within a reasonable period, as

pursuant to Section 3.01(b)(1) or Section 3.02(a) of this Agreement, and
otherwise upon 30 days' notice after the expiration of such reasonable period,
to permit any such public accountant full access to all appropriate records or
other information in the possession of any member of the Litton Group or the

to all issues raised by the taxing authority with whom the
settlement was made in a Revenue Agent's Report or similar
document) relative to the costs and risks of litigation. Upon
making determinations with respect to all issues in dispute the

its own similar information.

Section 5.17. LIMITATION ON WAIVERS. The provisions of this Agreement
may be waived only if the waiver is in writing and signed by the party making
the waiver. No delay or omission in exercising any right under this Agreement
will operate as a waiver of the right on any further occasion. No waiver of any
particular provision of this Agreement will be treated as a waiver of any other
provision, and no waiver of any rights will be deemed a continuing waiver of the
same right with respect to subsequent occurrences that give rise to it. All

EXHIBIT "A"

ARBITRATION PROCEDURAL RULES

1. Administration and Conduct of Arbitration.

(a) At the discretion of the Arbitrator, an administrative conference
with the Arbitrator and the parties and/or their representatives will be
scheduled in appropriate cases to expedite the Arbitration proceedings.

(b) It is intended that the Arbitration be conducted in an
expeditious manner and without evidentiary hearing or oral presentation and
argument, unless the Arbitrator determines, at any time, that an evidentiary
hearing, and/or oral presentation or argument is desired by the Arbitrator for
the rendition of an award or a decision. However, the Arbitrator shall fix
limits on the duration of any such evidentiary hearing and/or oral presentation
and argument, in advance, with time equally divided between the parties.

(c) On such schedule as may be established by the Arbitrator, each of
the parties shall submit simultaneous briefs, including exhibits, to the
Arbitrator supporting their respective positions. There shall be no limit to
the

<PAGE>

number of pages included in such briefs or to the number of exhibits. Each
party shall have a reasonable opportunity, as determined by the Arbitrator, to
reply to the brief of the other. The Arbitrator shall have the right to request
additional written statements of all or any of the parties; provided that each
party shall have the reasonable opportunity to reply to any such additional
statements submitted in response to the request of the Arbitrator.

2. Fixing of Locale.

The parties may mutually agree to the locale where the Arbitration is
to be held. If the parties cannot agree on the locale, the Arbitrator shall
have the power to determine the locale and its decision shall be final and
binding.

3. Date, Time and Place of Hearing.

The Arbitrator shall set the date, time, and place for any hearing.
The Arbitrator shall mail to each party notice thereof at least ten days in
advance, unless the parties by mutual agreement waive such notice or modify the
terms thereof.

4. Postponements.

<PAGE>

The Arbitrator for good cause shown may postpone any hearing upon the
request of a party or upon the Arbitrator's own initiative, and shall also grant
such postponement when all of the parties agree thereto.

5. Oaths.

Before proceeding with the first hearing, the Arbitrator may take an
oath of office and, if required by law, shall do so. The Arbitrator may require
witnesses to testify under oath administered by any duly qualified person and,
if it is required by law, shall do so.

6. Order of Proceedings and Communication
with Arbitrator.

(a) A hearing shall be opened by the filing of the oath of the
Arbitrator, where required, and by the recording of the date, time, and place of
the hearing, and the presence of the Arbitrator, the parties, and their
representatives, if any.

(b) The Arbitrator may, at the beginning of the hearing, ask for
statements clarifying the issues involved.

(c) The complaining party shall then present evidence and/or
argument, as required by the Arbitrator, to

<PAGE>

support its claim. The defending party shall then present evidence and/or
argument supporting its position and responding to the position of the other.
Witnesses, if any, for each party shall submit to questions or other
examination. The Arbitrator has the discretion to vary this procedure but,
within the time limits specified above, shall afford a full and equal
opportunity to all parties for the presentation of any material and relevant
evidence.

(d) Exhibits, when offered by either party, may be received in
evidence by the Arbitrator. The names and addresses of any witnesses and a
description of the exhibits in the order received shall be made a part of the
record.

(e) There shall be no direct communication between the parties and
the Arbitrator other than at oral hearing, unless the parties and the Arbitrator
agree in writing.

7. Arbitration in the Absence of a Party or
Representative

Unless the law provides to the contrary, the Arbitration may proceed
in the absence of any party or representative who, after due notice, fails to be
present or fails to obtain a postponement ("absence in default"). An award
shall not be made solely on the default of a party.

<PAGE>

The Arbitrator shall require the party who is present to submit such evidence as
the Arbitrator may require for the making of an award.

8. Evidence.

(a) The parties may offer such evidence as is relevant and material
to the dispute and shall produce such evidence as the Arbitrator may deem
necessary to an understanding and determination of the dispute.

(b) The Arbitrator shall be the judge of the relevance and
materiality of the evidence offered, and conformity to legal rules of evidence
shall not be necessary. All evidence shall be taken in the presence of the
Arbitrator and all of the parties, except where any of the parties is absent in
default or has waived the right to be present.

9. Evidence by Affidavit and Post-Hearing Filing of
Documents or Other Evidence.

(a) The Arbitrator may receive and consider the evidence of witnesses
by affidavit, but shall give it only such weight as the Arbitrator deems it to
be entitled to after consideration of any objection made to its admission.

<PAGE>

(b) If the parties agree or the Arbitrator directs that documents or
other evidence be submitted to the Arbitrator after the hearing, the documents
or other evidence shall be filed with the Arbitrator. All parties shall be
afforded an opportunity to examine such documents or other evidence.

10. Closing of Hearing.

If satisfied that the record is complete, the Arbitrator shall declare
the hearing closed and a minute thereof shall be recorded. If briefs are to be
filed, the hearing shall be declared closed as of the final date set by the
Arbitrator for the receipt of briefs. If documents are to be filed as provided
in Section 9 and the date set for their receipt is later than that set for the
receipt of briefs, the later date shall be the date of closing of the hearing.

11. Reopening of Hearing.

The hearing may be reopened on the Arbitrator's initiative at any time
before the award is made. If reopening the hearing would prevent the making of
the award within the specified time limit, the matter may not be reopened unless
the parties agree on an extension of time.

<PAGE>

12. Waiver of Oral Hearing.

The parties may provide, by written agreement, for the waiver of oral
hearing in any case.

13. Waiver of Rules.

Any party who proceeds with the Arbitration after knowledge that any
provision or requirement of these rules has not been complied with and who fails
to state an objection thereto in writing shall be deemed to have waived the
right to object.

14. Extensions of Time.

The parties may modify any period of time by mutual agreement. The
Arbitrator may for good cause extend any period of time established by these
rules, except the time for making the award. The Arbitrator shall notify the
parties of any extension.

15. Serving of Notice.

Each party shall be deemed to have consented that any papers, notices,
or process necessary or proper for the initiation or continuation of an
Arbitration under these rules, for any court action in connection therewith, or
for

<PAGE>

the entry of judgment on any award made under these rules may be served on a
party by mail addressed to the party or its representative at the last known
address or by personal service, in or outside the state where the Arbitration is
to be held, provided that reasonable opportunity to be heard with regard thereto
has been granted to the party.

16. Time of the Award.

The award shall be made promptly by the Arbitrator and, unless
otherwise agreed by the parties in writing or specified by law, no later than
thirty days from the date of closing the hearing, or, if oral hearings have not
been held, from the date of the transmittal of the final briefs, statements and
proofs to the Arbitrator.

17. Award upon Settlement.

If the parties settle their dispute during the course of the
Arbitration, the Arbitrator may set forth the terms of the agreed settlement in
an award. Such an award is referred to as a consent award.

18. Delivery of Award to Parties.

Parties shall accept as legal delivery of the award the placing of the
award or a true copy thereof in the

<PAGE>

mail addressed to a party or its representative at the last known address,
personal service of the award, or the filing of the award in any other manner
that is permitted by law.

19. Applications to Court and Exclusion of Liability.

(a) No judicial proceeding by a party relating to the subject matter
of the Arbitration shall be deemed a waiver of the party's right to arbitrate.

judgment upon the Arbitration award may be entered in any federal or state court
having jurisdiction thereof.

This Western Tax Agreement (the "Agreement") is

made and entered into on and as of March 17, 1994 by and

between Litton Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation

("Litton") and Western Research Holdings, Inc., a Delaware

corporation ("Western").

WHEREAS, Dresser Industries, Inc., a Delaware

corporation ("Dresser"), Litton and Western Geophysical

Company of America, a Delaware corporation (Western

Geophysical") executed an Amalgamation Agreement dated April

30, 1987, (the "Amalgamation Agreement") pursuant to which

Dresser contributed certain assets to Western Atlas

International, In. ("Western Atlas International") and

Litton caused Western Geophysical to contribute

substantially all of its assets to Western Atlas

International, in exchange for stock and the assumption of

certain liabilities by Western Atlas International;

WHEREAS, on the date of and in connection with the

Amalgamation agreement, dresser, Litton and Western Atlas

International entered into a Tax Separation and

in order to provide, among other things, for the allocation

among the parties of certain tax liabilities;

WHEREAS, Western is the successor by merger to

Western Geophysical;

<PAGE>

WHEREAS, on or about March 17, 1994 Litton intends

to distribute (the "Distribution") to holders of its common

stock all the issued and outstanding common stock of Western

Atlas Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Western Atlas");

WHEREAS, as a result of transactions contemplated

as part of the Distribution, Western will become a

subsidiary of Western Atlas;

WHEREAS, Litton and Western Atlas intend to enter

into a Tax Sharing Agreement in connection with the

Distribution to provide, among other things, for the

allocation of certain tax liabilities between Litton and its

present and future subsidiaries on the one hand, and Western

Atlas and its present and future subsidiaries on the other

(the "Tax Sharing Agreement");

WHEREAS, in light of the Distribution and the Tax

Sharing Agreement, the parties wish to clarify their

respective rights and obligations under the Litton/Dresser

Agreement;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual

promises made herein, the parties hereto agree for the

purpose of the Litton/Dresser Agreement only and for no

other purpose:

(1) As between the parties hereto, the term

(2) Litton agrees to pay any amounts payable by

"Litton Parties" pursuant to the Litton/Dresser Agreement;

underlying subsections (c) and (d) of Section 3.03 of the

Tax Sharing Agreement, and neither party shall be required

to make any payment pursuant to section 3 of the
