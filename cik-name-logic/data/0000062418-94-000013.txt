Item 2 - Acquisition and Disposition of Assets

On October 3, 1994, Mark IV Industries, Inc. (the "Company"), and its
wholly owned subsidiary, Mark IV Acquisition Corp. (the "Purchaser"), entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with Purolator
Products Company ("Purolator"). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the
Purchaser commenced a tender offer (the "Offer") for all outstanding shares of
Purolator's common stock (and associated preferred stock purchase rights), at
a price of $25.00 net per share in cash to the seller. Prior to the
commencement of the Offer, the Company beneficially owned 520,500 shares of
Purolator's common stock (4.69% of Purolator's outstanding common stock),
which shares were acquired by the Company in open market transactions. Upon
the expiration of the Offer at 12:00 Midnight on November 4, 1994, the Company
accepted for payment and thereby purchased approximately 10,236,000 additional
shares of Purolator's common stock (including approximately 342,070 shares
subject to guarantees of delivery), which, when combined with the shares
already owned by the Company, resulted in the Company's ownership of
approximately 96.9% of Purolator's outstanding common stock.

As a result of the Company acquiring in excess of 90% of Purolator's
outstanding common stock, and as provided for in the Merger Agreement, the
Company anticipates the Purchaser will be merged into Purolator as soon as
practicable pursuant to the short-form merger provision of Delaware law 
without the vote of the holders of Purolator common stock other than the 
Purchaser, (the "Merger"). In the Merger, each share of Purolator's common 
stock (other than shares held by the Company and its subsidiaries and those 
shares held by stockholders who properly exercise appraisal rights under 
Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive $25.00 per share in 
cash. The foregoing is a summary of the Merger Agreement. For additional 
information concerning the Merger Agreement and the Offer, reference is made 
to the Merger Agreement and the Offer to Purchase, incorporated by reference 
as exhibits hereto.

The total amount of funds required by the Company to purchase all of
Purolator's outstanding shares of common stock (including those acquired by
the Company prior to the commencement of the Offer) and to pay related fees
and expenses, is estimated to be approximately $286.3 million. The funds
required for such purchase was provided from bank borrowings under the
definitive credit agreement (the "Credit Agreement") which the Company entered
into with Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association and other
banks and financial institutions, as discussed in Item 5 of this Form 8-K. 
The Credit Agreement is incorporated by reference as an exhibit hereto.

Purolator's products include a broad range of filters and separation
systems used in automotive (principally aftermarket), marine, heating,
ventilation, air conditioning, and high-technology liquid-filtration
applications, and specialized industrial filters and separation systems. 
Purolator will be included in the Company's Power and Fluid Transfer business
segment. The Company presently intends to cause Purolator to continue to
devote its plant, equipment and other physical properties to the same purposes
for which they were used by Purolator prior to the consummation of the
Offer.Included in Item 7 are Purolator's historical financial statements (Item
7(a) exhibits 13.1 and 13.2) and pro forma financial information (Item 7(b)).

Item 5 - Other Events

On November 2, 1994, the Company entered into the Credit Agreement
referred to in Item 2 of this Form 8-K. The Credit Agreement provides for (i)
a five-year term loan in the principal amount of approximately $300 million
for the purpose of financing the acquisition of Purolator and to repay certain
Purolator debt, and (ii) a five-year revolving credit facility in an amount of
up to $350 million to be used to refinance amounts outstanding under the
Company's previously existing credit agreement and certain existing Purolator
debt, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes. The loans
outstanding under the Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company's option,
at (i) the reference rate of the agent acting on behalf of the financial
institutions, or (ii) under a LIBOR option with borrowing spreads of LIBOR
plus 0.55% to LIBOR plus 1.00% depending on the Company's consolidated
leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement). The Company is currently
paying interest on the loans at LIBOR plus 1.00% per annum. The Credit
Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants customary for
this type of agreement and is guaranteed by all of the Company's significant
domestic subsidiaries. All of such guarantees are collateralized by first
priority pledges of all outstanding capital stock of each guarantor
subsidiary. Reference is made to the definitive Credit Agreement for the
actual terms and conditions thereof, which has been incorporated by reference
as an exhibit hereto.

(b) Pro Forma Financial Information

The pro forma (unaudited) consolidated statements of income for the six
months ended August 31, 1994 and the fiscal year ended February 28, 1994 set
forth below present the results of operations of the Company for such period
and such year as if the following transactions had occurred on March 1, 1994,
the beginning of fiscal 1995, with respect to the consolidated statement of
income for the six months ended August 31, 1994, and on March 1, 1993, the
beginning of fiscal 1994, with respect to the consolidated statement of income
for the fiscal year ended February 28, 1994: (i) the consummation of the
Purolator acquisition in November 1994 and the borrowings under the Credit
Agreement in connection therewith; and (ii) the conversion in October 1994 of
approximately $76.7 million aggregate principal amount of the Company's 6 1/4%
Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2007 (the "Convertible Debentures")
into approximately 5,340,000 shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of
$14.3685 per share. The pro forma statement of income for the six months
ended August 31, 1994 combines, with appropriate adjustments, the Company's
unaudited consolidated results of operations for its six months ended August
31, 1994 and the unaudited consolidated results of operations of Purolator for
the same six-month period. The pro forma statement of income for the fiscal
year ended February 28, 1994 combines, with appropriate adjustments, the
Company's audited consolidated results of operations for its fiscal year ended
February 28, 1994 and the audited consolidated results of operations of
Purolator for its fiscal year ended December 31, 1993.

The pro forma (unaudited) consolidated condensed balance sheet as of
August 31, 1994 set forth below presents the financial position of the Company
as if the following transactions had occurred on August 31, 1994: (i) the
consummation of the Purolator acquisition in November 1994 and the borrowings
under the Credit Agreement in connection therewith; and (ii) the conversion in
October 1994 of approximately $76.7 million aggregate principal amount of
Convertible Debentures into approximately 5,340,000 shares of Common Stock at
a conversion price of $14.3685 per share. The pro forma balance sheet as of
August 31, 1994 combines, with appropriate adjustments, the Company's
unaudited consolidated condensed balance sheet as of August 31, 1994 and the
unaudited consolidated condensed balance sheet of Purolator as of that same
date.

The pro forma (unaudited) financial statements have been prepared on the
basis of preliminary assumptions and estimates. The pro forma financial
statements may not be indicative of the results that would have been achieved
if the Purolator acquisition and the borrowings under the Credit Agreement
in connection therewith and the conversion of Convertible Debentures had been
effected on the dates indicated or which may be achieved in the future. The
pro forma financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements of the Company, as well as Purolator's
consolidated financial statements identified in Item 7 (a) and included as
exhibits 13.1 and 13.2 hereto.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Purolator
Products Company (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31,
1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 1993,
1992 and 1991. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Purolator
Products Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December
31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

As explained in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
January 1, 1991, the Company changed its method of accounting for
postretirement benefit costs other than pensions.

PUROLATOR PRODUCTS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

Basis of Presentation

Effective December 21, 1992, Pennzoil Company ("Pennzoil" or the "Former
Parent") together with Purolator Products Company, a Delaware corporation
("Purolator" or the "Company"), sold 10,000,000 shares of common stock of
Purolator in concurrent domestic and international public offerings. 
Purolator did not receive any of the proceeds from the sales of shares held by
the Former Parent (8,500,000). As a result of the completion of the
offerings, the Former Parent does not own any shares of capital stock of the
Company. On January 11, 1993, the Company sold 1,100,000 shares of common
stock pursuant to the partial exercise of the over-allotment options granted
to the underwriters in connection with the public offerings.

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Purolator and its majority-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated.

Foreign Currency Translation

Foreign currency transactions and financial statements are translated in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 52,
Foreign Currency Translation. Assets and liabilities are translated to U.S.
dollars at the current exchange rate at the end of the period. Income and
expense accounts are translated using the weighted average exchange rate for
the period. Adjustments arising from translation of foreign financial
statements are reflected in the cumulative translation adjustment in the
equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. Transaction gains and
losses are included in net income (loss).

The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the effect
of fluctuating currency rates on certain liabilities, such as accounts
payable, that are denominated in foreign currencies. The contracts typically
provide for the exchange of different currencies at specified future dates and
rates. The gain or loss due to the difference between the forward exchange
rates of the contracts and current rates offsets in whole or in part the loss
or gain on the liabilities being hedged.

Inventories

Substantially all inventories are reported at cost, using the first-in, first-
out (FIFO) method, which is lower than market.

Land, Buildings and Equipment

Land, buildings and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is provided
generally on a straight-line basis over the estimated service lives of the
respective classes of property. Estimated service lives are as follows:

Years
Land improvements 10-35
Leasehold improvements 3-30
Buildings and improvements 3-66
Machinery and equipment 3-18

Amortization of leasehold improvements is based upon the terms of the
respective leases. Maintenance, repairs and betterments, including
replacement of minor items of physical properties, are charged to expense;
major additions to physical properties are capitalized. The cost of the
assets retired or sold is credited to the asset accounts and the related
accumulated depreciation is charged to the accumulated depreciation accounts. 
The gain or loss from sale or retirement of property, if any, is included in
net income (loss).

Investments

Common stock investments in entities in which the Company owns equity
interests ranging from 20 percent to 50 percent are accounted for under the
equity method, pursuant to which the Company's share of the affiliate's
operating results is included in net income (loss).

Intangible Assets

Intangible assets include goodwill which represents the excess of cost over
the amount ascribed to the net assets of ongoing businesses purchased and is
being amortized on a straight-line basis over a 40-year period.

The cost of internally developed patents is charged to expense as incurred. 
Purchased patents are amortized over their estimated economic lives.

Interest Rate Swap Agreement

During 1993, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement which
involved the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest payments
periodically over the life of the agreement without the exchange of the
underlying principal amounts. The differential to be paid or received is
recorded as an adjustment to interest expense over the life of the agreement.

Federal, State and Foreign Income Taxes

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes, which uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes. 
Under the liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be
in effect when the differences are expected to reverse.

The Company and its United States subsidiaries are included in the Former
Parent's consolidated United States federal income tax returns for the year
ended December 31, 1991 and the period from January 1, 1992 through December
21, 1992. The Company and the Former Parent previously entered into a tax
sharing agreement ("Tax Sharing Agreement") which was intended to put the
Company in the same position with regard to the amount of federal income taxes
that it would pay if it filed a separate tax return. The agreement also
provided that the Company would be reimbursed by the Former Parent for any tax
losses or credits of the Company utilized by the Former Parent consolidated
return group. The Tax Sharing Agreement was terminated effective September
30, 1992. The Company received no benefit for federal income tax losses
which were generated during the period October 1, 1992 through December 21,
1992. The Company filed a separate federal income tax return for the period
from December 22, 1992 through December 31, 1992.

Capitalized Leases

Assets and related obligations under certain long-term leases are capitalized.
The related depreciation and the imputed interest expense are charged against
income in lieu of lease rental expense.

Earnings (Loss) Per Share

Earnings (loss) per share are calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Stock options
have been excluded from the calculations as their dilutive effect is not
significant.

Cash Flows Information

For purposes of the consolidated statements of cash flows, all highly liquid
investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less are considered
to be cash equivalents. The effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on
cash balances is immaterial.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of
each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate
that value:

Cash and Short-term Investments: 

The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity
of those instruments.

Notes Receivable:

The carrying amount approximates fair value because interest rates are at
or close to a reasonable market rate.

Long-term Debt:

The carrying amount approximates fair value because of the frequent
repricing on revolving facilities.

Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts:

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by
obtaining a quote from a commercial bank. The carrying amount
approximates fair value.

Interest Rate Swap Agreement:

The fair value of the Company's interest rate swap agreement is the
estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the
agreement. Based on a quote from a commercial bank, the carrying amount
of the swap agreement approximates the fair value.

Reclassifications

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current
year presentations. These reclassifications have no impact on net income
(loss).

The Company amended its credit facility with a group of banks and Texas
Commerce Bank National Association ("TCB"), as agent, (the "Credit Facility")
during the fourth quarter of 1993. The amended agreement expands the total
funds available under the revolving credit agreement by $20.0 million. The
Credit Facility provides the Company with the ability to make individual
acquisitions up to $20.0 million without the consent of the lenders under the
Credit Facility and up to $45.0 million in the aggregate ("permitted
acquisitions"). At December 31, 1993, the Credit Facility provided for a
$65.0 million revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility") and
a $31.0 million term loan (the "Term Loan"). Up to $7.0 million of the
Revolving Credit Facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit. 
The aggregate amount available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit
Facility is limited to an amount equal to a specified borrowing base
(generally consisting of 80 percent of certain accounts receivable balances
and 45 percent of certain inventory balances of the Company and certain
subsidiaries, with the inventory portion of the borrowing base not to exceed
50 percent of the borrowing base). At December 31, 1993, the Credit Facility
provided for quarterly principal payments on the Term Loan of $1.0 million
beginning on March 31, 1994, escalating to $1.44 million on March 31, 1996. 
The final maturities of the Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan are
four years and seven years, respectively, from the establishment of the
original credit facility ("TCB Credit Facility") on December 14, 1992. 
Interest on the Revolving Credit Facility is at a variable rate equal to, at
the option of the Company, LIBOR plus 1.75 percent, or the agent bank's "base
rate" plus one percent. Interest on the Term Loan is at a variable rate equal
to, at the option of the Company, LIBOR plus two percent, or the agent bank's
"base rate" plus one percent. The interest rates for both the Revolving
Credit Facility and the Term Loan are subject to reduction based upon the
ratio of the total committed debt under the Credit Facility to the Company's
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, obsolescence and amortization
("EBITDA"). 

Borrowings under the Credit Facility are collateralized by liens on
substantially all accounts receivable and inventory and certain patents and
trademarks of the Company and certain subsidiaries, together with a pledge of
all the capital stock of such subsidiaries, and are guaranteed by certain of
those subsidiaries. The terms of the Credit Facility require the Company to
meet certain financial covenants. The primary financial covenants require
that the company maintain (i) net worth; as defined, $175.1 million at
December 31, 1993; (ii) a current ratio greater than 1.5-to-1.0; and (iii) a
fixed charge coverage ratio greater than 1.25-to-1.0 (1.0-to-1.0 inclusive of
dividends).

Additionally, certain covenants contained in the Credit Facility, among other
things, generally (i) restrict the Company's incurrence of additional
indebtedness or contractual contingent obligations to an aggregate of $7.5
million; (ii) prohibit the encumbrance of the Company's assets and the
creation of negative pledges; (iii) restrict the transfer of the Company's
assets (including dispositions of capital stock of certain of the Company's
subsidiaries); (iv) prohibit the Company from engaging in any merger,
consolidation or asset disposition transaction (except for disposition of
previously scheduled non-producing assets); and (v) limit the Company's
investments, other than permitted acquisitions, and extensions of credit in
excess of $3.0 million.

The Company leases certain of its plant facilities and equipment under capital
leases. Lease payments are scheduled to coincide with the liquidation of the
related debt obligations of the lessors.

Future maturities of long-term debt and the minimum future annual obligations
on all capitalized leases in effect as of December 31, 1993 are presented in
the table below (expressed in thousands):

$38,971

At December 31, 1993, the Company had available revolving credit facilities
aggregating $67.3 million with $10.1 million drawn under these facilities.

As required by the Credit Facility, the Company entered into an interest rate
agreement during 1993 to effectively fix or place a limit upon the interest
payable with respect to at least 50% of the principal amount of the Term Loan. 
At December 31, 1993, the Company had outstanding an interest rate swap
agreement with a commercial bank. Under the interest rate swap agreement, the
Company pays an effective fixed interest rate of approximately 6.7% on a
notional principal amount of $17.0 million. The agreement expires in 1996.

4. INCOME TAXES:

The Company adopted SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, effective
January 1, 1993. There was no cumulative effect of adopting SFAS No. 109 on
net income for the year ended December 31, 1993. Deferred income taxes
reflect the net tax effects of (i) temporary differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the
amounts used for income tax purposes, and (ii) operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. The effects of significant items comprising the Company's net
deferred tax asset are as follows:

Valuation allowance for deferred tax assets (37,147) (40,234)
22,016 14,416
Net deferred tax asset $ 7,516 $ - 

Due to its recent history of losses, the Company applied valuation allowances
against all of its net deferred tax assets as of January 1, 1993. The net
change of $3.1 million in the valuation allowance was attributable to (i)
current year temporary differences, (ii) federal and state current income
taxes paid or payable, and (iii) utilization of pre-acquisition net operating
loss carryforwards to reduce goodwill.

At December 31, 1993, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $3.4
million available to offset future federal taxable income. The net operating
loss carryforwards expire as follows: $1.1 million in 2003 and $2.3 million
in 2004. The future utilization of these net operating loss carryforwards
will result in a reduction of goodwill. The Company has net state operating
loss carryforwards of $14.5 million available to offset future state taxable
income. The state net loss carryforwards begin to expire in 1999.

5. BENEFIT PLANS:

Stock Option Plans

In November 1992, the Company established the 1992 Stock Option Plan ("1992
Plan"). Awards under the 1992 Plan are to be made to those persons who hold
positions of responsibility and whose performance can have a significant
effect on the success of the Company and its subsidiaries. An award consists
of an option to purchase a specified number of shares of common stock at a
specified price that is not less than the fair market value of the common
stock on the date of grant of the option. All options granted under the 1992
Plan are ten-year non-qualified options and become exercisable in 33-1/3%
increments on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of
grant. The Company has reserved 387,500 shares of common stock for awards
made under the 1992 plan.

In May 1993, the stockholders approved the 1993 Nonemployee Director Stock
Option Plan ("1993 Plan"). The 1993 Plan is intended as an incentive to
attract and retain, as independent directors of the Company, persons of
training, experience and ability, to encourage the sense of proprietorship of
such persons and to stimulate their active interest in the development and
financial success of the Company. Under the 1993 Plan, nonemployee members of
the Company's board of directors receive nondiscretionary automatic grants of
non-qualified options to purchase 500 shares of common stock upon becoming a
director of the Company (persons who were serving as nonemployee directors as
of May 20, 1993, the date of implementation of the plan, were granted their
500 share options as of that date). In addition, beginning in 1994, each
person serving as a nonemployee director on January 1 of each calendar year
will automatically be granted options to purchase an additional 1,000 shares
of common stock, subject to the availability for issuance of such shares under
the 1993 Plan. All options granted under the 1993 Plan have an exercise price
equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of
the grant and become exercisable in increments of 50% on the first anniversary
of the date of grant and 25% on each of the second and third anniversaries of
the date of grant. The Company has reserved 50,000 shares of common stock for
awards made under the 1993 Plan.

Long-Term Incentive Plan

In February 1994, the Company adopted the 1994 Long-Term Incentive Plan ("1994
Plan"). The 1994 Plan is intended to provide an incentive that will allow the
Company to retain key executives and other selected employees and reward them
for making major contributions to the success of the Company and its
subsidiaries. Awards that can be made under the 1994 Plan include (i) stock
options (both non-qualified stock options and incentive stock options); (ii)
stock appreciation rights; (iii) stock; and (iv) cash. The exercise price of
stock options granted under the 1994 Plan may not be less than the par value
of the underlying common stock on the date of grant of the option. The
Company has reserved 500,000 shares of common stock for awards granted under
the 1994 Plan. All awards made under the 1994 Plan for the year ended
December 31, 1993 were in the form of non-qualified stock options with
exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the
date of grant.

The number and option price of options granted under the Company's stock
option plans and long-term incentive plan were as follows:
Number of Price Per
Shares Share 
Outstanding at January 1, 1992 - -
Granted 287,000 $15.00
Exercised - -
Cancelled - - 
Outstanding at December 31, 1992 287,000 $15.00
Granted 132,430 $17.75 - $19.75
Exercised - -
Cancelled (4,910) $15.00 
Outstanding at December 31, 1993 414,520 $15.00 - $19.75
Exercisable at December 31, 1993 94,030 $15.00 

Shares of common stock reserved for future grants at December 31, 1993 and
1992 were 522,980 and 100,500, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plan

In November 1993, the Company adopted the Deferred Compensation Plan (the
"Plan") as an incentive for certain employee directors, officers and other key
employees of the Company or its subsidiaries to encourage them to remain in
the employ of the Company or of its subsidiaries. The Plan, which is treated
as an unfunded non-qualified deferred compensation plan, enables eligible
employees to defer the receipt of a portion of their compensation for a fixed
period of years, until their employment terminates. Participants' account
balances are valued at the greater of the share value or the dollar value, as
defined in the Plan. The share value of a participant's account balance is
the market value of the number of shares of common stock that could have been
purchased by the participant with the deferral amounts, including dividend
reinvestment. The dollar value represents the value of the deferral amounts
adjusted for compound interest that would have been earned on the deferral
amounts assuming allocation of interest at the Applicable Interest Rate
established quarterly by the Internal Revenue Service. The Company accrued
no additional compensation expense related to the Plan for the year ended
December 31, 1993.

Retirement Plans

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries maintain three noncontributory
defined benefit pension plans (the Employees' Pension Plan, the Hourly
Employees' Pension Plan, and the Retirement Plan for Employees of UAW Local
604, Elmira, NY, the "Elmira Plan") covering certain salaried and hourly
employees, former employees and retirees. Under these plans, the Company
contributes an amount equal to or greater than the minimum funding
requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended ("ERISA"), where applicable, but not in excess of the maximum amount
that can be deducted for federal income tax purposes. Benefits under the
Employees' Pension Plan are generally based on the employees' years of service
and compensation during years of service. Benefits under the Hourly
Employees' Pension Plan are generally based on years of service multiplied by
a specified dollar amount. The Company previously maintained a defined
contribution plan, the Hourly Employees' Target Benefit Plan (the "Target
Plan"), and a defined benefit plan, the Hourly Employees' Supplemental
Retirement Plan (the "Supplemental Plan"). The Target Plan covered the
current hourly employees of the Motor Components Division of the Automotive
Products Segment and the former hourly employees of the Motor Components,
Filter Products and Fuel Devices Divisions who previously were covered by a
collective bargaining agreement with the United Automotive Workers Union. The
Supplemental Plan covered employees and former employees who were participants
of a defined benefit pension plan (the "Terminated Hourly Plan") that was
terminated by the Company in 1980 under the provisions of ERISA. The Target
Plan and Supplemental Plan were adopted in connection with the termination of
the Terminated Hourly Plan. Under the Target Plan, the Company was obligated
to make periodic contributions to a trust fund based on each covered
employee's credited hours of service to the Company. The Supplemental Plan
provided that the Company make periodic contributions sufficient to fund
benefits equal to the benefits that retirees (or their spouses) would have
received had the Terminated Hourly Plan not been terminated, less the sum of
the amounts paid to such persons (i) by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation with respect to the Terminated Hourly Plan and (ii) all amounts
paid under the Target Plan. Effective April 15, 1992, the Supplemental and
Target Plans were combined into a single defined benefit plan which is the
Elmira Plan. 

Net periodic pension cost includes the following components:

Savings Plan

The Company has a voluntary savings and investment plan available to
substantially all non-union employees. Employee contributions of not less
than one percent of the employee's salary to not more than eight percent are
matched 75 percent by the Company. The cost of the Company's contributions
was $1.9 million, $1.8 million and $1.4 million for the years ended December
31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Postretirement Health Care and Life Insurance Benefits

The Company provides health care and life insurance benefits to certain
retirees. Health care coverage includes medical costs as well as prescription
drugs.

During 1991, the Company changed its method of accounting for postretirement
benefit costs other than pensions by adopting the requirements of SFAS No.
106, Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions,
effective as of January 1, 1991. As a result, the Company recorded a charge
of $17.3 million to reflect the cumulative effect of the change in accounting
principle for periods prior to 1991.

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost includes the following components:

Year Ended December 31, 
1993 1992 1991 
(Expressed in thousands)

Service cost - 
benefits attributed to 
service during the period $ 473 $ 548 $ 469

Amortization of accumulated gains (673) (808) - 
Net periodic postretirement 
benefit cost $3,348 $4,513 $5,927

The following table sets forth the plans' combined status reconciled with the
amounts included in the consolidated balance sheets:

December 31, 
1993 1992 
(Expressed in thousands)
Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation:
Retirees $47,110 $45,077
Fully eligible active plan participants 5,511 1,161
Other active plan participants 6,571 6,144
Total accumulated postretirement
benefit obligation 59,192 52,382
Unrecognized net gain from past 
experience differences 5,088 12,070
Accrued postretirement benefit cost $64,280 $64,452

None of the future annual benefits of plan participants is covered by
insurance contracts issued by the Company or a related party.

For measurement purposes, an 11 percent annual rate of increase in the per
capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 1994; the rate was
assumed to decrease gradually to six percent through the year 1999 and to
remain at that level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate assumption
has a significant effect on the amount of the obligation and the periodic cost
reported. An increase in the assumed health care cost trend rates by one
percent in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation as of December 31, 1993 by $6.0 million and the aggregate of the
service and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit
cost for the year then ended by $0.5 million.

The weighted average discount rate used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 was
7.5 percent, 8.0 percent and 8.5 percent, respectively.

Postemployment Benefits

In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No.
112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, which requires accrual
accounting for postemployment benefits, such as disability benefits, instead
of recognizing an expense for those benefits when paid. The Company currently
is accumulating the data necessary to comply with the new rules. Adoption of
SFAS No. 112 using the cumulative effect method is required in the first
quarter of 1994. Based on preliminary estimates, the cumulative effect of the
accounting change at January 1, 1994 is expected to range from approximately
$5.4 million to approximately $7.4 million. The Company does not expect 1994
postemployment expense under the new rules to differ significantly from
postemployment expense that would have been recognized under the pay-as-you-go
basis of accounting.

6. OPERATING LEASES:

Certain properties and equipment are leased for varying periods under long-
term, noncancellable agreements which are renewable in many instances. The
total rent expense amounted to $8.17 million, $8.04 million and $8.17 million
for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The
approximate annual minimum rentals under all noncancellable operating leases
as of December 31, 1993 are as follows (expressed in thousands):

1994 $ 6,918
1995 5,325
1996 4,756
1997 2,495
1998 723
Thereafter 752
$20,969

7. NONRECURRING CHARGES:

During the third quarter of 1991, the Company recorded provisions against
income to reflect losses due to certain identified liabilities and asset
impairments. In the fourth quarter of 1992, the Company recorded a charge
related to compensation of a key executive under the terms of an employment
contract. The following is a summary of the charges provided for (expressed
in thousands):

Year Ended December 31, 
1993 1992 1991 

Executive compensation $ - $2,888 $ -
Reserve for environmental
costs (see Note 8) - - 26,480
Other write-downs and charges - - 13,500
$ - $2,888 $39,980

8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

The Company had a remaining reserve of approximately $8.5 million at December
31, 1993 for estimated cleanup and compliance costs at certain waste disposal
areas, including those in which it has been alleged that the Company is a
potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("CERCLA"), as amended, or similar
state legislation. Included in these sites is a plant operated by the Company
in Elmira, New York (the "Elmira Facility") that is the subject of an
Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") Record of Decision dated September 4,
1992 (the "Elmira ROD") which delineates the actions to be taken to remediate
the contamination specified in the Elmira ROD.

The Company and the Former Parent have entered into an indemnification
agreement, which became effective December 14, 1992, with respect to the
Elmira Facility. Under the agreement, the Former Parent has agreed to
reimburse the Company for costs and expenses of certain remediation required
by the Elmira ROD and indemnify the Company against necessary costs and
expenses of certain remediation activities at one other site located near the
Elmira Facility and at a landfill site in Metamora, Michigan. The
indemnification provided by the Former Parent with respect to the Elmira
Facility will apply to all remediation required by the Company under CERCLA
that had been identified as of the date of the indemnification agreement at
the Elmira Facility, but will not extend to certain additional environmental
expenditures relating to the Elmira Facility or other sites for which the
Company is or may be held responsible. In connection with the
indemnification, the Company reduced its accrual for environmental costs and
credited additional paid-in capital for $17.7 million. Management believes
the accrual for environmental costs at December 31, 1993 is adequate.

The Company is a defendant in certain other litigation arising out of
operations in the normal course of business and is aware of certain litigation
threatened against the Company from time to time. In the opinion of
management, none of the other pending or threatened lawsuits and proceedings
should have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position
or results of operations of the Company.

9. INVESTMENT IN PURODENSO:

In 1989, the Automotive Products Segment formed the Purodenso manufacturing
joint venture with a unit of Nippondenso of Japan (with each joint venturer
owning a 50% interest) to exploit the combined engineering and technological
abilities of the two companies. Purodenso supplies highly specialized
automotive filters and injection molded filter housings to the Company for
distribution to domestic Original Equipment Manufacturers ("OEMs"), U.S.
manufacturing plants of Japanese OEM companies and the aftermarket. The
selected financial data presented below as of the dates and for the periods
indicated are derived from the audited financial statements of Purodenso.

One customer accounted for 14 percent of the Company's net sales in the years 
ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991. These sales were made from the 
Automotive Products Segment.

13. CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK:

The Company extends credit to various companies in the retail,
wholesale/distributor, original equipment and export markets in the normal
course of business. Within these markets, certain concentrations of credit
risk exist. These concentrations of credit risk may be similarly affected by
changes in economic or other conditions and may, accordingly, impact the
Company's overall credit risk. However, management believes that consolidated
receivables are well diversified, thereby reducing potential credit risk to
the Company, and that allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate to absorb
estimated losses at December 31, 1993.

At December 31, 1993 and 1992, trade receivables related to these group
concentrations were:

Retail $ 28,796 $ 28,326

Other 2,300 3,784
Total $ 72,304 $ 72,124

14. SUBSEQUENT EVENT:

In January 1994, the Company made the decision to shut down the fiberglass
manufacturing process of the Air Filtration Products Segment's Henderson,
North Carolina plant, effective on or about April 15, 1994, in favor of
purchasing fiberglass from outside sources. The Company will reserve
approximately $950,000 in the first quarter of 1994 for the costs associated
with shutting down the process. There are no plans at the present time that
would adversely impact the remaining operations at the Henderson, North
Carolina plant.

PUROLATOR PRODUCTS COMPANY
NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)

(1) General -

The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein have
been prepared by Purolator Products Company (the "Company") without audit and
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes
thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 1993. The foregoing financial statements include only
normal recurring accruals and all adjustments which the Company considers
necessary for a fair presentation.

(2) Detail to Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets - (Expressed in
thousands)

September 30,
1994 

Inventories:
Finished goods $ 41,306
Work in progress 7,506
Raw materials and supplies 28,659
Total 77,471
Less reserves 4,326
Total, net $ 73,145

(3) Repurchase of Common Stock -

On February 25, 1994, the Company was authorized to repurchase as many
as approximately 560,000 common shares, or five percent of its common stock
outstanding as of that date. During the nine months ended September 30, 1994,
the Company repurchased 121,000 common shares.

(4) Postemployment Benefits -

The Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS")
No. 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment Benefits, effective January
1, 1994. SFAS No. 112 requires accrual accounting for postemployment
benefits, such as disability benefits, instead of recognizing an expense for
those items when paid. The Company recorded a charge of $6.5 million in the
first quarter of 1994 to reflect the cumulative effect of the change in
accounting principle for periods prior to 1994. The Company does not expect
1994 postemployment expense under the new rules to differ significantly from
postemployment expense that would have been recognized under the pay-as-you-go
basis of accounting.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED)

(5) Pro Forma Earnings Per Share -

As a result of adopting SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes,
effective January 1, 1993, the Company expects to report only foreign income
tax expense through December 31, 1994. Therefore, the effective income tax
rates for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 and 1993 were substantially
below the 35% statutory U.S. income tax rate. Previously unrecognized tax
benefits have been recognized in the balance sheet to the extent of U.S.
federal and state income taxes paid or payable and the utilization of net
operating loss carryforwards. The table below sets forth a pro forma
representation of earnings per share based on the following assumptions and
adjustments: (a) a 45 percent combined federal, state and foreign tax rate;
(b) a constant level of shares outstanding (11,095,674 shares issued and
outstanding as of September 30, 1994); (c) exclusion of the cumulative effect
of a change in accounting principle; and (d) exclusion of the process shutdown
charge recorded in the first quarter of 1994 as the result of the Company's
decision to shut down the fiberglass manufacturing process of the Air
Filtration Products Segment's Henderson, North Carolina plant in favor of
purchasing fiberglass from outside sources.

(6) Subsequent Event -

On October 3, 1994, Mark IV Industries, Inc. ("Mark IV"), and its wholly
owned subsidiary, Mark IV Acquisition Corp. (the "Purchaser"), entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement") with the Company.
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, which was unanimously approved by the
Company's Board of Directors, the Purchaser commenced a tender offer (the
"Offer") for all outstanding shares of the Company's common stock (and
associated preferred stock purchase rights), at a price of $25.00 net per
share in cash to the seller. Prior to the commencement of the Offer, Mark IV
beneficially owned 520,500 shares of the Company's common stock (4.69% of the
Company's outstanding common stock), which shares were acquired by Mark IV in
open market transactions upon the expiration of the Offer on November 1994,
the Purchaser had accepted for payment an additional 10,236,000 shares of the
Company's common stock, which, when combined with the shares already owned by
Mark IV, resulted in the Purchaser's ownership of approximately 96.9% of the
Company's outstanding common stock. 

As a result of the Purchaser acquiring in excess of 90% of the Company's
outstanding common stock, and as provided for in the Merger Agreement, it is
anticipated that the Company will be merged with the Purchaser by
November 30, 1994 (the "Merger"). In the Merger each share of the Company's
common stock (other than shares held by Mark IV and its subsidiaries and
those shares held by stockholders who properly exercise appraisal rights 
under Delaware law) will be converted into the right to receive $25.00 
per share in cash.

Upon the consummation of the Merger, the holders of outstanding options
to acquire common stock of the Company, which options were granted by the
Company under its non-qualified stock option plans, will be offered the
opportunity to elect either: to have the outstanding Purolator options
assumed by Mark IV and amended to become options to purchase common stock of
Mark IV; or, to receive a cash payment in settlement of each Purolator option
in an amount equal to $25.00 minus the exercise price per share of the
Purolator option, multiplied by the number of shares of Purolator common stock
subject to such Purolator option.

As a result of the tender of a majority of the Company's stock to Mark
IV Acquisition Corp. effective November 7, 1994, the Company's credit facility
with a group of banks and Texas Commerce Bank National Association ("TCB"),
as agent, was terminated and the outstanding amounts owed thereunder were 
paid from the proceeds of a replacement credit facility provided by TCB 
under a $44,000,000 note due on demand or within 30 days ("Bridge Note").
All collateral securing the previous credit agreement has been assigned 
as security for the Bridge Note.

On November 8, 1994, as a result of the completion of the Offer, the
Company announced that five of its seven directors resigned and were
replaced by four nominees of Mark IV.
