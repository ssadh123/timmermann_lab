BOISE CASCADE TO COMBINE MOST NEWSPRINT AND UNCOATED
GROUNDWOOD ASSETS INTO CANADIAN SUBSIDIARY

BOISE, Idaho -- Boise Cascade Corporation (NYSE:BCC) took
action today to further sharpen its operating focus, accelerate
the growth and improvement of its three business segments, and
strengthen its balance sheet.
The company reported that it intends to combine the majority
of its newsprint, uncoated groundwood, and related assets in its
wholly owned Canadian subsidiary and to structure the transaction
so that the Canadian company is independently managed, has its own
access to financial markets, and can fund its future capital
requirements.
Boise Cascade said the Canadian company, with its dedication
to the newsprint and groundwood paper business, will be
particularly well-positioned to serve the needs of its customers.
Boise Cascade said it is reviewing financial alternatives for
accomplishing the transaction, including a recapitalization of the
Canadian company and a sale of a portion of its equity.
Boise Cascade said the move will enhance its ability to carry
out its Blueprint for the '90s, the company's strategy for
capitalizing on the potential of its coated and uncoated white
paper and containerboard businesses, as well as its building
products and office products distribution businesses. The company
also said proceeds to Boise Cascade from the transaction will be
used to strengthen its balance sheet by reducing parent-company
debt and for general corporate purposes.
Upon completion of the transaction, Boise Cascade will retain
3.1 million short tons of annual pulp and paper capacity and will
continue to be among the largest producers of uncoated white
papers in the U.S. and a major producer of coated white papers. 
The company will also continue to be among the largest producers
of wood products in the country, a major factor in the wholesale
distribution of building materials, and one of the largest
distributors of office products in the U.S. Boise Cascade will
also own or control more than 3 million acres of timberland in the
U.S.
The assets of the Canadian company currently include a pulp
and paper mill in Kenora, Ontario, which has the capability to
produce 300,000 short tons of newsprint and 45,000 short tons of
uncoated groundwood paper annually and is currently building a
recycling facility which will produce 106,200 short tons of
recycled pulp annually; a pulp and paper mill in Fort Frances,
Ontario, which can produce 290,000 short tons of uncoated
groundwood papers and 135,000 short tons of market pulp annually;
and long-term harvesting rights on 3.1 million acres of timberland
in Ontario. In addition, the Canadian company will purchase Boise
Cascade's pulp and paper mill in Steilacoom (West Tacoma),
Washington. The West Tacoma mill has the capability to produce
190,000 short tons of recycled-content newsprint annually. Sales
from these operations were approximately $350 million in 1993. 
The Canadian company will also become the exclusive sales agent
for the newsprint production of Boise Cascade's pulp and paper
mill in DeRidder, Louisiana, which has annual newsprint capacity
of 420,000 short tons.
Boise Cascade Corporation is an integrated paper and forest
products company headquartered in Boise, Idaho, with operations
located in the United States and Canada. The company manufactures
and distributes paper and paper products, office products, and
building products and owns and manages timberland to support these
operations. Sales in 1993 were $4 billion.

As previously announced, the majority of Boise Cascade's

and Exchange Commission but has not yet become effective. The
senior secured notes may not be sold, nor may offers to buy
be accepted, prior to the time the registration statement
becomes effective. This press release shall not constitute
an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor
shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in
which such offers, solicitation, or sale would be unlawful
prior to the registration or qualification under the
securities laws of any such state.
Boise Cascade Corporation is an integrated paper and
forest products company headquartered in Boise, Idaho, with
