CERTAIN PROPERTIES ACQUIRED
HISTORICAL SUMMARY OF REVENUES AND CERTAIN OPERATING
EXPENSES FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1992

Rental Income 
$4,788,523

Repairs and maintenance $666,133
Real estate taxes $400,196
Certain operating expenses $608,821 
$1,675,150

Excess of revenues over
certain operating expenses 
$3,113,373

NOTE:

The historical summary of revenues and certain operating expenses relate to
the operations of three shopping centers: Heritage Square, Georgetown Square
and Eastgate Shopping Center, and two garden apartment complexes:
Charlestown @ Douglass Hills and Ashford Place (collectively, the
"properties") while under ownership previous to New Plan Realty Trust.

The summary has been prepared on the accrual method of accounting. 
Operating expenses include maintenance and repair expenses, utilities, real
estate taxes, insurance and certain other expenses. In accordance with the
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, mortgage interest
expense, depreciation, and general and administrative costs have been
excluded from operating expenses, as they are dependent upon a particular
owner, purchase prices or financial arrangement.

Minimum future rentals for years ended July 31, under existing commercial
operating leases at the shopping centers being reported on are approximately
as follows (in thousands):

1994 - $2,871 1997 - $ 2,279
1995 - 2,589 1998 - 1,978
1996 - 2,448 thereafter - 16,243

The above assumes that all leases which expire are not renewed, therefore
neither renewal rentals nor rentals from replacement tenants are included.

Minimum future rentals do not include contingent rentals which may be
received under certain leases on the basis of percentage of reported
tenants' sales volume, increases in Consumer Price Indices, common area
maintenance charges and real estate tax reimbursements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

We have audited the accompanying Historical Summary of Revenues and Certain
Operating Expenses of Heritage Square, Georgetown Square, Eastgate Shopping
Center, Charlestown @ Douglass Hills and Ashford Place (the "Properties")
for the year ended December 31, 1992. This Historical Summary is the
responsibility of New Plan Realty Trust's management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on this Historical Summary based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Historical Summary is free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Historical Summary. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the Historical Summary. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The Historical Summary has been prepared for the purpose of complying with
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and its
use for any other purpose may be inappropriate. Accordingly, as described
in the Note to the Historical Summary, the statement excludes interest,
depreciation, and general and administrative expenses for the period
examined, and is not intended to be a complete presentation of the
properties' revenues and expenses.

In our opinion, the Historical Summary referred to above presents fairly, in
all material respects, the revenues and certain operating expenses
(exclusive of interest, depreciation and general and administrative
expenses) in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

REQUIREMENTS PURSUANT TO RULE 3-14 REGULATION S-X

Part I MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT

Management's assessment of the Properties prior to acquisition
includes, but is not limited to, the quality of the tenant base, regional
demographics, the competitive environment, operating expenses and local
property taxes. In addition, the physical aspect of the property, location,
condition and quality of design and construction are evaluated. Management
also always conducts Phase I and II environmental tests. All factors, when
viewed in their entirety, have met management's acquisition criteria. 
Management is not aware of any material factors relating to the acquisition
other than those discussed above. 

Part II ESTIMATES OF NET INCOME AND FUNDS GENERATED FROM CERTAIN
PROPERTIES
ACQUIRED (UNAUDITED)

not purport to present expected results of operations for the Properties in
the future and were prepared on the basis described in the accompanying
notes which should be read in conjunction herewith.

NOTES TO ESTIMATES OF NET INCOME AND FUNDS GENERATED FROM
CERTAIN PROPERTIES ACQUIRED
(UNAUDITED)

Basis of Presentation

1. Estimated depreciation was based upon an allocation of the
purchase price to land (20%) and building (80%) with the
depreciation being taken over a 40 year life using the straight
line method.

2. No income taxes have been provided because New Plan Realty Trust
is taxed as a real estate investment trust under the provisions
of
the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, the Trust does not pay
Federal income tax whenever income distributed to shareholders is
equal to at least 95% of real estate investment trust taxable
income and certain other conditions are met.<PAGE>

PRO FORMA CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(UNAUDITED)

The following unaudited pro forma condensed balance sheet at October
31, 1993 reflects the acquisition of three shopping centers: Heritage
Square (8/93), Georgetown Square (9/93), Eastgate Shopping Center (11/93),
and two garden apartments: Charlestown at Douglass Hills (9/93) and Ashford
Place (10/93).

The pro forma condensed statements of income for the year ended July
31, 1993 and the three months ended October 31, 1993 assume the acquisition
of these properties as if they had occurred as of August 1, 1992 and 1993,
respectively. This pro forma information is based on the historical
statements of the Trust after giving effect to the acquisition of these
properties.

The unaudited pro forma condensed financial statements have been
prepared by New Plan Realty Trust management. The unaudited pro forma
condensed statements of income may not be indicative of the results that
would have actually occurred if the acquisitions had been in effect on the
dates indicated. Also, they may not be indicative of the results that may
be achieved in the future. The unaudited pro forma condensed financial
statements should be read in conjunction with New Plan Realty Trust's
audited financial statements as of July 31, 1993 and for the year then ended
(which are contained in the Trust's Form 10-K for the year ended July 31,
1993) and the unaudited financial statements as of October 31, 1993 and for
the three months then ended (which are contained in the Trust's Form 10-Q
for the period ended October 31, 1993) and the accompanying notes.<PAGE>

NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)

1. Represents the acquisition of the Properties for cash.

2. Amounts as reported have been adjusted by historical results for the
year ended December 31, 1992. These adjustments to the Pro Forma
Condensed Statements of Income (Unaudited) have the effect of
reflecting the results for the year ended July 31, 1993 and the three
months ended October 31, 1993 as if the Properties had been acquired as
of August 1, 1992 and 1993 respectively. Pro forma adjustments to
rental revenue includes increases in rent as if such increase occurred
at the beginning of the period.

3. The reduction in interest and dividend income is due to the actual use
of cash and cash equivalents to pay the purchase price of the
acquisitions. The average rate of return for the year ended July 31,
1993 and the three months ended October 31, 1993 was 4.3% and 4.5%
respectively.

4. Estimated depreciation was based upon an allocation of the purchase
price to land (20%) and building (80%) with the depreciation being
taken over a 40 year life using the straight line method.

5. Refer to Form 8 Amendment No. 1 dated October 6, 1993 for previously
reported amounts.
