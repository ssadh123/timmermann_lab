issued the following two press releases:

A&A TO SEEK SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL

OF $200 MILLION INVESTMENT BY AIG;

BOARD REDUCES QUARTERLY COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND TO $0.025

NEW YORK, June 7, 1994 -- Alexander & Alexander Services

Inc. (A&A) today announced that American International

Group, Inc. (AIG) has agreed to invest $200 million in a new

issue of Series B convertible preferred stock with an 8

percent annual dividend. The dividend will be paid in kind

through Dec. 15, 1996, and at A&A's option for an additional

three years. 

A&A's Board of Directors also declared a quarterly

common stock dividend of $0.025 per share, payable June 30

to shareholders of record on June 17, 1994.

Dr. Robert E. Boni, chairman of the board, said, "A&A

intends to use most of the proceeds of the AIG investment to

strengthen our core businesses. Also, part of the proceeds

will finance a reinsurance arrangement to further protect

the company from previously disclosed exposures relating to

certain discontinued underwriting operations." 

He added, "The AIG investment, together with the lower

dividend, would greatly strengthen the company's capital

base and cash flow, providing for significant new investment

in A&A's core businesses."

The new preferred stock is convertible into A&A's

common stock at $17 per share. Upon conversion of the

preferred shares into common stock, AIG would own

approximately 21 percent of A&A's common stock. Both this

stock and the

<PAGE>

common stock into which it is convertible are non-voting in

the hands of AIG.

AIG can exchange non-voting common stock for up to 9.9

percent of A&A's voting stock, but AIG does not intend to do

so. AIG will not be represented on the A&A board, and a

standstill agreement is in effect for eight years.

A&A will seek authorization for the transaction at a

special stockholders meeting to be called in the near

future. The transaction also is subject to customary

closing conditions, including appropriate government

approvals.

AIG Chairman Maurice R. Greenberg said, "A&A is a

leading insurance brokerage organization with a long

tradition of leadership in its industry. AIG strongly

believes in the independent broker system and has in the

past made investments in other brokerage firms to enable

them to continue the tradition of operating independently."

Dr. Boni added, "In January, we promised dramatic

action to improve operations and earnings. Today's steps

constitute an important installment on that promise. AIG's

investment is a welcome vote of confidence in A&A's future."

AIG is the leading U.S.-based international insurance

organization and the largest underwriter of commercial and

industrial insurance in the United States.

A&A Services Inc. [NYSE: AAL] is a global organization

of professional advisers providing risk management,

insurance brokerage and human resource management consulting

services from offices in more than 80 countries.

A&A NAMES FRANK ZARB AS CHAIRMAN, CEO AND PRESIDENT

NEW YORK, June 7 -- The Board of Directors of Alexander &

Alexander Services Inc. (A&A) today named Frank G. Zarb as

chairman, CEO and president of the company.

Dr. Robert E. Boni, who has been non-executive chairman

of A&A's board of directors since January 1994, said, "We

are delighted to have an executive of Frank Zarb's calibre

to lead our company. He is one of the best known and most

talented leaders in the financial services industry, with

experience in insurance and a proven track record in

turnaround situations. His stature and success in the

global business community as well as the public sector

reinforce our confidence in A&A's business outlook as we

strengthen our operations."

Mr. Zarb, 59, said, "I believe very strongly in the

future of A&A. We will move quickly to improve

profitability and strengthen our core business. Today's

earlier announcement of the $200 million capital infusion

from AIG and the dividend reduction by the board are very

significant. They contribute to the process of revitalizing

our franchise and returning A&A to the path of growth,

profitability and, ultimately, increased value to

shareholders."

He added, "From my experience at Smith Barney, I know

this company. We have great opportunities to realize our

potential through focused management and better service to

our customers."

Mr. Zarb, who is presently vice chairman and group

chief executive of 

<PAGE>

Travelers Inc., has a distinguished record in business

and public service. He had previously served as chairman

and chief executive officer of Smith Barney, Travelers'

brokerage and investment banking subsidiary, which he

joined in November 1988. He was named corporate group chief

executive in June 1993 and elected a vice chairman of

Travelers Inc. (formerly Primerica Corporation) in September

1991.

During his tenure at Smith Barney, Mr. Zarb oversaw

growth in the firm's business mix and clientele. Most

importantly, he directed a series of record performances by

the firm, from a pre-tax loss of $100 million in 1988 to

more than $200 million in after tax profits in 1993, prior

to the acquisition of Shearson.

Before joining Smith Barney, Mr. Zarb for 10 years had

been a senior partner of Lazard Freres & Co., with

responsibilities for a broad range of investment banking

activities, including international and domestic corporate

finance and mergers and acquisitions.

From 1974 through 1977, Mr. Zarb was the senior federal

official for all U.S. government energy-related activities.

He served as executive director of the Cabinet-level Energy

Resources Council, Administrator of the Federal Energy

Administration and Assistant to the President for Energy

Affairs. He was widely known during the Ford administration

as the national "energy czar."

Prior to those appointments, he had been associate

director of the Office of Management and Budget from 1973 to

1974 and served as assistant secretary of labor between 1971

and 1972.

Before entering public service, Mr. Zarb acquired

considerable experience 

<PAGE>

in the securities industry, beginning his career with

Goodbody and Co. in 1962. He later served in various

capacities for predecessor firms to Shearson, as executive

vice president of marketing operations, and investment

banking as well as chairman of the Executive Committee.

Mr. Zarb continues to have a role in public service.

Since October 1993, he has been chairman of the New York

Stock Exchange Nominating Committee. He was nominated to

serve on the United States Enrichment Corporation's board of

directors by President Clinton, and his nomination was

confirmed by the U.S. Senate in February 1994. (USEC was

established in 1992 to take over the government's uranium

enrichment operations and eventually create a private

corporation to compete more aggressively in markets for

enriched uranium.)

Mr. Zarb, who earned his bachelor's and master's of art

degrees from Hofstra, was awarded an honorary law degree by

the university in 1975, and the school's Outstanding Scholar

Award in 1974. Hofstra recently named its business school

after Mr. Zarb.

With Mr. Zarb's appointment, Dr. Boni will continue as

an A&A board member and serve as chairman of the board's

Executive Committee. Michael K. White will step down as

A&A's president.

of professional advisers providing risk management,

insurance brokerage and human resource management consulting

services from offices in more than 80 countries.
