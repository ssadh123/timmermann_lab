<DESCRIPTION>EXHIBIT
<TEXT>
McDonnell Douglas had 1993 earnings of $396 million, or $10.10 per

share. That compares with 1992 earnings of $79 million, or $2.03 per

share, excluding unusual items related to the company's adoption of a

new retiree health care accounting standard. The increase in earnings

was achieved despite a 17 percent decline in revenues caused by

continued softness in commercial and military markets for aerospace

products.

Highlights for the year included strong performance across most

government aerospace programs, continued profitability in the

commercial aircraft business, and a 41 percent reduction in aerospace

debt -- from $2.767 billion at the outset of the year to a six-year

low of $1.625 billion at year end. Aerospace debt fell by $349

million in the fourth quarter, following debt reductions in each of

the first three quarters.

The 1993 results were reduced by a fourth quarter pre-tax charge

of $450 million, or $275 million after-tax ($6.99 per share). The

charge covered both an overall settlement of a range of issues related

to the C-17 military aircraft program and increased cost on the C-17

development and initial production contracts, which was in part

interrelated to the overall settlement.

Partially offsetting the C-17 charge, McDonnell Douglas had

unusual gains in 1993 from the sale of McDonnell Douglas Information

Systems International, the reversal of part of the one-time charge

taken in 1992 from the new retiree health care accounting standard,

and the successful resolution of tax issues. These gains totaled $220

million, or $5.61 per share.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 5
The charge in the C-17 program resulted in a fourth quarter loss

for the corporation of $132 million, or $3.36 per share. Excluding

the C-17 charge, McDonnell Douglas' earnings for the fourth quarter

totaled $143 million, or $3.63 per share, compared with $86 million,

or $2.20 per share, in 1992's fourth quarter, prior to a retiree health

care curtailment gain.

Interest expense for the aerospace segments in the fourth quarter

of 1993 was $51 million, down from $86 million in 1992's fourth

quarter. Interest expense for all of 1993 was $89 million, which

included the reversal of $135 million in previously accrued interest

expense associated with the favorable resolution of tax issues with

the Internal Revenue Service. Excluding the reversal, interest

expense for 1993 was $224 million, down from $309 million in the prior

year. The lower interest expense reflects reduced debt levels and

reduced interest rates.

Both 1993 and 1992 amounts for interest expense reflect a

$25 million reclassification of expenses in an executive life

insurance program from interest to general expenses. This

reclassification reduced segment operating earnings but had no impact

on net earnings.

Excluding C-17 charges in both years, operating earnings in the

military aircraft segment were $533 million for 1993, compared with

$391 million in 1992, a gain of 36 percent. Excluding the C-17 charge

in 1993's fourth quarter, fourth quarter earnings were $180 million,

up 61 percent from $112 million in 1992's fourth quarter. Revenues

for 1993 in this segment were 5 percent lower than in 1992, largely

due to reduced volume in the F-15 program.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 6

The commercial aircraft segment had its third consecutive

profitable year, with operating earnings of $40 million in 1993, down

from $102 million in 1992. Operating earnings in 1993's fourth

quarter were $2 million, compared with $34 million in the year-ago

quarter. There was a 28 percent reduction in revenues for the year

and 21 percent during the quarter due to reduced MD-80 twin jet and MD-

11 trijet deliveries.

Operating earnings for the commercial aircraft segment in 1993's

fourth quarter included a $41 million pre-tax gain from the sale of

McDonnell Douglas' 25 percent interest in Irish Aerospace and

offsetting charges of $37 million related to a commercial lease

guarantee, a product enhancement associated with a commercial

customer, and other items.

Margins in the MD80/90 program have continued to improve. But

total earnings have declined due to the sharp reduction in deliveries

caused by the continuing slump in the commercial aircraft market.

McDonnell Douglas delivered four twin jets in 1993's fourth

quarter, compared with 12 twin jets in 1992's fourth quarter. There

were 42 twin jet deliveries for the year 1993 (including eight under

lease arrangements), compared with 84 in 1992. In addition, there

were 36 MD-11 trijet deliveries in 1993 (including three under lease

arrangements), compared with 42 trijet deliveries in 1992. There were

11 trijet deliveries in 1993's fourth quarter (including two under

lease arrangements), compared with 13 trijet deliveries in 1992's

fourth quarter.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 7

The corporation received two new firm orders for MD80/90 twin

jets and entered into leases for two MD-11 trijets in the fourth

quarter. On Dec. 31, 1993, the MD80/90 program included 1,089

deliveries, 143 aircraft on firm order, and 185 options and reserves.

On the same date, the MD-11 program included 112 deliveries, 60

aircraft on firm order, and 101 options and reserves representing

potential future orders.

The missiles, space and electronic systems segment had record

operating earnings of $338 million in 1993, up 77 percent from

$191 million in 1992. There were strongly improved earnings from the

Harpoon, SLAM, Tomahawk, and Delta programs. Revenues for this

segment fell by 19 percent, largely as a result of the winding down of

the Advanced Cruise Missile program and reduced Delta space launches.

Earnings for the 1993 fourth quarter totaled $78 million, despite

$19 million in write-offs in several programs, including a laser

crosslink program and a plant closure and relocation. 1992 fourth

quarter earnings were $47 million, and included $29 million in pre-tax

write-offs primarily in the laser crosslink program.

Operating earnings in the financial services and other segment

were $31 million in 1993, compared with $20 million in 1992. Revenues

for this segment were 18 percent lower than in 1992, reflecting a

decision made in 1991 to streamline the finance subsidiary, refocusing

its efforts on only two markets -- aircraft and commercial

equipment leasing. Operating earnings in the 1993 fourth quarter were

$22 million, compared with $10 million in the year earlier quarter.

Most of the increase in 1993's fourth quarter earnings was due to used

aircraft and commercial equipment leasing sales.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 8
Excluding curtailment gains, after-tax retiree health care costs

associated with a new accounting standard (SFAS No. 106) were

$11 million lower in the fourth quarter of 1993 than in 1992's fourth

quarter and $117 million lower in 1993 compared with the same period

in 1992. The reduction reflects the elimination of company-paid

health care for many current and future retirees. The fourth quarter

of 1992 results include an after-tax curtailment gain of $676 million

($1,090 million pretax).

The corporation's firm backlog on Dec. 31, 1993, was $19.379

billion, compared with $24.052 billion on Dec. 31, 1992. Total

backlog at Dec. 31, 1993, was $35.698 billion, compared with $41.806

billion on Dec. 31, 1992. The decline in backlog reflects deliveries

and a softening of commercial aircraft orders worldwide.

Total employment of McDonnell Douglas was 70,016 on Dec. 31,

1993, compared with 87,377 a year earlier. A fifth of the total

reduction in McDonnell Douglas employment was due to the sale of non-

core businesses or outsourcing of certain support services.

Employment was further affected by lower production rates in a number

of programs and reductions in force aimed at achieving greater

efficiencies.
