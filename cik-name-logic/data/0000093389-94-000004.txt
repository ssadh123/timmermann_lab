Item 4 Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant

Effective July 6, 1994, the Registrant changed its prior certifying
principal accountant from David Berdon & Co. ("DB") to KPMG Peat Marwick
("KPMG").

DB's reports on the Registrant's financial statements for the two
fiscal years ended December 31, 1993 contained no adverse opinions or
disclaimers of opinion nor were such reports qualified or modified as to
uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles.

The decision to dismiss DB was unanimously approved by the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors of the Registrant.

During the two fiscal years ended December 31, 1993 and the quarter
ended March 31, 1994, there were no disagreements between the Registrant and DB
on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial statement
disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreements, if not
resolved to the satisfaction of DB, would have caused it to make a reference to
the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its reports.

None of the "reportable events" described in Item 304(a)(1)v) of
Regulation S-K occurred with respect to the Registrant during the two fiscal
years ended December 31, 1993 and the period from January 1, 1994 through July
6, 1994.

Effective July 6, 1994, the Registrant engaged KPMG as its principal
accountant.
