HALLIBURTON COMPRESSION UNIT TO BE SOLD

DALLAS, Texas -- Halliburton Company today announced that
Dillon, Read & Co. Inc. has been engaged to assist Halliburton in
the sale of the company's natural gas compression business.

Halliburton's compression business, part of the Halliburton
Energy Services business segment, provides rental equipment and
associated services for the compression of natural gas. It is
one of the largest independent providers of such services in
North America and in 1993 the business had revenues of about $44
million.
<PAGE> 6
Thomas H. Cruikshank, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer of Halliburton Company, said, "As part of our
ongoing strategic planning program, it has been determined that
the natural gas compression business is peripheral to Halliburton
Energy Services' core business activities and future strategic
direction. The planned sale is consistent with our recently
announced plans to dispose of another business unit, Halliburton
Industrial Services, with the objective of gaining greater focus
on the company's core business activities. We anticipate
completion of the sale of the compression business by year-end
1994 and we expect to realize a significant gain on the sale."

Halliburton Company is one of the world's largest
diversified energy services, engineering, maintenance, and
construction companies. Founded in 1919, Halliburton provides a
broad range of energy services and products, industrial and
marine engineering and construction services, and property and
casualty insurance services.
