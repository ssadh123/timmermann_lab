Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On June 24, 1994 Novell, Inc. ("Novell") issued 51,380,100 shares of its
Common Stock, $.10 par value, in connection with the merger (the
"Merger") of WordPerfect Corporation ("WordPerfect"), with and into Novell. 
Originally, the combination of Novell and WordPerfect was to be effected by 
the merger of Novell Acquisition Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Novell 
("Sub"), with and into WordPerfect, with WordPerfect becoming a wholly owned 
subsidiary of Novell, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of 
Reorganization, dated as of March 21, 1994 (the "Merger Agreement"), entered 
in by and among Novell, Sub, WordPerfect, Alan C. Ashton, Bruce W. Bastian and 
Melania L. Bastian. As of May 31, 1994, the Merger Agreement was amended by 
the parties thereto to provide for the merger of WordPerfect directly into 
Novell. All references herein to the Merger Agreement are to the Merger 
Agreement as amended.

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Novell became the surviving corporation
and holders of the issued and outstanding shares of WordPerfect Common Stock
received an aggregate of 51,380,100 shares of Novell Common Stock. Each
shareholder of WordPerfect received one share of Novell Common Stock for
each share of WordPerfect Common Stock owned by such shareholder. Each
outstanding option to acquire shares of WordPerfect Common Stock were 
assumed by Novell and became exercisable for an equivalent number of shares 
of Novell Common Stock. The vesting of such options accelerated immediately 
upon consummation of the Merger, based on existing contractual commitments to 
holders of such options. As a result of the Merger, Novell has assumed options 
which, at the time of the Merger, represent the right to purchase 7,820,000 
shares of Common Stock of Novell.

The Merger Agreement provided that Dr. Ashton and Mr. Bastian (or 
designees of each of them) be elected to the Novell Board of Directors. 
Dr. Ashton and Mr. Bastian elected to defer joining the Novell Board of 
Directors at this time. However, Dr. Ashton and Mr. Bastian are expected 
to make a request to join the Novell Board of Directors in the latter part 
of 1994. Certain "affiliates" (as that term is defined for purposes of 
Rule 145 of the Securities Act) of WordPerfect have entered into agreements 
restricting the sale or dispositions of their shares of Novell Common Stock 
received by them in the Merger (including shares of Novell Common Stock 
issued upon the exercise of options) so as to comply with the requirements 
of securitieslaws, tax laws and pooling of interests accounting.

Additionally, on March 20, 1994, Novell entered into a Purchase and
License Agreement (the "Borland Agreement") with Borland International, 
Inc. ("Borland"). Pursuant to such agreement, on June 24, 1994, Novell
acquired Borland's Quattro Pro spreadsheet product line for $110 million 
of cash. Novell also acquired for $35 million of cash, a three-year license 
to reproduce and distribute up to one million copies of current and future
versions of Borland's Paradox relational database products as part of a
suite of products including WordPerfect and any Quattro Pro product. 

Novell is the leading provider of network server operating system
software that integrates desktop computers, servers, and mini-computer and
mainframe hosts for business-wide information sharing. Novell's NetWare 
network computing products manage and control the sharing of data, applications
and services among personal computer work groups and departmental networks,
and across business-wide information systems. Novell's products support
standards to integrate DOS, IBM's OS/2, Microsoft Windows, Apple/Macintosh 
and UNIX System desktop computers with each other and with IBM, Digital 
Equipment Corporation ("DEC"), Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP") and UNIX System

WordPerfect Corporation is a leading provider of software applications
that enable users to create and process complex documents. WordPerfect also
produces a broad range of software in the areas of workgroup automations,
general business, electronic publishing and consumer products. 
WordPerfect's products provide individuals, small businesses and large, global

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINING FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS 

Note A. The unaudited pro forma condensed combining financial statements
of Novell and WordPerfect give retroactive effect to the merger which is
being accounted for as a pooling of interests, and as a result, the unaudited
pro forma condensed combining balance sheets and statements of income are
presented as if the combining companies had been combined for all periods
presented. The unaudited pro forma condensed combining financial statements 
will become the historical financial statements for Novell upon issuance
of the financial statements for the period that includes the date of the
acquisition. These unaudited pro forma condensed combining financial
statements may not be indicative of the results that may be obtained in
the future. The unaudited pro forma condensed combining financial
statements, including the notes thereto, should be read in conjunction with 
the historical consolidated financial statements of Novell and WordPerfect.

The pro forma combined net income per share is based on the combined
weighted average number of common shares of Novell Common Stock and 
WordPerfect Common Stock for each period, based on the Exchange Ratio 
of one share of Novell Common Stock for each share of WordPerfect Common 
Stock. The pro forma condensed combining balance sheet as of April 30, 1994 
reflects the issuance of 51,380,100 shares of Novell Common Stock in exchange 
for all of WordPerfect Common Stock outstanding at April 30, 1994 based on the
Exchange Ratio of one share of Novell Common Stock for each share of 
WordPerfect Common Stock.

Note B. WordPerfect has a calendar year end and, accordingly the
WordPerfect statements of income for the years ended December 31, 1993, 
1992, and 1991, have been combined with the Novell statements of income 
for the fiscal years ended October 30, 1993, October 31, 1992 and October 
26, 1991, respectively. In order to conform WordPerfect's year end to 
Novell's fiscal year end, the unaudited pro forma combined data for the 
six months ended April 30, 1994, includes two months (November and December 
1993) for WordPerfect, which are also included in the pro forma combined 
statement of income for the year ended October 30, 1993. Accordingly, an 
adjustment has been made in the six months ended April 30, 1994 to retained 
earnings for the duplication of net income of $39.9 million for such two 
month period. Other results for such two month period of WordPerfect 
included net sales of $136.6 million, income before taxes of $34.6 million 
and income tax benefits of $5.3 million. The pro forma condensed combining 
data for the six months ended May 1, 1993 combines Novell's financial 
statements for the six months ended May 1, 1993 with the WordPerfect's 
financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 1993.

Note C. The additional unaudited pro forma data are based upon
historical combined income before taxes, adjusted to reflect a provision 
for income taxes as if WordPerfect and its S corporation subsidiaries 
had never been S corporations.

Note D. Certain reclassifications, none of which are material, have been
made to the WordPerfect financial statements in the unaudited pro forma
condensed combining financial statements to conform to Novell 
classifications. 

There are no other material adjustments required to the historical 
financial statements of Novell and WordPerfect to arrive at the unaudited 
pro forma condensed combining balance sheets and statements of income.
Note E. Total costs to be incurred by Novell and WordPerfect in
connection with the Merger are estimated to be approximately $5.5 million. 
These costs, relating to legal, printing, accounting, financial advisory 
services and other related expenses will be charged against income in the 
periods subsequent to the pro forma condensed combining financial statements. 
Accordingly, the effects of these costs have not been reflected in these 
pro forma condensed combining financial statements.
