J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.

New York, New York 10260

Dear Sirs:

Avery Dennison Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"),
proposes to issue and sell from time to time its Medium-Term Notes, Series B
(the "Securities") in an aggregate amount up to $100,000,000 and agrees with
each of you (individually, an "Agent," and collectively, the "Agents") as set
forth in this Agreement.

Subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and to the
reservation by the Company of the right to sell Securities directly on its own
behalf, the Company hereby (i) appoints each Agent as an agent of the Company
for the purpose of soliciting and receiving offers to purchase Securities from
the Company pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof and (ii) agrees that, except as
otherwise contemplated herein, whenever it determines to sell Securities
directly to any Agent as principal, it will enter into a separate agreement
(each a "Terms Agreement"), substantially in the form of Annex I hereto,
relating to such sale in accordance with Section 2(b) hereof.

The Securities will be issued under an Indenture, dated as of March
15, 1991, between the Company and Security Pacific National Bank, as trustee, as
amended by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 16, 1993 between
the Company and BankAmerica National Trust Company, as successor trustee (the
"Trustee"). The Indenture, as amended by the First Supplemental Indenture,
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Indenture." The Securities shall have
the maturity ranges, interest rates, if any, redemption provisions, if any, and
other terms set forth in the Prospectus referred to below as it may be amended
or
<PAGE>

supplemented from time to time. The Securities will be issued, and the terms
and rights thereof established, from time to time by the Company in accordance
with the Indenture.

1. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each 
Agent that:

(a) A registration statement on Form S-3 in respect of $100,000,000
aggregate amount of debt securities of the Company, including the
Securities, has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"Commission"); such registration statement and any post-effective amendment
thereto, each in the form heretofore delivered or to be delivered to such
Agent, excluding exhibits to such registration statement, but including all
documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus included therein,
have been declared effective by the Commission in such form; no other
document with respect to such registration statement or document
incorporated by reference therein, other than the prospectus and prospectus
supplement filed or to be filed with the Commission under Rule 424(b) of
the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Act"), and the Current Report on Form 8-K dated
concurrently herewith, has heretofore been filed or transmitted for filing
with the Commission; and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of such
registration statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose
has been initiated or threatened by the Commission (any preliminary
prospectus included in such registration statement or filed with the
Commission pursuant to Rule 424(a) under the Act being hereinafter called a
"Preliminary Prospectus"; the various parts of such registration statement,
including all exhibits thereto and the documents incorporated by reference
in the prospectus contained in the registration statement, at the time such
part of the registration statement became effective, but excluding Form T-1
and, if applicable, including the information contained in the form of
final prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under
the Act, each as amended at the time such part of the registration
statement became effective, being hereinafter collectively called the
"Registration Statement"; the prospectus (including, if applicable, any
prospectus supplement) relating to the Securities, in the form in which it
has most recently been filed, or transmitted for filing, with the
Commission on or prior to the date of this Agreement, being hereinafter
called the "Prospectus"; any reference herein to any Preliminary Prospectus
or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the documents
incorporated by reference therein pursuant to the applicable form under the
Act, as of the date of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the
case may be; any reference to any

2
<PAGE>

amendment or supplement to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus,
including any supplement to the Prospectus that sets forth only the terms
of a particular issue of the Securities (a "Pricing Supplement"), shall be
deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date of such
Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and
incorporated therein by reference; any reference to any amendment to the
Registration Statement shall be deemed to refer to and include any annual
report of the Company filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the
Exchange Act after the effective date of the Registration Statement that is
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement; and any reference
to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented shall be deemed to refer to
and include the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (including by the
applicable Pricing Supplement filed in accordance with Section 4(a) hereof)
in relation to Securities sold pursuant to this Agreement, in the form
filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act and in
accordance with Section 4(a) hereof, including any documents incorporated
by reference therein as of the date of such filing);

(b) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, when
they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may
be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or
the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder, and none of such documents contained an untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading; and any further documents so filed and incorporated by
reference in the Prospectus, or any further amendment or supplement
thereto, when such documents become effective or are filed with the
Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to
the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the
rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty
shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by any
Agent expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented to
relate to the Securities;

(c) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus conform, and any
further amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus will conform, in

3
<PAGE>

all material respects to the requirements of the Act and the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture Act"), and the
rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and the Registration
Statement does not and will not, as of the effective date of any part of
the Registration Statement and any amendment thereto, contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, and the Prospectus does not and will not, as of the applicable
filing date of the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto,
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; provided, however, that the representations and warranties
contained in this Section 1(c) shall not apply to any statements or
omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with information
furnished in writing to the Company by any Agent expressly for use in the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented to relate to the Securities;

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has sustained
since the date of the latest audited financial statements included or
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus any loss or interference with
its business from fire, explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not
covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute or court or governmental
action, order or decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented, which would individually or in the
aggregate have a material adverse effect on the business, management,
financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; and, since the respective
dates as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and
the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, there has not been any decrease
in the capital stock of the Company in excess of $20 million or any
increase in total debt of the Company and its subsidiaries of more than $50
million (excluding the issuance of any of the Securities) or any material
adverse change, or any development involving a prospective material adverse
change, in or affecting the business, management, financial position,
stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated
in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented;

(e) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as
a corporation in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation, with power

4
<PAGE>

and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and conduct its
business as described in the Prospectus;

(f) The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth in the
Prospectus, and all of the issued shares of capital stock of the Company
have been duly and validly authorized and issued and are fully paid and
non-assessable;

(g) The Securities have been duly authorized and, when issued and
delivered pursuant to this Agreement and any Terms Agreement, will have
been duly executed, authenticated, issued and delivered and will constitute
valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled to the
benefits provided by the Indenture, which will be substantially in the form
filed and incorporated by reference, as the case may be, as an exhibit to
the Registration Statement, subject to the effect of bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now or
hereafter in effect relating to or limiting the rights and remedies of
creditors generally and to the unavailability of specific performance,
injunctive relief or other equitable remedies; the Indenture has been duly
authorized and duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and constitutes
a valid and legally binding instrument, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, subject to the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or
limiting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and to the
unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other
equitable remedies; and the Indenture conforms and the Securities of any
particular issuance of Securities will conform to the descriptions thereof
contained in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented to relate to such
issuance of Securities;

(h) The issue and sale of the Securities, the compliance by the
Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture, this
Agreement and any Terms Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions
herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or result in a
breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or constitute a
default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement or
other agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party or by which
the Company is bound or to which any of the property or assets of the
Company is subject, nor will such action result in any violation of the
provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or the Bylaws
of the Company or any statute or any order, rule or regulation of any court
or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any
of its properties; and no consent, approval, authorization, order,
registration or qualification of or

5
<PAGE>

with any court or governmental agency or body is required for the
solicitation of offers to purchase Securities, the issue and sale of the
Securities or the consummation by the Company of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, any Terms Agreement or the Indenture,
except such as have been, or will have been prior to the Commencement Date
(as defined in Section 3 hereof), obtained under the Act or the Trust
Indenture Act and such consents, approvals, authorizations, orders,
registrations or qualifications as may be required under state securities
or Blue Sky laws in connection with the solicitation by such Agent of
offers to purchase Securities from the Company and with purchases of
Securities by such Agent as principal, as the case may be, in each case in
the manner contemplated hereby;

(i) Other than as set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or
governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or to which any property of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries is subject, which, if determined adversely to the Company
or any of its subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate have a
material adverse effect on the financial position, stockholders' equity or
results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole,
and, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no such proceedings are
threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or threatened by
others; and

(j) Immediately after any sale of Securities by the Company hereunder
or under any Terms Agreement, the aggregate amount of Securities which
shall have been issued and sold by the Company hereunder or under any Terms
Agreement and of any debt securities of the Company (other than such
Securities) that shall have been issued and sold pursuant to the
Registration Statement will not exceed the amount of debt securities
registered under the Registration Statement.

2. (a) On the basis of the representations and warranties, and
subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, each of the Agents hereby
severally and not jointly agrees, as agent of the Company, to use its best
efforts to solicit and receive offers to purchase the Securities from the
Company upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented from time to time. So long as this Agreement shall remain in
effect with respect to any Agent, the Company shall not, without the consent of
such Agent, solicit or accept offers to purchase, or sell, any debt securities
with a maturity at the time of original issuance of 9 months or more except
pursuant to this Agreement, any Terms Agreement, a private placement not
constituting a public offering under the Act, in connection with a firm
commitment underwriting pursuant to an

6
<PAGE>

underwriting agreement that does not provide for a continuous offering of
medium-term debt securities or as otherwise provided in this Section 2(a).
However, the Company reserves the right to sell, and may solicit and accept
offers to purchase, Securities directly on its own behalf, and, in the case of
any such sale not resulting from a solicitation made by any Agent, no commission
will be payable with respect to such sale. These provisions shall not limit
Section 4(f) hereof or any similar provision included in any Terms Agreement.
In addition, after notice to the Agents, the Company may appoint one or more
additional agents to solicit and receive offers to purchase Securities from the
Company upon the terms and conditions set forth in the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented from time to time, provided that any such additional agent is made
a party to this Agreement or executes a distribution agreement substantially
identical to this Agreement.

Procedural details relating to the issue and delivery of Securities,
the solicitation of offers to purchase Securities and the payment in each case
therefor shall be as set forth in the Administrative Procedure attached hereto
as Annex II as it may be amended from time to time by written agreement between
the Agents and the Company (the "Administrative Procedure"). The provisions of
the Administrative Procedure shall apply to all transactions contemplated
hereunder other than those made pursuant to a Terms Agreement. Each Agent and
the Company agree to perform the respective duties and obligations specifically
provided to be performed by each of them in the Administrative Procedure. The
Company will furnish to the Trustee a copy of the Administrative Procedure as
from time to time in effect.

The Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to instruct
the Agents to suspend at any time, for any period of time or permanently, the
solicitation of offers to purchase the Securities. As soon as practicable, but
in any event not later than one business day in New York City, after receipt of
notice from the Company, the Agents will suspend solicitation of offers to
purchase Securities from the Company until such time as the Company has advised
the Agents that such solicitation may be resumed.

The Company agrees to pay each Agent a commission, at the time of
settlement of any sale of a Security by the Company as a result of a
solicitation made by such Agent, in an amount equal to the following applicable
percentage of the principal amount of such Security sold:

</TABLE> 

(b) Each sale of Securities to any Agent as principal shall be made in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (unless the Company and such
Agent shall otherwise agree) a Terms Agreement which will provide for the sale
of such Securities to, and the purchase thereof by, such Agent. A Terms
Agreement may also specify certain provisions relating to the reoffering of such
Securities by such Agent. The commitment of any Agent to purchase Securities as
principal, whether pursuant to any Terms Agreement or otherwise, shall be deemed
to have been made on the basis of the representations and warranties of the
Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions herein
set forth. Each Terms Agreement shall specify the principal amount of
Securities to be purchased by any Agent pursuant thereto, the price to be paid
to the Company for such Securities, any provisions relating to rights of, and
default by, underwriters acting together with such Agent in the reoffering of
the Securities and the time and date and place of delivery of and payment for
such Securities. Such Terms Agreement shall also specify any requirements for
opinions of counsel, accountants' letters and officers' certificates pursuant to
Section 4 hereof.

For each sale of Securities to an Agent as principal that is not made
pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the procedural details relating to the issue and
delivery of such Securities and payment therefor shall be as set forth in the
Administrative Procedure. For each such sale of Securities to an Agent as
principal that is not made pursuant to a Terms Agreement, the Company agrees to
pay such Agent a commission (or grant an equivalent discount) as provided in
Section 2(a) hereof and in accordance with the schedule set forth therein.

Each time and date of delivery of and payment for Securities to be
purchased by an Agent as principal, whether set

8
<PAGE>

forth in a Terms Agreement or in accordance with the Administrative Procedure,
is referred to herein as a "Time of Delivery".

3. The documents required to be delivered pursuant to Section 6
hereof on the Commencement Date (as defined below) shall be delivered to the
Agents at the offices of Latham & Watkins at 10:00 a.m., Los Angeles time, on
the date of this Agreement, which date and time of such delivery may be
postponed by agreement between the Agents and the Company but in no event shall
be later than the day prior to the date on which solicitation of offers to
purchase Securities is commenced or on which any Terms Agreement is executed
(such time and date being referred to herein as the "Commencement Date").

4. The Company covenants and agrees with each Agent:

(a) (i) To make no amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus (A) prior to the Commencement Date which shall
be reasonably disapproved by any Agent promptly after reasonable notice
thereof or (B) after the date of any Terms Agreement or other agreement by
an Agent to purchase Securities as principal and prior to the related Time
of Delivery which shall be reasonably disapproved by any Agent party to
such Terms Agreement or so purchasing as principal promptly after
reasonable notice thereof; (ii) to prepare, with respect to any Securities
to be sold through or to such Agent pursuant to this Agreement, a Pricing
Supplement with respect to such Securities in a form previously approved by
such Agent and to file such Pricing Supplement pursuant to Rule 424(b)(3)
under the Act not later than the close of business of the Commission on the
fifth business day after the date on which such Pricing Supplement is first
used; (iii) to make no amendment or supplement to the Registration
Statement or Prospectus, other than any Pricing Supplement, at any time
prior to having afforded each Agent a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon; (iv) to file promptly all reports and any definitive proxy
or information statements required to be filed by the Company with the
Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c), 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act for so long as the delivery of a prospectus is required in connection
with the offering or sale of the Securities, and during such same period to
advise such Agent, promptly after the Company receives notice thereof, of
the time when any amendment to the Registration Statement has been filed or
has become effective or any supplement to the Prospectus or any amended
Prospectus (other than any Pricing Supplement that relates to Securities
not purchased through or by such Agent) has been filed with the Commission,
of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of any order
preventing or suspending the use of

9
<PAGE>

any prospectus relating to the Securities, of the suspension of the
qualification of the Securities for offering or sale in any jurisdiction,
of the initiation or threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or
of any request by the Commission for the amendment or supplement of the
Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information; and (v)
in the event of the issuance of any such stop order or of any such order
preventing or suspending the use of any such prospectus or suspending any
such qualification, to use promptly its best efforts to obtain its
withdrawal;

(b) Promptly from time to time to take such action as such Agent may
reasonably request to qualify the Securities for offering and sale under
the securities laws of such jurisdictions as such Agent may request and to
comply with such laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings
therein for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution or
sale of the Securities; provided, however, that in connection therewith the
Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or to
file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction;

(c) To furnish such Agent with copies of the Registration Statement
and each amendment thereto, with copies of the Prospectus as each time
amended or supplemented, other than any Pricing Supplement (except as
provided in the Administrative Procedure), in the form in which it is filed
with the Commission pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act, and with copies of
the documents incorporated by reference therein, all in such quantities as
such Agent may reasonably request from time to time; and, if the delivery
of a prospectus is required at any time in connection with the offering or
sale of the Securities (including Securities purchased from the Company by
such Agent as principal) and if at such time any event shall have occurred
as a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would
include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus
is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be
necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or
to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in
the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the
Trust Indenture Act, to notify such Agent and request such Agent, in its
capacity as agent of the Company, to suspend solicitation of offers to
purchase Securities from the Company (and, if so notified, such Agent shall
cease such solicitations as soon as practicable, but in any event not later
than one business day later); and if the Company

10
<PAGE>

shall decide to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus as then amended or supplemented, to so advise such Agent
promptly by telephone (with confirmation in writing) and to prepare and
cause to be filed promptly with the Commission an amendment or supplement
to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as then amended or
supplemented that will correct such statement or omission or effect such
compliance; provided, however, that if during such same period such Agent
continues to own Securities purchased from the Company by such Agent as
principal or such Agent is otherwise required to deliver a prospectus in
respect of transactions in the Securities, the Company shall promptly
prepare and file with the Commission such an amendment or supplement;

(d) To make generally available to its securityholders as soon as
practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the
effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c)) an
earnings statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not be
audited) complying with Section 11(a) of the Act and the rules and
regulations of the Commission thereunder (including, at the option of the
Company, Rule 158);

(e) So long as any Securities are outstanding, to furnish to such
Agent copies of all reports or other communications (financial or other)
furnished to stockholders, and deliver to such Agent (i) as soon as they
are available, copies of any reports and financial statements furnished to
or filed with the Commission or any national securities exchange on which
any class of securities of the Company is listed; and (ii) such additional
information concerning the business and financial condition of the Company
as such Agent may from time to time reasonably request (such financial
statements to be on a consolidated basis to the extent the accounts of the
Company and its subsidiaries are consolidated in reports furnished to its
stockholders generally or to the Commission);

(f) That, from the date of any Terms Agreement with such Agent or
other agreement by such Agent to purchase Securities as principal and
continuing to and including the earlier of (i) the termination of the
trading restrictions for the Securities purchased thereunder, as notified
to the Company by such Agent and (ii) the related Time of Delivery, not to
offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities
of the Company which both mature more than 9 months after such Time of
Delivery and are substantially similar to the Securities without the prior
written consent of such Agent;

11
<PAGE>

(g) That each acceptance by the Company of an offer to purchase
Securities hereunder (including any purchase by such Agent as principal not
pursuant to a Terms Agreement), and each execution and delivery by the
Company of a Terms Agreement with such Agent, shall be deemed to be an
affirmation to such Agent that the representations and warranties of the
Company contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement are true and
correct as of the date of such acceptance or of such Terms Agreement, as
the case may be, as though made at and as of such date, and an undertaking
that such representations and warranties will be true and correct as of the
settlement date for the Securities relating to such acceptance or as of the
Time of Delivery relating to such sale, as the case may be, as though made
at and as of such date (except that such representations and warranties
shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus
as amended and supplemented relating to such Securities);

(h) That reasonably in advance of each time the Registration
Statement or the Prospectus shall be amended or supplemented (other than by
a Pricing Supplement) and each time a document filed under the Act or the
Exchange Act is incorporated by reference into the Prospectus, and each
time the Company sells Securities to such Agent as principal pursuant to a
Terms Agreement and such Terms Agreement specifies the delivery of an

opinion of the same tenor as the opinion of such counsel referred to in

changes as may be necessary to reflect changes in the financial statements
and other information derived from the accounting records of the Company,
to the extent such financial statements and other information are available
as of a date not more than five business days prior to the date of such
letter; provided, however, that, with respect to any financial information
or other matter, such letter may reconfirm as true and correct at such date
as though made at and as of such date, rather than repeat, statements with
respect to such financial information or other matter made in the letter
referred to in Section 6(d) hereof which was last furnished to such Agent;

as the certificates referred to in said Section 6(g) but modified to relate

refuse to purchase and pay for such Securities if, on the related

condition set forth in Section 6(a), 6(e) or 6(f) hereof shall not have
been satisfied (it being understood that the judgment of such person with
respect to the impracticability or inadvisability of such purchase of
Securities shall be substituted, for purposes of this Section 4(1), for the
respective judgments of an Agent with respect to certain matters referred
to in such Sections 6(a), 6(e) and 6(f), and that such Agent shall have no
duty or obligation whatsoever to exercise the judgment permitted under such
Sections 6(a), 6(e) and 6(f) on behalf of any such person).

discretion, to the condition that all representations and warranties and other
statements of the Company herein (and, in the case of an obligation of an Agent
under a Terms Agreement, in or incorporated in such Terms Agreement by
reference) are true and correct at and as of the Commencement Date and any
applicable date referred to in Section 4(k) hereof that is prior to such

performed, and the following additional conditions:

(a) (i) With respect to any Securities sold at such Solicitation Time
or at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as the case may be, the Prospectus
as amended or supplemented (including the Pricing Supplement) with respect

which were last furnished to such Agent pursuant to this Section 6(b) to
the same extent as though it or they were dated the date of such letter

opinions shall be deemed to relate to the Registration Statement and the

lieu of such an opinion or opinions, an opinion or opinions of the same
tenor as the opinion or opinions referred to in clause (i) but modified to
relate to the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and
supplemented to such date; and in each case such counsel shall have
received such papers and information as they may reasonably request to
enable them to pass upon such matters;

(c) (1) Robert G. van Schoonenberg, General Counsel of the Company,
or other counsel for the Company satisfactory to such Agent, shall have

or any of its subsidiaries, would individually or in the aggregate
have a material adverse effect on the financial position,
stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole; and to the best of such counsel's
knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by
governmental authorities or threatened by others;

(iii) The issue and sale of the Securities, the compliance by the
Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture,
this Agreement and the applicable Terms Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict
with or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or
provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage,
deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to
which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which
the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the
property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is
subject, or any statute or any order, rule or regulation known to such
counsel of any court or governmental agency or body having
jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of its
properties, which breach or violation would individually or in the
aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial position,
stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole, nor will such action result in any
violation of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation, as
amended, of the Company or the Bylaws of the Company;

hereby; and

17
<PAGE>

(v) Such counsel does not know of any amendment to the
Registration Statement required to be filed or any contracts or other

described in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended
or supplemented which are not filed or incorporated by reference or
described as required;

(2) Latham & Watkins, counsel for the Company, or other counsel for
the Company satisfactory to such Agent, shall have furnished to such Agent
their written opinions, dated the Commencement Date and each applicable
date referred to in Section 4(i) hereof that is on or prior to such
Solicitation Time or Time of Delivery, as the case may be, in form and
substance satisfactory to such Agent, to the effect that:

(i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly

of Delaware, with corporate power and authority to own its properties
and conduct its business as described in the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented;

(ii) This Agreement and any applicable Terms Agreement have been
duly authorized, executed and delivered by the Company;

(iii) The Securities have been duly authorized and, when duly
executed, authenticated, issued and delivered by the Company, and paid
for as contemplated by this Agreement and any applicable Terms
Agreement, will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of
the Company entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture,
subject to the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating
to or limiting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and to
the unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other
equitable remedies; and the Indenture conforms and the Securities will
conform in all material respects to the descriptions thereof in the
Prospectus as amended or supplemented;

(iv) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Company and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally
binding instrument, enforceable in accordance with its terms,

18
<PAGE>

subject to the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating
to or limiting the rights and remedies of creditors generally and to
the unavailability of specific performance, injunctive relief or other
equitable remedies; and the Indenture has been duly qualified under
the Trust Indenture Act;

(v) The issue and sale of the Securities, the compliance by the
Company with all of the provisions of the Securities, the Indenture,
this Agreement and any applicable Terms Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions herein and therein contemplated will not result in
any violation of the provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation of
the Company, as amended, or the Bylaws of the Company;

(vi) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus
(other than the financial statements, related schedules and other
financial or statistical data therein, as to which such counsel need
express no opinion), when they became effective or were filed with the
Commission, as the case may be, appeared on their face to comply as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act or the
Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder; and

(vii) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended
and supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto
made by the Company prior to the date of such opinion (other than the
financial statements, related schedules and other financial or
statistical data therein, as to which such counsel need express no
opinion) appeared on their face to comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder;

Such counsel shall state that they have participated in conferences
with officers and other representatives of the Com-pany at which the contents of
the Registration Statement and Prospectus and related matters were discussed
and, although such counsel may state that they are not passing upon, and do not
assume any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of the
statements contained in the Registration State-ment and the Prospectus and have
not made any independent check or verification thereof, such counsel shall state
that during the course of such participation (relying in connection with
questions of materiality, on representations of factual matters of officers and
other representatives of the Company), nothing has come to their attention that
caused them to believe that the

19
<PAGE>

Registration Statement, at the time any part of it became effective, contained
an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, or the Prospectus, as of its date and at the date of such opinion,
included an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material
fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; it being understood
that such counsel need express no belief with respect to the financial
statements, schedules and other financial or statistical data included in the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus or with respect to the Form T-1.

(d) Not later than 10:00 a.m., Los Angeles time, on the Commencement
Date and not later than 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on each applicable
date referred to in Section 4(j) hereof that is on or prior to such
Solicitation Time or Time of Delivery, as the case may be, the independent
certified public accountants who have certified the financial statements of
the Company and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by reference in
the Registration Statement shall have furnished to such Agent a letter,
dated the Commencement Date or such applicable date, as the case may be, in
form and substance satisfactory to such Agent, to the effect set forth in
Annex III hereto;

(e) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have
sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements
included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented any loss or interference with its business from fire,
explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or
from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or decree,
otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented and (ii) since the respective dates as of which information is
given in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented there shall not have
been any decrease in the capital stock of the Company in excess of $20
million or any increase in the total debt of the Company and its
subsidiaries of more than $50 million (excluding the issuance of any of the
Securities) or any change, or any development involving a prospective
change, in or affecting the business, management, financial position,
stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and its
subsidiaries, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus
as amended or supplemented, the effect of which, in any such case described
in clause (i) or (ii), is in the judgment of such Agent so material and
adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the
solicitation by such Agent of offers to purchase Securities

20
<PAGE>

from the Company or the purchase by such Agent of Securities from the
Company as principal, as the case may be, on the terms and in the manner
contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented;

(f) There shall not have occurred any of the following: (i) a
suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally on the
New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a general moratorium on commercial banking
activities in New York declared by either Federal or New York State
authorities; (iii) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities involving the
United States or the declaration by the United States of a national
emergency or war if the effect of any such event specified in this clause
(iii) in the judgment of such Agent makes it impracticable or inadvisable
to proceed with the solicitation of offers to purchase Securities or the
purchase of Securities from the Company as principal, pursuant to the
applicable Terms Agreement or otherwise, as the case may be, on the terms
and in the manner contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented; (iv) any downgrading in the rating accorded the Company's
debt securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating
organization", as that term is defined by the Commission for purposes of
Rule 436(g)(2) under the Act; or (v) such organization shall have publicly
announced that it has under surveillance or review, with possible negative
implications, its rating of any of the Company's debt securities; and

(g) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to
such Agent certificates of officers of the Company dated the Commencement
Date and each applicable date referred to in Section 4(k) hereof that is on
or prior to such Solicitation Time or Time of Delivery, as the case may be,
in such form and executed by such officers of the Company as shall be
satisfactory to such Agent, as to the accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company herein at and as of the Commencement Date or such
applicable date, as the case may be, as to the performance by the Company
of all of its obligations hereunder to be performed at or prior to the
Commencement Date or such applicable date, as the case may be, as to the
matters set forth in subsections (a) and (e) of this Section 6, and as to
such other matters as such Agent may reasonably request.

7. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Agent
against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which
such Agent may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out
of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the

21
<PAGE>

Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will
reimburse such Agent for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it
in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such
expenses are incurred; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable
in any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability
arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
or omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company by such Agent expressly for use therein;
and provided, further, that the Company shall not be liable to any Agent under
the indemnity agreement in this subsection (a) with respect to any Preliminary
Prospectus to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability of such
Agent results from the fact such Agent sold, or acted as Agent, in the sale of,
such Securities to a person to whom there was not sent or given, at or prior to
the written confirmation of such sale, a copy of the Prospectus (excluding any
documents incorporated by reference) or of the Prospectus as then amended or
supplemented (excluding any documents incorporated by reference) in any case
where such delivery is required by the Act if the Company has previously
furnished copies thereof to such Agent and the loss, claim, damage or liability
of such Agent results from an untrue statement or omission of a material fact
contained in the Preliminary Prospectus which was corrected in the Prospectus
(or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented).

(b) Each Agent will, severally and not jointly, indemnify and hold
harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which
the Company may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out
of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration
Statement, the Prospectus, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any
other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to
the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission
or alleged omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration
Statement, the Prospectus, the

22
<PAGE>

Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any other prospectus relating to the
Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such Agent
expressly for use therein; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other
expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or
defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection
(a) or (b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified
party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the
indemnifying party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in
writing of the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the
indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may have to
any indemnified party otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such
action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the
indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be
entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly
with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense
thereof, with counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not,
except with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying
party), and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party
of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall
not be liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently
incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other
than reasonable costs of investigation and except as otherwise provided herein.
In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its
own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense
of such indemnified party unless (i) the indemnifying party and the indemnified
party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel or (ii) the
named parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include
both the indemnifying party and the indemnified party and representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between them. It is understood that the indemnifying party
shall not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings, in the same
jurisdiction, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm
(in addition to any local counsel) for all such indemnified parties and that all
such fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. The
indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding
effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if
there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to
indemnify the

23
<PAGE>

indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such
settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written
consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or
threatened proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have
been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified
party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such
indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of
such proceeding.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is
unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under
subsection (a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each
indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the
other from the offering of the Securities to which such loss, claim, damage or
liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however, the allocation
provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable
law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required under
subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such
amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative
fault of the Company on the one hand and each Agent on the other in connection
with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages
or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the
one hand and each Agent on the other shall be deemed to be in the same
proportion as the total net proceeds from the sale of Securities (before
deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total commissions or
discounts received by such Agent in respect thereof. The relative fault shall
be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state
a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading relates to information supplied by the Company
on the one hand or by any Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
statement or omission. The Company and each Agent agree that it would not be
just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this subsection (d) were
determined by per capita allocation (even if all Agents were treated as one
entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not
take account of the equitable

24
<PAGE>

considerations referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or
payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection
(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred
by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), an
Agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by
which the total public offering price at which the Securities purchased by or
through it were sold exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has
otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be
entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. The obligations of each of the Agents under this subsection
(d) to contribute are several in proportion to the respective purchases made by
or through it to which such loss, claim, damage or liability (or action in
respect, thereof) relates and are not joint.

(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 7 shall be in
addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend,
upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any
Agent within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of each Agent under
this Section 7 shall be in addition to any liability which such Agent may
otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each
officer and director of the Company and to each person, if any, who controls the
Company within the meaning of the Act.

8. Each Agent, in soliciting offers to purchase Securities from the
Company and in performing the other obligations of such Agent hereunder (other
than in respect of any purchase by an Agent as principal, pursuant to a Terms
Agreement or otherwise), is acting solely as agent for the Company and not as
principal. Each Agent will make reasonable efforts to assist the Company in
obtaining performance by each purchaser whose offer to purchase Securities from
the Company was solicited by such Agent and has been accepted by the Company,
but such Agent shall not have any liability to the Company in the event such
purchase is not consummated for any reason. If the Company shall default on its
obligation to deliver Securities to a purchaser whose offer it has accepted, the
Company shall (i) hold each Agent harmless against any loss, claim or damage
arising from or as a result of such default by the Company and (ii)
notwithstanding such default, pay to the Agent that solicited such offer any
commission to which it would be entitled in connection with such sale.

9. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations,
warranties and other statements by any Agent and the Company set forth in or
made pursuant to this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless
of any investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on
behalf of any Agent or any controlling person of any Agent, or the Company, or
any officer or director or any controlling person of the Company, and shall
survive each delivery of and payment for any of the Securities.

10. The provisions of this Agreement relating to the solicitation of
offers to purchase Securities from the Company may be suspended or terminated at
any time by the Company as to any Agent or by any Agent as to such Agent upon
the giving of written notice of such suspension or termination to such Agent or
the Company, as the case may be. In the event of such suspension or termination
with respect to any Agent, (x) this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect with respect to any Agent as to which such suspension or termination has
not occurred, (y) this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with
respect to the rights and obligations of any party which have previously accrued
or which relate to Securities which are already issued, agreed to be issued or
the subject of a pending offer at the time of such suspension or termination and
(z) in any event, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect insofar
as the fourth paragraph of Section 2(a), Section 4(d), Section 4(e), Section 5,
Section 7, Section 8 and Section 9 hereof are concerned.

11. Except as otherwise specifically provided herein or in the
Administrative Procedure, all statements, requests, notices and advices
hereunder shall be in writing, or by telephone if promptly confirmed in writing,
and if to Goldman, Sachs & Co. shall be sufficient in all respects when

inure solely to the benefit of, each Agent and the Company, and to the extent
provided in Section 7, Section 8 and Section 9 hereof, the officers and
directors of the Company

26

and any person who controls any Agent or the Company, and their respective
personal representatives, successors and assigns, and no other person shall
acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this Agreement or any Terms
Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities through or from any Agent
hereunder shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of such
purchase.

13. Time shall be of the essence in this Agreement and any Terms
Agreement. As used herein, the term "business day" shall mean any day when the
Commission in Washington, D.C. is open for business.

construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE
------------------------

This Administrative Procedure relates to the Securities defined in the
Distribution Agreement, dated March 29, 1994 (the "Distribution Agreement"),
between Avery Dennison Corporation (the "Company") and Goldman, Sachs & Co. and
J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (together, the "Agents"), to which this
Administrative Procedure is attached as Annex II. Defined terms used herein and
not defined herein shall have the meanings given such terms in the Distribution
Agreement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or the Indenture.

The procedures to be followed with respect to the settlement of sales
of Securities directly by the Company to purchasers solicited by an Agent, as
agent, are set forth below. The terms and settlement details related to a
purchase of Securities by an Agent, as principal, from the Company will be set
forth in a Terms Agreement pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, unless the
Company and such Agent otherwise agree as provided in Section 2(b) of the
Distribution Agreement, in which case the procedures to be followed in respect
of the settlement of such sale will be as set forth below. An Agent, in
relation to a purchase of a Security by a purchaser solicited by such Agent, is
referred to herein as the "Selling Agent" and, in relation to a purchase of a
Security by such Agent as principal other than pursuant to a Terms Agreement, as
the "Purchasing Agent".

The Company will advise each Agent in writing of those persons with
whom such Agent is to communicate regarding offers to purchase Securities and
the related settlement details.

Each Security will be issued only in fully registered form and will be
represented by either a global security (a "Global Security") delivered to the
Trustee, as agent for The Depository Trust Company (the "Depositary") and
recorded in the book-entry system maintained by the Depositary (a "Book-Entry
Security") or a certificate issued in definitive form (a "Certificated
Security") delivered to a person designated by an Agent, as set forth in the
applicable Pricing Supplement. An owner of a Book-Entry Security will not be
entitled to receive a certificate representing such a Security, except as
provided in the Indenture.

Certificated Securities will be issued in accordance with the
Administrative Procedure set forth in Part I hereof, and

II-1
<PAGE>

Book-Entry Securities will be issued in accordance with the Administrative
Procedure set forth in Part II hereof.

PART I: ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE FOR CERTIFICATED SECURITIES
- ------------------------------------------------------------

Posting Rates by Company:

The Company and the Agents will discuss from time to time the rates of
interest per annum to be borne by and the maturity of Certificated Securities
that may be sold as a result of the solicitation of offers by an Agent. The
Company may establish a fixed set of interest rates and maturities for an
offering period ("posting"). If the Company decides to change already posted
rates, it will promptly advise the Agents to suspend solicitation of offers
until the new posted rates have been established with the Agents.

Acceptance of Offers by Company:

Each Agent will promptly advise the Company by telephone or other
appropriate means of all reasonable offers to purchase Certificated Securities,
other than those rejected by such Agent. Each Agent may, in its discretion
reasonably exercised, reject any offer received by it in whole or in part. Each
Agent also may make offers to the Company to purchase Certificated Securities as
a Purchasing Agent. The Company will have the sole right to accept offers to
purchase Certificated Securities and may reject any such offer in whole or in
part.

The Company will promptly notify the Selling Agent or Purchasing
Agent, as the case may be, of its acceptance or rejection of an offer to
purchase Certificated Securities. If the Company accepts an offer to purchase
Certificated Securities, it will confirm such acceptance in writing to the
Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, and the Trustee.

Communication of Sale Information to Company by Selling Agent:

After the acceptance of an offer by the Company, the Selling Agent or
Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, will communicate the following details of
the terms of such offer (the "Sale Information") to the Company by telephone
(confirmed in writing) or by facsimile transmission or other acceptable written
means:

(1) Principal amount of Certificated Securities to be purchased;

(2) If a Fixed Rate Certificated Security, the interest rate and the
initial Interest Payment Date;

II-2
<PAGE>

(3) Maturity Date;

(4) Specified Currency and, if the Specified Currency is other than
U.S. dollars, the applicable Exchange Rate for such Specified
Currency;

(10) If a redeemable Certificated Security, such of the following as
are applicable:

(i) Redemption Commencement Date,

(ii) Initial Redemption Price (% of par), and

(iii) Amount (% of par) that the Redemption Price shall decline
(but not below par) on each anniversary of the Redemption
Commencement Date;

(11) If a Floating Rate Certificated Security, such of the following
as are applicable:

(i) Interest Rate Basis,

(ii) Index Maturity,

(iii) Spread or Spread Multiplier,

(iv) Maximum Rate,

(v) Minimum Rate,

(vi) Initial Interest Rate,

registered owner(s);

(13) Denomination of certificates to be delivered at settlement; and

(14) Book-Entry Security or Certificated Security.

Preparation of Pricing Supplement by Company:

copies of such Pricing Supplement to the Selling Agent or Purchasing Agent, as
the case may be, not later than 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the business
day following the date of acceptance of such offer, or if the Company and the
purchaser agree to settlement on the date of such acceptance, not later than
noon, New York City time, on such date. The Company will arrange to have ten
Pricing Supplements filed with the Commission not later than the close of
business of the Commission on the fifth business day following the date on which
such Pricing Supplement is first used.

Delivery of Confirmation and Prospectus to Purchaser by Selling Agent:

The Selling Agent will deliver to the purchaser of a Certificated
Security a written confirmation of the sale and delivery and payment
instructions. In addition, the Selling Agent will deliver to such purchaser or
its agent the Prospectus as amended or supplemented (including the Pricing
Supplement) in relation to such Certificated Security prior to or together with
the earlier of the delivery to such purchaser or its agent of (a) the
confirmation of sale or (b) the Certificated Security.

Date of Settlement:

All offers solicited by a Selling Agent or made by a Purchasing Agent
and accepted by the Company will be settled on a date (the "Settlement Date")
which is the fifth business day after the date of acceptance of such offer,
unless the Company and the purchaser agree to settlement (a) on any other
business day after the acceptance of such offer or (b) with respect to an offer
accepted by the Company prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the date of
such acceptance.

II-4
<PAGE>

Instruction from Company to Trustee for Preparation of Certificated Securities:

After receiving the Sale Information from the Selling Agent or
Purchasing Agent, as the case may be, the Company will communicate such Sale
Information to the Trustee by telephone (confirmed in writing) or by facsimile
transmission or other acceptable written means.

The Company will instruct the Trustee by facsimile transmission or
other acceptable written means to authenticate and deliver the Certificated
Securities no later than 2:15 p.m., New York City time, on the Settlement Date.
Such instruction will be given by the Company prior to 3:00 p.m., New York City

Certificated Securities in which case such instruction will be given by the
Company by 11:00 a.m., New York City time.

Preparation and Delivery of Certificated Securities by Trustee and
Receipt of Payment Therefor:

The Trustee will prepare each Certificated Security and appropriate
receipts that will serve as the documentary control of the transaction.

In the case of a sale of Certificated Securities to a purchaser
solicited by an Agent, the Trustee will, by 2:15 p.m., New York City time, on
the Settlement Date, deliver the Certificated Securities to the Selling Agent
for the benefit of the purchaser of such Certificated Securities against
delivery by the Selling Agent of a receipt therefor. On the Settlement Date the
Selling Agent will deliver payment for such Certificated Securities in
immediately available funds to the Company in an amount equal to the issue price
of the Certificated Securities less the Selling Agent's commission; provided
that the Selling Agent reserves the right to withhold payment for which it has
not received funds from the purchaser. The Company shall not use any proceeds
advanced by a Selling Agent to acquire securities.

In the case of a sale of Certificated Securities to a Purchasing
Agent, the Trustee will, by 2:15 p.m., New York City time, on the Settlement
Date, deliver the Certificated Securities to the Purchasing Agent against
delivery of payment for such Certificated Securities in immediately available
funds to the Company in an amount equal to the issue price of the Certificated
Securities less the Purchasing Agent's discount.

II-5
<PAGE>

Failure of Purchaser to Pay Selling Agent:

If a purchaser (other than a Purchasing Agent) fails to make payment
to the Selling Agent for a Certificated Security, the Selling Agent will
promptly notify the Trustee and the Company thereof by telephone (confirmed in
writing) or by facsimile transmission or other acceptable written means. The
Selling Agent will immediately return the Certificated Security to the Trustee.
Immediately upon receipt of such Certificated Security by the Trustee, the
Company will return to the Selling Agent an amount equal to the amount
previously paid to the Company in respect of such Certificated Security. The
Company will reimburse the Selling Agent on an equitable basis for its loss of
the use of funds during the period when they were credited to the account of the
Company.

The Trustee will cancel the Certificated Security in respect of which
the failure occurred, make appropriate entries in its records and, unless
otherwise instructed by the Company, destroy the Certificated Security.

PART II: ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE FOR BOOK-ENTRY SECURITIES
- -----------------------------------------------------------

In connection with the qualification of the Book-Entry Securities for
eligibility in the book-entry system maintained by the Depositary, the Trustee
will perform the custodial, document control and administrative functions
described below, in accordance with its respective obligations under a Letter of
Representation from the Company and the Trustee to the Depositary, dated the
date hereof, and a Medium-Term Note Certificate Agreement between the Trustee
and the Depositary, dated as of April 1993 (the "Certificate Agreement"), and
its obligations as a participant in the Depositary, including the Depositary's
Same-Day Funds Settlement System ("SDFS").

Posting Rates by the Company:

The Company and the Agents will discuss from time to time the rates of
interest per annum to be borne by and the maturity of Book-Entry Securities that
may be sold as a result of the solicitation of offers by an Agent. The Company
may establish a fixed set of interest rates and maturities for an offering
period ("posting"). If the Company decides to change already posted rates it
will promptly advise the Agents to suspend solicitation of offers until the new
posted rates have been established with the Agents.

Acceptance of Offers by the Company:

appropriate means of all reasonable offers to purchase Securities other than
those rejected by such Agent.

E 10:00 a.m. on settlement date

F-G 2:00 p.m. on settlement date

H 4:45 p.m. on settlement date

I 5:00 p.m. on settlement date
</TABLE>

If a sale is to be settled more than one Business Day after the sale
date, Settlement Procedures "B" and "C" shall be completed as soon as
practicable but not later than 2:00 p.m. on the first Business Day after the
sale date. If the Initial Interest Rate for a Floating Rate Book-Entry Security
has not been determined at the time that Settlement Procedure "A" is completed,
Settlement Procedures "B" and "C" shall be completed as soon as such rate has
been determined but no later than 2:00 p.m. on the second Business Day before
the settlement date. Settlement Procedure "H" is subject to extension in
accordance with any extension of Fedwire closing deadlines and in the other
events specified in the SDFS operating procedures in effect on the settlement
date.

If settlement of a Book-Entry Security is rescheduled or cancelled,
the Trustee, upon obtaining knowledge thereof, will deliver to the Depositary,
through the Depositary's Participation Terminal System, a cancellation message
to such effect by no later than 2:00 p.m. on the Business Day immediately
preceding the scheduled settlement date.

Failure to Settle:

If the Trustee fails to enter an SDFS deliver order with respect to a
Book-Entry Security pursuant to Settlement Procedure "F", the Trustee may
deliver to the Depositary through the Depositary's Participant Terminal System
as soon as practicable a withdrawal message instructing the Depositary to debit
such Book-Entry Security to the Trustee's participant account, provided that the
Trustee's participant account contains a principal amount of the Global Security
representing such Book-Entry Security that is at least equal to the principal
amount to be debited. If a withdrawal message is processed with respect to all
the Book-Entry Securities represented by a Global Security, the Trustee will
mark such Global Security "cancelled", make appropriate entries in the Trustee's
records and send such cancelled Global Security to the Company. The CUSIP
number assigned to such Global Security shall, in accordance with CUSIP Service
Bureau procedures, be cancelled and not immediately reassigned. If a withdrawal
message is processed with respect to

II-12
<PAGE>

one or more, but not all, of the Book-Entry Securities represented by a Global
Security, the Trustee will exchange such Global Security for two Global
Securities, one of which shall represent such Book-Entry Security or Securities
and shall be cancelled immediately after issuance and the other of which shall
represent the remaining Book-Entry Securities previously represented by the
surrendered Global Security and shall bear the CUSIP number of the surrendered
Global Security.

If the purchase price for any Book-Entry Security is not timely paid
to the participants with respect to such Book-Entry Security by the beneficial
purchaser thereof (or a person, including an indirect participant in the
Depositary, acting on behalf of such purchaser), such participants and, in turn,
the Agent for such Book-Entry Security may enter deliver orders through the
Depositary's Participant Terminal System debiting such Book-Entry Security to
such participant's account and crediting such Book-Entry Security to such
Agent's account and then debiting such Book-Entry Security to such Agent's
participant account and crediting such Book-Entry Security to the Trustee's
participant account and shall notify the Company and the Trustee thereof.
Thereafter, the Trustee will (i) immediately notify the Company of such order
and the Company shall transfer to such Agent funds available for immediate use
in an amount equal to the price of such Book-Entry Security which was credited
to the account of the Company maintained at the Trustee in accordance with
Settlement Procedure I, and (ii) deliver the withdrawal message and take the
related actions described in the preceding paragraph. If such failure shall
have occurred for any reason other than default by the applicable Agent to
perform its obligations hereunder or under the Distribution Agreement, the
Company will reimburse such Agent on an equitable basis for the loss of its use
of funds during the period when the funds were credited to the account of the
Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon any failure to settle with respect
to a Book-Entry Security, the Depositary may take any actions in accordance with
its SDFS operating procedures then in effect. In the event of a failure to
settle with respect to one or more, but not all, of the Book-Entry Securities to
have been represented by a Global Security, the Trustee will provide, in
accordance with Settlement Procedure "D" for the authentication and issuance of
a Global Security representing the other Book-Entry Securities to have been
represented by such Global Security and will make appropriate entries in its
records. The Company will, from time to time, furnish the Trustee with a
sufficient quantity of Securities.

ANNEX III

ACCOUNTANTS' LETTER

Pursuant to Section 4(j) and Section 6(d), as the case may be, of the
Distribution Agreement, the Company's independent certified public accountants
shall furnish letters to the effect that:

(i) They are independent certified public accountants with
respect to the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the
Act and the applicable published rules and regulations thereunder;

(ii) In their opinion, the financial statements and any
supplementary financial information and schedules examined by them and
included or incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable accounting requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as
applicable, and the related published rules and regulations
thereunder; and, if applicable, they have made a review in accordance
with standards established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants of the consolidated interim financial statements,
selected financial data, pro forma financial information and/or
condensed financial statements derived from audited financial
statements of the Company for the periods specified in such letter, as
indicated in their reports thereon, copies of which have been
furnished to the Agents;

(iii) The unaudited selected financial information with respect
to the consolidated results of operations and financial position of
the Company for the five most recent fiscal years included or
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and included or
incorporated by reference in Item 6 of the Company's Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year agrees with the
corresponding amounts (after restatement where applicable) in the
audited consolidated financial statements for the five such fiscal
years which were included or incorporated by reference in the
Company's Annual Reports on Form 10-K for such fiscal years;

(iv) On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an

III-1
<PAGE>

available interim financial statements of the Company and its
subsidiaries, inspection of the minute books of the Company and its
subsidiaries since the date of the latest audited financial statements
included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, inquiries of
officials of the Company and its subsidiaries responsible for
financial and accounting matters, the performance of procedures
specified by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
for a review of interim financial information as described in SAS No.
71, Interim Financial Information and such other inquiries and
procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their
attention that caused them to believe that:

(A) the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of
income, consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements
of cash flows included or incorporated by reference in the
Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q incorporated by
reference in the Prospectus do not comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of
the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the related
published rules and regulations thereunder or that any material
modifications should be made thereto for such unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles;

(B) any other unaudited income statement data and balance
sheet items included in the Prospectus do not agree with the
corresponding items in the unaudited consolidated financial

Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year;

(C) the unaudited financial statements which were not
included in the Prospectus but from which were derived the
unaudited condensed financial statements referred to in Clause
(A) and any unaudited income statement data and balance sheet
items included in the Prospectus and referred to in Clause (B)
were not determined on a basis substantially consistent with the
basis for the audited financial statements included or

III-2
<PAGE>

incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the most recent fiscal year;

(D) any unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed
financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the
Prospectus do not comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the
published rules and regulations thereunder or the pro forma
adjustments have not been properly applied to the historical
amounts in the compilation of those statements;

(E) as of a specified date not more than five days prior to
the date of such letter, there have been any changes in the
consolidated capital stock (other than issuances of capital stock
upon exercise of options and stock appreciation rights, upon
earn-outs of performance shares and upon conversions of
convertible securities, in each case which were outstanding on
the date of the latest balance sheet included or incorporated by
reference in the Prospectus) or any increase in the consolidated
long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries, or any
decreases in consolidated stockholders' equity or other items
specified by the Agents, or any increases in any items specified
by the Agents, in each case as compared with amounts shown in the
latest balance sheet included or incorporated by reference in the
Prospectus, except in each case for changes, increases or
decreases which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may
occur or which are described in such letter; and

(F) for the period from the date of the latest financial
statements included or incorporated by reference in the
Prospectus to the specified date referred to in Clause (E) there
were any decreases in consolidated net revenues or operating
profit or the total or per share amounts of consolidated net
income or other items specified by the Agents, or any increases
in any items specified by the Agents, in each case as compared
with the comparable period of the preceding year and with any
other period of corresponding length specified by the Agents,
except in each case for increases or decreases which the
Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which are
described in such letter; and

III-3
<PAGE>

(v) In addition to the examination referred to in their report(s)
included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus and the
limited procedures, inspection of minute books, inquiries and other
procedures referred to in paragraphs (iii) and (iv) above, they have
carried out certain specified procedures, not constituting an
examination in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
with respect to certain amounts, percentages and financial information
specified by the Agents which are derived from the general accounting
records of the Company and its subsidiaries, which appear in the
Prospectus (excluding documents incorporated by reference), or in Part
II of, or in exhibits and schedules to, the Registration Statement
specified by the Agents or in documents incorporated by reference in
the Prospectus specified by the Agents, and have compared certain of
such amounts, percentages and financial information with the
accounting records of the Company and its subsidiaries and have found
them to be in agreement.

All references in this Annex III to the Prospectus shall be deemed to
refer to the Prospectus (including the documents incorporated by reference
therein) as defined in the Distribution Agreement as of the Commencement Date
referred to in Section 6(d) thereof and to the Prospectus as amended or

AVERY DENNISON CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), for
value received, hereby promises to pay to Cede & Co., or registered assigns, the
principal sum set forth on the face hereof at the office or agency of the
Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New
York, on the maturity date shown above, or if such date is not a Business Day
(as defined below), the next succeeding Business Day (the "Maturity Date"), in
such coin or currency specified above (a "Specified Currency") as at the time of
payment shall be legal tender for the payment of public and private debts, and
to pay interest on said principal sum at said offices or agencies, at the rate
per annum (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months)
shown above, in like Specified Currency, semi-annually on each Interest Payment
Date set forth above from and after the date of this Note and on the Maturity
Date or date of redemption or repayment, if any, until payment of said principal
sum has been made or duly provided, provided, however, that the Company will
-------- ------- 
make such payments in respect of non-U.S. dollar denominated Notes in the
Specified Currency indicated above in amounts determined as set forth on the
reverse hereof; provided, however, that payments of principal (and premium, if
-------- ------- 
any) and interest on Notes denominated in other than U.S. dollars will
nevertheless be made in U.S. dollars (i) at the election of the holder as
provided herein and (ii) at the election of the Company in the case of the
imposition of exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the
Company as provided herein. Unless this Note is a Note which has been issued
upon transfer of, in exchange for, or in replacement of a predecessor Note,
interest on this Note shall accrue from the Interest Payment Date next preceding
the date of this Note to which interest has been paid, unless the date hereof is
an Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid, in which case from the
date of this Note, or unless no interest has been paid on this Note, in which
case from the Original Issue Date indicated above. If this Note has been issued
upon transfer of, in exchange for, or in replacement of a predecessor Note,
interest on this Note shall accrue from the last Interest Payment Date to which
interest was paid on such predecessor Note or, if no interest was paid on such
predecessor Note, from the Original Issue Date indicated above. Each payment of
interest in respect of an Interest Payment Date will include interest accrued to
but excluding such Interest Payment Date. The first payment of interest on a
Note originally issued and dated between a Regular Record Date (as defined
below) and an Interest Payment Date will be due and payable on the Interest
Payment Date following the next succeeding Regular Record Date to the registered
owner on such next succeeding Regular Record Date. Subject to certain
exceptions provided in the Indenture referred to on the reverse hereof, the
interest so payable on any Interest Payment Date will be paid to the person in
whose name this Note is registered at the close of business on the July 1 or
January 1 immediately preceding such Interest Payment Date or on such other
Regular Record Date indicated on the face hereof prior to such Interest Payment
Date, whether or not a Business Day (each such date a "Regular Record Date"),
and interest payable on the Maturity Date or upon redemption or repayment will
be paid to the person to whom said principal sum is payable.

Payment of interest on this Note due on any Interest Payment Date (other
than interest on this Note due to the holder hereof on the Maturity Date or a
redemption or repayment date, if any) to be made in U.S. dollars will be paid by
check mailed by first class mail to the person entitled thereto at his last
address as it appears on the Security Register or by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a designated account maintained in the United
States upon receipt by the Trustee of written instructions not later than the
Regular Record Date for the related Interest Payment Date by the registered
holder of this Note. Such instructions shall remain in effect with respect to
payments of interest made on subsequent Interest Payment Dates unless revoked or
changed by written instructions received by the Trustee from such holder,

provided that any such written revocation or change which is received by the
- -------- 
Trustee after a Regular Record Date and before the related Interest Payment Date
shall not be effective with respect to the interest payable on such Interest
Payment Date. Payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if
any, on this Note due to the holder hereof on the Maturity Date or upon earlier
redemption or repayment to be made in U.S. dollars will be paid, in immediately
available funds, upon surrender of this Note at the office or agency of the
Company maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New
York; provided that this Note is surrendered to the paying agent appointed under
-------- 
the Indenture (the "Paying Agent") in time for the Paying Agent to make such
payment in accordance with its normal procedures.

Payments of interest to be made in a Specified Currency other than U.S.
dollars (other than interest on this Note due to the holder hereof on the
Maturity Date or date of redemption or repayment, if any) will be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to a designated account maintained with
a bank in the country issuing the Specified Currency, or if this Note is
denominated in European Currency Units ("ECUs"), to an ECU account, or other
jurisdiction acceptable to the Company and the Trustee as shall have been
designated at least five Business Days prior to the Interest Payment Date by the
registered holder of this Note on the relevant Regular Record Date. Payment in
a Specified Currency, other than U.S. dollars of the principal of, and premium,
if any, and interest on this Note due to the holder hereof on the Maturity Date
or upon any earlier redemption or repayment will be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a designated account maintained with a bank in
the country issuing the Specified Currency, or if this Note is denominated in
ECUs, to an ECU account, or other jurisdiction acceptable to the Company and the
Trustee as shall have been designated at least five Business Days prior to the
Maturity Date or the redemption or repayment date, as the case may be, by the
registered holder of this Note on the Maturity Date or the redemption or
repayment date, as the case may be, provided that this Note is presented for
surrender to the Paying Agent in time for the Paying Agent to make such payment
in such funds in accordance with its normal procedures. Such designation for
wire transfer purposes shall be made by filing the appropriate information with
the Trustee at its corporate trust office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan,
The City of New York and, unless revoked by written notice to the Trustee
received by the Trustee on or prior to the date five Business Days prior to the
applicable Interest Payment Date, Maturity Date or date of redemption or
repayment, as the case may be, any such designation shall remain in effect with
respect to any further payments with respect to this Note payable to such
holder. If a payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest to be made in
a Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars cannot be made by wire transfer
because the required designation has not been received by the Trustee on or
before the requisite date or for any other reason, a notice will be mailed to
the holder at its registered address requesting a designation pursuant to which
such wire transfer can be made and, upon the Trustee's receipt of such a
designation, such payment will be made within five Business Days of such
receipt. The Company will pay any administrative costs imposed by banks in
connection with making payments by wire transfer, but any tax, 

2
<PAGE>

assessment or governmental charge imposed upon payments will be borne by the
holder or holders of this Note in respect of which payments are made.

The holder of any Note denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S.

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES, SERIES B
(FIXED RATE NOTE)
DUE FROM NINE MONTHS TO 30 YEARS FROM DATE OF ISSUE

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of unsecured debentures, notes
or other evidences of indebtedness of the Company (hereinafter called the
"Securities"), all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to an Indenture
dated as of March 15, 1991, duly executed and delivered by the Company to
Security Pacific National Bank, as trustee, as amended by a First Supplemental
Indenture, dated as of March 16, 1993, duly executed and delivered by the
Company to BankAmerica National Trust Company, as successor trustee (such
Indenture as amended by such First Supplemental Indenture being hereinafter
called the "Indenture" and such successor trustee being hereinafter called the
"Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to
which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made
for a description of the rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee
and the rights thereunder of the holders of the Securities. As provided in the
Indenture, the Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different
series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at
different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject
to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking
or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and events of
default, and may otherwise vary as provided or permitted in the Indenture. This
Note is one of a series of the Securities designated as the Medium-Term Notes,
Series B (the "Notes") of the Company. The Notes may mature at different times,
bear interest at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at
all, be repayable at the option of the holder at different times or not at all,
be denominated in different currencies and otherwise vary as provided or
permitted in the Indenture. Terms used herein which are defined in the Indenture
shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Indenture.

If this Note is denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S.
dollars, any U.S. dollar amount to be received by a holder of this Note who
elects to receive payments in U.S. dollars will be based on the highest bid
quotation (rounded to the nearest cent, with one-half cent rounded up) in The
City of New York received by the Exchange Rate Agent (as specified on the face
hereof) as of 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the second Business Day next
preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange
dealers (one of which may be the Exchange Rate Agent) for the purchase by the
quoting dealer of the Specified Currency for U.S. dollars for settlement on such
payment date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all
holders of Notes electing to receive U.S. dollar payments on such payment date
and at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract. If three such
bid quotations are not available on the second Business Day preceding the date
of a payment, such payment will be made in the Specified Currency. All currency
exchange costs associated with any payments in U.S. dollars will be borne by the
holder hereof by deductions from such payments.

If the principal, premium, if any, or interest on this Note is payable in a
Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars and, due to the imposition of
exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the
Specified Currency is not available at the time of any scheduled payment of
principal, premium, if any, or interest to be made in the Specified Currency,
then the Company shall be entitled to satisfy its obligations hereunder by
making such payment in U.S. dollars. Any such payment shall be made on the
basis of the most recently available noon buying rate for cable transfers in The
City of New York for such Specified Currency. Any payment under such
circumstances in U.S. dollars where required payment is in a Specified Currency
will not constitute a default under the Indenture.

In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to
the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be
declared, and upon such declaration shall become, immediately due and payable in
the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the
Indenture.

The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee,
with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Securities of each series issued under the Indenture
which are affected thereby, at the time outstanding, as provided in the
Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or
changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or
any indenture supplemental thereto or modifying in any manner the rights of the
holders of the Securities of such series provided, however, that no such
-------- ------- 
supplemental indenture shall, among other things, (i) change the fixed maturity
of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or
reduce the amount of, or postpone the date fixed for, the payment of any sinking
fund or analogous obligation, or change the currency in which any Security or
any premium or the interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute
suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after the Maturity Date
without the consent of the holder of each such Security so affected, or (ii)
reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities of any series, the consent of the
holders of which is required for any such supplemental indenture or the consent
of whose holders is required for any waiver provided for in the Indenture,
without the consent of the holders of all Securities affected then outstanding.
The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series then
outstanding to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the
Indenture with respect to such series and certain past defaults under the
Indenture with respect to such series and their consequences, except in each
case a failure to pay principal or premium, if any, or interest on such
Securities of such series. Any such consent or waiver by the holder of this
Note (unless revoked as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and

<PAGE>

binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of this Note and
any Notes which may be issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in
exchange or substitution therefor, irrespective of whether or not any notation
thereof is made upon this Note or other such Notes.

If so provided on the face of this Note, this Note may be redeemed by the
Company on any Business Day on or after the "Date on or After Which the Note is
Redeemable at the Option of the Company" as specified on the face hereof. On
and after such date, if any, this Note may be redeemed in whole or in part, at
the option of the Company, in increments of $1,000 or, in the case of non-U.S.
dollar denominated Notes, in an amount equal to the integral multiples referred
to on the face hereof under "Authorized Denominations" (or, if no such reference
is made, an amount equal to the minimum Authorized Denomination) provided that
the remaining principal amount of any Note partially redeemed shall be at least
$100,000 or, in the case of non-U.S. dollar denominated Notes, the minimum
Authorized Denomination referred to on the face hereof. The redemption price
shall equal the product of the principal amount of this Note to be redeemed
multiplied by the Redemption Percentage, plus accrued interest, if any, to the
date of redemption. The Redemption Percentage shall initially equal the Initial
Redemption Percentage specified on the face of this Note, and shall decline at
each anniversary of the "Date on or After Which this Note is Redeemable at the
Option of Company by the amount of the Annual Redemption Percentage Reduction
specified on the face of this Note, until the Redemption Percentage is equal to
100%.

If so provided on the face of this Note, this Note will be repayable at the
option of the holder in whole or in part in increments of $1,000 or, in the case
of non-U.S. dollar denominated Notes, in an amount equal to the integral
multiples referred to on the face hereof under "Authorized Denominations" (or,
if no such reference is made, an amount equal to the minimum Authorized
Denomination) provided that the remaining principal amount of any Note
surrendered for partial repayment shall be at least $100,000 or, in the case of
non-U.S. dollar denominated Notes, the minimum Authorized Denomination referred
to on the face hereof, on any Business Day on or after the "Date on or After
Which this Note is Repayable at the Option of the Holder" (as stated on the face
hereof). The repurchase price shall equal the product of the principal amount of
this Note to be repurchased multiplied by the Repayment Percentage, plus accrued
interest, if any, to the repayment date. The Repayment Percentage shall
initially equal the Initial Repayment Percentage specified on the face of this
Note, and shall decline at each anniversary of the "Date on or After Which this
Note is Repayable at the Option of the Holder" by the amount of the Annual
Repayment Percentage Reduction specified on the face of this Note, until the
Repayment Percentage is equal to 100%. In order for the holder to exercise its
option to cause the Company to repurchase all or any portion of this Note, the
Company must receive at the applicable address of the Trustee set forth below or
at such other place or places of which the Company shall from time to time
notify the holder of this Note, on or before the fifteenth, but not earlier than

succeeding Business Day, prior to the repayment date, either (i) this Note, with
the form below entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" duly completed, or (ii) a
telegram, telex, facsimile transmission, or letter from a member of a national
securities exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a
commercial bank or a trust company in the United States of America setting forth

principal amount of this Note and the amount of this Note to be repaid, (c) a
statement that the option to elect repayment is being exercised thereby, and (d)
a guarantee stating that the Company will receive this Note, with the form below
entitled "Option to Elect Repayment" duly completed, not later than five
Business Days after the date of such telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or
letter (and this Note and form duly completed are received by the Company by
such fifth Business Day). Any such election shall be irrevocable. The address to
which such deliveries are to be made is BankAmerica National Trust Company,
Attention: Domestic Corporate Trust Administration, One World Trade Center, New
York, New York 10048 (or, at such other places as the Company shall notify the
holders of the Notes). All questions as to the validity, eligibility (including
time of receipt) and acceptance of any Note for repayment will be determined by
the Company, whose determination will be final and binding.

The Notes are issuable in global or definitive form without coupons in
Authorized Denominations of $100,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess
thereof or, if the Specified Currency is other than U.S. dollars, in the
denominations indicated on the face hereof. Upon due presentment for
registration of transfer of this Note at the office or agency of the Company
maintained for that purpose in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, a
new Note or Notes in authorized denominations in the Specified Currency for an
equal aggregate principal amount and like interest rate and maturity will be
issued to the transferee in exchange therefor, subject to the limitations
provided in the Indenture and to the limitations described below if applicable,
without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in
connection therewith.

This Note is exchangeable only if (i) the Depositary notifies the Company
that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this Global Note or
if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a successor Depositary is
not appointed within the time specified in the Indenture, or (ii) the Company in
its sole discretion determines that all Global Notes of the same series as this
Note shall be exchangeable for definitive Notes of differing denominations
aggregating a like amount in registered form. If this Note is exchangeable
pursuant to the preceding sentence, it shall be exchangeable for definitive
Notes of differing denominations aggregating a like amount in registered form in
denominations of $100,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof,
bearing interest at the same rate or pursuant to the same formula, having the
same date of issuance, redemption provisions, if any, Specified Currency,
Maturity Date and other terms.

The Depositary will not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise convey any
beneficial interest in this Note unless such beneficial interest is in an amount
equal to $100,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof or, if
this Note is denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars, an Authorized
Denomination indicated on the face hereof. The Depositary, by accepting this
Note, agrees to be bound by such provision.

prescribed.

The Company, the Trustee and their respective agents may deem and treat the
registered holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Note at such holder's

Trustee and their respective agents shall treat a person as the holder of such
principal amount of Notes as shall be represented by a Global Note as shall be
specified in a written statement of the Depositary for purposes of obtaining any
consents or directions required to be given by holders of Securities pursuant to
the Indenture.

in the Indenture or in any indenture supplemental thereto or any Note, or
because of any indebtedness evidenced thereby, shall be had against any
incorporator, or against any past, present or future stockholder, officer or
director, as such, of the Company or of any successor corporation, either
directly or through the Company or any successor corporation, under any rule of
law, statute or constitutional provision or by the enforcement of any assessment
or by any legal or equitable proceeding or otherwise, all such personal
liability of every such incorporator, stockholder, officer and director, as
such, being expressly waived and released by the acceptance hereof and as a
condition of and as part of the consideration for the issuance of this Note.

This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of California.

"Determination of Interest Rate Per Annum for LIBOR Notes," "Determination of

-------- ------- 
Date specified above would otherwise fall on a day that is not a Business Day,
such Interest Payment Date will be the next succeeding day that is a Business

month, such Interest Payment Date will be the next preceding day that is a
Business Day; provided, further, that the Company will make such payments in
-------- ------- 
respect of non-U.S. dollar denominated Notes in the Specified Currency indicated

-------- 
however, that payments of principal (and premium, if any) and interest on Notes
- ------- 
denominated in other than U.S. dollars will nevertheless be made in U.S. dollars

determined by the ECU Banking Association in Paris); or (b) if the Interest Rate
Basis of this Note is LIBOR, any day on which dealings in deposits in U.S.

redemption or repayment date, if any) to be made in U.S. dollars will be made by
check mailed by first class mail to the person entitled thereto at the holder's
last address as it appears in the Security Register or by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a designated account maintained in the United
States upon receipt by the Trustee of written instructions not later than the
Regular Record Date for the related Interest Payment Date by the registered
holder of this Note. Such instructions shall remain in effect with respect to
payments of interest made on subsequent Interest Payment Dates unless revoked or
changed by written instructions received by the Trustee from such holder,

provided that any such written revocation or change which is received by the
- -------- 
Trustee after a Regular Record Date and before the related Interest Payment Date
shall not be effective with respect to the interest payable on such Interest
Payment Date. Payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest, if
any, on this Note due to the holder hereof on the Maturity Date or upon earlier

a bank in the country issuing the Specified Currency, or if this Note is
denominated in ECUs, to an ECU account, or other jurisdiction acceptable to the

but written notice of any such revocation must be received by the Trustee on or
prior to the Regular Record Date for the applicable Interest Payment Date or the

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES, SERIES B
(FLOATING RATE NOTE)
DUE FROM NINE MONTHS TO 30 YEARS FROM DATE OF ISSUE

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of unsecured debentures, notes
or other evidences of indebtedness of the Company (hereinafter called the
"Securities"), all issued or to be issued under and pursuant to an Indenture
dated as of March 15, 1991, duly executed and delivered by the Company to
Security Pacific National Bank, as trustee, as amended by a First Supplemental
Indenture, dated as of March 16, 1993, duly executed and delivered by the
Company to BankAmerica National Trust Company, as successor trustee (such
Indenture as amended by such First Supplemental Indenture being hereinafter
called the "Indenture" and such successor trustee being hereinafter called the
"Trustee," which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to
which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made
for a description of the rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee
and the rights thereunder of the holders of the Securities. As provided in the
Indenture, the Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different
series may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at
different times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject
to different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking
or analogous funds, if any, may be subject to different covenants and events of
default, and may otherwise vary as provided or permitted in the Indenture. This
Note is one of a series of the Securities, designated as the Medium-Term Notes,
Series B (the "Notes") of the Company. The Notes may mature at different times,
bear interest at different rates, be redeemable at different times or not at
all, be repayable at the option of the holder at different times or not at all,
be denominated in different currencies and otherwise vary as provided or
permitted by the Indenture. Terms used herein which are defined in the
Indenture shall have the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Indenture.

The interest rate in effect from the date of issue to the first Interest
Reset Date specified on the face hereof shall be the Initial Interest Rate
specified on the face hereof. Commencing with the first Interest Reset Date
specified on the face hereof following the Original Issue Date specified on the
face hereof, the rate at which interest on this Note is payable shall be
adjusted daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually or
otherwise as specified on the face hereof under "Interest Rate Reset Period";

provided, however, that the interest rate in effect hereon for the ten calendar
- -------- ------- 
days immediately prior to the Maturity Date hereof will be that in effect on the
tenth day next preceding such Maturity Date specified on the face hereof. Each
such adjusted rate shall be applicable from and including the Interest Reset
Date to which it relates to but not including the next succeeding Interest Reset
Date or until the Maturity Date, as the case may be.

Determination of Interest Rate Per Annum for Prime Rate Notes. If the
------------------------------------------------------------- 
Interest Rate Basis specified on the face hereof is Prime Rate, the interest
rate per annum determined with respect to any Interest Determination Date
specified on the face hereof shall equal the rate, adjusted by the addition or
subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified on the face hereof, or by
multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof,
and calculated to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with
five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward, set forth for the
relevant Interest Determination Date in "Statistical Release H.15(519), Selected
Interest Rates," published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System or any successor publication of the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System ("Release H.15(519)") under the heading "Bank Prime Loan." In
the event that such rate is not published prior to 9:00 A.M., New York City
time, on the relevant Interest Calculation Date, then the interest rate per
annum with respect to such Interest Determination Date will be determined by the
Calculation Agent and will be the arithmetic mean of the rates of interest
publicly announced by each bank that appears on the display designated as page
"NYMF" on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or such other page as may
replace the NYMF page on that service for the purpose of displaying prime rates
or base lending rates of major United States banks) ("Reuters Screen NYMF Page")
as such bank's prime rate or base lending rate as in effect for such Interest
Determination Date, adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if
any, specified on the face hereof, or by multiplication by the Spread
Multiplier, if any, set forth on the face hereof, and calculated to the nearest
one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a
percentage point rounded upward. If fewer than four such rates but more than
one such rate appear on the Reuters Screen NYMF Page for the Interest
Determination Date, the Prime Rate will be determined by the Calculation Agent
and will be the arithmetic mean of the prime rates quoted on the basis of the
actual number of days in the year divided by a 360-day year as of the close of
business on such Interest Determination Date by four major money center banks in
The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent. If fewer than two such
rates appear on the Reuters Screen NYMF Page, the Prime Rate will be determined
by the Calculation Agent on the basis of the rates furnished in The City of New
York by the appropriate number of substitute banks or trust companies organized
and doing business under the laws of the United States or any State thereof,
having total equity capital of at least U.S. $500,000,000 and being subject to
the supervision or examination by Federal or State authority, selected by the
Calculation Agent to provide such rate or rates; provided, however, that if the
banks selected as aforesaid are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, the
Prime Rate will be the Prime Rate in effect on such Interest Determination Date.

Determination of Interest Rate Per Annum for LIBOR Notes. If the Interest
-------------------------------------------------------- 
Rate Basis specified on the face hereof is LIBOR, the interest rate per annum
determined with respect to any Interest Determination Date specified on the face
hereof shall be determined by the Calculation Agent and shall equal either (a)
the arithmetic mean of the offered rates for deposits in

5
<PAGE>

U.S. dollars having the specified Index Maturity, commencing on the second
Market Day immediately following such Interest Determination Date, that appears
on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page (as defined herein) as of 11:00 A.M., London
time, on such Interest Determination Date, adjusted by the addition or
subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified on the face hereof, or by
multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof
if at least two such offered rates appear on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page 
("LIBOR Reuters"), or (b) the rate for deposits in U.S. dollars having the 
specified Index Maturity, commencing on the second Market Day immediately
following such Interest Determination Date, that appears on the Telerate Page
3750 as of 11:00 A.M., London time, on such Interest Determination Date,
adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified on the
face hereof, or by multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on
the face hereof ("LIBOR Telerate"). "Reuters Screen LIBO Page" means the display
designated as page "LIBO" on the Reuters Monitor Money Rates Service (or such
other page as may replace page LIBO on that service for the purpose of
displaying London interbank offered rates of major banks). "Telerate Page 3750"
means the display designated as "3750" on the Telerate Service (or such other
page as may replace the 3750 page on that service or such other service or
services as may be nominated by the British Bankers' Association for the purpose
of displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits). If
neither LIBOR Reuters nor LIBOR Telerate is specified on the face hereof, LIBOR
will be determined as if LIBOR Telerate had been specified. If at least two such
offered rates appear on the Telerate Page 3750, the rate in respect of such
Interest Determination Date will be the arithmetic mean of such offered rates as
determined by the Calculation Agent. If fewer than two offered rates appear on
the Reuters Screen LIBO Page, or if no rate appears on the Telerate Page 3750,
as applicable, LIBOR in respect of such Interest Determination Date will be
determined as if the parties had specified the rate described in the following
paragraph.

On any Interest Determination Date on which fewer than two offered rates
appear on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page as specified in (a) above or on which no
rate appears on the Telerate Page 3750, as specified in (b) above, as
applicable, LIBOR will be determined on the basis of the rates at which deposits
in U.S. dollars are offered by four major banks in the London interbank market
selected by the Calculation Agent (the "Reference Banks") at approximately 11:00
A.M., London time, on such Interest Determination Date to prime banks in the
London interbank market, having the specified Index Maturity, commencing on the
second Market Day immediately following such Interest Determination Date and in
a principal amount equal to an amount of not less that U.S. $1,000,000 that is
representative for a single transaction in such market at such time. The
Calculation Agent will request the principal London office of each of such
Reference Banks to provide a quotation of its rate. If at least two such
quotations are provided, LIBOR in respect of such Interest Determination Date
will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations, adjusted by the addition or
subtraction of the Spread, if any, or the multiplication by the Spread
Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof. If fewer than two quotations
are provided, LIBOR in respect of such Interest Determination Date will be the
arithmetic mean of the rates quoted by three major banks in The City of New York
selected by the Calculation Agent at approximately 11:00 A.M., New York City
time, on such Interest Determination Date for loans in U.S. dollars to leading
European banks, having the specified Index Maturity, such loans commencing on
the second Market Day immediately following such Interest Determination Date and
in a principal amount equal to an amount of not less than U.S. $1,000,00 that is
representative for a single transaction in such market at such time, adjusted by
the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, or the multiplication by the
Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof; provided, however, that
-------- ------- 
if the banks in The City of New York selected as aforesaid by the Calculation
Agent are not quoting as mentioned in this sentence, LIBOR with respect to such
Interest Determination Date will be LIBOR in effect on such Interest
Determination Date.

Determination of Interest Rate Per Annum for Treasury Rate Notes. If the
---------------------------------------------------------------- 
Interest Rate Basis specified on the face hereof is Treasury Rate, the interest
rate per annum determined with respect to any Interest Determination Date
specified on the face hereof shall equal the rate for the most recent auction of
direct obligations of the United States ("Treasury bills") having the Index
Maturity specified on the face hereof as published in Release H.15(519) under
the heading "U.S. Government Securities-Treasury Bills-auction average
(investment)" or, if not so published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the
Interest Calculation Date (as specified on the face hereof) pertaining to such
Interest Determination Date, the average rate for the aforementioned auction
(expressed as a bond equivalent, on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as
applicable, and applied on a daily basis) as otherwise announced by the United
States Department of the Treasury, in either case, adjusted by the addition or
subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified on the face hereof, or by
multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof.
In the event that the results of such auction of Treasury bills having the
specified Index Maturity are not otherwise reported as provided above by 3:00
P.M., New York City time, on such Interest Calculation Date, or if no such
auction is held in a particular week, then the interest rate per annum with
respect to such Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the
Calculation Agent and shall be the yield to maturity (expressed as a bond
equivalent, on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as applicable, and
applied on a daily basis) of the arithmetic mean of the secondary market bid
rates, as of approximately 3:30 P.M., New York City time, on such Interest
Determination Date, of three primary United States securities dealers selected
by the Calculation Agent for the issue of Treasury bills with a remaining
maturity closest to the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, adjusted by
the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified on the face hereof,
or by multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face
hereof; provided, however, that if the dealers selected as aforesaid by the
-------- ------- 
Calculation Agent are not quoting as described in this sentence, the interest
rate per annum hereon with respect to such Interest Determination Date shall be
the interest rate per annum in effect hereon on such Interest Determination
Date.

Determination of Interest Rate Per Annum for Commercial Paper Rate Notes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
If the Interest Rate Basis specified on the face hereof is Commercial Paper
Rate, the interest rate per annum determined with respect to any Interest Reset
Date specified on the face hereof shall equal (a) the Money Market Yield (as
defined herein) of the rate for the relevant Interest Determination Date for
commercial paper having the Index Maturity specified on the face hereof, (i) as
such rate is published in Release H.15(519), under the heading "Commercial
Paper," or (ii) if such rate is not published by 3:00 P.M., New York City time,
on the relevant Interest Calculation Date, the Money Market Yield on such
Interest Determination Date of such rate for commercial paper having the
specified Index Maturity as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in
its daily statistical release, "Composite 3:30 P.M. Quotations for U.S.
Government Securities" ("Composite Quotations"), under the heading "Commercial
Paper," or (b) if by 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on such Interest Calculation
Date, such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or Composite Quotations,
the Money Market Yield of the arithmetic mean (calculated to the nearest one
hundred-thousandth of a

6
<PAGE>

percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward)
of the offered rates as of 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on such Interest
Determination Date, of three leading dealers of commercial paper in The City of
New York selected by the Calculation Agent for commercial paper having the Index
Maturity specified on the face hereof placed for an industrial issuer whose bond
rating is "AA," or the equivalent, from a nationally recognized rating agency,
in each of the above cases (a) and (b) adjusted by the addition or subtraction
of the Spread, if any, specified on the face hereof, or by multiplication by the
Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof; provided, however, that
-------- ------- 
if such rate is not published in either H.15(519) or Composite Quotations by
3:00 p.m., New York City time, on such Interest Calculation Date and fewer than
three dealers selected as aforesaid by the Calculation Agent are quoting as
described in (b) above, the interest rate per annum hereon with respect to such
Interest Reset Date shall be the interest rate per annum in effect hereon on
such Interest Determination Date.

"Money Market Yield" shall be a yield (expressed as a percentage)
calculated in accordance with the following formula:

360 x D
Money Market Yield = 100 x ____________________
360-(D x M)

where "D" refers to the per annum rate for commercial paper, quoted on a bank
discount basis and expressed as a decimal calculated to the nearest one hundred-
thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point
rounded upward; and "M" refers to the actual number of days in the period for
which interest is being calculated.

Determination of Interest Rate Per Annum for CD Rate Notes. If the
---------------------------------------------------------- 
Interest Rate Basis specified on the face hereof is CD Rate, the Interest Rate
per annum determined with respect to any Interest Determination Date specified
on the face hereof shall equal the rate, adjusted by the addition or subtraction
of the Spread, if any, specified on the face hereof, or by multiplication by the
Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof and calculated to the
nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths
of a percentage point rounded upward, on such date for negotiable certificates

in Release H.15(519) under the heading "CDs (Secondary Market)." In the event

relevant Interest Calculation Date, then the interest rate per annum shall be
the rate on such Interest Determination Date for negotiable certificates of
deposit having the specified Index Maturity as published in Composite Quotations
under the heading "Certificates of Deposit," adjusted by the addition or
subtraction of the Spread, if any, specified on the face hereof, or by
multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof

five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward. If by 3:00 P.M., New
York City time, on such Interest Calculation Date such rate is not published in
either Release H.15(519) or Composite Quotations, the interest rate per annum
shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent and shall be the arithmetic mean of
the secondary market offered rates, as of 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on
such Interest Determination Date, of three leading non-bank dealers of
negotiable U.S. dollar certificates of deposit in The City of New York selected
by the Calculation Agent (after consultation with the Company) for negotiable
certificates of deposit of major United States money market banks of the highest
credit standing (in the market for negotiable certificates of deposit) with a
remaining maturity closest to the specified Index Maturity in a denomination of
U.S. $5,000,000, adjusted by the addition or subtraction of the Spread, if any,
specified on the face hereof, or by multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if
any, specified on the face hereof and calculated to the nearest one hundred-
thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point
rounded upward; provided, however, that, if the dealers selected as aforesaid by

the interest rate per annum in effect on such Interest Determination Date.

Determination of Interest Rate Per Annum for Federal Funds Rate Notes. If
--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
the Interest Rate Basis specified on the face hereof is Federal Funds Rate, the
interest rate per annum determined with respect to any Interest Determination
Date shall be the rate on such date for Federal Funds as published in Release
H.15(519) under the heading "Federal Funds (Effective)," adjusted by the

with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward. In the event that

relevant Interest Calculation Date, then the per annum interest rate shall be
the rate on such Interest Determination Date as published in Composite
Quotations under the heading "Federal Funds/Effective Rate," adjusted by the

by multiplication by the Spread Multiplier, if any, specified on the face hereof

five one-millionths of a point rounded upward. If by 9:00 A.M., New York City
time, on such Interest Calculation Date such rate is not published in either
Release H.15(519) or Composite Quotations, then the per annum interest rate for
such Interest Determination Date shall be calculated by the Calculation Agent
and shall be the arithmetic mean of the rates, as of 9:00 A.M., New York City
time, on such Interest Determination Date, for the last transaction in overnight
Federal Funds arranged by three leading brokers of Federal Funds transactions in
The City of New York selected by the Calculation Agent, adjusted by the addition

<PAGE>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the interest rate per annum hereon shall not
be greater than the Maximum Interest Rate, if any, or less than the Minimum
Interest Rate, if any, specified on the face hereof. The Calculation Agent
shall calculate the interest rate hereon in accordance with the foregoing on or
before each Interest Calculation Date.

At the request of the holder hereof, the Calculation Agent will provide to
the holder hereof the interest rate hereon then in effect and, if different, the
interest rate which will become effective on the next Interest Reset Date as a
result of a determination made on the most recent Interest Determination Date
with respect to this Note. The Calculation Agent's determination of the
interest rate hereon will be final and binding in the absence of manifest error.

Interest payments hereon will include interest accrued to but excluding the
applicable Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that if the rate at which
-------- ------- 
interest on this Note is payable shall be adjusted daily or weekly as specified
on the face hereof under "Interest Rate Reset Period" and as determined in
accordance with the provisions hereof, interest payable on any Interest Payment
Date, other than interest payable on any date on which principal hereof is
payable, will include interest accrued through but excluding the day following
the next preceding Regular Record Date. Accrued interest hereon from the
Original Issue Date or from the last date to which interest hereon has been
paid, as the case may be, shall be an amount calculated by multiplying the face
amount hereof by an accrued interest factor. Such accrued interest factor shall
be computed by adding the interest factor calculated for each day from the
Original Issue Date or from the last date to which interest shall have been
paid, as the case may be, to but excluding the date for which accrued interest
is being calculated. The interest factor (expressed as a decimal and calculated
to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with five one-
millionths of a percentage point rounded upward) for each such day shall be
computed by dividing the interest rate per annum (expressed as a decimal and
calculated to the next highest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point)
applicable to such date by 360 if the Interest Rate Basis specified on the face
hereof is Prime Rate, LIBOR, Commercial Paper Rate, CD Rate or Federal Funds
Rate, or by the actual number of days in the year if the Interest Rate Basis
specified on the face hereof is Treasury Rate.

If this Note is denominated in a Specified Currency other than U.S.
dollars, any U.S. dollar amount to be received by a holder of this Note who
elects to receive payment in U.S. dollars will be based on the highest bid
quotation (rounded up to the nearest cent, with one-half cent rounded up) in The
City of New York received by the Exchange Rate Agent (specified on the face
hereof) as of 11:00 A.M., New York City time, on the second Business Day next
preceding the applicable payment date from three recognized foreign exchange
dealers (one of which may be the Exchange Rate Agent) for the purchase by the
quoting dealer of the Specified Currency for U.S. dollars for settlement on such
payment date in the aggregate amount of the Specified Currency payable to all
holders of Notes electing to receive U.S. dollar payments on such payment date
and at which the applicable dealer commits to execute a contract. If three such
bid quotations are not available on the second Business Day preceding the date
of a payment, such payment will be made in the Specified Currency. All currency
exchange costs associated with any payments in U.S. dollars will be borne by the
holder hereof by deductions from such payments.

If the principal, premium (if any) or interest on this Note is payable in a
Specified Currency other than U.S. dollars and, due to the imposition of
exchange controls or other circumstances beyond the control of the Company, the
Specified Currency is not available at the time of any scheduled payment of
principal, premium, if any, or interest to be made in the Specified Currency,
then the Company shall be entitled to satisfy its obligations hereunder by
making such payment in U.S. dollars. Any such payment shall be made on the
basis of the most recently available noon buying rate for cable transfers in The
City of New York for such Specified Currency. Any payment under such
circumstances in U.S. dollars where required payment is in a Specified Currency
will not constitute a default under the Indenture.

In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, with respect to
the Notes shall have occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be
declared, and upon such declaration shall become, immediately due and payable in
the manner, with the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the
Indenture.

The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee,
with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Securities of each series issued under the Indenture
which are affected thereby, at the time outstanding, as provided in the
Indenture, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to or
changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or
of any indenture supplemental thereto or modifying in any manner the rights of
the holders of the Securities of such series; provided, however, that no such
-------- ------- 
supplemental indenture shall, among other things, (i) change the fixed maturity
of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or
reduce the amount of, or postpone the date fixed for, the payment of any sinking
fund or analogous obligation, or change the currency in which any Security or
any premium or the interest thereon is payable, or impair the right to institute
suit for the enforce-ment of any such payment on or after the Maturity Date
without the consent of the holder of each such Security so affected, or (ii)
reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities of any series, the consent of the

[LETTERHEAD OF LATHAM WATKINS]

March 29, 1994

Avery Dennison Corporation
150 North Orange Grove Boulevard
Pasadena, California 91103

Re: $100,000,000 Aggregate Principal
Amount of Debt Securities of
Avery Dennison Corporation
--------------------------------

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We have acted as your counsel in connection with the issuance and sale
from time to time of Medium Term Notes, Series B, due from nine months to 30
years from the date of issue (the "Securities") pursuant to that certain
Indenture, dated as of March 15, 1991, between Avery Dennison Corporation (the
"Company") and Security Pacific National Bank, as Trustee, as amended by that
certain First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March 16, 1993, between the
Company and BankAmerica National Trust Company, as successor trustee (the
"Trustee") (collectively, the "Indenture"). The Securities are registered on
the Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No. 33-52737; the "Registration
Statement"), filed by the Company on March 18, 1994 under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Act"). We are familiar with the proceedings taken, and
are familiar with the additional proceedings proposed to be taken, by you in
connection with the authorization, issuance and sale of the Securities. We have
examined the Registration Statement and the Indenture under which the Securities
are to be issued.

Avery Dennison Corporation
March 29, 1994
Page 2

Based on the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, and subject to the
assumptions, qualifications and limitations set forth herein, it is our opinion
that the Securities have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action
on the part of the Company and when the final terms of a particular Security and
of its issuance and sale have been duly established in conformity with the
Indenture, and when such Security has been duly executed, authenticated, issued
and delivered by the Company, and paid for as contemplated by the Distribution
Agreement, dated as of March 29, 1994, among the Company, Goldman, Sachs & Co.
and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., and by any applicable Terms Agreement, such
Security will be a valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the Company
entitled to the benefits provided by the Indenture.

Our opinion is subject to the following limitations, qualifications
and exceptions: (a) the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws, or equitable principles, relating to or
limiting the rights of creditors generally; (b) the use of the term enforceable
shall not imply any opinion as to the availability of specific performance,
injunctive relief or other equitable remedies; (c) we advise you that a
California court may not strictly enforce certain covenants contained in the
Indenture or allow acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness evidenced by
the Securities if it concludes that such enforcement or acceleration would be
unreasonable under the then existing circumstances; and (d) that certain rights,
remedies and waivers contained in the Indenture or Securities may be limited or
rendered ineffective by applicable California laws or judicial decisions
governing such provisions, but such laws or judicial decisions do not render the
Indenture or the Securities invalid or unenforceable as a whole.

We consent to the incorporation by reference of this opinion in the
Registration Statement.

Very truly yours,

LATHAM & WATKINS
