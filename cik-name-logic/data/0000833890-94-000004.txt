ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

ASHLAND COAL AND ARCH MINERAL TERMINATE DISCUSSIONS

Ashland Coal, Inc. (the "Company") and Arch Mineral
Corporation have terminated discussions about a possible business
combination of the companies.

FIRST QUARTER RESULTS

The Company's financial results for the first quarter of
1994 will be substantially affected by severe winter weather
during January and the operational after effects of the recent
strike by the United Mine Workers of America. The strike after
effects include required maintenance on equipment that was idled
by the strike; the building up of coal inventories depleted by
the strike; and mine development work deferred during the strike.
As a result, the Company believes earnings for the first quarter
will be around the break-even level.
