COLUMBIA/HCA RECORDS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH OF 22%
WITH EPS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS REPORTED AT $0.60

Same-Hospital Operating Statistics Up From Prior Year

Louisville, KY, July 28, 1994 -- Columbia/HCA Healthcare
Corporation (NYSE:COL) today announced operating results for the second
quarter ended June 30, 1994. Results for the quarter exceeded expectations
due to growth in same-hospital utilization and financial performance, the
impact of recent debt refinancings, and the realization of anticipated
merger synergies.

Columbia/HCA's earnings per share from continuing operations
increased 22% to $.60 for the second quarter ended June 30, 1994, compared
to earnings per share of $0.49 for the second quarter of 1993. Net
revenues for the second quarter of 1994 totaled $2.7 billion, up 6% from
$2.5 billion in the second quarter of 1993. Operating income in the second
quarter rose 10% to $543 million, up from $496 million last year.

Columbia/HCA's same-hospital admissions increase 1.1% during the
second quarter of 1994, continuing the trend seen in the first quarter. 
Same-hospital outpatient visits rose 22% over the second quarter of 1993,
primarily as a result of expanding home health and other ancillary
outpatient services.

"Columbia/HCA's earnings growth in the second quarter reflects a
combination of operating improvements and the realization of anticipated
merger synergies," said David T. Vandewater, Chief Operating Officer of
Columbia/HCA. "Our focus on labor and supply costs improved our operating
margin this quarter to 20.2% compared to 19.5% in the second quarter of
1993."

"The debt refinancings accomplished in late 1993 and thus far in
1994 have significantly reduced interest expense," said David C. Colby,
Columbia/HCA's Chief Financial Officer. "In addition, Columbia/HCA has
continued to generate strong cash flow as evidenced by the fact that the
ratio of debt to total capitalization improved from 51.6% at year end to
49.5% at June 30, 1994. In the first half of 1994, the Company has
expended significant amounts related to its capital expenditure and
acquisition programs while reducing debt by $42 million."

Richard L. Scott, President and Chief Executive Officer of
Columbia/HCA, added that "We continue to be successful as we create
efficient, quality-focused healthcare delivery systems in our markets. The
commitment of our local market management teams in custom designing
provider networks for their communities is at the base of our success. The
expected third quarter completion of the Medical Care America acquisition
will continue to add needed surgical facilities to many of our markets,
enabling Columbia/HCA to enhance local services."

The following table highlights the consolidated operating
results of Columbia/HCA for the second quarter and six months ended June
