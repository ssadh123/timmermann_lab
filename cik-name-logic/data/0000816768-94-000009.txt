Alan Seelenfreund Chairman and Chief Executive Officer

McKESSON 

July 11, 1994

To Our Shareholders and Employees:

By the time this letter reaches you, the news media will
have reported that McKesson Corp. announced today that we have
entered into a definitive agreement for a corporate restructuring
pursuant to which we will sell our PCS Health Systems, Inc.
subsidiary to Eli Lilly and Company for $4 billion in cash. 
Enclosed is a copy of the press release containing details of the
transaction.

The purpose of this letter is to alert you to expect a
communication very shortly from Eli Lilly and Company in respect
to the tender offer.

As a consequence of the pending transaction, the annual
stockholders' meeting scheduled for July 27, 1994 is being
cancelled. We also have postponed the publication of the annual
report issue of McKesson Today so that we can prepare a report
that reflects the financial and operating performance as well as
the prospects of our continuing businesses.

Sincerely,

/s/Alan Seelenfreund
Alan Seelenfreund
