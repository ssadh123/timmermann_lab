IOWA-ILLINOIS AND MIDWEST RESOURCES SHAREHOLDERS
APPROVE PROPOSED MERGER

DAVENPORT, IOWA--At a special meeting today Iowa-Illinois Gas and
Electric Company shareholders approved the planned merger of
Iowa-Illinois and Midwest Resources Inc. to form MidAmerican
Energy Company. Midwest Resources shareholders also approved the
proposed merger at a separate meeting in Des Moines.
The approval required favorable votes of two-thirds of
Iowa-Illinois' outstanding shares entitled to vote. Of the
company's shareholders who submitted their proxies, 96 percent
voted in favor of the merger.
A favorable vote from a simple majority of Midwest
Resources' outstanding shares was required. Of the outstanding
shares voted at that meeting, 94 percent were in favor of the
merger.
"We are pleased the shareholders of both companies have
shown overwhelming support for the merger," said Stanley J.
Bright, Iowa-Illinois chairman and chief executive officer. "We
are convinced that the long-term outlook for MidAmerican will be
superior to that either company has as a stand-alone entity. The
merger is in the best interests of the customers and shareholders
of our two companies and the many communities we serve.
"We expect to have all of the necessary regulatory
approvals within the next six to eight months," he said.
In addition to the approval of shareholders, the merger
must receive approvals from the Iowa Utilities Board, the
Illinois Commerce Commission, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The utilities
have filed the necessary materials with these regulatory
agencies. Completion of the merger is expected in the second
half of 1995.
Iowa-Illinois, with assets of $1.8 billion, provides
natural gas and electric service to a population exceeding
600,000 in central and eastern Iowa and western Illinois. The
company's non-regulated subsidiary, InterCoast Energy Company,
has more than $540 million of assets in three major businesses:
oil and gas, energy services, and financial investments.
Midwest Resources, with assets of $2.6 billion, provides
natural gas and electric service to a population exceeding 1
million in Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota. A subsidiary,
Midwest Capital Group Inc., has non-regulated investments.
The two companies announced the merger agreement on July
27. Iowa-Illinois common shareholders will receive 1.47 shares
of MidAmerican common stock for each Iowa-Illinois common share. 
Midwest Resources common shareholders will receive one share of
MidAmerican common for each share of Midwest common. The
shareholders of Iowa-Illinois will own 44 percent of MidAmerican,
and Midwest Resources shareholders will own 56 percent.
Upon the effectiveness of the merger, MidAmerican Energy
Company will serve 620,000 electric customers and 580,000 natural
gas customers. With total assets of about $4.4 billion and
annual utility revenues of $1.5 billion, it will be the largest
utility company operating in Iowa. The new company will provide
service in most of Iowa's major cities, with a service area
spanning the state of Iowa, as well as the Illinois Quad-Cities
and parts of eastern Nebraska and southeastern South Dakota. 
Iowa-Illinois' common shares are traded on the New York Stock
Exchange and the Chicago Stock Exchange under the symbol: IWG. 
Its preference shares are traded over-the-counter. Common share
quotations are listed in the New York Stock Exchange
Composite Transactions under: IowaIllGas.
