ACQUISITION OR DISPOSTION OF ASSETS 

The Merger (the Merger) of First Kentucky Bancorp, Inc. (Bancorp), the parent
company of First Kentucky Federal Savings Bank (Bank), Central City, Kentucky,
into Peoples First Acquisition Corporation (Subsidiary), a wholly-owned subsi-
diary of Peoples First Corporation (PFC), became effective upon the filing of
Articles of Merger with the Kentucky Secretary of State on March 10, 1994. In
the Merger, the surviving Subsidiary, acquired all the assets and assumed all
the liabilities of the Bancorp. At the time of the Merger, the principal asset
of Bancorp was the stock of the Bank. At December 31, 1993, Bancorp had, on a
consolidated basis, total assets of approximately $176.8 million, loans of
approximately $78.3 million, deposits of approximately $160.8 million and net
assets (stockholders' equity) of approximately $13.7 million. 

PFC exchanged 930,000 shares of its common stock for all the outstanding shares
of Bancorp. PFC's common stock is traded on the National Association of Secur-
ities Dealers Automated Quotation System (NASDAQ) National Market System (NMS)
under the symbol PFKY. The last trading price reported by NASDAQ on March 10,
1994, for PFKY was $27.00 per share. This business combination will be account-
ed for as a pooling-of-interest. PFC will report the results of operations for
1994 as though Bancorp had been combined as of the beginning of 1994 and finan-
cial statements for prior years will be restated on a combined basis to furnish
comparative information. 

Peoples First generally intends to continue to use the assets acquired in the
Merger for the purpose of the general business conducted by a savings bank,
their use immediately before the Merger.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT 

Board of Directors 
First Kentucky Bancorp, Inc. 
Central City, Kentucky 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition
of First Kentucky Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiary as of September 30, 1993 and
1992, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30,
1993. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Bank's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of First
Kentucky Bancorp, Inc. and subsidiary as of September 30, 1993 and 1992, and the
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended September 30, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

FIRST KENTUCKY BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

1. First Kentucky Bancorp, Inc. 

First Kentucky Bancorp, Inc. (the Company) is a Delaware corporation formed at
the direction of First Kentucky Federal Savings Bank (the Bank) to acquire all
the outstanding capital stock that the Bank issued upon conversion from a fed-
erally chartered mutual savings bank to a federally chartered stock savings
bank; this conversion was effective June 18, 1991. As part of the conversion,
the Bank issued all of its common stock to the Company and, simultaneously, the
Company sold its common stock to certain depositors of the Bank. The Company
issued 362,250 shares of common stock for an aggregate price of $3,622,500 or
$3,150,372, net of conversion costs which were deducted from the proceeds. The
plan of conversion outlined that all but approximately 1% of the net proceeds
would be injected into the Bank in exchange for 100% of its stock and, accord-
ingly $3,100,000 was infused into the Bank. Prior to the conversion, the
Company had not transacted any material business activities other than those
associated with the issuance of stock. Subsequent to the conversion, the
Company's business activities have been limited to owning the Bank. 

2. Significant Accounting Policies 

Principles of Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, First Kentucky Federal
Savings Bank and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Home Service Corporation, for all
years presented. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. Certain prior year accounts have been reclassified to conform
with 1993 classifications. 

Real Estate Owned - Real estate properties acquired through foreclosure and in
settlement of loans are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable
value at the date of foreclosure. Cost is the lesser of fair value or the sum
of the related loan balance and the costs of foreclosure. Estimated net realiz-
able value represents estimated sales price less direct selling expenses. Costs
relating to development and improvement of property are capitalized, whereas
costs relating to holding property are not capitalized and are charged against
operations in the current period. Any portion of interest costs relating to
development of real estate is capitalized. In addition, real estate owned
consists of in-substance foreclosures which based on current information and
events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due
according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement and foreclosure is
probable to provide for repayment of the loan. 

Office Properties and Equipment - Office properties and equipment are stated at
cost less accumulated depreciation computed principally by the straight-line
method over the following estimated useful lives: 

Years 
Land improvements 5 - 20 
Buildings and improvements 5 - 50 
Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 - 15 
10

FIRST KENTUCKY BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 

Loans Receivable - Loans receivable are stated at unpaid principal balances,
less the allowance for loan losses, deferred loan origination fees and unearned
discounts. Deferred loan origination fees are amortized using the level yield
method on a loan-by-loan basis over the lives of the underlying loans. Unearned
discounts on consumer loans are recognized over the lives of the loans using
methods that approximate the interest method. The allowance for loan losses is
increased by charges to income and decreased by charge-offs (net of recoveries).
Management's periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on
the Bank's past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio,
adverse situations that may affect the borrower's ability to repay, estimated
value of any underlying collateral, and current economic conditions. 

Uncollectible interest on loans that are contractually past due is charged off
or an allowance is established based on management's periodic evaluation. The
allowance is established by a charge to interest income equal to all interest
previously accrued, and income is subsequently recognized only to the extent
cash payments are received until, in management's judgment, the borrower has the
ability to make regular interest and principal payments, in which case the loan
is returned to accrual status. 

The Bank's primary lending area is a region within Western Kentucky. The
economy within this region is based upon agriculture and coal industries. The
Bank's primary lending activity is the origination of residential real estate
loans secured by first mortgage for the purpose of acquisition or construction
of one-to-four family residential properties. 

Allowance for Losses and Uncollected Interest - The Bank provides valuation
allowances for estimated losses on loans, accrued interest and real estate owned
when a loss is both estimable and probable. Major loans, real estate, and major
lending areas are reviewed periodically to determine potential problems at an
early date. The Bank's experience has shown that foreclosures on loans result
in some losses. Therefore, in addition to allowances for specific loans, the
Bank makes a provision for losses on properties based in part on loss experience
and in part on prevailing market conditions. Additions to allowances are
charged to operations. 

Investment Securities - Securities are carried at amortized cost and are not
adjusted to the lower of cost or market because it is management's intention to
hold them to maturity. Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts is
computed on a method which approximates the level yield method. Gains or losses
on the sale of investment securities are recognized in income at the time of
sale, with cost being determined by the specific identification method.

FIRST KENTUCKY BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 

In May, 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 "Accounting for Certain Investments,
Debt, and Equity Securities" (SFAS No. 115). The statement requires the
classification of investment securities into three categories: held-to-maturity,
available-for-sale, or trading, based on management's positive intent and
ability to hold such securities. The Bank intends to adopt SFAS No. 115 by
October 1, 1994, as required. The adoption of SFAS No. 115 would not have a
material effect on the financial statements at September 30, 1993. 

Mortgage-backed Securities - Mortgage-backed securities are carried at unpaid
principal balances adjusted for unamortized premiums and unearned discounts as
it is management's intent and ability to hold such investments to maturity.
Amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts is computed on a method
which approximates the level yield method. Such securities are primarily
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and Government National Mortgage
Association participations. 

Income Taxes - Deferred income taxes are provided on differences between income
reported for financial reporting and income tax purposes as explained more fully
in Note 12. 

3. Statement of Cash Flows 

Companies are required to classify cash receipts and payments according to
whether they stem from operating, investing or financing activities. For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Bank considers all highly liquid
debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash
equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, amounts due from

10. Stockholders' Equity 

Regulatory Capital Requirements - Under the Financial Institutions Reform,
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 ("FIRREA"), regulations for savings
institutions' minimum capital requirements which went into effect on December 7,
1989, require institutions to have a minimum regulatory tangible capital equal
to 1.5% of adjusted total assets, a minimum 3% leverage core capital ratio and
an 8.0% risk-based capital ratio. 

The Bank, at September 30, 1993, meets all regulatory capital requirements. The
following is a reconciliation of the Bank's stockholders' equity to regulatory
capital (In Thousands):

FIRST KENTUCKY BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 

Liquidation Account - In connection with the Bank's conversion from mutual to
stock form of ownership during 1991, the Bank established a "liquidation
account" in the amount of $6,750,000 for the purpose of granting to eligible
savings account holders a priority in the event of future liquidation. Only in
such an event, an eligible account holder who continues to maintain a savings
account will be entitled to receive a distribution from the liquidation account.
The total amount of the liquidation account decreases in an amount
proportionately corresponding to decreases in the savings account balances of
the eligible account holders. 

Dividend Restrictions - The Bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend on any
of its capital stock if the effect thereof would cause the net worth of the Bank
to be reduced below the amount required for the liquidation account. 

Additionally, federal regulations limit dividend and capital distributions by
the Bank to (a) the greater of 75% of net income for the previous four quarters
or (b) 100% of the Bank's net income to date during the calendar year plus the
amount that would reduce by one-half its surplus capital ratio at the beginning
of the calendar year. If the Bank's capital requirement falls below its minimum
capital requirement, the Bank may not pay dividends without regulatory approval.

Earnings Per Share - Net income per share for fiscal years 1993 and 1992 is
computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares outstanding.
Common stock equivalents have not been used in computing net income per share
because their effect is not material. Net income per share of common stock from
the date of conversion, June 18 to September 30, 1991, is computed by dividing
net income for the period by 362,250 shares, the number of shares of common
stock issued and outstanding for the period. 

Pro forma net income per share of common stock is $2.40 per share for the year
ended September 30, 1991, and has been calculated as if the 362,250 common
shares were issued on October 1, 1990. Pro forma net income has been adjusted
to reflect investment of the stock proceeds for the period October 1, 1990,
through June 17, 1991, at 6.03 percent (the Bank's weighted average interest
rate on interest-earning assets for 1991, net of tax). 

Federal Income Tax Bad Debt Reserve - Retained earnings include approximately
$2,600,000 at September 30, 1993, for which no provision for federal income
taxes has been made. This amount represents allocations of income to bad debt
deductions for tax purposes only. If the amounts that qualify as deductions for
federal income tax purposes are later used for purposes other than bad debt
losses, including distributions in liquidation, such distributions will be
subject to federal income tax at the then current corporate rate.

11. Employee Benefits 

Pension Plans - The Bank is a participant in the Financial Institutions Retire-
ment Fund, a multi-employer defined benefit pension plan covering substantially
all employees. Employees are eligible to participate after one year of service
and are 100 percent vested at the completion of five years of participation in
the plan. The Bank's share of accumulated plan benefits and net assets
available for benefits is not available. The plan was fully funded in 1993,
1992 and 1991, thus requiring no contributions. The Bank also participates in
the Financial Institutions Thrift Plan, a defined contribution plan covering
substantially all employees, qualifying under Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code. Under the terms of the plan, voluntary employee contributions are
matched by up to 3% of the employee base pay, and employees are immediately
vested. Employer contributions charged to operations were $35,650, $34,378 and
$31,503 during 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. 

Stock Option Plan - In connection with the conversion to the stock form of
ownership, the Company's Board of Directors adopted the First Kentucky Bancorp,
Inc. 1991 Stock Option Plan, which was approved by the stockholders at the
first annual meeting. Pursuant to the plan, 36,225 shares of the Company's
common stock have been reserved for issuance to certain employees upon exercise
of options granted to them under the plan. The exercise price of the options is
$10 per share. All options were exercised during 1993. 

Employee Stock Ownership Plan - The Company has established an Employee Stock
Ownership Plan (ESOP) to provide additional retirement benefits to its
employees. Generally, all employees are eligible to participate in the ESOP
upon completion of one year of service. Employees are 100 percent vested at the
completion of five years of vested service in the plan. 

The ESOP borrowed $253,570 to purchase 25,357 shares of Company common stock, or
7% of the original shares issued, pledging the stock as collateral for the loan.
Future contributions to retire the loan will be paid to the ESOP out of current
or retained earnings. The unpaid balance of the loan, representing deferred
employee benefits, has been recorded as a deduction from stockholders' equity
with a corresponding amount as a liability. 

As the Bank makes annual contributions to the ESOP, these contributions plus
the dividends accumulated on the Bank stock held by the ESOP, are used to
repay the loan. As the loan is repaid, common stock is allocated to the
participants. The loan matures in the year 2001. Interest, payable quarterly
at a rate of 7.0% was $13,626, $17,745 and $7,322 for 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively. Contributions charged to operations during 1993, 1992 and 1991,
including interest, were $38,983, $43,102 and $32,679, respectively. Dividends
paid on shares held by the ESOP were $19,018 during 1993.

FIRST KENTUCKY BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 

Management Recognition Plan - The Company has adopted the First Kentucky
Bancorp, Inc. Management Recognition Plan (MRP), which was approved by the
stockholders, to help retain its key employees. Under the plan, 10,867 shares
were issued to the MRP Trust and have been paid to the key employees.
Compensation expense in the amount of fair market value of the Company's common
stock at the date of the grant ($12.50 per share) has been recognized in the
financial statements. 

Deferred Compensation Agreements - The Bank has deferred compensation agreements
with certain directors which are partially funded currently through whole life
insurance contracts. 

12. Federal Income Tax 

Under the Internal Revenue Code, the Bank is allowed a special bad debt
deduction related to additions to tax bad debt reserves established for the
purpose of absorbing losses. The applicable provisions of the law permit the
Bank to deduct from taxable income an allowance for bad debts based on the
greater of a percentage of taxable income before such deductions or actual loss
experience. Because the Bank does not intend to use the reserve for purposes
other than to absorb losses, deferred income taxes have not been provided. 

Deferred income taxes (credits) result from timing differences in the
recognition of income and expenses for tax and financial reporting purposes.
Timing differences and the tax effect of each are as follows: 

Year Ended September 30,
1993 1992 1991

Accelerated depreciation ($10,800) $17 ($7,542)
Deferred loss from hedging activities -- (60,906) (2,466)

Taxes on income differs from statutory amounts which are computed by applying
the federal income tax rate of 34% for all periods presented as follows: 

Year Ended September 30,
1993 1992 1991

Tax at statutory rate $881,493 $746,629 $394,473
Differences between tax and book 
provisions for loan losses (26,412) 36,011 56,845
Tax-exempt interest and dividend income (26,262) (23,797) (29,951)

basis of assets sold -- -- 13,416
Other 7,265 (13,628) (1,179)
------- ------- -------
$836,084 $745,215 $433,604
======= ======= =======

The Bank intends to adopt the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," as amended, (SFAS No. 109)
by October, 1993, as required. Under SFAS No. 109, accounting for income taxes
changes from the deferral method to the asset and liability method. Under the
asset and liability method, the deferred income tax asset or liability is
adjusted each period based on the application of currently enacted tax rates and
laws that are scheduled to be in effect in the periods the temporary differences
reverse. 

Under the deferred method in effect until SFAS No. 109, deferred income taxes
are recognized for income and expense items that are reported in different years
for financial reporting purposes and income tax purposes using the tax rate
applicable to the year of the calculation. Under the deferred method, deferred
taxes are not adjusted for subsequent changes in tax rates. 

This change in accounting for income taxes may be applied retroactively by
restating previously issued financial statements or it may be shown by reporting
the cumulative effect of the change in the year of initial application. The
effect of retroactive implementation to the Bank would increase (decrease) net
income by $(45,139), $10,446, and $46,835 in the years ended September 30, 1993,
1992, and 1991, respectively. Additionally, the adoption of SFAS No. 109 would
decrease retained earnings by $157,807 at September 30, 1993. The Bank intends
to adopt SFAS No. 109 on a prospective basis for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 1994.

15. Fair Values of Financial Instruments 

In December, 1991, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of
Financial Instruments" (SFAS No. 107). The Statement requires disclosure of
fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in
the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. In cases
where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates
using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are
significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and
estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value
estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in
many cases could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument.
SFAS No. 107 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial
instruments from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair
value amounts presented are not intended to represent the underlying value of
the Bank. 

The methods and assumptions used by the Bank in estimating its fair value
disclosures for financial instruments are presented below: 

Cash and Interest-Bearing Deposits - The carrying amounts for cash and
interest-bearing deposits approximates their fair values. 

Investment Securities - Fair values for investment securities are based upon _
quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not
available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable
instruments. 

Loans, Net - For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no
significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying amounts.
The fair values of other types of loans are estimated by discounting the future
cash flows using current interest rates at which similar loans would be made to
borrowers with similar credit quality and for the same remaining maturities. 

Deposits - The fair values for demand deposits, savings account and certain
money market deposits are the amounts payable on demand at the reporting date.
The carrying amounts for variable-rate, money market accounts and certificates
of deposit approximate their fair values at the reporting date. Fair values for
fixed-rate certificates of deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flow
calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates
to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits. 

26

FIRST KENTUCKY BANCORP, INC. AND SUBSIDIARY 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued 

Commitments to Extend Credit and Standby Letters of Credit - The fair values of
commitments to extend credit is estimated using fees currently charged to enter
into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the
agreements and the present creditworthiness of the customer. For fixed-rate
loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current
levels of interest rates and the committed rates. The fair values of standby
letters of credit are based on fees currently charged for similar agreements or
on the estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise settle the obligation with
the counter parties at the reporting date. 

The estimated fair values of the Bank's financial instruments at September 30,
1993, are as follows: 

Carrying Fair
Value Value
Financial assets: 
Cash and interest bearing deposits $7,382,992 $7,382,992
Investment securities 15,569,313 17,133,000
Mortgage-backed securities 69,747,976 71,393,000
Loans, net 78,233,516 79,486,000

Financial liabilities: 
Deposits 161,374,848 162,630,000

Unrecognized financial instruments: 
Commitments to extend credit -- 2,903,150

16. Subsequent Events 

In October, 1993, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired
by Peoples First Corporation in Paducah, Kentucky. The merger, which the
Corporation expects to be completed in April, 1994, is subject to regulatory
approval.

Transaction 
Peoples First acquired First Kentucky as outlined in the Merger Agreement. The
Merger Agreement provided that Peoples First obtained 100% ownership of the
outstanding stock of First Kentucky for 930,000 shares of Peoples First Common
Stock. 

Assumptions 
1. The pro forma combined condensed balance sheet of Peoples First and First
Kentucky as of December 31, 1993 has been prepared with the following
assumptions: 

a. The Merger occurred on December 31, 1993. 

b. The pooling-of-interest method of accounting was used to account for 
the business combination and, accordingly, the recorded assets and 
liabilities of First Kentucky are carried forward to the combined 
entity at their recorded amounts. 

c. Pro forma adjustment to record Peoples First's issuance of 930,000 
shares of Peoples First Common Stock at a stated value of $0.7812 
per share. 

d. Pro forma adjustment to record the excess of First Kentucky's total 
stockholders' equity over the total of the stated value of the Peoples 
First stock issued and First Kentucky's retained earnings. 

e. Pro forma adjustment to record First Kentucky's deferred income taxes 
payable pursuant to Financial Standard No. 109 (FAS 109). Peoples 
First adopted the provisions of FAS 109 effective on Janauary 1, 1992, 
changing the method of accounting for income taxes on a prospective 
basis. To conform to the accounting principles used for income taxes 
by Peoples First, First Kentucky's cumulative adjustment would have 
been $158,000 for 1992 to adopt FAS 109. 

2. The pro forma combined condensed statements of income presented herein have
been prepared in accordance with the following financial assumptions: 

a. The Merger was consummated at the beginning of the year presented. 

b. The pooling-of-interest method of accounting was used for the business 
combination. 

c. No pro forma adjustments to the historical combined statements of 
income are necessary to reflect the Merger. The reported income of 
Peoples First and First Kentucky for prior periods was combined and 
stated as income of the combined entity.
