UNION PLANTERS CORPORATION
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INTRODUCTION

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial statements
present a balance sheet as of June 30, 1994, and statements of earnings for the
six-month period ended June 30, 1994, and for each of the three years ended
December 31, 1993. The pro forma balance sheet presents certain acquisitions
which were completed subsequent to June 30, 1994, as well as pending
acquisitions, the consummation of which is considered by management to be
probable (the probable acquisitions). The statement of earnings for the
six-month period ended June 30, 1994 and for the twelve-month period ended
December 31, 1993, present the pro forma impact of certain acquisitions
completed in 1993 and 1994 and the probable acquisitions assuming that all of
the acquisitions had been completed at January 1, 1993. Acquisitions accounted
for as poolings of interests and completed in 1993 are included in the
Corporation's 1993 results. Pro forma statements of earnings are also presented
for the two years ended December 31, 1992, to reflect the pending acquisitions
of BNF BANCORP, INC. (formerly BANCFIRST Corporation) (BNF), and Grenada
Sunburst System Corporation (GSSC) which are expected to be accounted for as
poolings of interests. Consummation of the BNF and GSSC acquisitions are
considered probable and both meet the test for a significant subsidiary. With
the exception of these two acquisitions, the pro forma impact of the other
probable acquisitions expected to be accounted for as poolings of interests is
not presented because the results of the entities acquired are not considered
significant to consolidated results. The pro forma financial statements should
be read in connection with the Corporation's 1993 Annual Report on Form 10-K
and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 1994 and
June 30, 1994. Additionally, the Corporation's Current Reports on Form 8-K
dated February 8, 1994, April 14, 1994, May 18, 1994, July 1, 1994, July 26,
1994, and August 17, 1994 contain audited financial statements, unaudited
interim financial statements, and other related information for BNF and GSSC.
Note 1 to these pro forma financial statements identifies (including the
abbreviations for the company names heading the columns of the statements) the
completed and probable acquisitions included herein.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1. CONSUMMATED ACQUISITIONS

The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and statements of
earnings reflect the consummated and the probable acquisitions listed below.
The unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet gives effect to these
transactions at June 30, 1994 as if they had occurred on that date, and the
unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of earnings reflect the impact of
the transactions as if they had occurred January 1, 1993, except for the
acquisitions of BNF BANCORP, INC. (formerly BANCFIRST Corporation) (BNF) and
Grenada Sunburst System Corporation (GSSC) which are presented assuming the
transactions occurred January 1, 1991. The unaudited pro forma consolidated
results shown are not necessarily indicative of future operating results, nor
can there be any assurance that the pending transactions will be consummated.
For the probable acquisitions expected to be accounted for as poolings of
interests, except BNF and GSSC, statements of earnings for periods prior to
1993 are not presented because the transactions are not significant.

(a) The Corporation had previously acquired 17.93% of the common stock of BOET
($3.4 million). On January 1, 1993, the Corporation purchased an
additional 43.93% of the common stock of BOET in exchange for Series E
Preferred Stock ($11.1 million). Effective May 3, 1993, the Corporation
acquired the remaining outstanding common stock of BOET in exchange for
the Corporation's Series E Preferred Stock ($10.8 million).

(b) The Corporation acquired Maryville, a federal mutual savings bank which,
incidental to a conversion/acquisition, converted to a federal stock
charter. All of the stock of Maryville was acquired by the Corporation in
exchange for a capital contribution equalling approximately $14.1 million
derived in part from the proceeds of a public offering of the
Corporation's Common Stock made in connection with the
conversion/acquisition.

(c) The recording of the acquisition of Maryville using the purchase method of
accounting resulted in negative goodwill of approximately $9.4 million,
$8.1 million of which was deducted from noncurrent, nonmonetary assets
(premises and equipment, fair value adjustment of loans, prepaid software
and mortgage servicing rights). The remaining negative goodwill of $1.3
million was recorded in other liabilities and is being amortized over 7
years.

NOTE 2. REORGANIZATION OF UPNB

As of July 1, 1994, the Corporation formed four new regional bank
subsidiaries, Union Planters Bank of East Tennessee, National Association
(Knoxville); Union Planters Bank of Middle Tennessee, National Association
(Nashville); Union Planters Bank of Chattanooga, National Association
(Chattanooga); and Union Planters Bank of Jackson, National Association
(Jackson) (collectively, the Regional Banks). UPC injected equity of $101.7
million into the Regional Banks with a majority of the funds ($98 million)
provided by a dividend from Union Planters National Bank (UPNB). Each of the
Regional Banks purchased from UPNB, at book value, substantially all of the
assets and assumed the liabilities of the UPNB branches located in its region.
While the separation of the branches previously held by UPNB had no material
impact on the consolidated financial condition of UPC, it will promote the
identification of individual branch operations within their local communities.
UPNB continues to operate branches located in Memphis and West Tennessee.

NOTE 3. EARNINGS CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO PENDING ACQUISITIONS AND
REORGANIZATIONS

In connection with pending acquisitions, particularly the GSSC
acquisition, and possible internal and acquisition-related reorganizations,
management anticipates that possible significant expenses (e.g., elimination of
duplicate facilities, staff reductions, elimination of duplicate functions,
write-off of impaired assets, etc.) may be incurred in the third and fourth
quarters of 1994 upon completion of ongoing financial, due diligence,

-19-
<PAGE> 23
and strategic reviews and assessments of the post-merger operating environment
of the Corporation. It is preliminarily estimated that at least $2 million of
such expense will be incurred in the third quarter and those expenses have not
been considered in the accompanying pro forma financial statements. Any
additional charges which may be incurred in either the third or fourth quarter
as a result of the completion of the studies cannot be estimated at this time.
Additionally, management of the Corporation expects significant future cost
savings from the combined operations of the Corporation and GSSC once that
acquisition is consummated. Preliminary studies indicate that there are
significant savings opportunities and management expects that they will be
realized once the recommendations are implemented; however, the final savings
which may actually be realized cannot be estimated at this time.

NOTE 4. THIRD QUARTER 1994 EARNINGS CONSIDERATION

The Corporation is evaluating its available for sale (AFS) investment
portfolio in light of the rising interest rate environment in the first half of
1994. Selective restructurings of the AFS investment portfolio to increase book
yields are expected in the last half of 1994. It is currently estimated that
the losses recognized would be in a range of $2.5 million to $5 million after
taxes. These losses have already been recognized on the Corporation's balance
sheet by a reduction in shareholders' equity under SFAS No. 115, adopted
January 1, 1994. The higher book yields in the investment portfolio after the
restructurings are expected to increase the Corporation's future earnings, and
any losses are expected to be earned back over a shorter time period than the
original maturity of the securities being sold. The restructurings are expected
to enhance the liquidity and flexibility of the Corporation's balance sheet.

NOTE 5. UNAUDITED PRO FORMA ADJUSTMENTS

The following summarizes the unaudited pro forma adjustments which are
necessary to reflect the transactions described previously as of June 30, 1994,
for the unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet and for the six-month
period ended June 30, 1994 and for the three years ended December 31, 1993, for
the unaudited pro forma consolidated statements of earnings. The adjustments
for the probable acquisitions are based on currently available information and
could change significantly upon consummation. Not all purchase accounting
adjustments have been reflected because certain information is not available;
however, the amounts not reflected are not expected to be material.
