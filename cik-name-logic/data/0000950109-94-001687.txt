NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(dollar amounts in thousands)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CoreStates
Financial Corp ("the Corporation") and all of its subsidiaries, including:
CoreStates Bank, N.A. ("CBNA"); New Jersey National Bank ("NJNB"); Constellation
Bank, N.A. ("Constellation Bank"); and CoreStates Bank of Delaware, N.A.
("CBD"). All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated. The
financial statements have been restated to include Constellation Bancorp
("Constellation"), which was acquired on March 16, 1994 in a transaction
accounted for as a pooling of interests. Certain amounts in prior years have
been reclassified for comparative purposes.

The accompanying financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 
1993 have been restated subsequent to the release of March 31, 1994 financial 
statements to reflect merger-related charges of $127.8 million after-tax, or 
$.89 per share, related to the Constellation acquisition in the first quarter of
1994, rather than in the fourth quarter of 1993 as previously reported. This 
restatement was made after discussions with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission staff, which resulted in these charges being reflected in the quarter
that the acquisition was consummated. The restatement has no effect on 
CoreStates' basic operating results for 1993 or 1994 excluding the one-time 
merger-related charges. On a pre-tax basis, the merger-related charges consisted
of a $120.0 million provision for loan losses, a $28.0 million addition to the 
OREO reserve, $13.0 million for the writedown of purchased mortgage servicing 
rights and related assets, and $34.0 million for expenses directly attributable 
to the acquisition. The effects of this restatement on the accompanying 
consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 1993

All common shares outstanding and per common share data have been restated to
reflect the impact of the Corporation's 100% stock dividend declared on August
17, 1993, and paid on October 15, 1993 to shareholders of record on September
15, 1993 ("the Stock Dividend"). An amount equal to the par value of the shares
issued in connection with the Stock Dividend was transferred from capital
surplus to common stock.

At the annual shareholders' meeting on April 20, 1993, an increase in the number
of authorized shares of common stock from 80,000,000 to 200,000,000 was
approved.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

Effective January 1, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits" ("FAS 112"). FAS 112 established the accounting requirements for
benefits provided to former or inactive employees after employment but before
retirement. FAS 112 requires that employers accrue the costs associated with
providing benefits, such as salary and benefit continuation under disability
plans, when payment of the benefits is probable and the amount of the obligation
can be reasonably estimated. The Corporation recognized the January 1, 1993 FAS
112 transitional liability of $20,015, $13,010 after-tax or $.10 per share, as
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle.

Effective December 31, 1993, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities" ("FAS 115"). FAS 115 established the accounting and
reporting requirements for investments in equity securities that have readily
determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities. All
affected investment securities must be classified as either held-to-maturity,
trading, or available-for-sale. Held-to-maturity securities are carried at
amortized cost basis. Trading securities are carried at fair value with
unrealized holding gains and losses reported in the income statement.
Available-for-sale securities are carried at fair value with unrealized holding
gains and losses reported as a component of shareholders' equity. As a result
of adopting FAS 115, securities with an original carrying value of $680,000 were
classified as available-for-sale at December 31, 1993 and were written up to
their aggregate fair value of $785,046. After the related tax effects,
shareholders' equity at December 31, 1993 was increased by $68,331 to reflect
the write-up of these securities to fair value.

Effective January 1, 1992, the Corporation adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits
Other Than Pensions" ("FAS 106"). FAS 106 requires that employers accrue the
costs associated with providing postretirement benefits during the active
service periods of employees. As permitted under FAS 106, the Corporation
elected to immediately recognize the January 1, 1992 transitional liability of
$128,706, $84,946 after-tax or $.71 per share, as the cumulative effect of a
change in accounting principle.

INCOME TAXES

In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("FAS
109"). In the first quarter of 1992 the Corporation retroactively adopted FAS
109 as of January 1, 1987. Under the asset and liability method provided for by
FAS 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax
consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates
applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities.

The Corporation and its subsidiaries file a consolidated Federal income tax
return.

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: continued

INVESTMENT SECURITIES

Held-to-maturity securities are carried at cost adjusted for amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, both computed on the interest method.
Held-to-maturity securities primarily consist of debt securities. The
Corporation has both the ability and positive intent to hold these securities
until maturity. Trading account securities are carried at market values. Gains
on trading account securities include both realized and unrealized gains and
losses on the portfolio.

Debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity or trading and marketable
equity securities are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale
securities are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of
tax, reported as a component of shareholders' equity. The accumulated net
unrealized gain on available-for-sale securities included in retained earnings
was $68,331 at December 31, 1993.

The adjusted cost of a specific certificate sold is the basis for determining
realized securities gains and losses as included in the consolidated statement
of income in "non-interest income".

Interest and dividends on investment securities are recognized as income when
earned.

LOANS
Interest on commercial loans is recognized on the daily principal amounts
outstanding. Loan fees are generally considered as adjustments of interest rate
yields and are amortized into interest income on loans over the terms of the
related loans. Interest on installment loans is principally recognized on the
interest method.

Commercial loans are placed on a non-accrual status, generally recognizing
interest as income when received, when, in the opinion of management, the
collectibility of principal or interest becomes doubtful. The deferral or non-
recognition of interest does not constitute forgiveness of the borrower's
obligation. In those cases where collection of principal is in doubt, additions
are made to the allowance for loan losses.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES

The allowance for loan losses is based on management's evaluation of the effects
on the loan portfolio of current economic and political conditions and other
pertinent indicators. Activities in foreign countries may involve special risks
not normally a part of domestic operations. Credit review personnel and senior
officers evaluate the loan portfolio by determining the net realizable value of
collateral and the financial strength of borrowers. Installment and credit card
loans are evaluated largely on the basis of delinquency data because of the
number of such loans and the relatively small size of each individual loan.

Additions to the allowance arise from the provision for loan losses charged to
operations or from the recovery of amounts previously charged off. Loan charge-
offs reduce the allowance. Loans are charged off when there has been permanent
impairment of the related carrying values.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT

Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and
amortization. The provision for depreciation and amortization is computed,
generally, on the straight-line method at rates based on the following range of
lives: buildings - 10 to 45 years; equipment - 3 to 12 years; and leasehold
improvements - 3 to 15 years.

RETIREMENT PLANS

The Corporation maintains a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan for
substantially all employees. Benefits are primarily based on the employee's
years of credited service, average annual salary and primary social security
benefit, as defined in the plan. It is the Corporation's policy to fund the
plan on a current basis to the extent deductible under existing tax regulations.

The Corporation provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance
benefits for retired employees. In order to participate in the health care
plan, an employee must retire with at least 10 years of service. The
postretirement health care plan is contributory, with retiree contributions
based on years of service. It is the Corporation's policy to fund the health
care plan on a current basis to the extent deductible under existing tax
regulations.

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

Forward exchange contracts are valued at current rates of exchange. Gains or
losses on forward exchange contracts intended to hedge an identifiable foreign
currency commitment are deferred and included in the measurement of the related
foreign currency transaction. All other gains or losses on forward exchange
contracts are included in the consolidated statement of income.

Currency gains and losses in connection with foreign loans and deposit contract
transactions, which are included in interest income and expenses, are recognized
pro rata over the contract terms. Foreign currency translation adjustments are
recorded directly to retained earnings. The cumulative foreign currency
translation gain (loss) was $(1,623), $135 and $4,519 at December 31, 1993, 1992
and 1991, respectively.

INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS

The Corporation uses various interest rate contracts such as, interest rate
swaps, futures, forward rate agreements, caps and floors, primarily as hedges
against specific assets, liabilities or anticipated transactions and to provide
for the needs of its customers. For contracts designated as hedges, gains or
losses are deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest income or expense
of the underlying assets or liabilities. Gains or losses resulting from early
terminations of contracts are deferred and amortized over the remaining term of
the underlying assets or liabilities. Any fees received or disbursed which
represent adjustments to the yield on interest rate contracts are capitalized
and amortized over the term of the interest rate contracts. Other contracts are
valued at market with gains or losses included in the consolidated income
statement.

CASH DIVIDENDS DECLARED PER SHARE

Cash dividends declared per share for the periods prior to the acquisitions of
Constellation Bancorp on March 16, 1994 and First Peoples Financial Corporation
on September 3, 1992 assume that the Corporation would have declared cash
dividends equal to the cash dividends per share actually declared by the
Corporation.

2. ACQUISITIONS AND PROPOSED ACQUISITIONS

On December 17, 1993, the Corporation purchased Inter Community Bancorp ("Inter
Community"), a New Jersey bank holding company with $133 million in assets and
$110 million in deposits at the time of the acquisition. As a result of this
acquisition, 640 thousand shares of the Corporation's common stock was issued.
The transaction had a total value of approximately $17 million and was accounted
for under the purchase accounting method. Accordingly, the results of
operations of Inter Community have been included with the Corporation since the
date of acquisition.

This acquisition is not material to the financial position or results of
operations and accordingly, pro forma information is deemed not necessary. 

On March 16, 1994, the Corporation acquired Constellation Bancorp
("Constellation"), a New Jersey bank holding company with $2.1 billion in assets
and $2.1 billion in deposits. The Corporation issued approximately 11.3 million
shares of common stock to shareholders of Constellation based on an exchange
ratio of .4137 of a share of the Corporation's common stock for each share of
Constellation common stock.

The merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests, accordingly, the
consolidated financial statements have been restated to include the consolidated
accounts of Constellation for all periods presented. Previously reported

(a) At December 31, 1993, Constellation had non-performing assets, non-
performing loans plus other real estate owned ("OREO"), of $120.6 million.
While Constellation had utilized a long-term workout strategy to deal with its
non-performing assets, the Corporation's strategy is to dispose of problem
assets in a more accelerated manner. In the first quarter of 1994, subsequent
to the consummation of its acquisition by the Corporation, Constellation
recorded an addition to its allowance for possible loan losses of $120 million
and an addition to its OREO reserves of $28 million as a result of conforming to
the Corporation's strategic direction and consumer lending loan charge-off
policies. Constellation also recorded pre-tax charges of $47 million, which
include expenses directly attributable to the acquisition, and certain other
costs and expenses. 

(b) In 1993, Constellation prospectively adopted FAS 109. However, restated
financial information is prepared as if Constellation retroactively adopted FAS
109 as of January 1, 1987. The impact of applying pooling of interests
accounting rules and retroactively applying FAS 109 to Constellation had the
following effects on restated net income and period-end common shareholders'
equity:

</TABLE>

(c) Constellation adopted FAS 106 on January 1, 1993, the date required under
that statement. Constellation elected not to recognize immediately its $6.0
million transitional liability, but to amortize that liability over 20 years. As
permitted under FAS 106 and pooling accounting, the restated financial 
information is prepared as if Constellation adopted FAS 106 effective January 1,
1992 and immediately recognized the $6.0 million, $4.0 million after-tax, 
traditional liability. Restated salaries, wages and benefits have been adjusted 
accordingly. 

In November 1993, the Corporation announced a definitive agreement to acquire
the $2.6 billion asset Independence Bancorp, Inc. ("Independence"), a
Pennsylvania bank holding company, in a transaction expected to be accounted for
as a pooling of interests. Assuming approval by regulators and by
Independence's shareholders, the transaction is expected to close in the second
quarter of 1994. For each Independence common share outstanding, a maximum of
1.5 shares of the Corporation's common stock will be issued assuming that the
average price per Corporation share over a pre-closing pricing period is less
than $27 per share, or a minimum of 1.45 shares of the Corporation's common
stock will be issued assuming that the average price per Corporation share is
greater than $28 per share. As a result of this transaction up to approximately
16.6 million new shares will be issued.

savings bank. The total purchase price of approximately $260 million will be
paid, 55% in the Corporation's common stock and 45% in cash, and the
acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase creating an intangible of
approximately $141 million. The Corporation plans to purchase in the market
100% of the shares to be issued. The transaction is expected to close late in

3. FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair
Value of Financial Instruments" ("FAS 107"), requires disclosure of fair value
information about financial instruments, whether or not required to be
recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that
value. FAS 107 defines a financial instrument as cash, evidence of ownership
interest in an entity, or a contractual obligation or right that will be settled
with another financial instrument.

In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on
estimates using discounted cash flow or other valuation techniques. Those
techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the
discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Fair value estimates derived
through those techniques cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent
markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the
instrument. FAS 107 excludes certain financial instruments and all nonfinancial
instruments from its disclosure requirements. Accordingly, the aggregate fair
value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the
Corporation.

Fair value estimates, methods, and assumptions are set forth below for the
Corporation's financial instruments.

CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS AND SHORT-TERM INSTRUMENTS The carrying amounts reported
in the balance sheet for cash and due from banks and short-term instruments
approximate their fair values. Short-term instruments include: time deposits;
Federal funds sold; and securities purchased under agreements to resell, all of
which generally have original maturities of less than 90 days.

INVESTMENT SECURITIES Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted
market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair
values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments. See Note 5
for the carrying value and estimated fair value of investment securities.

TRADING ACCOUNT SECURITIES Fair values for the Corporation's trading account
securities, which also are the amounts recognized in the balance sheet, are
based on quoted market prices where available. If quoted market prices are not
available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable
instruments.

LOANS Fair values are estimated for loans in groups with similar financial and
risk characteristics. Loans are segregated by type including: commercial and
industrial, commercial real estate; residential real estate; credit card and
other consumer; financial institutions; factoring receivables; and foreign.
Each loan type is further segmented into fixed and variable rate interest terms
and by performing and non-performing categories in order to estimate fair
values.

CoreStates Financial Corp and Subsidiaries

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(dollar amounts in thousands)

3. FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: continued

The fair value of fixed-rate performing loans is calculated by discounting
scheduled principal and interest cash flows through the estimated maturity using
estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk
inherent in the loan type at December 31, 1993 and 1992. The estimate of
maturity is based on the Corporation's historical experience with repayments for
each loan type, modified by an estimate of the effect of current economic and
lending conditions. For performing residential mortgage loans, fair value is
estimated by discounting contractual cash flows adjusted for prepayment
estimates using discount rates based on secondary market sources.

For credit card loans, cash flows and maturities are estimated based on
contractual interest rates and historical experience and are discounted using
secondary market rates adjusted for differences in servicing and credit costs.

For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and which have experienced no
significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying amounts.

Fair value for non-performing loans is based on discounting estimated cash flows
using a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the estimated cash
flows. Assumptions regarding cash flows, and discount rates are determined
using available market information and specific borrower information.

The following table presents carrying amounts and estimated fair values for
loans at December 31, 1993 and 1992. Disclosures about fair value of lease
financing receivables, which totaled $656,620 and $527,925 at December 31, 1993
and 1992, respectively, are not required by FAS 107, accordingly, the following
table excludes lease financing receivables.

</TABLE>

The fair value estimate for credit card loans is based on the value of existing
loans at December 31, 1993 and 1992. This estimate does not include the benefit
that relates to estimated cash flows from new loans expected to be generated
from existing cardholders over the remaining life of the portfolio. That
benefit is estimated to be approximately $64 million at December 31, 1993 and
$62 million at December 31, 1992 and is neither included in the fair value
estimate for credit card loans, nor recorded as an intangible asset in the
consolidated balance sheet.

DEPOSIT LIABILITIES The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (non-interest
bearing checking accounts, NOW accounts, savings accounts, and money market
accounts) are, by FAS 107 definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at
the reporting date (i.e. their carrying amounts). The carrying amounts for
variable-rate, fixed-term certificates of deposit approximate their fair values.
Fair values for fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a
discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates offered on
certificates at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, to an estimate of
aggregate expected maturities for those certificates of deposit.

</TABLE>

The estimated fair values above do not include the benefit that results from the
low-cost funding provided by core deposit liabilities as compared to the cost of
borrowing funds in the financial markets. That benefit, commonly referred to as
a deposit base intangible, is estimated to be approximately $510,000 at December
31, 1993 and $460,000 at December 31, 1992 and is neither considered in the
above estimated fair value amounts nor recorded as an intangible asset in the
consolidated balance sheet. The core deposit base intangible was determined by
using a discounted cash flow approach to value the spread between the cost of
core deposit liabilities and the cost of alternative borrowing sources over the
estimated lives of the core deposit liabilities.

SHORT-TERM FUNDS BORROWED The carrying amounts of Federal funds purchased,
securities sold under agreements to repurchase, commercial paper and other
short-term borrowings approximate their fair values.

LONG-TERM DEBT The fair values for long-term debt are based on quoted market
prices where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values
are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the Corporation's
borrowing rates at December 31, 1993 and 1992 for comparable types of borrowing
arrangements. See Note 11 for additional information regarding the carrying
value and estimated fair value of long-term debt.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET INSTRUMENTS Fair values for the Corporation's futures,
forwards, interest rate swaps, options, interest rate caps and floors, and
foreign exchange contracts are based on quoted market prices (futures); current
settlement values (forwards); quoted market prices of comparable instruments
(foreign currency exchange contracts); or, if there are no relevant comparable
instruments, on pricing models or formulas using current assumptions (interest
rate swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and options). The fair value of
commitments to extend credit other than credit card is estimated using the fees
currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the
remaining terms of the agreements and the present credit worthiness of the
counterparties. For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the
difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates.
The value of commitments to extend credit under credit card lines is embodied in
the benefit that relates to estimated cash flows from new loans expected to be
generated from existing cardholders over the remaining life of the portfolio.

The fair value of standby and commercial letters of credit is based on fees
currently charged for similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate
the agreements or otherwise settle the obligations with the counterparties. See
Note 15 for the notional value and estimated fair value of the Corporation's
off-balance sheet financial instruments.

4. CASH AND DUE FROM BANKS

The Corporation's banking subsidiaries are required to maintain reserve balances
with the Federal Reserve Bank. The average amount of those reserve balances for
the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 were approximately $421,000, and
$290,000, respectively.

At December 31, 1992, the other domestic investment securities category included
marketable equity securities of $33,344, which were carried at the aggregate of
their lower of cost or market in 1992. During 1991, the Corporation recorded
$24,589 of pre-tax losses for write-downs taken against these securities. These
write-downs reflected the amount of market value impairment in the portfolio
which management viewed to be due to other than temporary conditions. During
1992, the Corporation recorded pre-tax gains of $2,822 on sales of certain
domestic equity securities. At December 31, 1992, the market value of the
marketable equity securities portfolio exceeded its carrying value by $22,536.
As a result of the December 31, 1993 adoption of FAS 115, these marketable
equity securities are carried in the available-for-sale portfolio and have been
written up by $30,705, the aggregate of their December 31, 1993 fair values,
through an after-tax credit to retained earnings. The Corporation recorded pre-
tax gains of $12,848 on sales of certain domestic equity securities in 1993.
During 1993 and 1992, the Corporation recorded pre-tax gains of $8,617 and
$5,325 on sales of foreign equity securities.

At December 31, 1993 and 1992, there were no investments in securities of any
single, non-Federal issuer in excess of 10% of shareholders' equity.

Securities with a carrying value of $1,647,767 were pledged at December 31, 1993
to secure public deposits, trust deposits, and for certain other purposes as
required by law.

6. LOAN PORTFOLIO

For a breakdown of the loan portfolio by type of loan and for information on
non-performing loans, refer to Supplemental Financial Data under the captions
Loan Portfolio and Non-Performing Assets (pages 84 and 86).

The book value of real estate loans transferred to other real estate owned
during 1993, 1992 and 1991 was $38,672, $109,993 and $142,824 respectively.
Other real estate owned includes properties that the Corporation has acquired in
foreclosure or that has been determined to be "in substance" foreclosed.

At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the Corporation had loans totalling $147,381 and
$200,145, respectively, to its directors, officers and companies in which the
directors had a 10% or more voting interest. These loans were made on
substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral as those
prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with unrelated persons and do
not involve more than normal risk of collectibility. The 1993 additions and
reductions were $2,463,230 and $2,515,994, respectively.

In October 1991, the Corporation sold $1,017,989 of credit card receivables,
representing most of its out-of-region credit card portfolio. The sale resulted
in a net gain of $53,524 after $33,085 of income tax expense. The loans were
sold net of $27,486 of the allowance for loan losses and the gain also reflects
the write-off of $74,748 of intangible assets associated with the loans sold.

In May 1992, the Corporation sold the assets of Signal Financial Corp, a
consumer finance subsidiary, including approximately $300,000 of consumer
installment loans. The loans were sold net of $14,700 of the allowance for loan
losses. This transaction had an immaterial impact on the earnings of the
Corporation.

In September 1993, the Corporation sold five of its seven branches from the
Virgin Islands operations. The five branches had loans of $131,200 and deposits
of $228,800 at the time of sale. The Corporation recorded a pre-tax gain of
$11,000 on the sale. Also in 1993, the Corporation sold $207,000 of fixed-rate
home equity loans in two securitization transactions.

The weighted average discount rate used in determining the actuarial present
value of the projected benefit obligation for the Corporation was 7.0% and
8.0%, respectively, at December 31, 1993 and 1992. The discount rate used in
the Constellation plan was 7.0% and 9.0%, respectively, at December 31, 1993
and 1992. The rate of increase on future compensation levels used for both
plans was 5.0% to 6.0%. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets
for both plans was 8.5% to 9.5%.

The Corporation sponsors a savings plan for its employees. Contributions to the
savings plan for the employers' match were $12,763 in 1993, $12,303 in 1992, and
$12,326 in 1991.

The Corporation and its subsidiaries provide certain postretirement health care
and life insurance benefits for retired employees. The liability for these
postretirement benefits is unfunded. Postretirement benefits are provided
through an insurance company whose premiums are based on the benefits paid
during the year. The postretirement health care plan is contributory, with
retiree contributions based on years of service.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" ("FAS 106") was issued in December
1990 to establish the accounting for postretirement benefits. FAS 106 requires
that employers accrue the costs associated with providing postretirement
benefits during the active service periods of employees, rather than the
previously accepted accounting practice of recognizing these costs on a pay-as-
you-go basis.

Effective January 1, 1992, the Corporation adopted FAS 106. As permitted under
FAS 106, the Corporation elected to recognize immediately the transitional
postretirement benefit liability of $128,706, $84,946 after-tax or $.71 per
share, as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The impact
of FAS 106 on salaries, wages and benefits expense on the Consolidated Statement
of Income for the year ended December 31, 1992 versus the pay-as-you-go basis
was an increase of $9,288.

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year ended December 31, 1993
and 1992 included the following expense (income) components:

Net amortization and deferral................... 6
------- -------
Net periodic postretirement benefit cost........ $12,268 $13,571
======= =======
</TABLE>

The cost of providing postretirement benefits in 1991 was recognized by
expensing the annual insurance premiums, which were $4,179.

For measurement purposes, a 13% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost
of covered health care benefits was assumed for 1994; the rate was assumed to
decrease gradually to 10.5% for 1997 and remains at that level thereafter. For
measurement purposes, a fixed dollar amount was determined as the Corporation's
maximum contribution per employee. This fixed dollar amount was established at
the projected cost level for medical expenses in 1997. The health care cost
trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported. To
illustrate, increasing the assumed health care cost trend rates by 1 percentage
point in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation as of December 31, 1993 by $10,584 and the aggregate of the service
and interest cost components of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the
year then ended by $805.

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets was 8.5%. The weighted-
average discount rate used in determining the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation was 7.0% and 8.0%, respectively, at December 31, 1993 and 1992. The
discount rate used in the Constellation plan was 7.0% and 9.0%, respectively, at
December 31, 1993 and 1992.

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits" ("FAS 112") was issued in November 1992 to establish
accounting for benefits provided to former or inactive employees after
employment but before retirement. FAS 112 requires that employers accrue the
costs associated with providing benefits, such as salary and benefit
continuation under disability plans, when payment of the benefits is probable
and the amount of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Effective January
1, 1993, the Corporation adopted FAS 112. The Corporation recognized the January
1, 1993 FAS 112 transitional liability of $20,015, $13,010 after-tax or $0.10
per share, as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The
impact of FAS 112 on salaries, wages and benefits expense for the year ended
December 31, 1993 was not material.

13. LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN

The Corporation has outstanding options granted under the Corporation's long-
term incentive plan (Plan). As provided in the Plan, a variety of incentives
can be issued to eligible participants including restricted stock awards,
incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights,
performance units and cash awards. Constellation had maintained a similar plan.
Options granted under that plan were carried over into the Corporation's Plan 
upon consummation of the Constellation acquisition. Information on options 
for 1993 follows:

========== =========
</TABLE>

Options under the Plan are granted to purchase the Corporation's common shares
at market value on the date of grant and are exercisable one year from the date
of grant for a period not exceeding ten years. Stock appreciation rights may be
granted in conjunction with the granting of an option. Upon the exercise of
stock appreciation rights and the surrender of the related option, an employee
may receive in cash or common stock of the Corporation a value equal to the
difference between the market price at the date of exercise and the option price
of shares.

The assumed exercise of the options and other awards under the Plan did not have
a materially dilutive effect on the earnings per share in years 1991 through
1993.

The preceding option table does not reflect 280,190 performance unit awards
outstanding at December 31, 1993, 371,514 at December 31, 1992 and 481,836 at
December 31, 1991. Performance unit awards are earned subject to specific
performance of the Corporation over specified performance periods as defined in
the Plan. The payment value of each performance unit earned for the applicable
performance period is the fair market value of one share of common stock of the
Corporation based on the formula contained in the Plan. During 1993, 1992 and
1991, respectively, $1,051, $1,557 and $2,265 was expensed in connection with
performance unit awards.

14. OPERATING LEASES

Rental expense, reduced by sublease rental income, charged to operations was
$61,338, $60,163 and $61,874 for 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

In the normal course of business, there are outstanding commitments and
contingent liabilities which are not reflected in the financial statements.
These include various financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk used in
connection with the Corporation's asset and liability management and to provide
for the needs of customers. These involve varying degrees of credit, interest
rate and liquidity risk, but do not represent unusual risks for the Corporation
and management does not anticipate any significant losses as a result of these
transactions.

The following is a summary of significant commitments and contingent liabilities
as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, including fair values:

15. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES - (continued)

(a) Standby letters of credit (SBLC) are used in various transactions to enhance
the credit standing of the Corporation's customers and are subjected to the same
risk, credit review and approval process as loans. SBLC's are irrevocable
assurances that the Corporation will make payment in the event that a customer
cannot perform its contractual obligations to third parties.

(b) Commitments to extend credit represent the Corporation's obligation to fund
commercial and real estate loans, including home equity lines, lines of credit,
revolving lines of credit and other types of commitments.

(c) Exchange traded futures contracts and forward rate agreements represent
agreements to exchange dollar amounts at a specified future date for interest
rate differentials between an agreed interest rate and a reference rate,
computed on a notional amount. Credit and market risk exist with respect to
these instruments. Exchange traded futures contracts entail daily cash
settlement; therefore, the credit risk amount represents a one-day receivable.
Gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and amortized over the life of
the specific asset, liability or transaction hedged.

(d) Commitments to purchase foreign and U.S. currencies are primarily executed
for the needs of customers. These foreign exchange contracts are structured
similar to interest rate futures and forward contracts. The risk associated
with a foreign exchange contract arises from the counterparty's ability to make
payment at settlement and that the value of a foreign currency might change in
relation to the U.S. dollar. The Corporation's exposure, if any, to
counterparty failure equals the current market value of the contract. At
December 31, 1993 and 1992, the market value of the Corporation's foreign
exchange contracts which has been included in income was $1,160 and $2,543,
respectively.

(e) Interest rate swaps generally represent the contractual exchange of fixed
and variable rate interest payments based on a notional principal amount and an
interest reference rate. The differential between the fixed and variable rate
is included as interest income or expense of the asset or liability transaction
hedged. Credit and market rate risk exist with respect to these instruments.
The risk associated with interest rate swaps arises from the possible failure of
the counterparty to make required payments on those contracts which are
favorable to the Corporation. The Corporation's exposure to counterparty failure
equals the current replacement cost of the contract. At December 31, 1993 and
1992, the replacement cost of the Corporation's interest rate swap contracts was
$153,624 and $163,482, respectively. The risk of counterparty failure is
controlled by limiting transactions to an approved list of counterparties.

(f) Interest rate caps and floors are written by the Corporation to enable
customers to transfer, modify or reduce their interest rate risk. Interest rate
caps and floors are similar to interest rate swaps except that payments are made
only if current interest rates move above or below a predetermined rate. The
risk associated with interest rate caps and floors is an unfavorable change in
interest rates. As a writer of interest rate caps and floors, the Corporation
receives a premium in exchange for bearing the risk of an unfavorable change in
interest rates. The Corporation generally minimizes this risk by entering into
offsetting cap and floor positions that essentially counterbalance each other.

In the normal course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are
subject to numerous pending and threatened legal actions and proceedings, some
for which the relief or damages sought are substantial. Management and the
Corporation's legal counsel do not believe the outcome of these actions and
proceedings will have a materially adverse effect on the consolidated financial
position of the Corporation.

======== ========
</TABLE>

At December 31, 1993 cumulative deductible temporary differences are 
approximately $842 million and the related deferred asset is $295 million before
any valuation allowance. The major components include $394 million related to 
allowance for loan losses and $138 million related to post retirement benefits. 
Constellation has a federal net operating loss at December 31, 1993 which can be
carried forward and used to offset CoreStates future income. The benefit of the 
net operating loss is approximately $16 million. Cumulative taxable temporary 
differences related to deferred tax credits as of December 31, 1993 are 
estimated at $469 million are primarily related to leasing, fair value 
accounting, partnership investments and depreciation. The related deferred tax 
liability is $164 million. 

As required by FAS 109, the Corporation has determined that it is required to 
establish a valuation reserve for the deferred tax asset of $9 million related 
to Constellation's New Jersey income taxes. It is more likely than not that the 
deferred tax asset of $286 million will be principally realized through 
carryback to taxable income in prior years, and future reversals of existing 
taxable temporary differences, and to a lesser extent, future taxable income and
tax planning strategies. Management believes that future taxable income will be 
sufficient to realize the benefits of temporary deductible differences that 
cannot be realized through carryback to prior years or through the reversal of 
future temporary taxable differences. The Corporation's conclusion that it is 
"more likely than not" that the deferred tax asset will be realized is based on 
a history of growth in earnings and the prospects for continued growth including
an analysis of potential uncertainties that may affect future operating results.
The Corporation will continue to review the tax criteria of "more likely than 
not", for the recognition of deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis.

Foreign earnings of certain subsidiaries would be taxed only upon their transfer
to the United States. Accumulated earnings of insurance subsidiaries would be
taxed only to the extent they are distributed as dividends, or exceed limits
prescribed by tax laws. During 1993, earnings of a foreign subsidiary were
repatriated and a portion of insurance subsidiary previously untaxed earnings
became subject to tax. No further transfers or dividends are contemplated.
Taxes payable upon remittance of such accumulated earnings of $22,014 at
December 31, 1993 would approximate $7,306.

Taxes, other than income taxes, included in other operating expenses for the
years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 are $70,374, $69,655 and $62,876,

The approval of the Comptroller of the Currency is required for a nationally
chartered bank to pay dividends if the total of all dividends declared in any
calendar year exceeds the bank's net profits (as defined) for that year combined
with its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years. Under this
formula, CBNA, NJNB and CBD can declare dividends without approval of the
Comptroller of the Currency of approximately $151 million, $19 million and $1
million, respectively, plus an additional amount equal to CBNA's, NJNB's and
CBD's retained net profits for 1994 up to the date of any such dividend
declaration. CBD paid special dividends of $10 million in January 1992 and $25
million in September 1992. In addition, CBD paid $30 million as a return of
capital in January 1992. These payments had the prior approval of the
Comptroller of the Currency and resulted from CBD's lower capital requirements
after the October 1991 sale of credit card receivables (Note 6). Constellation
Bank has been prohibited from paying dividends since 1991 without the approval
of the Comptroller of the Currency and other regulatory agencies.

20. Joint Venture

On December 4, 1992, the Corporation entered into a joint venture with three
other banking companies creating Electronic Payment Services, Inc. ("EPS"). The
joint venture combines the partners' separate consumer electronic transaction
processing businesses and provides automated teller machine ("ATM") and
electronic point-of-sale ("POS") processing services.

The Corporation contributed to EPS its wholly-owned subsidiaries Money Access
Service Inc. ("MAC"), a regional ATM network, and BUYPASS Corporation, a third-
party processor of electronic POS transactions.

The Corporation has equal ownership with two partners in the joint venture, each
with 31%. The fourth partner owns 7%. As part of the transaction, the
Corporation received a cash payment of $79,350 and $245,400 of EPS 5% cumulative
redeemable preferred stock (additional dividends are tied to EPS performance).
The exchange of assets involved in the transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain to
the Corporation of $41,072, $25,670 after-tax, which was recorded in other
operating income for the year ended December 31, 1992. The exchange also
generated a deferred gain of approximately $136,000.

In December 1993, the Corporation and EPS mutually agreed to enter into a
recapitalization of EPS involving the EPS preferred stock held by the
Corporation. In exchange for substantially all of the preferred stock, the
Corporation received from EPS a ten-year 6.45% note providing for equal
principal payments over the life of the note. The recapitalization does not
affect the amount of deferred gain, but changes the timing of deferred gain
income recognition from a five-year period beginning in 1996 to a ten-year
period beginning in 1994.

EPS has announced the signing of definitive agreements providing for two
additional banking companies to enter the joint venture. The transactions are
expected to be completed in 1994. As a result of the addition of new partners,
the Corporation's share in earnings of EPS will decline from the current 31% to
an estimated 23%.

The Corporation's net investment in EPS, $69,436 at December 31, 1993, is
included in other assets.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Shareholders
CoreStates Financial Corp

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of CoreStates
Financial Corp as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the related consolidated
statements of income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We did not audit the financial statements of Constellation
Bancorp, which statements reflect total assets of 8.8% and 9.3% as of December
31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, and net interest income of 8.3%, 7.6% and
7.0% for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. Those
statements were audited by other auditors whose report, which has been
furnished to us, included an explanatory paragraph that explains that those
statements were restated to remove certain merger-related charges. Our opinion,
insofar as it relates to data included for Constellation Bancorp, is based
solely on the report of other auditors. 

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits and the report of other auditors provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of other auditors, the
financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of CoreStates Financial Corp at December 31,
1993 and 1992, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, in 1993 the Company 
changed its methods of accounting for certain investments in debt and equity 
securities and for postemployment benefits, and in 1992 the Company changed 
its methods of accounting for income taxes and for postretirement benefits 
other than pensions.

As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the accompanying 1993
financial statements have been restated to remove certain merger-related
charges.

Bancorp and subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The Financial Information for 1993 Has Been Restated Where Applicable 
(See Note 1) 

OVERVIEW

In August 1993, CoreStates Financial Corp ("CoreStates") entered into an
agreement to acquire Constellation Bancorp ("Constellation"), a bank holding
company with $2.3 billion in assets. On March 16, 1994, CoreStates consummated
its acquisition of Constellation and has accounted for this transaction as a
pooling of interests. The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations have been revised to include
Constellation for 1993 and all other periods presented. 

The accompanying financial information as of and for the year ended December 31,
1993 has been restated to reflect merger-related charges of $127.8 million 
after-tax, or $.89 per share, related to the Constellation acquisition in the 
first quarter of 1994, rather than in the fourth quarter of 1993 as previously 
reported. This restatement was made after discussions with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission staff which resulted in these charges being reflected in the
quarter that the acquisition was consummated. The restatement has no effect on 
CoreStates' basic operating results, excluding the one-time merger-related 
charges. On a pre-tax basis, the merger-related charges consisted of a $120.0 
million provision for loan losses, a $28.0 million addition to the OREO reserve,
$13.0 million for the writedown of purchased mortgage servicing rights and 
related assets, and $34.0 million for expenses directly attributable to the 
Constellation acquisition. 

Income for 1993, before the cumulative affect of a change in accounting
principle, was $339.5 million, or $2.64 per share, reflecting growth of 21% on a
per share basis when compared to $261.0 million, or $2.19 per share for 1992.
Key performance measures improved during 1993 and are among the highest in the
banking industry. Returns on average equity and assets were 17.09% and 1.35%
respectively, in 1993, compared to 14.98% and 1.05%, respectively in 1992. The
1993 Montgomery Securities Regional Bank Composites for returns on average
equity and assets were 15.49% and 1.21%, respectively.

CORESTATES FINANCIAL CORP AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW - continued

On a business line basis, CoreStates' 1993 earnings improvement reflects
the strong growth achieved by the Wholesale Banking business, as net income
increased $45.3 million, or 35.4% for that business. Wholesale Banking
experienced a 12.0% increase in net interest income due primarily to substantial
reductions in non-performing assets (this excludes Constellation which is
treated as a separate line of business), higher average loan balances and wider
interest spreads on prime based loans. Wholesale Banking's non-interest income
increased by 14.3%, mostly due to growth in service charges on deposits and fees
for international services. For a more detailed analysis of the performance of
Wholesale Banking and CoreStates' other business lines, refer to the Business
Line Results section beginning on page 46.

CoreStates' income statements in 1993 and 1992 reflect the adoption of two
new accounting standards. Effective January 1, 1993, CoreStates adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits" ("FAS 112"). FAS 112 requires that employers accrue
the costs associated with providing benefits, such as salary and benefit
continuation under disability plans, when payment of the benefits is probable
and the amount of the obligation can be reasonably estimated. CoreStates
recognized the January 1, 1993 FAS 112 transitional liability of $20.0 million,
$13.0 million after-tax or $.10 per share, as the cumulative effect of a change
in accounting principle in 1993.

In the prior year, CoreStates adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions" ("FAS 106") effective January 1, 1992. FAS 106 requires that
employers accrue the costs associated with providing postretirement benefits
during the active service periods of employees. CoreStates recognized the
January 1, 1992 transitional liability of $128.7 million, $84.9 million after-
tax or $.71 per share, as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle in 1992.

OVERVIEW - continued

Comparison of 1992 to 1991

The comparability of CoreStates' 1992 reported revenues and expenses to 1991
was impacted by strategic actions occurring in those years. These actions
included the October 1991 sale of approximately $1 billion of credit card
receivables and the May 1992 sale of approximately $300 million of consumer
installment loans. These two actions were responsible for the 2.8% year-to-year
decline in net interest income in 1992 and approximately $60 million of the
$143.3 million, or 52.6%, decline in the loan loss provision in 1992. From an
operating earnings standpoint, the related business lines (Credit Card and
Consumer Finance) experienced a $14.0 million after-tax earnings decline in 1992
that was principally attributable to these asset sales. Most of the remaining
decline in the 1992 loan loss provision was due to the $72.0 million reduction
at Constellation. Strong performances in the Wholesale and Community Banking
businesses in 1992 more than offset this unfavorable impact. Also impacting
1992 to 1991 comparability was the adoption of FAS 106 which reduced 1992
operating earnings by $9.3 million, or $.08 per share.

Although total 1992 and 1991 year-to-year non-interest income and non-
financial expenses were essentially level, there was significant growth in
Wholesale Banking non-interest income which was obscured by large gains: in 1991
from the sale of credit card receivables and in 1992 from the EPS transaction.
Non-financial expenses in both years also included significant and unusual
expenses that substantially offset those gains.

Non-performing Assets

Non-performing assets at December 31, 1993 totalled $400.6 million, a decline
of $217.1 million, or 35.1% from December 31, 1992. The decrease in non-
performing assets as compared to the level at December 31, 1992 was principally
in non-performing real estate assets which were down $168.1 million, or 36.8%
from year-end 1992. Non-performing assets in the commercial portfolio also
declined $43.2 million, or 28.2% from year-end 1992. At December 31, 1993 the
allowance for loan losses at $417.8 million was 148.6% of non-performing loans.
This compares to $407.6 million and 92.4% at December 31, 1992.

STRATEGIC ACTIONS IN 1993

Acquisitions

On December 17, 1993, CoreStates purchased Inter Community Bancorp ("Inter
Community"), a New Jersey bank holding company with $133 million in assets and
$110 million in deposits. The four Inter Community branches acquired were merged
into CoreStates' New Jersey National Bank ("NJNB") subsidiary providing added
presence in an important marketplace and a strategic complement to NJNB's
growing middle market business. As a result of this acquisition, 640 thousand
CoreStates' common shares were issued out of treasury. The transaction has a
total value of approximately $17 million.

On March 16, 1994, CoreStates acquired Constellation Bancorp
("Constellation"), a New Jersey bank holding company with $2.3 billion in assets
and $2.1 billion in deposits. As a result of this transaction, approximately
11.3 million new shares of CoreStates' common stock were issued. The transaction
had a total value of approximately $300 million and was accounted for as a
pooling of interests. 

The Constellation acquisition is expected to add to CoreStates' earnings per
share in the second year following closing. CoreStates expects to reduce
operating costs by approximately one-third of Constellation's non-financial
expenses through operations and branch consolidations and support staff
efficiencies. Constellation's bank subsidiary is being merged into NJNB on 
April 29, 1994. 

The acquisition of Constellation with its 49 branches in northern and central
New Jersey is highly complementary to the branch network and businesses of NJNB,
and the combined bank will be the fourth largest in New Jersey with more than $6
billion in assets. The acquisition creates the strength of presence CoreStates
considers necessary in the strategically important commercial and industrial
middle region of New Jersey.

STRATEGIC ACTIONS IN 1993 - continued

In November 1993, CoreStates announced a definitive agreement to acquire
Independence Bancorp, Inc. ("Independence"), a $2.6 billion Pennsylvania bank
holding company, in a transaction expected to be accounted for as a pooling of
interests. Assuming approval by regulators and by Independence's shareholders,
the transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 1994. As a result
of this transaction, approximately 16.6 million new shares of CoreStates' common
stock will be issued with a total value of approximately $430 million based on
the year-end stock price.

The 54 branches of Independence's four Pennsylvania bank subsidiaries will be
legally merged into CoreStates' lead banking subsidiary, CoreStates Bank, N.A.
This in-market acquisition is expected to result in significant operating
efficiencies, and after first year charges of approximately $30 million for
CoreStates' planned strategic initiatives regarding Independence's problem
assets and approximately $24 million for closing and consolidation costs, is
expected to add to earnings per share in the second year following the 
acquisition.

In March 1994, CoreStates announced a definitive agreement to acquire
Germantown Savings Bank ("GSB"), a $1.6 billion Pennsylvania chartered stock
savings bank. The transaction has a total value of approximately $260 million,
of which 55% will be paid in CoreStates common stock and 45% will be paid in
cash, and will be accounted for as a purchase creating an intangible of
approximately $141 million. CoreStates plans to purchase in the market 100% of
the shares to be issued. The transaction is expected to close late in the
third quarter of 1994, assuming approval by regulators and GSB shareholders.

The 32 branches of GSB will be legally merged into CoreStates' lead banking
subsidiary, CoreStates Bank, N.A. This in-market acquisition is expected to
result in signficant operating efficiencies, and is expected to add to
earnings per share in the second year following the acquisition.

In December 1993, the Corporation announced a definitive agreement to purchase
the privately held Rittenhouse Financial Services, Inc. and the $35 million 
asset Rittenhouse Trust Company. That agreement was terminated on June 8, 1994 
by mutual consent. 

Major Initiatives

In September 1993, CoreStates formed a new transaction services business named
"Transys". Transys is a stand-alone business and includes 1,100 of staff
previously employed in CoreStates' check processing operations. Transys
provides banks and other financial institutions with a full range of check
processing, electronic check presentment and related payment services. This
initiative was undertaken to build on CoreStates' position as a leading provider
of third-party payment processing services and as a response to the emerging
trend among banking institutions to outsource services that are undifferentiated
by customers, but which will require significant investments in technology.
Transys is expected to have the technological and operational base to lead its
customers in the transition from paper to electronic processing.

STRATEGIC ACTIONS IN 1993 - continued

A related initiative was the November 1993 formation of Synapsys, Inc.
("Synapsys"), a new subsidiary offering credit card and merchant processing
services, another area where the industry trend has been to outsource. Synapsys
will also serve as one of three development sites for VISA U.S.A. for next-
generation, third-party card processing services for commercial card issuers.

Both Transys and Synapsys are part of CoreStates' ongoing strategy to provide
sophisticated processing to other banks and financial institutions.

In August 1993, CoreStates' formerly Pennsylvania state-chartered Hamilton
Bank subsidiary was merged into CoreStates Bank, N.A. This action has improved
operating efficiencies and customer convenience in the Pennsylvania branch
banking business. The Hamilton unit is managed as a division of the lead bank
and will continue to be marketed as CoreStates Hamilton Bank in central
Pennsylvania.

Divestitures

On September 30, 1993, CoreStates concluded its sale of five branches from
its Virgin Islands operations to Banco Popular de Puerto Rico. The five
branches had loans of $131.2 million and deposits of $228.8 million on
September 30, 1993. CoreStates recorded a pre-tax gain of $11.0 million on the
sale. On April 22, 1994, CoreStates executed a purchase and assumption
agreement for the sale of its remaining banking operations in the Virgin
Islands. The Virgin Island branches are in markets well beyond CoreStates'
core consumer strategy.

In May 1993, CoreStates completed the sale of its Australian merchant banking
unit, PNB Australia Limited. Based in Sydney, PNB Australia Limited had $70
million in assets. The merchant bank was not of a strategic size and its
business mix was not consistent with CoreStates' international strategy.

BUSINESS LINE RESULTS

CoreStates utilizes a value-based reporting methodology to facilitate
management's analysis of performance by defined business lines. This process
supports CoreStates' strategic objective of creating superior growth in
shareholder value by focusing on the performance and value creation potential of
CoreStates' component businesses.

This section of management's discussion and analysis presents the performance
results of CoreStates' four core businesses: Wholesale Banking; Consumer
Financial Services; Trust and Investment Management; and Electronic Payment
Services. Each core business is comprised of well-defined business lines with
market or product specific missions. For the current reporting period,
Constellation is shown as a separate entity. During 1994, as the new company is
fully integrated into CoreStates, the respective business components of
Constellation will be blended into the existing business lines. It is expected
that there will be a one to two quarter transition period following each
acquisition prior to when complete business line reporting can be established.
During the transition period, a new acquisition will be reported separately from
the existing lines of business.

Corporate overhead, processing and support costs are allocated along
with the impact of balance sheet management and hedging activities of
CoreStates. A matched maturity transfer pricing system is used to allocate
interest income and interest expense. The loan loss provision and allowance for
loan losses are allocated based on an expected normalized credit environment.
All business lines in the four core businesses are allocated equity utilizing
regulatory risk-based capital guidelines as well as each business line's fixed
assets and other capital investment requirements. Intangible assets and
associated costs are also allocated to relevant business units. The development
of these allocation methodologies is a continuous process at CoreStates. 

The Corporate category includes the income and expense impact of unallocated
equity; unallocated loan loss reserves and provision; unusual or non-recurring
items not attributable to the operating activities of the four major business
areas; emerging business activities not directly related to the four major
business areas; and miscellaneous items.

BUSINESS LINE RESULTS - continued

Wholesale Banking is organized into six business lines: Corporate and
Institutional Banking; Investment Banking; Cash Management; International
Banking; Corporate Middle Market; and Specialized Finance. Wholesale Banking
continued its strong performance in 1993 as net income increased $45.3 million,
or 35.4% above 1992. This increase was due primarily to growth in net interest
income and non-interest income. Net-interest income was $58.6 million, or 12.0%
above 1992 due to lower levels of non-performing loans, cash basis interest
received on non-performing loans, higher loan and factoring volume and wider
spreads on prime based loans. Average non-performing loans declined 27.7% from
prior year. Average loan outstandings increased 4.9% from 1992. Fees
recognized on loans were also well above 1992 principally resulting from loan
prepayments due to the low interest rate environment. Non-interest income was
14.3% above 1992 as continued emphasis on Cash Management products resulted in
substantial year-to-year growth in both service charges on deposits and fees for
international services. An increase in securities gains also contributed to the
year-to-year growth.

Consumer Financial Services includes the Community Banking and Specialty
Products business lines. Specialty Products includes Credit Card, Student
Lending and Residential Mortgage. Community Banking's 1993 results include the
Virgin Islands operations center and five branches until their sale on September
30, 1993.

Total net income for Consumer Financial Services of $94.2 million in 1993
was $5.0 million or 5.6% above 1992. This increase was primarily the result of
significant net interest income growth in the credit card portfolio, strong non-
interest income performance in Community Banking, and management's continued
emphasis on cost control throughout the Group. Net interest income declined
$7.4 million or 1.4% in 1993, reflecting the May 1992 sale of Signal Financial,
a $300 million consumer finance subsidiary, and the sale of the Virgin Islands
branches in September 1993. Excluding these transactions, net interest income
increased by $6.5 million, including growth of 14.0% in credit card interest,
partially offset by a declining net interest margin in Community Banking. The
Community Banking margin continued to reflect the impact of deposit spread
compression in a sustained low interest rate environment in 1993. Average loan
volumes decreased 3.6% from 1992, primarily as a result of the two sale
transactions and the securitization of $207 million in home equity loans during
1993. Average deposit volumes declined 2.1% compared to 1992, as consumers
continue to shift out of certificates of deposits and into more liquid bank
deposit products, as well as into higher yielding non-bank investment products.
The loan loss provision for 1993 decreased $4.1 million or 7.9%, a direct impact
of the decline in loan volumes. Non-interest income reflected strong growth of
$16.4 million, or 16.7%, above 1992. Service charges on deposits in Community
Banking increased 14.2% compared to 1992, as ongoing emphasis is placed on fee
income generation. Additionally, loan securitizations also produced significant
fee income for Community Banking in 1993. The 1993 results also reflect
revenues from introducing sales of annuities and mutual funds by a third party
through the CoreStates branch network. Non-financial expenses of the Group grew
by $4.1 million or .9% in 1993. On a normalized basis, excluding the impact of
the Signal and Virgin Island sales, non-financial expenses increased 3.3% as
management's cost control efforts continued.

BUSINESS LINE RESULTS - continued

Trust and Investment Management is organized into four business lines:
Institutional Trust; Personal Trust; Private Banking; and Investment Management.
Net income of $10.9 million was down $.2 million from 1992. The slight decline
in net income was due to 4.3% growth in non-financial expenses, which was
partially offset by 4.5% growth in non-interest income. Net interest income was
flat year-to-year. Lower earnings on demand balances due to the low interest
rate environment was the primary factor for net interest income of $29.9 million
being level with 1992. Non-interest income growth was due principally to growth
in Personal Trust, Investment Services and Employee Benefit fees. Asset growth
in the CoreFund family of Mutual funds was 10.6% over 1992 contributing most of
the fee growth in Investment Services. Growth in trust fees, the largest
component of non-interest income, was hampered by lower than anticipated new
business, the continued low interest rate environment, and the loss of several
large Institutional Custody/Securities Lending relationships in 1992.

Electronic Payment Services includes the MAC automated teller machine
("ATM") network and POS processing business lines. On December 4, 1992, the MAC
and POS business lines were contributed to Electronic Payment Services, Inc.
("EPS"), a joint venture that combines the separate consumer electronic
transaction processing businesses of CoreStates, Banc One Corporation, PNC
Financial Corp and Society Corporation into the nation's leading provider of ATM
and POS processing services.

EPS has announced the signing of definitive agreements providing for two
additional banking companies to enter the joint venture. The transactions will
significantly expand the MAC network and POS business volume and are expected to
be completed in 1994. As a result of the addition of new partners, CoreStates'
share in earnings of EPS will decline from the current 31% to an estimated 23%.

Full year 1993 net income totaled $8.2 million versus $2.0 million for 1992.
The 1992 results include MAC and POS as a CoreStates business group through
December 4, 1992 and earnings from EPS for the remainder of the year. The
results for 1993 include income from CoreStates' 31% equity interest in the
earnings of the EPS joint venture and dividends on EPS preferred stock, 80% of
which is tax free, partially offset by an interest carrying charge on the net
investment in EPS.

In December 1993, CoreStates and EPS mutually agreed to enter into a
recapitalization of EPS involving the EPS preferred stock held by CoreStates.
In exchange for substantially all of the preferred stock, CoreStates received
from EPS a ten-year 6.45% note providing for equal principal payments over the
life of the note. The recapitalization does not affect the amount of deferred
gain, but changes the timing of deferred gain income recognition from a five-
year period beginning in 1996 to a ten-year period beginning in 1994.

BUSINESS LINE RESULTS - continued

Constellation net income in 1993 was $11.6 million as compared to a
loss of $1.4 million in 1992. The increase was primarily due to a $14.2 million
increase in net interest income and a $3.8 million decline in non-financial
expenses. The primary reason for the improvement in net interest income was due
to the earnings on new capital, a more rapid decline in average rates on
interest bearing liabilities than on interest earning assets, a lower level of
non-performing assets and the extinguishment of Constellation's high cost debt.
The decrease in non-financial expenses was primarily the result of lower
salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy expense, furniture and equipment
expense, and amortization of purchased assets partially offset by higher legal
and non-performing asset related expenses. 

The Corporate Category's net income increased $9.2 million in 1993. This
category included unusual gains for both 1993 and 1992. In 1992 a $41.1 million
pre-tax gain was recorded for the EPS transaction and 1993 includes pre-tax
gains of $11.0 million on the sale of five branches in the Virgin Islands and
$9.1 million on prepayments of long-term debt, and securities gains of $8.6
million. Additionally, there were significant expenses recorded in each year
that substantially offset those gains. The loan loss provision in the corporate
category was $17.1 million lower than 1992 due to the reduction in the overall
corporate provision levels. The provision reduction was not allocated to the
core businesses where the loan loss provision is based on a normalized credit
environment. The increase in net interest income in the corporate category was
largely due to the impact of an increase in unallocated average equity, which
has grown year-to-year by $272 million.

CAPITAL STRENGTH

Capital strength must be evaluated in the context of business risk
exposures, including asset quality, interest sensitivity, liquidity and earnings
diversification. CoreStates places a significant emphasis on the maintenance of
strong capital which promotes investor confidence, helps provide access to the
credit markets under favorable terms and enhances the flexibility to capitalize
on business growth and acquisition opportunities. Capital is managed for each of
the CoreStates' subsidiaries based on their respective risks and growth
opportunities, as well as regulatory requirements. CoreStates is positioned to
take advantage of market opportunities to strengthen capital. A shelf
registration is in place for fine tuning the debt structure and adding debt,
preferred or convertible preferred equity, if and when appropriate. The relative
strength of CoreStates' capital is reflected in the table "Average Common
Equity/Assets".

* The Montgomery Securities Regional Bank Composite

At December 31, 1993, common shareholders' equity totaled $2,162 million or
8.3% of total assets, compared with $1,890 million or 7.2% at year-end 1992.
The year-end 1993 equity to assets ratio for the Montgomery Securities Regional
Bank Composite was 7.2%. CoreStates has achieved steady internal capital
generation throughout the past five years. Common shareholders' equity
increased over the five years ended December 31, 1993 at a compound annual
growth rate of 5.9%, while dividends paid increased at a compound annual growth
rate of 8.2%. 

During 1993, CoreStates increased its quarterly dividend by 8.0% to $.27 per
share beginning January 1993, and again by 11.1% to $.30 per share beginning in
October 1993. CoreStates' dividend on its common stock was $1.14 per share in
1993 and $1.02 per share in 1992. The common dividend payout ratio was 69.1%
for 1993, compared to 46.6% for 1992.

On August 17, 1993 the Board of Directors approved a two-for-one common
stock split effected in the form of a 100% stock dividend ("the Stock
Dividend"). The additional shares resulting from the Stock Dividend were
distributed on October 15, 1993 to holders of record on September 15, 1993. All
common shares and per common share data have been restated for the impact of the
Stock Dividend.

CoreStates and its bank subsidiaries are subject to minimum risk-based and
leverage capital guidelines issued by the Federal Reserve Board and Comptroller
of the Currency. The measurement of risk-based capital takes into account the
credit risk of both balance sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures. These
guidelines require minimum risk-based capital ratios of 4% for Tier 1 capital
and 8% for total capital. In addition, a minimum leverage ratio of Tier 1
capital to quarterly average total assets of 3% is required for banking
organizations that are rated as strong. The following table illustrates
CoreStates' risk-based and leverage capital ratios at December 31, 1993 and
1992:

ASSET QUALITY

Risk Management

CoreStates manages asset quality and credit risk by maintaining
diversification in its loan portfolio and through intensive review processes
that include careful analysis of credit requests and ongoing examination of
outstandings and delinquencies, with particular attention to portfolio dynamics.
CoreStates strives to identify loans experiencing difficulty early enough to
correct the problems, to recognize non-performing loans early, to record charge-
offs promptly based on realistic assessments of current collateral values, and
to maintain reserves that are strong.

CoreStates' credit culture has served it well during economic downturns and,
while asset quality was impacted by the recent extended recession, it has
steadily improved over the past six quarters and remains strong relative to its
peers. This same well- developed and ingrained credit culture that has evolved
over the past decade will serve CoreStates well in the emerging economic growth
environment and for the next inevitable recession. This credit culture has as a
cornerstone a team approach that includes well- trained relationship managers
supported by: 1) a group of Credit Officers with significant lending experience
who have demonstrated the highest level of credit judgment and who have no
direct business development or profit responsibility; 2) a credit management
process that requires early and broad communication of and action on
deteriorating credits, as well as regular, formal, detailed evaluations and
projections of non-performing assets and potential losses; and 3) formal
guidance through the loan quality committee process in which all criticized
credits, all deteriorating credits and other credits with specified risk
characteristics are reviewed and addressed by all levels involved in the credit
process up through senior management on a regular basis. The team approach and
successful use of Credit Officers in CoreStates' Wholesale Banking line of
business have been extended into other areas including Trust, Community Banking
and Asset and Liability Management.

The above process allows CoreStates to make timely credit decisions, to know
the customers' needs and evaluate closely all aspects of their businesses,
keeping negotiating and structuring close to the customer. It allows for the
early detection and reporting of credit problems, which is key to CoreStates'
historically high levels of asset quality. Also, the mixing of experienced and
less experienced bankers provides excellent training and mentoring, important
components of our overall management approach.

Underlying CoreStates' credit culture are well tested and defined credit
policies and procedures. Approved at the holding company level by the
CoreStates Credit Policy Office in concert with each bank's Chief Lending
Office, these policies set underwriting standards, approval procedures, limits
on exposure by borrower and by industry and such other limits as currently
deemed prudent. The credit process is designed to make approval of
straightforward credits relatively simple through a dual approval matrix system,
but to increase the degree of involvement by experienced approvers as the credit
becomes more complex. Some examples of complexities that require sign-offs
beyond the dual approval matrix system include: large dollar concentrations,
highly leveraged transactions, tenors beyond policy, lower rated credits and
loans to customers with specialty characteristics.

ASSET QUALITY - continued

In addition to the management of credit risk, CoreStates manages and
controls operating and fraud risks in all of its substantive transactional
products through its Transactional Products Exposure Committee ("TPEC"). It is
the role of this committee to review and assign risk levels to all significant
new products prior to their implementation. In addition, reviews of substantial
changes to existing products and regular reviews of the product array offered to
customers are part of TPEC's responsibilities. The products reviewed by TPEC
include products from CoreStates' normal operating services as well as those
arising from Cash Management, Trust and Community Banking services. Through a
predetermined risk matrix approach, all products are rated and assigned risk
levels. Each product manager is responsible for acting on risk reduction
recommendations issued by TPEC. By focusing on the transactional risk in all of
its products, TPEC serves as one element in the overall risk management process
at CoreStates.

Credit quality and the effectiveness of portfolio management are
independently and systematically assessed by Credit Review, which reports to the
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Both its credit rating and process
evaluation techniques are consistent with regulatory standards. Because
CoreStates considers risk oversight to be an essential element for long-term
financial stability, in 1994 CoreStates will more cohesively define its overall
risk profile by applying its various well-developed risk analysis approaches to
all risk areas within the corporation.

Loan Portfolio

Wholesale Loans - CoreStates has traditionally maintained limits on
industry, market and borrower concentrations as a way to diversify and manage
credit risk. Management's current policy is to limit industry concentrations to
50% of total equity and to limit market segment concentrations to 10% of total
assets. CoreStates conservatively manages industry concentrations by applying
these dollar limits to a family of industries that have common risk
characteristics. This management process is reflected in the following table,
which illustrates each industry that exceeds 10% of total shareholders' equity.
CoreStates' largest concentration is in the non-bank finance industry at 38.6%
of total equity.

The following discussion highlights specific portfolios that are of interest
in the current environment. The discussion focuses on three wholesale
portfolios: communications because of its size; healthcare because of the high
profile of this industry; and the commercial finance portfolio at a CoreStates
non-bank subsidiary, Congress Financial Corp ("Congress"), because of the recent
growth in this portfolio.

Communications - The communications/media lending activities are in
industries which are either regulated by the Federal Communications Commission
and/or derive some or all of their revenues from advertising. These industries,
which include Cable Television, Telephone, Newspapers, Broadcasting and
Cellular, are typically financed based on the cash flows available to repay
debt, with less focus on tangible balance sheets. The underlying basis for this
focus is the intangible franchise value of the business which generally exceeds
the cost of establishing the business. Significant and rapid technological,
regulatory and competitive changes are occurring in the communications segments
of these businesses which our specialized lenders are closely monitoring. Risks
are further mitigated through exposures to generally large, often diversified
and highly experienced operators, and conservative debt structures. Three of the
specialized portfolios in this industry, Cable Television, Broadcasting and
Cellular, are highlighted below. Exposures in these industries are managed
within clearly defined parameters regarding total exposure and acceptable tenors
/maturities.

(1) Does not include $68 million at December 31, 1993 and $56 million at
December 31, 1992 outstanding to diversified companies that have cable
and broadcasting in their mix of businesses.

Healthcare - The specialized healthcare lending activities are to healthcare
providers which are heavily dependent upon third-party reimbursement for their
revenue base. Two of the subsegments of the industry are the acute care
(hospital) sector and the alternate site care sector (rehabilitation, subacute,
psychiatric, oncology, etc.). Financing typically supports working capital
requirements caused by delays in third-party payments, medium-term financing for
the acquisition of equipment and/or merger activity. The industry operates in a
highly regulated environment and is currently undergoing significant reform.
Our analysis focuses on several key indicators as predictors for success in this
evolving industry: management's ability to identify and operate profitably
within particular market niches, stable and growing market share, diversified
and strong payor mix. The financial analysis emphasizes strong and steady cash
flow and conservative leverage. The changing nature of this industry requires
close monitoring which includes ongoing analysis of reimbursement by subsegment
and geography, assessment of management and their respective strategies and
collateral valuations.

Commercial Finance - The loan portfolio at Congress grew approximately 25%
on a year-to- year basis through December 31, 1993. The credit quality of loans
generated during this period is consistent with past performance and reflects
what would be expected from a high quality commercial finance company. During
this period there were unusual market opportunities arising from the constraints
and restrictive lending policies in the commercial banking system and the ever
increasing nationwide reputation of Congress as a highly expert asset based
lender able to structure and syndicate both large and complex transactions. The
new business origination was geographically diverse, represented no particular
industry concentrations and continued the historical collateral characteristics
of the portfolio with its heavy emphasis on working assets such as accounts
receivable and inventory.

Real Estate Loans - Although improving over the prior three years, the
CoreStates regional real estate market continues to present a mixed picture as
it emerges from a severe recession. The residential market has achieved
supply/demand balance; marginal developers have been removed and low interest
rates have created sales activity. However, the commercial and industrial
market remains fundamentally weak, although there has been some increased
interest from the investor market.

Total real estate related loans outstanding were $5,648 million at December
31, 1993, compared to $6,050 million at December 31, 1992. Included within the
broad classification of real estate loans are a number of different lending
categories with distinctly different risk factors and performance. The
construction and development loan portfolio was $327 million or 1.8% of total
loans at December 31, 1993. Currently, 5.8% of CoreStates' construction and
development loan portfolio is non-performing, compared to 2.8% for the remaining
real estate loan portfolio. The table below summarizes CoreStates' real estate
loans outstanding.

category, primarily commercial loans collateralized by owner-occupied real
estate, accounted for 30.7% of total real estate loans and 9.6% of total loans.

The remaining category of real estate loans, totaling $1,063 million at
December 31, 1993, is comprised of completed projects and investment properties.

Net charge-offs of construction and development loans in 1993 were $7 million

Allowance for Loan Losses

In 1993, CoreStates refined its methodology for determining appropriate
levels of allowance for loan losses ("ALLL"). Each subsidiary of CoreStates
which extends credit maintains an allowance sufficient to absorb the anticipated
loss inherent in its credit portfolio for a minimal one-year horizon. Factors
included in management's determination of an adequate level of ALLL are a
statistical analysis of historical loss levels throughout an economic cycle and
one year of projected charge-offs, creating a band, below which a bank's ALLL is
considered inadequate and above which is considered inappropriate. A quarterly
evaluation of loss potential on specific credits, products, industries,
portfolios and markets as well as indicators for loan growth, the economic
environment and concentrations assist in validating the position of the ALLL
within the band. Management's evaluation of the adequacy of the ALLL is
independently tested by Credit Review. CoreStates believes that the ALLL is an
important source of protection against problems in the portfolio. Equally
important is the prompt recognition of problem situations and prompt write-downs
of these assets to net realizable value. Accordingly, over an economic cycle,
CoreStates has experienced relatively high levels of recoveries against these
write-downs compared to other banking companies.

The year-end 1993 allowance for loan losses totaled $417.8 million and
represented 2.3% of loans. This compares with a loan loss allowance at year-end
1992 of $407.6 million, or 2.4% of loans. The allowance for loan losses at
year-end 1993 was 148.6% of non-performing loans, an increase over the year-end
1992 coverage ratio of 92.4% and a reflection of the lower level of non-
performing loans at year-end 1993 and reduced net loan charge-offs during 1993.

CoreStates' total provision for loan losses in 1993 was $110.0 million, a 
decrease of $19.3 million from the $129.3 million provided in 1992. Subsequent
to the March 16, 1994 consummation of the Constellation acquisition,
Constellation recorded a $120.0 million provision for loan losses in the first
quarter of 1994 in connection with a change in strategy related to problem
assets and to conform its consumer lending charge-off policies to those of
CoreStates. Net charge-offs in 1993, excluding net LDC recoveries of $12.6
million, were $114.9 million or .7% of related average loans. This represents a
decrease of $51.5 million when compared to the $166.4 million of net charge-offs
excluding $13.1 million LDC recoveries in 1992. 

The following table reflects the distribution of 1993 and 1992 net charge-

Non-Performing Assets

Non-performing assets at year-end 1993 were $400.6 million, or 2.2% of total
loans plus other real estate owned ("OREO") and 1.5% of total assets. These
levels compared to total non-performing assets at year-end 1992 of $617.7
million, 3.5% of total loans plus OREO and 2.4% of total assets. Management
expects a continuing decline in non-performing asset levels during 1994 for
current CoreStates' banks. However, with planned acquisitions, CoreStates
anticipates increases in both non-performing assets and charge-offs (refer to
the Strategic Actions section beginning on page 42). 

At year-end 1993, total non-performing assets were comprised of $226.3
million of non-accrual loans, $54.9 million of renegotiated loans and $119.4
million of OREO. The $217.1 million, or 35.1%, decline in total non-performing
assets as compared to year-end 1992 was principally experienced in CoreStates'
two largest portfolios, the commercial loan portfolio, declining $43.2 million,
or 28.2%, and the real estate portfolio which declined $168.1 million, or 36.8%.
During 1993, loans aggregating $227 million were added to non-performing status,
payments of $218 million against non-performing assets were received, loans
totaling $81 million were returned to full accrual status and $145 million of
non-performing assets were charged off. 

CoreStates monitors the movements within the non-performing portfolio
closely. The following table illustrates the components of the quarterly changes
for 1993 and 1992:

well secured and in the process of collection.

In May 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
of a Loan" ("FAS 114"). FAS 114 addresses accounting for impairment of certain
loans and requires that impaired loans within the scope of FAS 114 be measured
based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan's
effective interest rate, or be measured at the loan's observable market price or
the fair value of its collateral. FAS 114 is effective beginning in 1995. The
impact that FAS 114 will have on CoreStates' future results of operations cannot
be estimated with certainty at the current time. However, the adoption of FAS
114 is not expected to have a material impact on CoreStates' level of allowance
for loan losses.

ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT

CoreStates manages its balance sheet to achieve maximum shareholder value
within the constraints of a conservative interest rate risk discipline, the
maintenance of high credit quality, and sound leverage and liquidity positions.
CoreStates' asset and liability management is centralized and individual
subsidiaries are managed within the context of overall corporate policies.

Interest Rate Risk Management - Interest rate risk refers to potential
changes in current and future net interest income resulting from changes in
interest rates, product spreads and mismatches in the repricing between interest
rate sensitive assets and liabilities. CoreStates' management emphasizes stable
net interest income throughout rate cycles, with the result that intermediate
and longer term considerations take precedence over short-term profitability.
This commitment is evidenced by the stability and strength of CoreStates' net
interest margin over time, despite significant changes in economic conditions,
competition and interest rates. CoreStates' net interest margin has remained
consistently above industry averages over the last five years as illustrated in
the table "Net Interest Margin".

At CoreStates, measurement of interest rate risk focuses on potential
changes in net interest income identified through computer simulations against
both rising and falling interest rates. Longer term repricing risks are measured
and controlled through gap analysis. All measurements of interest rate risk
include the impact of off-balance sheet activities. Under CoreStates' policy,
rate changes of at least 200 basis points over a six-month period are simulated
with rate related negative net interest income volatility over a twelve-month
horizon limited to 4% of shareholders' equity. Included in these simulations are
all contractual repricing risks, the impact of prepayments in the loan and
securities portfolios, potential spread and volume changes on consumer deposits
and fluctuations in the value of non-interest bearing funding sources.
CoreStates believes that the spread between the prime rate and financial market
rates is a function of both interest rates and credit conditions. While changes
in the prime spread are included in simulations, only that portion believed to
be interest rate related is subject to the policy guidelines.

As a matter of practice, positions are generally managed to produce
significantly lower volatility than policy guidelines would permit. Current
simulations show that CoreStates' net interest income volatility over one year
due to a 200 basis point change in short-term interest rates is relatively
neutral. Reflecting its interest rate risk management philosophy, CoreStates'
net interest margin results from strong relationship business profitability
rather than a temporarily favorable interest rate environment.

There are two key elements to CoreStates' interest rate risk. First, is the
broad mismatch between the rate sensitivity of the assets and liabilities in its
core businesses. Second, is the spread risk between the rates on those products
and financial market rates.

CoreStates carries a large portfolio of prime and other short-term rate
related assets generated through its core wholesale and retail businesses. As a
regional banking company, CoreStates has a significant funding base of consumer
deposits with indefinite maturities and non-contractual rates such as savings,
NOW and money market accounts. Traditionally, consumer deposits have had a
longer term rate sensitivity; pricing has been relatively stable for long
periods and pricing changes lag changes in financial market rates. While this
mix of relationship assets and liabilities provides excellent liquidity, it
results in considerable interest rate risk. This inherent mismatch (the
"relationship gap") of longer term fixed-rate liabilities funding short-term
rate sensitive assets would generate significant exposure to declining interest
rates if not hedged.

CoreStates hedges this relationship gap through the use of both on and off-
balance sheet discretionary assets and liabilities. The typical offsetting
position is created by purchasing fixed-rate investment securities funded by
short-term liabilities, and entering into interest rate swaps in which
CoreStates receives a fixed rate and pays a variable rate. The following
excerpts from the Interest Sensitivity Analysis shown on page 89 demonstrates
the basic mismatch of the relationship portfolios and the offsetting
discretionary position. The adjustments and the placement of indefinite
maturity products within the table reflect the lagged pricing effects of those
products, as identified through simulations.

</TABLE>

The second major element of CoreStates' interest rate risk is the spread
risk between product rates and financial market rates. CoreStates simulates the
behavior of individual products under various rate scenarios to determine an
appropriate investment or funding strategy to provide a stable spread.

Declining interest rates in 1993 provided the opportunity to reprice
consumer savings, NOW and money market accounts. This contributed to a wider net
interest margin in 1993 to the extent that these deposit balances funded fixed-
rate assets. Assuming a stable rate environment, spreads are expected to narrow
as the fixed-rate assets mature and are replaced at market rates. There was also
growth in those deposit balances in 1993, increasing the significance of the
repricing of those products to net interest income. CoreStates has simulated
potential changes in pricing and the resultant impact on deposit volumes under a
multitude of rate environments. The key simulation assumptions revolve around
the ability to reprice those products if rates fall, and the extent to which
balances will be maintained and repricing will lag market rates if rates rise.
Recognizing that much of the growth in these products represents a temporary
liquidity preference, CoreStates has invested additional balances for a shorter
term than for those considered to be more permanent.

The spread between the prime rate and short-term market rates is also an
important component of net interest income. In 1993, that spread averaged well
above prior years' experience and, while management does not expect a return to
historic levels, some compression of the prime spread is anticipated.
CoreStates has approximately $6.5 billion in loans subject to changes in prime,
excluding the credit card portfolio which floats with prime only at higher rate
levels.

The low rate environment of 1993 provided refinancing opportunities for many
consumers and raised questions concerning the level of prepayment risk in many
financial institutions. CoreStates' interest rate risk discipline has been to
minimize prepayment risk by selling fixed-rate mortgages as created, and
restricting purchases of mortgage related securities to short-term
collateralized mortgage obligations, with limited cash flow variability. In
1993, CoreStates completed two transactions in which $207 million in longer term
fixed-rate home equity loans were sold and securitized. These securitizations
served both CoreStates' customers and shareholders by providing long-term fixed-
rate financing to consumers, while reducing both credit and interest rate risk
on the balance sheet.

Off-Balance Sheet Instruments - CoreStates uses off-balance sheet
instruments to hedge interest rate risk. Most activities are designed to be a
substitute for the fixed rate assets which are necessary to balance the
sensitivity of relationship business portfolios.

CoreStates believes the management of interest rate risk must be balanced
with the management of liquidity and capital and, therefore, off-balance sheet
instruments are used to hedge interest rate risk and avoid unnecessary leverage
and liquidity impairment. The required level of fixed-rate asset sensitivity
could be achieved principally with on-balance sheet investment securities. The
amount recorded in net interest income related to interest rate swaps was income
of $114.7 million in 1993, $122.9 million in 1992 and $68.5 million in 1991. If
the alternative approach of on-balance sheet assets were used, it would not
materially affect net interest income.

CoreStates' use of financial futures is concentrated in short-term LIBOR and
Eurodollar contracts although longer term contracts are occasionally used to
hedge anticipatory transactions. CoreStates uses interest rate swaps in both
short and longer term maturities to offset on-balance sheet interest rate risk
and, as of December 31, 1993, does not use index amortizing swaps. In addition
to its hedging portfolio; CoreStates also offers interest rate swaps as a risk
management tool to commercial customers; however, customer transactions
represent only 10% of the portfolio and are generally offset with swaps of
similar terms. The following table reflects the future repricing schedule of
CoreStates' interest rate swap portfolio at December 31, 1993:

In addition to using interest rate swaps to hedge the relationship gap,
interest rate swaps have also been used to convert long-term fixed rate debt to
a floating rate sensitivity, accounting for most of the swaps maturing beyond
five years in the preceding table.

CoreStates evaluates the credit worthiness of all off-balance sheet
counterparties using the same standards applied in any other loan or credit
transaction, and credit risk in these positions is centrally managed and
controlled by the Credit Policy Group. The current credit exposure in a
derivative transaction is the cost to replace the transaction at current market
rates, while potential exposure is the estimated cost to replace the transaction
at future rates. CoreStates continually monitors both current and potential
risk. As of December 31, 1993, the current cost to replace CoreStates' interest
rate swap portfolio was $154 million.

Liquidity - Liquidity management allows a financial institution to meet
potential cash needs at a reasonable price under various operating conditions.
Liquidity comes from a variety of sources: the maturing of short-term assets,
readily marketable unpledged securities, and the ability to attract new funds.
The ability to securitize or sell other assets, such as loans, also enhances
liquidity, as does the structure and stability of existing funding sources.

CoreStates maintains sufficient liquidity to meet its obligations in a timely
and cost-effective manner. Management monitors current and projected cash
flows, and adjusts positions as necessary to maintain adequate levels of
liquidity. CoreStates emphasizes diversification of funding sources. By using
a variety of markets, limiting funds borrowed from a single investor, and
staggering maturities, the risk of potential funding pressure is significantly
reduced. Management also maintains a detailed liquidity contingency plan
designed to adequately respond to situations such as a decline in asset quality
or credit ratings, which could lead to liquidity concerns. Management analyzes
potential changes in major funding sources during difficult times, the amount of
runoff that may be expected, as well as available options to replace those
funds. The plan includes specific action steps to be taken in the event of
funding disturbances.

The cornerstone of CoreStates' liquidity position is a sizable and stable base
of core deposits acquired through customer relationships. Core deposits are
comprised of interest bearing consumer savings products as well as non-interest
bearing consumer and commercial deposits. Core deposits averaged 69.0% of
assets in 1993 compared to 70.2% in 1992. This decline is a result of increased
loan volumes and relatively no growth in core deposits.

ASSET AND LIABILITY MANAGEMENT - continued

Core deposits are supplemented by discretionary funding sources from direct
customer contacts in both the domestic and international markets. These sources
include large denomination certificates of deposit, deposits in foreign branches
as well as federal funds, repurchase agreements, commercial paper and long-term
debt. Commercial paper is used primarily to fund Congress, the non-bank
commercial finance subsidiary. In addition to commercial paper, Congress is
funded through the issuance of medium-term notes and long-term debt. Growth in
loans at Congress during 1993 resulted in increases in these funding sources
while loan growth in the banking subsidiaries accounted for the growth in other
discretionary sources. CoreStates' liquidity is further enhanced by its ability
to raise funds in a variety of domestic and international money and capital
markets. During 1993, CoreStates issued $375 million in new subordinated long-
term debt with maturities of 10 to 12 years.

Under existing shelf registration statements filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC"), CoreStates had debt and capital securities that
were registered but unissued of approximately $177 million at December 31, 1993.
In February 1994, CoreStates' Board of Directors approved the filing of a shelf
registration with the SEC that will, when effective, cover the issuance of a
broad range of debt and equity securities that will increase available
registered but unissued securities to $1 billion.

The tables on pages 88 and 90 illustrate the maturity characteristics of
CoreStates' domestic certificates of deposit over $100 thousand and investment
portfolio, respectively. For information regarding the maturity characteristics
of CoreStates' short-term funds borrowed and long-term debt, see notes 10 and 11
to the financial statements.

Investment Portfolio - Within the context of the policies and practices
previously outlined, CoreStates maintains a portfolio of marketable debt
securities to contribute to a balanced interest rate risk position and to
provide liquidity reserves. Interest rate risk management disciplines require
strict matching of interest rate sensitivities and, therefore, CoreStates
generally does not consider changes in the market value of individual portfolios
as significant to the management of its interest sensitivity. CoreStates
generally has both the ability and the intent to hold these securities until
maturity.

In 1993, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 115 "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and
Equity Securities" ("FAS 115"). As a result of adopting FAS 115 on December 31,
1993, CoreStates has reclassified $680 million of investment securities as
"Available-for-Sale". These investment securities were marked to fair value,
adding $68.3 million after-tax to shareholders' equity as of December 31, 1993.
These securities include a bank stock portfolio and other marketable equity
securities, as well as certain debt securities which CoreStates foresees as
potential candidates for sale prior to maturity. Constellation's 
classifications will be reviewed in the second quarter and reclassifications 
will be made as appropriate.

CoreStates' Available-for-Sale account guidelines establish a minimum and
maximum amount of debt and equity securities which can be carried as Available-
for-Sale. The intent of the minimum guideline is to establish an amount of debt
securities as Available-for-Sale to meet liquidity and balance sheet management
concerns. The maximum is established to protect against capital ratio
deterioration, while providing portfolio management flexibility.

SOURCES AND USES OF FUNDS

Total assets were $25.9 billion at year-end 1993, down $182 million or 0.70%
from year-end 1992. However, comparing specific asset categories to year-end
1992 balances reflects recovering loan demand, as loans increased $797 million
or 4.6%, and a $100 million, or 3.4%, increase in investment securities, mostly
due to the FAS 115 recognition of unrealized net appreciation in Available-for-
Sale securities. Time deposits declined $493 million or 27.9%. The increase in
loans was primarily due to improved demand across CoreStates' lending products.
A $646 million, or 5.1%, decline in interest bearing deposits, principally the
result of the September 30, 1993 sale of the five Virgin Islands branches, was
partially offset by growth of $147 million, or 2.4% in demand deposits, and an
increase of $202 million, or 16.1% in long-term debt. 

Total assets averaged $25.2 billion in 1993, an increase of $239 million or
1.0% from 1992. Average loans increased $163 million, or 1.0% and average
investment securities increased $288 million or 10.8%. As reflected in the
table on Earning Asset Mix, loans comprised 79.6% of CoreStates' average earning
assets in 1993, compared to 79.2% in 1992, ending two consecutive years of
declining average loan outstandings. Funding for the increase in average assets
was provided by non-interest bearing funding sources.

REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF EARNINGS

Operating Revenue

Although operating revenue for 1993 was significantly impacted by the December
1992 EPS transaction and other significant items, CoreStates' operating revenue
reflected strong growth in revenues in Wholesale Banking and in fee-based
businesses. Excluding EPS related revenues in 1993 and 1992, net gains on
investment securities transactions, pre-tax gains of $11.0 million from the
Virgin Islands branch sale and $9.1 million on prepayments of long-term debt in
1993, and the $41.1 million pre-tax gain recorded on the December 1992 EPS
transaction, operating revenue increased 8.0% for 1993.

Operating revenue has three major components and, as illustrated on the
accompanying table ("Operating Revenue"), net interest income from loans and
investments is the largest component. Net interest income is presented
excluding the earnings benefit of balances maintained by commercial customers as
compensation for transaction oriented non-credit products.

The two other components of operating revenue are non-interest income and the
previously mentioned earnings benefit of balances maintained as compensation for
non-credit products. Net interest income and non-interest income are discussed
in further detail on the following pages.

For analytical purposes, net interest income is adjusted to a taxable
equivalent basis to recognize the income from tax exempt assets as if the
interest were taxable. Net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis
increased $70.9 million, or 6.0% in 1993, following a decrease of $33.9 million,
or 2.8% in 1992.

The increase in net interest income in 1993 principally reflects the impact
of a $77 million increase in average interest earning assets. Also contributing
to the increase in net interest income were wider interest rate spreads, a $.2
billion increase in non-interest bearing funding sources, the earnings impact of
lower levels of non-performing loans and cash basis interest received on non-
performing loans. The interest rate spread increased in 1993 mostly due to a
decline in the rates paid on domestic deposits of 109 basis points, while the
rates earned on domestic loans decreased 36 basis points.

The decrease in net interest income for 1992 was the result of reduced
domestic loan volume. On average, domestic loans decreased $1.7 billion from
1991, mostly due to the $1 billion October 1991 credit card sale and the $300
million May 1992 consumer installment loan sale. Partially offsetting the
decline in interest income attributable to lower domestic loan volume was the
impact of a $.7 billion increase in non-interest bearing funding sources.

The net interest margin is a key measure of net interest income
performance. It represents the difference between tax equivalent interest
income, including net loan fees earned, and interest expense, reflected as a
percentage of average earning assets.

The net interest margin increased 31 basis points in 1993 to 5.72%. This
increase was principally related to improved interest rate spreads which
resulted from the continued decline of interest rates in 1993 and from the shift
in funding mix to lower cost funding. The migration of consumer deposits from
certificates of deposit to more liquid and less costly deposit products
contributed to the reduction in 1993 funding costs. The low rate environment in
1993 also provided CoreStates with the opportunity to reprice these deposit
products at lower rates and to refinance $325 million in long-term debt.

For further detailed information regarding average balances, yields and
costs, see the consolidated average balance sheet on pages 76-79, and the
rate/volume analysis on page 83.

While reported total non-interest income decreased $42.0 million or 7.2% in
1993, following a slight decline of $.4 million, or .1% in 1992, total non-
interest income in 1993 before non-recurring items and EPS related revenues
increased more than $60 million or 13.3% over 1992. Comparability between 1993
and 1992 was affected by the following items: the $11.0 million gain on the sale
of five Virgin Islands branches in 1993; gains of $9.1 million on prepayments of
long-term debt in 1993; securities gains; the $1.8 million gain on the sale of a
Constellation branch in 1992; and the December 1992 restructuring of CoreStates'
MAC and POS consumer electronic payment business into EPS. As a result of the
EPS restructuring, CoreStates' Statement of Income in 1993 reflects a
significant decline in debit and credit card fees and includes $13.2 million,
reflecting EPS' preferred stock dividends and CoreStates' 31% equity share in
the net income of the EPS joint venture. For analytical purposes, fees
generated by the MAC and POS businesses have been reclassified from the debit
and credit card fee category in the preceding table in 1992 and 1991. POS and
MAC revenues in 1993 were recorded by EPS. Included in other non-interest
income in 1993 was $17.5 million of fees earned by Financial Telesis, a third-
party provider of lockbox processing and data management services, which was
acquired by CoreStates on December 31, 1992. Other non-interest income in 1992
included the $41.1 million pre-tax gain recorded on the EPS transaction.
Excluding the impact of securities gains and losses, EPS related revenues and
the $86.6 million pre-tax gain recorded on the October 1991 credit card sale,
total non-interest income in 1992 increased more than 5% over 1991.

in September 1992, $5.3 million of gains recorded on the partial sale of a
foreign equity investment, and $1.7 million of gains recorded on sales of
certain investments in a portfolio of bank stocks. Included in 1991 securities
losses were $22.8 million of pre-tax write-downs taken against the portfolio of
bank stocks.

Income from basic banking transactional services increased 8.8% in 1993,
following growth of 7.2% in 1992. The components of basic banking
transactional services are discussed in detail below.

. Service charges on deposit accounts, paid in fees, increased $16.1 million, or
10.4%, in 1993 and $19.5 million, or 14.4%, in 1992 reflecting added volume
and many commercial and correspondent customers' decisions to pay fees for
banking services in place of maintaining deposit balances. After adding the
value of service charges paid through the maintenance of deposit balances by
commercial and correspondent customers, which is included in net interest
income, total service charge compensation for 1993 was $286.7 million, up $3.8
million, or 1.3%, from 1992. The benefit derived from deposit balances
maintained by commercial and correspondent customers decreased $12.3 million
from 1992 due to the decline in the value of maintaining balances in the lower
1993 interest rate environment. Total service charge compensation on this
basis for 1992 was $282.9 million, an increase of $6.2 million or 2.2% over
1991.

. Fees for international services increased $9.2 million, or 15.2%, in 1993, as
compared with an increase of $13.0 million, or 27.4%, in 1992. The high growth
in revenues for 1993 was principally due to increased volume from new branch
offices opened over the past year. The prior period increase was primarily
related to product volume growth for traditional cash management products
including: funds transfer; trade payment services; and reimbursement
collection services. International non-credit product volume growth,
particularly foreign exchange fees, continued to be responsible for high gross
revenue increases in 1993 and 1992.

. Trust income increased $4.6 million, or 5.0%, in 1993 following a slight
decline of $.7 million, or .8%, in 1992. Growth in assets and related fees in
the Personal Trust, Investment Services, and Employee Benefit areas
contributed to 1993 fee growth. The decline in 1992 trust income was
principally attributable to the loss of several large customers and the impact
of lower interest rates.

. Debit and credit card fees increased $2.1 million, or 3.6% in 1993, following
a decrease of $7.2 million, or 11.1%, in 1992. For analytical purposes, fees
generated by the MAC and POS businesses, which were contributed to the EPS
joint venture in December 1992, have been reclassfied from the debit and
credit card fee category in the table on page 71 in 1992 and 1991. Credit card
fees were up $.9 million, or 3.4%, for 1993 following a decline of $14.1
million, or 36.2%, for 1992. The 1992 decline was mostly due to the sale of
approximately 560,000 accounts in the fourth quarter of 1991. At year-end
1993, CoreStates' credit card portfolio included approximately 575,000 active
accounts, compared to 546,000 active accounts at year-end 1992. Merchant
processing services fees in 1993 were level with 1992, following growth of
$3.1 million or 21.2% in 1992.

Other operating income, including gains on trading account securities and
other gains but excluding pre-tax gains of $11.0 million on the Virgin Islands
branch sale and $9.1 million on prepayments of long-term debt, increased $27.5
million in 1993, following a decrease of $1.5 million in 1992. Other operating
income in 1993 included $17.5 million of fees earned by Financial Telesis.
Gains on trading account securities were $2.3 million in 1993, as compared with
$1.8 million in 1992 and $2.6 million in 1991.

While reported total non-financial expenses in 1993 of $1,148.3 million
reflected a decrease of 5.4% from 1992; excluding significant and unusual items
as noted below for both years, non-financial expenses for 1993 decreased less
than 1% from 1992. Comparability of 1993 and 1992 total non-financial expenses
is affected by certain significant expenses recorded in each year. In 1993,
total non-financial expenses included a $10.0 million restructuring charge
related to the formation of Transys; and $12.1 million for reserves and write-
downs against other real estate owned. In 1992, total non-financial expenses
included: $16.2 million for systems enhancements and operations consolidations;
$40.0 million for reserves and write-downs against other real estate owned; $7.4
million of expenses associated with personnel related initiatives; $9.1 million
impact of adopting FAS 106; $4.5 million for streamlining business operations;
and a $2.5 million reserve for PMSR write-downs. Comparability of 1993 and 1992
is also impacted by the formation of EPS, as total non-financial expenses for
1992 included eleven months of expenses related to the MAC and POS businesses
which were contributed to EPS in December 1992. 

Comparability for the years 1992 and 1991 is also affected by the 
significant 1992 operating costs, as described above, by the EPS transaction, as
an additional month's expenses for MAC and POS would have added approximately
$8.6 million to 1992 non-financial expenses, and by several significant expenses
recorded in 1991. In 1991, non-financial expenses included the following items:
$44.3 million of write-offs against other real estate owned; $27.1 million
associated with the costs of systems enhancements and conversions, streamlining
business operations, and write-downs of certain assets no longer required in the
streamlined operations; and $6.6 million in charges related to branch
consolidations. Excluding these items for both years, non-financial expenses for
1992 were somewhat lower than 1991.

Non-Financial Expenses: continued

Salaries, wages and benefits increased .3% in 1993, compared to an increase of
.7% in 1992. A decrease in 1993 salary expense was attributable to the transfer
of employees in the MAC and POS businesses to EPS, was partially offset by an
increase in employee related expenses of $11.7 million due to the acquisition of
Financial Telesis. The number of full-time equivalent employees at December 31,
1993, 1992 and 1991 was: 14,728; 14,887; and 15,176, respectively.

Net occupancy expense decreased 1.2% in 1993, compared to a decline of 5.2% in
1992. Equipment expenses declined 14.1% in 1993, compared to a modest increase
of 1.2% in 1992. The decline in combined 1993 net occupancy and equipment
expense was primarily due to the formation of the EPS joint venture. Other
operating expenses increased slightly .8% in 1993, following an increase of 7.4%
in 1992 compared to 1991.

Provision for Income Taxes

The provisions for income taxes was $165.5 million in 1993 compared to $126.4 
million in 1992 and $90.5 million in 1991. The $39.1 million increase in 1993 
total tax expense was primarily the result of higher pre-tax book income of 
$117.6 million. The provisions for income taxes for 1993, 1992 and 1991 were at
effective rates of 32.8%, 32.6% and 35.9% respectively. The 1% retroactive 
increase in the 1993 federal corporate tax rate, higher state tax expense, and 
lower tax exempt income were largely offset by the FAS 109 revaluation of the 
net deferred tax asset reflecting the increased federal tax rate and a higher 
dividend received deduction.

</TABLE>
Changes in interest income or expense not arising solely as a result of volume
or rate variances are allocated to rate variances due to the interest
sensitivity of consolidated assets and liabilities.

Included in interest income is $61.7 million, $56.2 million and $56.4 million
of loan fees for the years ended 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Non-performing loans are included in interest earning assets.

The changes in interest expense on domestic time deposits attributable to
volume and rate are adjusted by specific reserves as average balances are
reduced by such reserve amounts for purposes of rate calculations.

RISK ELEMENT DATA:

FOREIGN OUTSTANDINGS

At December 31, 1993 there were no aggregate foreign outstandings (defined as
loans, investments, acceptances and time deposits) to borrowers in a foreign
country that exceeded 1% of total assets. At December 31, 1992 and 1991,
countries where such outstandings exceeded 1% of total assets were as follows

While the associated risks are clearly recognized, international lending is a
part of the Corporation's wide range of international services. It is the
Corporation's intent to remain involved in providing the international financial
services needed for the increasingly global competition faced by customers.
Outstandings below 1%, but over .75% of total assets were $197,974 in Germany at
December 31, 1992.

Notes to interest sensitivity analysis:

(a) Non-performing loans are included in 1-90 days.
(b) Deposit volumes exclude time deposits not at interest.
(c) Net non-interest bearing funds is the sum of non-interest bearing
liabilities and shareholders' equity minus non-interest earning assets.
(d) The estimated volume of stable net non-interest bearing funds is allocated
to the over 1 year interest sensitivity period. Allocations to the under 1
year periods include: estimated volumes that are expected to vary inversely
with interest rates; and the temporary difference between the actual volume
of total net non-interest bearing funds on December 31, 1993 and the trend
volume at the current level of interest rates.
(e) Adjustments reflect managerial assumptions as to the appropriate investment
maturities for non-interest bearing funding sources, along with the funding
of current investment and loan commitments.
