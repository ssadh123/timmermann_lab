ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

On January 4, 1994, an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Seagull
Energy Corporation ("Seagull" or the "Company") acquired all of the outstanding
shares of stock (the "Stock") of Novalta Resources Inc. ("Novalta") and an
intercompany note (the "Note") from Novalta to its parent, Novacor
Petrochemicals Ltd. ("Novacor Petrochemicals"). The Stock and the Note were
acquired for a purchase price of approximately $203 million in cash, subject to
customary post-closing adjustments described below (the "Seagull Canada
Acquisition"). The economic effective date of the Seagull Canada Acquisition
was December 31, 1993 (the "Effective Date"). Effective as of the January 4,
1994 Closing Date, Novalta was amalgamated with one of its subsidiaries along
with Seagull Energy Canada Ltd., the indirect subsidiary of Seagull that
acquired Novalta. The resulting amalgamated company was named Seagull Energy
Canada Ltd. ("Seagull Canada"). As a result of the amalgamation, the Note was
extinguished. See "Purchase Price" and "Financing" below. References to
dollars throughout this Current Report on Form 8-K refer to U. S. dollars
unless otherwise noted.

SEAGULL CANADA PROPERTIES

Seagull Canada's assets (the "Seagull Canada Properties") consist
primarily of natural gas and oil reserves and developed and undeveloped lease
acreage concentrated principally in a small number of fields located in
Alberta, Canada. Seagull estimates that the Seagull Canada Acquisition
provided proved reserves of approximately 244 billion cubic feet of natural gas
and about 2.8 million barrels of oil, condensate and natural gas liquids as of
the Effective Date. Approximately 80 percent of these reserves and 75 percent
of Seagull Canada's total producing wells are concentrated in 16 of 95 total
fields. As of December 31, 1993, the Seagull Canada Properties consisted of
lease acreage holdings including approximately 200,000 net developed acres and
approximately 250,000 net undeveloped acres.

PURCHASE PRICE

The purchase price was determined pursuant to arm's-length
negotiations between Seagull and Novacor Petrochemicals, based on an economic
effective date of December 31, 1993. The $203 million purchase price for the
Stock and the Note is subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments for
working capital and capital expenditures for 1993 in excess of a specified
threshold pursuant to the provisions of the Sale Agreement, dated November 19,
1993, between Seagull and Novacor Petrochemicals.

FINANCING

The Seagull Canada Acquisition was financed primarily with a new $175
Million reducing revolving credit facility (the "Canadian Credit Agreement"),
as well as borrowings under Seagull's amended and restated $475 million
revolving credit facility (the "Revolver") with a group of major U. S. and
international banks. The Canadian Credit Agreement between Seagull Canada and
10 Canadian affiliates of major U. S. and international banks provides for dual
currency borrowings in U. S. and Canadian dollars with a nominated maximum
borrowing availability of $160 million , which may be increased or decreased by
the Company at any time pursuant to provisions of the Canadian Credit
Agreement, up to the maximum commitment of $175 million. 

<PAGE> 3
The Canadian Credit Agreement matures on December 31, 1999 and commitments 
thereunder begin to decline on March 31, 1996 in equal quarterly reductions 
of $10,937,500. As of January 4, 1994, immediately following the Seagull 
Canada Acquisition, approximately $152 million in borrowings were outstanding 
under this facility, which are currently denominated in Canadian dollars.

Borrowings outstanding under the Canadian Credit Agreement funded in
U. S. dollars bear interest, at Seagull Canada's option, at a rate equal to (i)
either one, two, three or six month Adjusted LIBOR, plus a margin (the "LIBOR
Margin") or (ii) the Reference Rate, plus a margin (the "Prime Margin"). The
"Reference Rate" is the greater of (i) 0.5% per annum above the daily federal
funds rate or (ii) the prime rate of the agent bank. The LIBOR Margin ranges
from 0.625% to 2.5% per annum, depending upon Seagull's credit rating and
consolidated Debt to Capitalization Ratio (as defined under the Revolver), and
the Prime Margin ranges from 0% to 1.5% per annum, depending upon the same
factors. Borrowings outstanding in Canadian dollars bear interest, at Seagull
Canada's option, at a rate equal to (i) either one, two, three or six month
Bankers' Acceptance Rate plus the LIBOR Margin or (ii) the Paying Agent's prime
rate plus the Prime Margin.

In connection with the consummation of the Seagull Canada Acquisition,
the Revolver was amended to allow for the incurrence of debt by Seagull Canada
under the Canadian Credit Agreement and to allow Seagull to guarantee such
debt. As an additional amendment to the Revolver, the "Borrowing Base" was
increased to $610 million to provide for value attributed to Seagull Canada's
proved reserves. The Borrowing Base is based upon the value of the proved
reserves of the Company's exploration and production segment and the financial
performance of the Company's other business segments as provided for under the
Revolver, and limits the total amount of senior indebtedness available to the
Company.

The available commitment under the Revolver is subject to the
Borrowing Base and is determined after consideration of outstanding borrowings
under Seagull's other senior debt facilities. As of January 4, 1994,
immediately following the Seagull Canada Acquisition, borrowings outstanding
under the Revolver were $188.5 million, leaving immediately available unused
commitments of approximately $149.3 million, net of outstanding letters of
credit of $2.2 million, $100 million of borrowings outstanding under Seagull's
senior notes, the nominated maximum borrowing availability of $160 million
under the Canadian Credit Agreement, and $10 million in borrowings outstanding
under one of Seagull's money market facilities.

The Revolver and the Canadian Credit Agreement are unsecured credit
facilities. Both facilities contain restrictive provisions regarding the
incurrence of additional debt, the making of investments outside of existing
lines of business, the maintenance of certain financial levels (based upon
Seagull's consolidated financial condition and results of operations), the
incurrence of additional liens, the declaration or payment of dividends (other
than dividends payable solely in the form of additional shares of the Company's
common stock) and the repurchase or redemption of capital stock.

2. SALE

Vendor agrees to sell and transfer the Shares and Note to Purchaser and

forth in this Agreement.

3. PRICE

3.1 Deposit: The parties acknowledge that Purchaser, no later
than 5:00 p.m. (Calgary time) on the date hereof, will pay the
Deposit to Vendor's Solicitors in trust for Vendor, to be
deposited with the Bank of Nova Scotia in the form of a
certificate of deposit, such Deposit and interest thereon to
be released only in accordance with the provisions of this
Subclause 3.1. The parties agree

<PAGE> 17
14

that, if the Deposit is not paid prior to such time, then Vendor may
terminate this Agreement without any further liability by the parties
hereunder by written notice to Purchaser at any time prior to the
payment of the Deposit. The parties hereby confirm their agreement
that the Deposit and interest thereon represent a fair, reasonable and
genuine assessment of the damages Vendor would suffer or incur solely
by reason of the failure or refusal of Purchaser to complete the
Closing in breach of the provisions of this Agreement. In this regard
it is agreed by the parties that a forfeiture of the Deposit and
interest thereon to Vendor in such circumstances shall represent
liquidated damages only and not a penalty and shall constitute a full
and complete discharge of Purchaser's obligations to Vendor under this
Agreement. The Deposit and interest thereon shall be paid on the
following basis:

(a) if Closing occurs, Vendor's Solicitors shall hold the
Deposit in escrow pursuant to the terms of Subclause
3.5 and shall credit interest which has accrued on
the Deposit up to the Effective Time to Purchaser;

(b) if Closing does not occur due solely to the failure
or refusal of Purchaser to complete the Closing in
breach of the provisions of this Agreement, the
Deposit plus interest which has accrued thereon shall
be paid by Vendor's Solicitors to Vendor; and

(c) if this Agreement is terminated without the
occurrence of the Closing under any other
circumstances, the Deposit plus interest which has
accrued thereon shall be promptly paid to Purchaser.

In the event Closing does not occur, a party entitled to be
paid the Deposit or interest under this Subclause 3.1 shall
issue a notice of entitlement in writing simultaneously to the
other party and Vendor's Solicitors. Vendor's Solicitors
shall pay the Deposit and interest as directed by such notice
unless within 24 hours of receipt thereof by Vendor's
Solicitors the other party reasonably objects in good faith to
the payment by notice of objection in writing simultaneously
to Vendor's Solicitors and the party giving the notice of
entitlement. In the event Vendor's Solicitors receive a
notice of objection or do not, within a reasonable time

<PAGE> 18
15

after it appears Closing will not occur, receive a notice of
entitlement from either party, Vendor's Solicitors shall pay the
Deposit and interest thereon into the Court of Queen's Bench in
Calgary, Alberta where the return or release of such monies will be as
determined or approved by such Court.

(a) Subject to adjustment as provided for in Subclause
3.4 the purchase price to be paid by Purchaser to

plus the Total Capital Estimate plus the EBOC Value;

(b) The Purchase Price prior to the adjustments described

which Closing occurs; and

shall be paid to the Vendor by or on behalf of Purchaser at

of the amount in dispute. Such accounting firm shall
be instructed to use a materiality standard as such
firm may determine to be reasonable under the
circumstances, in light of the cost to be incurred
and the amount in issue. Such accounting firm shall
be instructed to make such calculations as soon as
practicable. The final determination of any of the
Closing Financial Statements (including, without
limitation, the Working Capital and Total Capital)
pursuant to this Subclause 3.6(c) shall be binding on

In the event any of the foregoing records and information are

5.2 Confidentiality: The obligation of the Purchaser with respect

6.1 Howard Opinions: Purchaser acknowledges that it has reviewed
the Howard Opinions in respect of the Reviewed Lands and is

effective dates stated in the Howard Opinions. Upon Closing,
Vendor shall cause the Howard Opinions to be readdressed to
Purchaser.

6.2 Arthur D. Little Report: Purchaser acknowledges that it has
reviewed the Arthur D. Little Report in respect of the
Environmentally Reviewed Lands and agrees that Novalta shall
remain liable for all Environmental Liabilities described in

liable for all

<PAGE> 28
25

Environmental Liabilities with respect to all Lands which were not the
subject of the Arthur D. Little Report.

7. TITLE DEFICIENCIES

7.1 Identification of Title Deficiencies: Purchaser may from time
to time but no later than 20 Business Days prior to Closing
give written notice to Vendor describing in reasonable detail
all defects and irregularities relating to the Petroleum and
Natural Gas Rights, excluding all interests of Novalta in the
Reviewed Lands, that in the reasonable opinion of Purchaser,
materially adversely affect the title of Novalta to any
portion of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Rights, excluding all
interests of Novalta in Reviewed Lands (collectively the
"Title Deficiencies") and a reasonable estimate by Purchaser
of the aggregate value of such Title Deficiencies.

7.2 Reviewed Lands: For greater certainty Purchaser shall not be
entitled to give Vendor notice of, or request an adjustment to
the Purchase Price in respect of, any deficiencies or
irregularities relating to Novalta's title to the Reviewed
Lands.

7.3 Adjustment Limitation: If the aggregate value of Title
Deficiencies (determined in accordance with Subclause 7.4)
exceeds $500,000.00 then the Purchase Price shall be reduced
by the amount that the value of the Title Deficiencies
(determined in accordance with Subclause 7.4) exceeds
$500,000.00. If the aggregate value of the Title Deficiencies
(determined in accordance with Subclause 7.4) does not exceed
$500,000.00 then there shall be no adjustment to the Purchase
Price.

7.4 Value of Title Deficiencies: The value of the Title
Deficiencies shall be determined as follows:

(a) if Vendor agrees with Purchaser's estimate
set forth in the notice referred to in
Subclause 7.1 in respect of Title
Deficiencies, Vendor shall deliver to
Purchaser written notice of Vendor's
agreement to Purchaser's estimate of the
value of Title Deficiencies, in which case
the amount so agreed to shall be the value of
such Title Deficiencies for all purposes of
this Agreement (collectively, the "Agreed
Title Deficiencies");

<PAGE> 29
26

(b) if Vendor does not agree with Purchaser's
estimate set forth in the notice referred to
in Subclause 7.1 in respect of Title
Deficiencies, Vendor shall provide written
notice of such disagreement to Purchaser no
later than 15 Business Days prior to Closing.

(c) if after receipt of such notice Purchaser
contends that the Title Deficiencies which
remain (together with the value of the Agreed
Title Deficiencies), cumulatively diminish
the value of the Resource Assets by an amount
in excess of $500,000.00, the Purchaser may
elect by written notice to Vendor no later
than 4:30 p.m., Calgary time, on the tenth
Business Day prior to the Closing Time to:

(i) Waive: waive the uncured
Title Deficiencies (other
than the Agreed Title
Deficiencies); or

(iii) Price Reduction: negotiate a
reduction in the Purchase Price.

Failure by Purchaser to elect or to elect within the time
frame set out in this Subclause 7.4(b) shall be irrefutably
and conclusively deemed to be an election to waive all uncured
Title Deficiencies.

7.5 If Purchaser elects to negotiate a reduction in the Purchase
Price and no agreement is reached at or before 4:30 p.m.,
Calgary Time, on the fifth Business Day immediately preceding
the Closing Time and Purchaser contends that the uncured Title
Deficiencies cumulatively diminish the value of the affected
Resource Assets, other than the Reviewed Lands, by an amount
in excess of $500,000.00 (less the amount of the Agreed Title
Deficiencies), the parties agree to arbitrate the proposed
Purchase Price reduction in accordance with the Arbitration
Procedure and, if the Closing Time arrives before the
arbitration decision is issued, proceed with Closing with
Purchaser deducting from the Purchase Price otherwise payable
at Closing the full amount of the reduction requested and
depositing the same with the Vendor's Solicitors.

7.6 Ability to Remedy before Closing: Vendor shall be entitled to
remedy or cure any or all Title Deficiencies prior to Closing.
If a Title Deficiency has been

<PAGE> 30
27

remedied or cured prior to Closing it shall cease to be a Title
Deficiency for all purposes of this Agreement, including without
limitation, for purposes of adjustment of the Purchase Price and
calculation of the limit for adjustment provided for in Subclause 7.3.

7.7 Ability to Remedy after Arbitration: If the parties have
arbitrated a Purchase Price reduction with respect to uncured
Title Deficiencies pursuant to Subclause 7.5 and the
Arbitrator's decision results in a reduction in the value of
the Resource Assets in excess of $500,000.00, then, on the
written notice of Vendor to Purchaser within ten Business Days
of the date of delivery of the Arbitrator's decision to the
Vendor, Vendor shall have 180 days from the Closing Time to
remedy such Title Deficiencies. If a Title Deficiency is
remedied within such period it shall cease to be a Title
Deficiency for all purposes of this Agreement and the Purchase
Price reduction set out in the Arbitrator's decision shall be
adjusted accordingly and the Vendor's Solicitors shall
promptly pay the appropriate amount to Vendor from the funds
paid to Vendor's Solicitors pursuant to Subclause 7.5. If
Vendor does not provide Purchase with notice as contemplated
hereto then Vendor's Solicitors shall promptly pay to
Purchaser all the funds paid to Vendor's Solicitors pursuant
to Subclause 7.5.

7.8 Co-operation: Purchaser shall co-operate with respect to any
attempt by Vendor to remedy any Title Deficiency and shall
allow Vendor and Vendor's Representative with reasonable
access during normal business hours to all relevant records
relating to the Resource Assets.

subsequent to the Effective Time with respect to any and all
Environmental Liabilities however and whenever arising. This
liability and indemnity shall apply without limit and without regard
to cause or causes, including without limitation the negligence,
whether sole, concurrent, gross, active, passive, primary or

otherwise. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it shall not be
entitled to any rights or remedies as against Vendor under the common
law or statute pertaining to Environmental Liabilities relating to the

claim or remedy outside this Agreement including rights and remedies
under the common law or statute. This Subclause 9(I) shall, not

CREDIT AGREEMENT

This CREDIT AGREEMENT, dated as of December 30, 1993, is by and among
SEAGULL ENERGY CANADA LTD. (the "Company"), a corporation duly organized and
validly existing under the laws of the Province of Alberta, Canada; each of the
banks which is or which may from time to time become a signatory hereto
(individually, a "Bank" and, collectively, the "Banks"); CHEMICAL BANK OF
CANADA ("Chemical"), as arranger and administrative agent for the Banks (in
such capacity, together with its successors in such capacity, the
"Administrative Agent"); THE BANK OF NOVA SCOTIA ("BNS"), as paying agent and
co-agent for the Banks (in such capacity, together with its successors in such
capacity, the "Paying Agent"), and CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK OF COMMERCE ("CIBC"),
as co-agent for the Banks (in such capacity, together with its successors in
such capacity, the "Co-Agent").

The parties hereto agree as follows:

SECTION 1. DEFINITIONS AND ACCOUNTING MATTERS

1.1 Certain Defined Terms. As used herein, the following terms
shall have the following meanings (all terms defined in this Section 1.1 or in
other provisions of this Agreement in the singular to have the same meanings
when used in the plural and vice versa):

"Additional Costs" shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in
Section 6.1 hereof.

"Affiliate" shall mean, as to any Person, any other Person which
directly or indirectly controls, or is under common control with, or is
controlled by, such Person and, if such Person is an individual, any member of
the immediate family (including parents, siblings, spouse, children,
stepchildren, grandchildren, nephews and nieces) of such individual and any
trust whose principal beneficiary is such individual or one or more members of
such immediate family and any Person who is controlled by any such member or
trust. As used in this definition, "control" (including, with correlative
meanings, "controlled by" and "under common control with") shall mean
possession, directly or indirectly, of power to direct or cause the direction
of management or policies (whether through ownership of securities or
partnership or other ownership interests, by contract or otherwise).

"Agents" shall mean the Administrative Agent, the Paying Agent and the
Co-Agent, collectively.

"Agreement" shall mean this Credit Agreement, as the same may be
amended, modified, restated or supplemented from time to time.

1
<PAGE> 8
"Alternate Base Rate" shall mean, for any day, a rate per annum equal
to the higher of (a) the U.S. Prime Rate in effect on such day or (b) 1/2 of 1%
plus the Federal Funds Rate in effect for such day (rounded upwards, if
necessary, to the nearest 1/16th of 1%). For purposes hereof, "Federal Funds
Rate" shall mean, for any period, a fluctuating interest rate per annum equal
for each day during such period to the weighted average of the rates on
overnight Federal funds transactions with members of the Federal Reserve System
arranged by Federal funds brokers, as published for such day (or, if such day
is not a Business Day, for the next preceding Business Day) by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, or, if such rate is not so published for any day
which is a Business Day, the average of the quotations for such day on such
transactions received by the Paying Agent from three Federal funds brokers of
recognized standing selected by it. For purposes of this Agreement, any change
in the Alternate Base Rate due to a change in the Federal Funds Rate shall be
effective on the effective date of such change in the Federal Funds Rate. If
for any reason the Paying Agent shall have determined (which determination
shall be conclusive and binding, absent manifest error) that it is unable to
ascertain the Federal Funds Rate for any reason, including, without limitation,
the inability or failure of the Paying Agent to obtain sufficient bids or
publications in accordance with the terms hereof, the Alternate Base Rate shall
be the U.S. Prime Rate until the circumstances giving rise to such inability no
longer exist. For the purposes hereof, "U.S. Prime Rate" shall mean the annual
rate of interest announced from time to time by the Paying Agent in Canada as
its U.S. Base Rate for U.S. Dollar loans made by the Paying Agent in Canada.
Without notice to the Company or any other Person, the U.S. Prime Rate shall
change automatically from time to time as and in the amount by which said
annual rate of interest shall fluctuate. The U.S. Prime Rate is a reference
rate and does not necessarily represent the lowest or best rate actually
charged to any customer. Chemical Bank, any Agent or any Bank may make
commercial loans or other loans at rates of interest at, above or below the
U.S. Prime Rate. For purposes of this Agreement any change in the Alternate
Base Rate due to a change in the U.S. Prime Rate shall be effective on the date
such change in the U.S. Prime Rate is announced.

"Alternate Base Rate Loans" shall mean Loans which bear interest at a
rate based upon the Alternate Base Rate.

"APC" shall mean Alaska Pipeline Company, an Alaska corporation, a
Subsidiary of the Parent.

"APC Long Term Financing Documents" shall mean that certain Inducement
Agreement and that certain Note Agreement (together with the Notes, as defined
therein), each dated as of May 14, 1992, by and among the Parent, Aid
Association for Lutherans, The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United
States, Equitable Variable Life Insurance Company, Provident Life and Accident
Insurance Company and Teachers Insurance & Annuity Association of America, any
documentation executed in connection with any renewal, extension or
rearrangement of the Indebtedness that is the subject of the foregoing
documents, the Gas Sales Contract, the Intercompany Mortgage, as defined in the
above-mentioned Note Agreement, and

2
<PAGE> 9
any documents executed in replacement of any of the foregoing documents, if
any, and only if the Administrative Agent has received notice thereof pursuant
to Section 10.8.

"Applicable Lending Office" shall mean, for each Bank and for each
Type of Loan and for each Bankers' Acceptance, such office of such Bank (or of
an affiliate of such Bank) as such Bank may from time to time specify to the
Paying Agent and the Company as the office by which its Loans of such Type are
to be made and/or issued and maintained and at which Bankers' Acceptances are
to be accepted and purchased; provided, however, that each such office shall be
located in Canada.

"Applicable Margin" shall mean, on any day and with respect to any
Loan, the applicable per annum percentage set forth at the appropriate
intersection in the table shown below, based on the Debt/Capitalization Ratio
as of the last day of the most recently ending fiscal quarter of the Parent and
its Subsidiaries with respect to which the Administrative Agent shall have

commencing with the issuance of any Letter of Credit and until such Letter of
Credit shall have expired or been terminated, the Commitment of each Bank shall
be deemed to be utilized for all purposes hereof in an amount equal to such
Bank's Commitment Percentage of the amount then available for drawings under
such Letter of Credit.

(iii) Upon receipt from the beneficiary of any Letter of
Credit of any demand for payment thereunder, the applicable Issuer shall
promptly notify the Company and each Bank as to the amount to be paid as a
result of such demand and the payment date. If at any time the applicable
Issuer shall have made a payment to a beneficiary of a Letter of Credit in
respect of

26
<PAGE> 33
a drawing under such Letter of Credit, each Bank will pay to the applicable
Issuer immediately upon demand by the applicable Issuer at any time during the
period commencing after such payment until reimbursement thereof in full by the
Company, an amount equal to such Bank's Commitment Percentage of such payment,
together with interest on such amount for each day from the date of demand for
such payment (or, if such demand is made after 11:00 a.m. Toronto, Ontario time
on such date, from the next succeeding Business Day) to the date of payment by
such Bank of such amount at a per annum rate of interest determined by the
Issuer (such rate to be conclusive and binding on the Banks) in accordance with
the Issuer's usual banking practice for similar advances to financial
institutions of like standing to the applicable Bank.

(iv) The Company shall be irrevocably and unconditionally
obligated forthwith to reimburse the applicable Issuer for any amount paid by
the applicable Issuer upon any drawing under any Letter of Credit, without
presentment, demand, protest or other formalities of any kind. Such
reimbursement may, subject to satisfaction of the conditions in Sections 7.1
and 7.2 hereof and to the existence of the Maximum Revolving Credit Available
Amount (after adjustment in the same to reflect the elimination of the
corresponding Letter of Credit Liability) be made by borrowing of Loans. In
the event any such reimbursement is not made by borrowing of Loans, the Company
shall make such reimbursement in immediately available funds within five (5)
days after demand therefor by the applicable Issuer. The applicable Issuer
will pay to each Bank such Bank's Commitment Percentage of all amounts received
from the Company for application in payment, in whole or in part, of the
Reimbursement Obligation in respect of any Letter of Credit, but only to the
extent such Bank has made payment to the applicable Issuer in respect of such
Letter of Credit pursuant to clause (iii) above.

(v) The Company will pay to the Paying Agent at the
Payment Office for the account of each Bank a fee on such Bank's Commitment
Percentage of the daily average amount available for drawings under each Letter
of Credit, in each case for the period from and including the date of issuance
of such Letter of Credit to and including the date of expiration or termination
thereof at a rate per annum equal to the Letter of Credit Fee in effect from
time to time, such fee to be paid in arrears on the Quarterly Dates and on the
date of the expiration or termination thereof. The Paying Agent will pay to
each Bank, promptly after receiving any payment in respect of letter of credit
fees referred to in the preceding sentence of this clause (v), an amount equal
to such Bank's Commitment Percentage of such fees. The Company shall pay to
the applicable Issuer an administration and issuance fee in an amount equal to
1/8 of 1% per annum of the daily average amount available for drawings under
such Letter of Credit, in each case for the period from and including the date
of issuance of such Letter of Credit to and including the date of expiration or
termination thereof, such fee to be paid in arrears on the Quarterly Dates and
on the date of the expiration or termination thereof. Such administration and
issuance fee shall be retained by the applicable Issuer.

(vi) The issuance by the applicable Issuer of each Letter
of Credit shall, in addition to the conditions precedent set forth in Section 7
hereof, be subject to the conditions

27
<PAGE> 34
precedent that such Letter of Credit shall be in such form and contain such
terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Issuer and that the
Company shall have executed and delivered such other instruments and agreements
relating to such Letter of Credit as the applicable Issuer shall have
reasonably requested and are not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement
including an Application therefor. In the event of a conflict between the
terms of this Agreement and the terms of any Application, the terms of this
Agreement shall control. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing
sentence, in the event any such Application shall include requirements for
Cover, it is agreed that there shall be no requirements for the Company to
provide Cover except as expressly required in this Agreement.

(c) Indemnification. The Company hereby indemnifies and holds
harmless each Agent, the applicable Issuer and each Bank from and against any
and all claims and damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which such
Bank, the applicable Issuer or such Agent may incur (or which may be claimed
against such Bank, the applicable Issuer or such Agent by any Person
whatsoever) in connection with the execution and delivery or transfer of or
payment or failure to pay under any Letter of Credit, including, without
limitation, any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses which
such Agent, the applicable Issuer or such Bank, as the case may be, may incur
(whether incurred as a result of its own negligence or otherwise) by reason of
or in connection with the failure of any other Bank (whether as a result of its
own negligence or otherwise) to fulfill or comply with its obligations to such
Agent, the applicable Issuer or such Bank, as the case may be, hereunder (but
nothing herein contained shall affect any rights the Company may have against
such defaulting Bank); provided that, the Company shall not be required to
indemnify any Bank, the applicable Issuer or any Agent for any claims, damages,
losses, liabilities, costs or expenses to the extent, but only to the extent,
caused by (i) the willful misconduct or gross negligence of the party seeking
indemnification, or (ii) by such Bank's, the applicable Issuer's or such
Agent's, as the case may be, failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after
the presentation to it of a request required to be paid under applicable law.
Nothing in this Section 2.2(c) is intended to limit the obligations of the
Company under any other provision of this Agreement.

(d) Co-issuance or Separate Issuance of Letters of Credit. The
Company may, at its option, request that any requested Letter of Credit which
exceeds U.S. $1,000,000 be issued severally, but not jointly, by any two or
more of the Banks or issued through separate Letters of Credit issued by any
two or more of the Banks, respectively, each in an amount equal to a portion of
the amount of the applicable Letter of Credit requested by the Company. In
either such event, the Banks issuing such Letters of Credit shall each
constitute an "Issuer" and the Letters of Credit so issued shall each
constitute a "Letter of Credit" for all purposes hereunder and under the Loan
Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Bank other than BNS shall have
any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit, but may do so at its option.

(ii) On December 31, 1999, all Commitments shall be terminated in
their entirety unless terminated at an earlier date pursuant
to Section 11.1.

(b) Optional. The Company shall have the right to terminate or
reduce the unused portion of the Commitments at any time or from time to time,
provided that: (i) the Company shall give notice of each such termination or
reduction to the Administrative Agent and the Paying Agent as provided in
Section 5.5 hereof and (ii) each such partial reduction shall be permanent and
in an aggregate amount at least equal to U.S. $5,000,000.

(c) No Reinstatement. Any reduction in or termination of the
Commitments may not be reinstated without the approval of the Administrative
Agent and each of the Banks.

2.4 Fees.

(a) The Company shall pay to the Paying Agent for the account of each
Bank a commitment fee with respect to such Bank's Commitment accruing from the
date hereof, computed for each day at a rate per annum equal to the Revolving
Credit Commitment Fee

29
<PAGE> 36
Percentage with respect to the Commitments of the respective Banks and based on
the amount, if any, by which such Bank's pro rata share of the lesser of the
aggregate Commitments or the Maximum Outstanding Amount on such day exceeds the
sum of (i) the unpaid principal balance of such Bank's Note outstanding on such
day plus (ii) the full face amount of all outstanding Bankers' Acceptances
accepted by such Bank plus (iii) such Bank's allocated share of the aggregate
Letter of Credit Liabilities outstanding on such day. Commitment fees accruing
pursuant to this clause (a) shall be payable on the Quarterly Dates and on the
earlier of the date the Commitments are terminated or the last day of the
Revolving Credit Availability Period. Such fees shall be calculated in U.S.
Dollars, but paid in Canadian Dollars converted by using the Equivalent U.S.
Dollar Amount as of the date of payment.

(b) The Company shall pay to the Paying Agent for the account of each
Bank an additional commitment fee with respect to such Bank's Commitment
accruing from the date hereof, computed for each day at a rate per annum equal
to one-half (1/2) of the Revolving Credit Commitment Fee Percentage with
respect to the Commitments of the respective Banks and based on the amount, if
any, by which the amount set forth opposite such Bank's name on the signature
pages hereto under the heading "Commitment" (but only to the extent that such
amount has not been permanently and irrevocably terminated and reduced by
written notice from the Company to the Administrative Agent, with a copy to the
Paying Agent; provided, however that any such termination or reduction must be
allocated among the Banks pro rata in accordance with their respective
Commitment Percentages) exceeds such Bank's pro rata share of the Maximum
Outstanding Amount on such day. Commitment fees accruing pursuant to this
clause (b) shall be payable on the Quarterly Dates and on the earlier of the
date the Commitments are terminated or the last day of the Revolving Credit
Availability Period. Such fees shall be calculated in U.S. Dollars, but paid
in Canadian Dollars converted by using the Equivalent U.S. Dollar Amount as of
the date of payment.

(c) The Company shall pay to the Paying Agent for the account of
each Bank an additional commitment fee effective upon any increase in borrowing
availability hereunder. Such additional commitment fee shall be in an amount
equal to the amount by which the commitment fee which such Bank would have
received under Sections 2.4(a) and (b) if such increased borrowing availability
had been effective six (6) calendar months earlier exceeds the commitment fee
actually received by such Bank under Sections 2.4(a) and (b) during such six
(6) calendar month period. Payment of such additional commitment fee shall be
due and payable upon the effective date of such increase in the Maximum
Outstanding Amount. The commitment fee provided for in this Section 2.4(c)
shall be payable notwithstanding any prior decrease in the available
Commitments which may have occurred. Such fees shall be calculated in U.S.
Dollars, but paid in Canadian Dollars converted by using the Equivalent U.S.
Dollar Amount as of the date of payment.

30
<PAGE> 37
(d) For purposes of determining the amount of any payment required
to be made under this Section 2.4, the Quarterly Equivalent shall be used as
the conversion rate with respect to Canadian Dollars.

2.5 Affiliates; Lending Offices.

(a) Any Bank may, if it so elects, fulfill its Commitment as to
any Eurodollar Loan by causing a branch, foreign or otherwise, or Affiliate of
such Bank to make such Loan and may transfer and carry such Loan at, to or for
the account of any branch office or Affiliate of such Bank which is a resident
of Canada under the Income Tax Act (Canada); provided that, in such event for
the purposes of this Agreement such Loan shall be deemed to have been made by
such Bank and the obligation of the Company to repay such Loan shall
nevertheless be to such Bank and shall be deemed to be held by such Bank and,
to the extent of such Loan, to have been made for the account of such branch or
Affiliate.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, each Bank shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all
or any part of its Loans hereunder in any manner it sees fit, it being
understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement all determinations
hereunder shall be made as if such Bank had actually funded and maintained each
Eurodollar Loan during each Interest Period through the purchase of deposits
having a maturity corresponding to such Interest Period and bearing an interest
rate equal to the Eurodollar Rate, as the case may be, for such Interest Period
for such Interest Period.

2.6 Several Obligations. The failure of any Bank to make any Loan
to be made by it or accept and purchase Bankers' Acceptances to be purchased by
it on the date specified therefor shall not relieve any other Bank of its
obligation to make its Loan or accept and purchase such Bankers' Acceptances on
such date, but neither any Agent nor any Bank shall be responsible for the
failure of any other Bank to make a Loan to be made by such other Bank or to
accept and purchase any Bankers' Acceptances to be accepted and purchased by
such other Bank.

2.7 Notes. The Loans made by each Bank shall be evidenced by a
single Canadian Dollar denominated Note of the Company in the case of Loans
denominated in Canadian Dollars and by a single U.S. Dollar denominated Note of
the Company in the case of Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars, such notes to be
in substantially the forms of Exhibit C-1 and C-2, respectively, hereto payable
to the order of such Bank in a principal amount equal to the Commitment of such
Bank, and otherwise duly completed. Each Bank is hereby authorized by the
Company to endorse on the schedule (or a continuation thereof) attached to the
Note of such Bank, to the extent applicable, the date, amount and Type of and
the Interest Period for each Loan made by such Bank to the Company hereunder,
and the amount of each payment or prepayment of principal of such Loan received
by such Bank, provided, that any failure by such Bank to make any such
endorsement shall not affect the obligations of the Company under such Note or
hereunder in respect of such Loan.

31
<PAGE> 38
2.8 Use of Proceeds. The proceeds of the Loans and the Canadian
Bankers' Acceptance Discount Proceeds, as the case may be, shall be used to
finance a portion of the costs of acquiring the equity and other capital of
Novalta (consisting of common and preferred stock and a note payable from
Novalta to Novacor Petrochemicals Ltd.) and for general corporate purposes.

2.9 Designation of Maximum Outstanding Amount. The Company shall
from time to time designate a maximum principal amount, denominated in U.S.
Dollars, permitted to be outstanding hereunder for the period during which such
designation is effective (such amount being herein called the "Maximum
Outstanding Amount"). The initial Maximum Outstanding Amount, effective from
the date hereof, is U.S. $160,000,000. The Company may, at any time, by
written notice delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Paying Agent no
later than two (2) Business Days prior to the effective date thereof, revise
the Maximum Outstanding Amount upwards or downwards; provided, however, that
(i) the Maximum Outstanding Amount may not at any time exceed the aggregate
amount of the Commitments, as reduced from time to time pursuant to Section 2.3
hereof and (ii) the Maximum Outstanding Amount may not at any time exceed the
amount by which the Borrowing Base from time to time in effect exceeds the sum
of the aggregate amount of all "Revolving Credit Obligations" from time to time
outstanding under the U.S. Facility plus the aggregate amount of all other
Borrowing Base Debt of the Parent and its Subsidiaries from time to time
outstanding.

SECTION 3. BORROWINGS, PREPAYMENTS AND SELECTION OF INTEREST
RATES.

3.1 Borrowings. The Company shall give the Administrative Agent
and the Paying Agent notice of each borrowing or the issuance of each Bankers'
Acceptance to be made hereunder as provided in Section 5.5 hereof. Not later
than 2:00 p.m. Toronto, Ontario time on the date specified for each such
borrowing or the issuance of each such Bankers' Acceptance hereunder, each Bank
shall make available the amount of the Loan, if any, to be made by it on such
date or make available Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Discount Proceeds in
respect of Bankers' Acceptances to be accepted and purchased by it on such date
(less the applicable acceptance fees payable by the Company in respect of such
Bankers' Acceptances), in each case to the Paying Agent, at the Payment Office,
in immediately available funds, for the account of the Company. The amount so
received by the Paying Agent shall, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, be made available to the Company by depositing the same, in
immediately available funds, in an account designated by the Company maintained
with the Paying Agent at the Payment Office.

3.2 Prepayments.

(a) Optional Prepayments. Subject to the provisions of Sections
4, 5 and 6, the Company shall have the right to prepay, on any Business Day, in
whole or in part, without the payment of any penalty or fee, Loans at any time
or from time to time, provided that, the Company shall give the Administrative
Agent and the Paying Agent notice of each such

32
<PAGE> 39
prepayment as provided in Section 5.5 hereof. Eurodollar Loans may be prepaid
on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto and Bankers'
Acceptances may be prepaid on their stated maturity date. Eurodollar Loans and
Bankers' Acceptances may not be otherwise prepaid unless prepayment is
accompanied by payment of all compensation required by Section 6.

(b) Mandatory Prepayments and Cover.

(1) Reduction of Commitments. The Company shall from time to time
on demand by the Administrative Agent prepay the Loans (or provide Cover for
Letter of Credit Liabilities and the face amount of Bankers' Acceptances) in
such amounts as shall be necessary so that at all times the aggregate
outstanding principal amount (including therein the face amount of all
outstanding Bankers' Acceptances) of all Revolving Credit Obligations shall not
be in excess of the Maximum Outstanding Amount plus any Cover provided under
this Section 3.2(b)(1).

(2) Borrowing Base Deficiency. Any payments required to cure any
Borrowing Base Deficiency shall be made by Parent to the lenders under the U.S.
Facility and by the Company to the Banks (with the Maximum Outstanding Amount
to be reduced by the amount of such payments by the Company) in the manner
provided in the Intercreditor Agreement.

(3) Use of Quarterly Equivalent. For purposes of determining
whether any payment is required to be made under this Section 3.2, and the
amount thereof, when such determination requires a conversion of U.S. Dollars
into Canadian Dollars and vice versa, the Quarterly Equivalent shall be used as
the conversion rate.

3.3 Selection of Interest Rates. Subject to Section 5.1 and
Section 6 hereof, the Company shall have the right, by giving written notice to
the Administrative Agent and the Paying Agent as provided in Section 5.5
hereof, either to convert any Bankers' Acceptance (in whole or in part) into a
Loan, to convert any Loan (in whole or in part) into a Bankers' Acceptance, to
convert any Loan (in whole or in part) into a Loan of another Type (provided
that no such conversion of Eurodollar Loans shall be permitted other than on
the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto and no conversion of
Bankers' Acceptances shall be permitted other than on the maturity date
thereof), to continue any Bankers' Acceptance (in whole or in part) or to
continue any Loan (in whole or in part) as a Loan of the same Type. Any such
notice of conversion of a Bankers' Acceptance into a Loan or of conversion of a
Loan into, or continuation of a Loan as, a Eurodollar Loan or a Bankers'
Acceptance shall specify the new Interest Period or maturity date, as
applicable. In the event the Company fails to so give such notice prior to the
end of any Interest Period for any Eurodollar Loan, such Loan shall become an
Alternate Base Rate Loan on the last day of such Interest Period.

3.4 Conditions Applicable to Bankers' Acceptances.

(a) Acceptance and Purchase of Bankers' Acceptances. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Bank agrees to accept its
Commitment Percentage of

33
<PAGE> 40
Bankers' Acceptances issued by the Company and to purchase same at the
applicable Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Discount Rate and to provide to the
Paying Agent for the account of the Company the Canadian Bankers' Acceptance
Discount Proceeds in respect thereof less the applicable acceptance fees
payable by the Company to such Bank pursuant to Section 4.3. Each such Bank
may at any time and from time to time hold, sell, rediscount or otherwise
dispose of any or all Bankers' Acceptances purchased by it.

(b) Waiver of Presentment and Other Conditions. The Company
waives presentment for payment and any other defence to payment of any amounts
due to a Bank in respect of a Bankers' Acceptance accepted and purchased by it
pursuant to this Agreement which might exist solely by reason of such Bankers'
Acceptance being held, at the maturity thereof, by such Bank in its own right
and the Company agrees not to claim any days of grace if such Bank as holder
sues the Company on the Bankers' Acceptance for payment of the amount payable
by the Company thereunder. On the specified maturity date of a Bankers'
Acceptance, or such earlier date as may be required or permitted pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall pay the Bank that has
accepted and purchased such Bankers' Acceptance the full face amount of such
Bankers' Acceptance.

(c) Terms of Each Bankers' Acceptance: Each Bankers' Acceptance
shall:

(1) have a maturity date which shall be on a Business Day;

(2) have a term of not less than thirty (30) days and not
more than one hundred and eighty (180) days
(excluding days of grace);

(3) be in the form of Exhibit K attached hereto or in
such other form as the Company may agree to in 
writing;

(4) be issued in face amounts of Canadian $100,000 or
whole multiples thereof (each of the Banks agrees
that it will use its best efforts to minimize the
number of separate Bankers' Acceptances required to
be executed); and

(5) not have a maturity date which extends beyond the end
of the scheduled Revolving Credit Availability
Period.

(d) Delivery of Blank Bankers' Acceptances. As a condition
precedent to each Banks' obligation to accept and purchase Bankers' Acceptances
hereunder, the Company shall have delivered to such Bank through the Paying
Agent at the Payment Office sufficient bankers' acceptances endorsed in blank
in sufficient time for such Bank to forward to and hold the same for issuance
in accordance with a request from the Company. Each Bank is hereby authorized
to issue such bankers' acceptances endorsed in blank in such face amounts as
may be determined by such Bank; provided that the aggregate amount thereof is
equal to the aggregate amount of

34
<PAGE> 41
Bankers' Acceptances required to be accepted and purchased by such Bank
hereunder. No Bank shall be liable for any damage, loss or other claim arising
by reason of any loss or improper use of any bankers' acceptance endorsed in
blank except any loss arising by reason of the negligence or wilful misconduct
of such Bank or its officers, employees, agents or representatives. The Paying
Agent shall maintain a record with respect to bankers' acceptances endorsed in
blank that are received from the Company and that are delivered to a Bank
hereunder. Each Bank shall maintain a record with respect to bankers'
acceptances endorsed in blank that are:

(1) received by such Bank from the Paying Agent hereunder;

(2) voided by such Bank for any reason;

(3) accepted and purchased by such Bank hereunder; and

(4) cancelled by such Bank at the maturity thereof.

Each Bank agrees to provide such record to the Paying Agent upon request
therefor by the Paying Agent as well as concurrently with any request by such
Bank to the Paying Agent for any additional bankers' acceptances endorsed in
blank required from the Company. The Paying Agent shall provide a report of
such records received by the Paying Agent to the Company upon request from the
Company.

(e) Failure to Give Notice of Repayment. If the Company fails to
give notice to the Paying Agent at the Payment Office of the method of
repayment of a Bankers' Acceptance prior to the date of maturity of such
Bankers' Acceptance in accordance with the same period of notice required for
the original acceptance of such Bankers' Acceptance as set forth herein, the
face amount of such Bankers' Acceptance shall, on its maturity, automatically
be converted to a Canadian Prime Rate Loan.

(f) Execution of Bankers' Acceptances. Bankers' acceptances of
the Company which are endorsed in blank and are to be accepted as Bankers'
Acceptances hereunder shall be signed by a duly authorized signatory or duly
authorized signatories of the Company, and may, at the option of the Company,
be signed by way of affixing a reproduction of the signature or signatures of
such duly authorized signatory or signatories. Notwithstanding that any person
whose signature appears on any Bankers' Acceptance as a signatory may no longer
be an authorized signatory of the Company at the date of issuance of a Bankers'
Acceptance, and notwithstanding that the signature affixed may be a
reproduction only, such signature shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient
for all purposes as if such authority had remained in force at the time of such
issuance and as if such signature had been manually applied, and any such
Bankers' Acceptance so signed shall be binding on the Company.

35
<PAGE> 42
3.5 Paying Agent's Duties Re Bankers' Acceptances.

(a) Advice to the Lenders. The Paying Agent, promptly following
receipt of a Request for Extension of Credit by way of Bankers' Acceptance,
shall so advise the Banks and shall advise each Bank of the amount of each
issue of Bankers' Acceptances to be accepted and purchased by it and the term
thereof, which term shall be identical for all Banks.

(b) Agent's Confirmation of Bankers' Acceptance Issuance. At or
prior to 11:00 a.m. (Toronto, Ontario time) on the date on which the Bankers'
Acceptances are to be accepted and purchased hereunder, the Paying Agent shall
provide telephone advice to the Company and each Bank confirming the
particulars with respect to the issuance, acceptance and purchase of such
Bankers' Acceptances. Such advice shall be confirmed in writing at or prior to
4:30 p.m. (Toronto, Ontario time) on such date by delivery to the Company and
each Bank of a written confirmation of such telephone advice with respect to
the issuance, acceptance and purchase of such Bankers' Acceptances. Each Bank
will forthwith advise the Paying Agent of the particulars of the Bankers'
Acceptances accepted and purchased by it.

(c) Completion of Bankers' Acceptance. Upon receipt of the
telephone advice referred to in Section 3.5(a), each Bank is thereupon
authorized to complete bankers' acceptances held by it in blank in accordance
with the particulars so advised by the Paying Agent.

(d) Paying Agent's Discretion on Allocation. In the event it is
not practicable to allocate Bankers' Acceptances to each Lender in accordance
with Section 5.2 such that the aggregate amount of Bankers' Acceptances
required to be accepted and purchased by such Bank hereunder is in a whole
multiple of Canadian $100,000, the Paying Agent is authorized by the Company
and each Bank to make such allocation as the Paying Agent determines in its
sole and unfettered discretion may be equitable in the circumstances.

36
<PAGE> 43
3.6 Certain Provisions Relating to Bankers' Acceptances Forms.

(a) The Company shall hold and use prudently the bankers'
acceptance forms delivered to it in blank from time to time and shall return
them from time to time to the Paying Agent for onward conveyance to the
respective Banks, properly pre-signed and pre-endorsed and in sufficient
quantities to be dealt with by each Bank in conformity with this Agreement.
The Paying Agent shall provide to the Company written acknowledgment of the
receipt of such pre-signed and pre-endorsed bankers' acceptance forms.

(b) The Paying Agent and each Bank shall deal prudently with any
bankers' acceptance forms pre-signed and pre-endorsed by the Company and
delivered from time to time by the Company and shall use them only in
accordance with the instructions of the Company given to the Paying Agent, in
conformity with this Agreement.

(c) In accordance with the instructions given from time to time by
the Company, each Bank is hereby authorized to complete the aforementioned
bankers' acceptance forms, to provide its acceptance thereon and, at such
Bank's option, to put them into circulation, the whole as provided in and
subject to this Agreement.

(d) Neither the Paying Agent nor any Bank shall be responsible or
liable for any failure to make credit available by way of Bankers' Acceptances
under the terms of the Credit Agreement if such failure is due to the failure
of the Company to return duly pre-signed and pre-endorsed bankers' acceptance
forms to the Paying Agent on a timely basis.

(e) On request by the Paying Agent on behalf of the Banks, the
Company shall return to the Paying Agent all bankers' acceptance forms then
held by the Company, provided that all such bankers' acceptance forms which
have been pre-signed or pre-endorsed by the Company may be cancelled prior to
their return and on request by the Company made to the Paying Agent, a Bank
shall cancel all pre-signed or pre-endorsed bankers' acceptance forms held by
such Bank and not yet issued in accordance with the Company's instructions and
shall confirm such cancellation to the Paying Agent who shall in turn inform
the Company.

SECTION 4. PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST.

4.1 Repayment of Loans and Reimbursement Obligations. The Company
will pay to the Paying Agent for the account of each Bank (a) the principal of
each Loan made by such Bank on the dates provided in the respective Notes and
as provided hereunder, (b) the face amount of each Bankers' Acceptance on its
maturity date and (c) the amount of each Reimbursement Obligation promptly upon
its occurrence. The face amount of any Bankers' Acceptance or the amount of
any Reimbursement Obligation may, if the applicable conditions precedent
specified in Section 7 hereof have been satisfied, be paid with the proceeds of
Loans. Repayments of Loans or Reimbursement Obligations denominated in
Canadian Dollars and

37
<PAGE> 44
repayments of Bankers' Acceptances shall be made in Canadian Dollars and
repayments of Loans or Reimbursement Obligations denominated in U.S. Dollars
shall be made in U.S. Dollars.

4.2 Interest. (a) Subject to Section 13.6 hereof, the
Company will pay to the Paying Agent for the account of each Bank interest on
the unpaid principal amount of each Loan made by such Bank for the period
commencing on the date of such Loan to but excluding the date such Loan shall
be paid in full, in the currency in which the Loan is denominated, at the
lesser of (I) the following rates per annum:

(i) if such Loan is an Alternate Base Rate Loan, the
Alternate Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin, and

(ii) if such Loan is a Canadian Prime Rate Loan, the
Canadian Prime Rate plus the Applicable Margin, and

(iii) if such Loan is a Eurodollar Loan, the applicable
Eurodollar Rate plus the Applicable Margin,

or (II) the Highest Lawful Rate.

(b) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing but subject to Section
13.6 hereof, the Company will pay to the Paying Agent for the account of each
Bank interest in the applicable currency at the applicable Post-Default Rate on
any principal of any Loan made by such Bank, on any Reimbursement Obligation
and on any other amount payable by the Company hereunder to or for the account
of such Bank (but, if such amount is interest, only to the extent legally
allowed), which shall not be paid in full when due (whether at stated maturity,
by acceleration or otherwise), for the period commencing on the due date
thereof until the same is paid in full.

(c) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable on the last day
of each Interest Period for such Loan (and, if such Interest Period exceeds
three months' duration, quarterly, commencing on the first quarterly
anniversary of the first day of such Interest Period), except that (i) accrued
interest payable at the Post-Default Rate shall be due and payable from time to
time on demand of the Administrative Agent or the Majority Banks (through the
Administrative Agent) and (ii) accrued interest on any amount prepaid or
converted pursuant to Section 6 hereof shall be paid on the amount so prepaid
or converted.

4.3 Acceptance Fees. The Company shall pay to each Bank
acceptance fees in Canadian Dollars forthwith upon the acceptance by such Bank
of each Bankers' Acceptance issued by the Company at a rate per annum equal to
the B/A Stamping Rate in effect at the time of the acceptance of such Bankers'
Acceptance, calculated on the face amount of such Bankers' Acceptance and on
the basis of the number of days in the term of such Bankers' Acceptance divided
by three hundred sixty-five (365). Acceptance fees payable to the Banks
pursuant to this Section 4.3 shall be paid in the manner specified in Section
3.4(a).

SECTION 5. PAYMENTS; PRO RATA TREATMENT; COMPUTATIONS, ETC.

5.1 Payments.

(a) Except to the extent otherwise provided herein, all payments of
principal, interest, the full face amount of Bankers' Acceptances,
Reimbursement Obligations and other amounts to be made by the Company hereunder
and under the Notes and the other Loan Documents shall be made in U.S. Dollars
or Canadian Dollars, as the case may be, in immediately available funds, to the
Paying Agent at the Payment Office (or in the case of a successor Paying Agent,
at the payment office designated by such successor Paying Agent in Canada), not
later than 11:00 a.m. Toronto, Ontario time on the date on which such payment
shall become due (each such payment made after such time on such due date to be
deemed to have been made on the next succeeding Business Day). The Paying
Agent, or any Bank for whose account any such payment is made, may (but shall
not be obligated to) debit the amount of any such payment which is not made by
such time to any ordinary deposit account of the Company with the Paying Agent
or such Bank, as the case may be.

(b) The Company shall, at the time of making each payment
hereunder or under any Note or any other Loan Document, specify to the Paying
Agent the Loans, the Bankers' Acceptances or other amounts payable by the
Company hereunder or thereunder to which such payment is to be applied. Each
payment received by the Paying Agent hereunder or under any Note, Bankers'
Acceptance or any other Loan Document for the account of a Bank shall be paid
promptly to such Bank, in immediately available funds for the account of such
Bank's Applicable Lending Office.

(c) If the due date of any payment hereunder or under any Note or
any other Loan Document falls on a day which is not a Business Day, the due
date for such payment (subject to the definition of Interest Period) shall be
extended to the next succeeding Business Day and interest shall be payable for
any principal so extended for the period of such extension.

5.2 Pro Rata Treatment. Except to the extent otherwise provided
herein: (a) each borrowing from the Banks under Section 2.1 hereof shall be
made ratably from the Banks on the basis of their respective Commitments and
each payment of commitment fees shall be made for the account of the Banks, and
each termination or reduction of the Commitments of the Banks under Section 2.3
hereof shall be applied, pro rata, according to the Banks' respective
Commitments; (b) each payment by the Company of the full face amount of
Bankers' Acceptances and principal of or interest on Loans of a particular Type
shall be made to the Paying Agent for the account of the Banks pro rata in
accordance with the respective full face amount of such Bankers' Acceptances or
the unpaid principal amounts of such Loans held by the Banks; and (c) the Banks
(other than the applicable Issuer) shall purchase from the applicable Issuer
participations in the Letters of Credit to the extent of their respective
Commitment Percentages.

39
<PAGE> 46
5.3 Computations. Subject to Section 13.7, interest based on the
Eurodollar Base Rate or the Federal Funds Rate will be computed on the basis of
a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which payable, unless the
effect of so computing shall be to cause the rate of interest to exceed the
Highest Lawful Rate, in which case interest shall be calculated on the basis of
the actual number of days elapsed in a year composed of 365 or 366 days, as the
case may be. All other interest and fees shall be computed on the basis of a
year of 365 (or 366) days and actual days elapsed (including the first day but
excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which payable.

5.4 Minimum and Maximum Amounts. Except for prepayments made
pursuant to Section 3.2(b) hereof, each borrowing and repayment of principal of
Loans, each acceptance, purchase and repayment of Bankers' Acceptances and each
termination or reduction of Commitments, each optional prepayment and each
conversion of Type shall be in an aggregate principal amount at least equal to
(a) in the case of Eurodollar Loans, U.S. $5,000,000,(b) in the case of
Bankers' Acceptances, Canadian $5,000,000, (c) in the case of Canadian Prime
Rate Loans, Canadian $1,000,000, and (d) in the case of Alternate Base Rate
Loans, U.S. $1,000,000 (borrowings or prepayments of Loans of different Types
or, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, having different Interest Periods at the
same time hereunder to be deemed separate borrowings and prepayments for
purposes of the foregoing, one for each Type or Interest Period). Upon any
mandatory prepayment that would reduce Eurodollar Loans having the same
Interest Period to less than U.S. $5,000,000 such Loans shall automatically be
converted into Alternate Base Rate Loans. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, there shall not be, at any one time, more
than eight (8) Interest Periods in effect with respect to Eurodollar Loans.

5.5 Certain Actions, Notices, Etc. Notices to the Administrative
Agent and the Paying Agent of any termination or reduction of Commitments, of
borrowings and prepayments, of issuance, acceptance and purchase of Bankers'
Acceptances, of conversions and continuations of Loans and Bankers'
Acceptances, of the term of Bankers' Acceptances and of the duration of
Interest Periods shall be irrevocable and shall be effective only if received
by the Administrative Agent and the Paying Agent not later than 11:00 a.m.
Toronto, Ontario time on the number of Business Days prior to the date of the
relevant termination, reduction, borrowing and/or repayment, conversion or

Each such notice of termination or reduction shall specify the amount of the
Commitments to be terminated or reduced. Each such notice of borrowing or
prepayment shall specify the amount of Bankers' Acceptances to be accepted and
purchased or prepaid and the Type of the Loans to be borrowed or prepaid
(subject to Sections 3.2(a) and 5.4 hereof), the date of borrowing, acceptance
and purchase or prepayment (which shall be a Business Day) and, in the case of
Eurodollar Loans, the duration of the Interest Period therefor (subject to the
definition of "Interest Period") and, in the case of Bankers' Acceptances, the
term and maturity date therefor (subject to Section 3.4(c)). Each such notice
of conversion of a Bankers' Acceptance into a Loan or conversion of a Loan into
a Loan of another Type or a Bankers' Acceptance shall identify such Bankers'
Acceptance or Loan (or portion thereof) being converted and specify the Type of
Loan into which such Bankers' Acceptance or Loan is being converted (subject to
Section 5.4 hereof) and the date for conversion (which shall be a Business Day)
and, unless such Bankers' Acceptance or Loan is being converted into an
Alternate Base Rate Loan or a Canadian Prime Rate Loan, the duration (subject
to the definition of "Interest Period") of the Interest Period therefor which
is to commence as of the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor
(or the date of conversion, if such Loan is being converted from an Alternate
Base Rate Loan or a Canadian Prime Rate Loan). In the case of any such notice
for a Bankers' Acceptance, the term and maturity date of such Bankers'
Acceptance shall also be specified. Each such notice of continuation of a Loan
(or portion thereof) as the same Type of Loan shall identify such Loan (or
portion thereof) being continued (subject to Section 5.4 hereof) and, unless
such Loan is an Alternate Base Rate Loan or a Canadian Prime Rate Loan, the
duration (subject to the definition of "Interest Period") of the Interest
Period therefor which is to commence as of the last day of the then current
Interest Period therefor. The Paying Agent shall promptly notify the affected
Banks of the contents of each such notice. Notice of any prepayment having
been given, the principal amount specified in such notice, together with
interest thereon to the date of prepayment, shall be due and payable on such
prepayment date.

5.6 Non-Receipt of Funds by the Paying Agent. Unless the
Paying Agent shall have been notified by a Bank or the Company (the "Payor")
prior to the date on which such Bank is to make payment to the Paying Agent of
the Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Discount Proceeds in respect of a Bankers'
Acceptance to be purchased by it or the proceeds of a Loan to be made by it
hereunder (or the payment of any amount by such Bank to reimburse the
applicable Issuer for a drawing under any Letter of Credit) or the Company is
to make a payment to the Paying Agent for the account of one or more of the
Banks, as the case may be (such payment being herein called the "Required
Payment"), which notice shall be effective upon receipt, that the Payor does
not intend to make the Required Payment to the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent
may assume that the Required Payment has been made and may, in reliance upon
such assumption (but shall not be required to), make the amount thereof
available to the intended recipient on such date and, if the Payor has not in
fact made the Required Payment to the Paying Agent on or before such date, the
recipient of such payment (or, if such recipient is the beneficiary of a Letter
of Credit, the Company and, if the Company fails to pay the amount thereof to
the Paying Agent forthwith upon demand, the Banks ratably in proportion to
their respective Commitment Percentages) shall, on demand, pay to the Paying
Agent the amount

42
<PAGE> 49
made available to it together with interest thereon in respect of the period
commencing on the date such amount was so made available by the Paying Agent
until the date the Paying Agent recovers such amount at a per annum rate of
interest determined by the Paying Agent (such rate to be conclusive and binding
on the Banks) in accordance with the Paying Agent's usual banking practice for
similar advances to financial institutions of like standing to the applicable
Bank.

5.7 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If a Bank shall obtain
payment of the full face amount of an outstanding Bankers' Acceptance accepted
and purchased by it under this Agreement or of any principal of or interest on
any Loan made by it under this Agreement, or on any Reimbursement Obligation or
other obligation then due to such Bank hereunder, through the exercise of any
right of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or similar right, or otherwise,
it shall promptly purchase from the other Banks participations in the Loans
made, the outstanding Bankers' Acceptances or Reimbursement Obligations or
other obligations held, by the other Banks in such amounts, and make such other
adjustments from time to time as shall be equitable to the end that all the
Banks shall share the benefit of such payment (net of any expenses which may be
incurred by such Bank in obtaining or preserving such benefit) pro rata in
accordance with the unpaid principal and interest on the Obligations then due
to each of them. To such end all the Banks shall make appropriate adjustments
among themselves (by the resale of participations sold or otherwise) if such
payment is rescinded or must otherwise be restored. The Company agrees, to the
fullest extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Bank so
purchasing a participation in the Loans made, the outstanding Bankers'
Acceptances or Reimbursement Obligations or other obligations held, by other
Banks may exercise all rights of set-off, bankers' lien, counterclaim or
similar rights with respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were
a direct holder of Loans, Bankers' Acceptances and Reimbursement Obligations or
other obligations in the amount of such participation. Nothing contained
herein shall require any Bank to exercise any such right or shall affect the
right of any Bank to exercise, and retain the benefits of exercising, any such
right with respect to any other Indebtedness or obligation of the Company.

SECTION 6. YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY.

6.1 Additional Costs.

(a) Subject to Section 13.6, the Company shall pay to the
Paying Agent, on demand for the account of each Bank from time to time such
amounts as such Bank may determine to be necessary to compensate it for any
costs incurred by such Bank which such Bank determines are attributable to its
making or maintaining of any Eurodollar Loan or any Bankers' Acceptance
hereunder or its obligation to make any such Loan hereunder, or any reduction
in any amount receivable by such Bank hereunder in respect of any of such Loans
or such obligation (such increases in costs and reductions in amounts
receivable being herein called "Additional Costs"), in each case resulting from
any Regulatory Change which:

43
<PAGE> 50
(i) subjects such Bank (or makes it apparent that
such Bank is subject) to any tax, levy, impost, duty, charge or fee
(collectively, "Taxes"), or any deduction or withholding for any Taxes on or
from the payment due in respect of any Bankers' Acceptance or under any
Eurodollar Loan or other amounts due hereunder, other than income and franchise
taxes of the jurisdiction (or any subdivision thereof) in which such Bank has
an office or its Applicable Lending Office; or

(ii) changes the basis of taxation of any amounts
payable to such Bank under this Agreement or its Notes in respect of any of
such Loans or in respect of Bankers' Acceptances (other than changes which
affect taxes measured by or imposed on the overall net income or franchise
taxes of such Bank or of its Applicable Lending Office for any of such Loans by
the jurisdiction (or any subdivision thereof) in which such Bank has an office
or such Applicable Lending Office); or

(iii) imposes or modifies or increases or deems
applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirements (including,
without limitation, any such requirement imposed by the Office of the
Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada) relating to any extensions of
credit or other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities of, such
Bank or loans made by such Bank, or Bankers' Acceptances accepted by such Bank
or against any other funds, obligations or other property owned or held by such
Bank (including any of such Loans or, where applicable, any deposits referred
to in the definition of "Eurodollar Base Rate" in Section 1.1 hereof or any
Bankers' Acceptances) and such Bank actually incurs such additional costs; or

(iv) imposes any other condition affecting this
Agreement (or any of such extensions of credit or liabilities).

Each Bank (if so requested by the Company through the Administrative Agent)
will designate a different available Applicable Lending Office for the
Eurodollar Loans or the Bankers' Acceptances of such Bank or take such other
action as the Company may request if such designation or action will avoid the
need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation and will not, in the sole
opinion of such Bank, be disadvantageous to such Bank (provided that such Bank
shall have no obligation so to designate an Applicable Lending Office for
Eurodollar Loans located in the United States of America or to designate an
Applicable Lending Office for Bankers' Acceptances located in any jurisdiction
that is not located in Canada). Each Bank will furnish the Company with a
statement setting forth the basis and amount of each request by such Bank for
compensation under this Section 6.1(a); subject to Section 6.8, such
certificate shall be conclusive, absent manifest error, and may be prepared
using any reasonable averaging and attribution methods.

(b) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing
provisions of this Section 6.1, in the event that, by reason of any Regulatory
Change, any Bank either (i) incurs Additional Costs based on or measured by the
excess above a specified level of the amount of a category of

44
<PAGE> 51
deposits or other liabilities of such Bank which includes deposits by reference
to which the interest rate on Eurodollar Loans is determined as provided in
this Agreement or a category of extensions of credit or other assets of such
Bank which includes Eurodollar Loans or Bankers' Acceptances or (ii) becomes
subject to restrictions on the amount of such a category of liabilities or
assets which it may hold, then, if such Bank so elects by notice to the Company
(with a copy to the Administrative Agent and the Paying Agent), the obligation
of such Bank to make Eurodollar Loans or accept and purchase Bankers'
Acceptances, as applicable, hereunder shall be suspended until the date such
Regulatory Change ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of
Section 6.4 hereof shall be applicable).

(c) Good faith determinations and allocations by any Bank
for purposes of this Section 6.1 of the effect of any Regulatory Change on its
costs of maintaining its obligations to make Loans or accept and purchase
Bankers' Acceptances or of making or maintaining Loans or accepting and
purchasing Bankers' Acceptances on amounts receivable by it in respect of Loans
or Bankers' Acceptances, and of the additional amounts required to compensate
such Bank in respect of any Additional Costs, shall be conclusive, absent
manifest error.

(d) The Company's obligation to pay Additional Costs and
compensation with regard to each Eurodollar Loan and each Bankers' Acceptance
shall survive termination of this Agreement.

6.2 Limitations. Anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, if, with respect to any Eurodollar Loans or Bankers'
Acceptance:

(a) the Paying Agent determines in good faith (which
determination shall be conclusive) that quotations of interest rates for the
relevant deposits referred to in the definition of "Eurodollar Base Rate" in
Section 1.1 hereof are not being provided by the Reference Banks in the
relevant amounts or for the relevant maturities for purposes of determining the
rate of interest for such Loans for Interest Periods therefor as provided in
this Agreement; or

(b) the Paying Agent determines in good faith (which
determination shall be conclusive) that quotations of discount rates for the
purchase of Canadian Dollar bankers' acceptances referred to in the definition
of "Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Discount Rate" in Section 1.1 hereof are not
being provided by the Reference Banks in the relevant amounts or for the
relevant maturities for purposes of determining the Canadian Bankers'
Acceptance Discount Rate therefor as provided in this Agreement; or

(c) the Majority Banks determine (which determination
shall be conclusive) and notify the Paying Agent (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) that the relevant rates of interest referred to in the
definition of "Eurodollar Base Rate" in Section 1.1 hereof upon the basis of
which the rates of interest for such Loans (where applicable) are to be
determined do not accurately reflect the cost to such Banks of making or
maintaining such Loans for Interest Periods therefor; or

45
<PAGE> 52
(d) the Paying Agent determines in good faith (which
determination shall be conclusive) that by reason of circumstances affecting
the interbank U.S. Dollar market generally, deposits in United States dollars
in the relevant interbank U.S. Dollar market are not being offered for the
applicable Interest Period and in an amount equal to the amount of the
Eurodollar Loan requested by the Company;

then the Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Company and each Bank thereof,
and, so long as such condition remains in effect, the Banks shall be under no
obligation to make Eurodollar Loans or accept and purchase Bankers'
Acceptances, as the case may be (but shall maintain until the end of the
Interest Period then in effect the Eurodollar Loans and until the specified
maturity date of the Bankers' Acceptances, as the case may be, then
outstanding).

6.3 Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, if (x) by reason of the adoption of any
applicable Legal Requirement or any change in any applicable Legal Requirement
or in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental
Authority or compliance by any Bank with any request or directive (whether or
not having the force of law) of any central bank or other Governmental
Authority or (y) with respect to Eurodollar Loans, circumstances affecting the
relevant interbank U.S. Dollar market or the position of a Bank therein or (z)
with respect to Bankers' Acceptances, circumstances affecting the market for
Canadian Dollar bankers' acceptance or the position of a Bank therein shall at
any time make it unlawful or impracticable in the sole discretion of a Bank
exercised in good faith for such Bank or its Applicable Lending Office to (a)
honour its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans or accept and purchase Bankers'
Acceptances, as the case may be, hereunder, or (b) maintain Eurodollar Loans or
Bankers' Acceptances, as the case may be, hereunder, then such Bank shall
promptly notify the Company thereof through the Paying Agent and such Bank's
obligation to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans or accept and purchase Bankers'
Acceptances, as the case may be, hereunder shall be suspended until such time
as such Bank may again make and maintain Eurodollar Loans or accept and
purchase Bankers' Acceptances, as the case may be (in which case the provisions
of Section 6.4 hereof shall be applicable). Before giving such notice pursuant
to this Section 6.3 with respect to Eurodollar Loans only, such Bank will
designate a different available Applicable Lending Office for the Eurodollar
Loans of such Bank or take such other action as the Company may request if such
designation or action will avoid the need to suspend such Bank's obligation to
make Eurodollar Loans hereunder and will not, in the sole opinion of such Bank
exercised in good faith, be disadvantageous to such Bank (provided, that such
Bank may not designate an Applicable Lending Office that is not located in
Canada).

6.4 Substitute Alternate Base Rate Loans or Canadian Prime
Rate Loans. If the obligation of any Bank to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans
shall be suspended pursuant to Section 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3 hereof, all Loans which
would otherwise be made by such Bank as Eurodollar Loans shall be made instead
as Alternate Base Rate Loans (and, if an event referred to in Section 6.1(b) or
6.3 hereof has occurred and such Bank so requests by notice to the Company with
a copy to the Paying Agent, each Eurodollar Loan of such Bank then outstanding

46
<PAGE> 53
shall be automatically converted into an Alternate Base Rate Loan on the date
specified by such Bank in such notice) and, to the extent that Eurodollar Loans
are so made as (or converted into) Alternate Base Rate Loans, all payments of
principal which would otherwise be applied to such Eurodollar Loans shall be
applied instead to such Alternate Base Rate Loans. If the obligation of any
Bank to accept and purchase Bankers' Acceptances shall be suspended pursuant to
Section 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3 hereof, all advances which would otherwise be made by
such Bank by way of acceptance and purchase of Bankers' Acceptances shall be
made instead as Canadian Prime Rate Loans (and, if an event referred to in
Section 6.1(b) or 6.3 hereof has occurred and such Bank so requests by notice
to the Company with a copy to the Paying Agent, the face amount of each
Bankers' Acceptance of such Bank then outstanding shall be automatically
converted into a Canadian Prime Rate Loan on the date specified by such Bank in
such notice).

6.5 Compensation. Subject to Section 13.6 hereof, the
Company shall pay to the Paying Agent for the account of each Bank, within four
(4) Business Days after demand therefor by such Bank through the Administrative
Agent, such amount or amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion
of such Bank) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as
a result of:

(a) any payment, prepayment or conversion of a Eurodollar
Loan made by such Bank or a Bankers' Acceptance accepted by such Bank on a date
other than the last day of an Interest Period for such Eurodollar Loan or the
specified maturity date for such Bankers' Acceptance, as the case may be; or

(b) any failure by the Company to borrow a Eurodollar Loan
to be made by such Bank or to issue a Bankers' Acceptance to be accepted and
purchased by such Bank on the date for such borrowing or such issuance
specified in the relevant notice under Section 5.5 hereof or to convert a
Eurodollar Loan into a Bankers' Acceptance or a Loan of another Type or to
convert a Bankers' Acceptance into a Loan on such date after giving notice of
such conversion;

such compensation to include, without limitation, any loss or expense incurred
by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
acquired by the applicable Bank to fund or maintain its share of any Loan or to
fund the acceptance and purchase of any Bankers' Acceptance. Compensation due
pursuant to this Section with respect to Bankers' Acceptances shall be
calculated using the Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Discount Rate for bankers'
acceptances maturing on (or as close as reasonably possible) to the maturity
date of the Bankers' Acceptances with respect to which such compensation arises
(versus the actual Canadian Bankers' Acceptance Discount Rate for such Bankers'
Acceptances). Subject to Section 6.8, each determination of the amount of such
compensation by a Bank shall be conclusive and binding, absent manifest error,
and may be computed using any reasonable averaging and attribution method.

6.6 Additional Costs in Respect of Letters of Credit. If
as a result of any Regulatory Change there shall be imposed, modified or deemed
applicable any tax, reserve, special deposit

47
<PAGE> 54
or similar requirement against or with respect to or measured by reference to
Letters of Credit issued or to be issued hereunder or participations in such
Letters of Credit, and the result shall be to increase the cost to any Bank of
issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or any participation therein, or
reduce any amount receivable by any Bank hereunder in respect of any Letter of
Credit or any participation therein (which increase in cost, or reduction in
amount receivable, shall be the result of such Bank's reasonable allocation of
the aggregate of such increases or reductions resulting from such event), then
such Bank shall notify the Company through the Administrative Agent, and upon
demand therefor by such Bank through the Administrative Agent, the Company
(subject to Section 13.6 hereof) shall pay to such Bank, from time to time as
specified by such Bank, such additional amounts as shall be sufficient to
compensate such Bank for such increased costs or reductions in amount. Before
making such demand pursuant to this Section 6.6, such Bank will designate a
different available Applicable Lending Office for the Letter of Credit of such
Bank or take such other action as the Company may request, if such designation
or action will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation
and will not, in the sole opinion of such Bank exercised in good faith, be
disadvantageous to such Bank. A statement as to such increased costs or
reductions in amount incurred by such Bank, submitted by such Bank to the
Company, shall be conclusive as to the amount thereof, absent manifest error.

6.7 Capital Adequacy. If any Bank shall have determined
that the adoption after the date hereof or effectiveness after the date hereof
(whether or not previously announced) of any applicable law, rule, regulation
or treaty regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein after the date
hereof, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof after the
date hereof by any Governmental Authority charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its Applicable Lending
Office) with any request or directive after the date hereof regarding capital
adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental
Authority has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
Bank's capital as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder, under the
Loans made by it, under the Bankers' Acceptances accepted and purchased by it,
under the Letters of Credit and under the Notes held by it to a level below
that which such Bank could have achieved but for such adoption, change or
compliance (taking into consideration such Bank's policies with respect to
capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank to be material, then from
time to time, upon satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in this
Section 6.7, upon demand by such Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent
and the Paying Agent), the Company (subject to Section 13.6 hereof) shall pay
to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank for
such reduction. A certificate as to such amounts, submitted to the Company and
the Administrative Agent and the Paying Agent by such Bank, setting forth the
basis for such Bank's determination of such amounts, shall constitute a demand
therefor and shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error. The Company shall pay the amount shown as due on any such certificate
within four (4) Business Days after delivery of such certificate. Subject to
Section 6.8, in preparing such certificate, a Bank may employ such assumptions
and allocations of costs and expenses as it shall in good faith deem reasonable
and may use any reasonable averaging and attribution method.

48
<PAGE> 55
6.8 Limitation on Additional Charges; Substitute Banks;
Non-Discrimination. Anything in this Section 6 notwithstanding:

(a) the Company shall not be required to pay to any Bank
reimbursement with regard to any costs or expenses, unless such Bank notifies
the Company of such costs or expenses within 90 days after the date paid or
incurred;

(b) none of the Banks shall be permitted to pass through
to the Company charges and costs under this Section 6 on a discriminatory basis
(i.e., which are not also passed through by such Bank to other customers of
such Bank similarly situated where such customer is subject to documents

engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the business of
extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying margin stocks.

or any ERISA Affiliate to the PBGC or a Plan (other than to make contributions

which owns, controls or holds with power to vote, directly or indirectly, a
sufficient quantity of the voting securities of the Parent to be construed as a
"holding company", as such term is defined in the PUHC Act, in respect of the
Parent. All of the information contained in such Applications, as amended, was

Parent may, unless it has actual current knowledge to the contrary, rely solely
upon written information furnished by any Specified Shareholder with respect to
background information about the Specified Shareholder and the nature of the
ownership by such Specified Shareholder or its Affiliates of the voting
securities of the Parent), and the Parent knows of no reason why each such
Application, if acted upon by the Securities and Exchange Commission, would not
be approved. True and correct copies of each such Application and any
amendments thereto, as

operations have been and are in compliance with all applicable Requirements of
Environmental Law and Environmental Permits failure to comply with which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (iii) the Parent and
its Subsidiaries and their properties, assets, business and operations are not
subject to any (A) Environmental Claims or (B) Environmental Liabilities, in
either case direct or contingent, and whether known or unknown, arising from or
based upon any act, omission, event, condition or circumstance occurring or
existing on or prior to the date hereof which could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, and (iv) no Responsible Officer of the Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of any violation or alleged
violation of any Requirements of Environmental Law or Environmental Permit or
any Environmental Claim in connection with its assets, properties, business or
operations which could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. The liability (including without limitation any Environmental
Liability and any other damage to persons or property), if any, of the Parent
and its Subsidiaries and with respect to their properties, assets, business and
operations which is reasonably expected to arise in connection with
Requirements of Environmental Laws currently in effect and other environmental
matters presently known by a Responsible Officer of the Parent will not have a
Material Adverse Effect. No Responsible Officer of the Parent knows of any
event or condition with respect to Environmental Matters with respect to any of
its properties or the properties of any of its Subsidiaries which could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. For purposes of this
Section 8.19, "Environmental Matters" shall mean matters relating to pollution
or protection of the environment, including, without limitation, emissions,
discharges, releases or threatened releases of Hazardous Substances into the
environment (including, without limitation, ambient air, surface water or

transport or handling of Hazardous Substances.

8.20 Claims and Liabilities. Except as disclosed to the
Banks in writing, neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has accrued
any liabilities under gas purchase contracts for gas not taken, but for which
it is liable to pay if not made up and which, if not paid, would have a
Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed to the Banks in writing, no
claims exist against the Parent or its Subsidiaries for gas imbalances which
claims if adversely determined would have a Material Adverse Effect. No
purchaser of product supplied by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has any
claim against the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries for product paid for, but
for which delivery was not taken as and when paid for, which claim if adversely
determined would have a Material Adverse Effect.

specified in Section 11.1 to authorize the Administrative Agent to declare the
Notes and the full face amount of all Bankers' Acceptances outstanding due and

authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to the Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (any such notice being expressly waived by the Parent
and its Subsidiaries), to setoff and apply any and all deposits (general or
special, time or demand, provisional or final, whether or not such setoff
results in any loss of interest or other penalty, and including without
limitation all certificates of deposit) at any time held, and any other funds
or property at any time held, and other Indebtedness at any time owing by any
Bank to or for the credit or the account of the Company against any and all of

demand under this Agreement, any Bankers' Acceptances or the Notes and although

funds in any manner set forth hereinabove be challenged and any application of
such funds be reversed, whether by court order or otherwise, the Banks shall
make restitution or refund to the Company pro rata in accordance with their
Commitments. The Banks agree promptly to notify the Company and the
Administrative Agent and the Paying Agent after any such setoff and
application, provided that the failure to give such notice will not affect the
validity of such setoff and application. The rights of the Agents and the
Banks under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies
(including without limitation other rights of setoff) which the Agents or the
Banks may have.

SECTION 12. THE AGENTS.

12.1 Appointment, Powers and Immunities. Each Bank hereby
irrevocably appoints and authorizes the Administrative Agent to act as arranger
and administrative agent hereunder and under the Letters of Credit and the
other Loan Documents with such powers as are specifically delegated to the
Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such other
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each Bank hereby irrevocably
appoints and authorizes the Paying Agent to act as co-agent and paying agent
hereunder and under the Bankers' Acceptances, the Letters of Credit and the
other Loan Documents with such powers as are specifically delegated to the
Paying Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such other powers
as are reasonably incidental thereto. Each Bank hereby irrevocably appoints
and authorizes the Co-Agent to act as co-agent hereunder and under the Letters
of Credit and the other Loan Documents with such powers as are specifically
delegated to the Co- Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such
other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. None of the Agents (which
term as used in this Section 12 shall include reference to their affiliates and
their own and their affiliates' officers, directors, employees and agents) (a)
shall have any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in
this Agreement, the Bankers' Acceptances, the Letters of Credit, and the other
Loan Documents, or shall by reason of this Agreement or any other Loan Document
be a trustee or fiduciary for any Bank; (b) shall be responsible to any Bank
for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained

82
<PAGE> 89
in this Agreement, the Bankers' Acceptances, the Letters of Credit or any other
Loan Document, or in any certificate or other document referred to or provided
for in, or received by any of them under, this Agreement, the Bankers'
Acceptances, the Letters of Credit or any other Loan Document, or for the
value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of
this Agreement, the Bankers' Acceptances, the Letters of Credit, or any other
Loan Document or any other document referred to or provided for herein or
therein or any property covered thereby or for any failure by any Relevant
Party or any other Person to perform any of its obligations hereunder or
thereunder; (c) shall be required to initiate or conduct any litigation or
collection proceedings hereunder or under the Bankers' Acceptances, the Letters
of Credit or any other Loan Document except to the extent requested by the
Majority Banks, and (d) shall be responsible for any action taken or omitted to
be taken by them hereunder or under the Bankers' Acceptances, the Letters of
Credit or any other Loan Document or any other document or instrument referred
to or provided for herein or therein or in connection herewith or therewith,
including, without limitation, pursuant to their own negligence, except for
their own gross negligence or wilful misconduct. The Agents may employ agents
and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be responsible for the negligence or
misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by them with
reasonable care. Without in any way limiting any of the foregoing, each Bank
acknowledges that neither any Agent nor any Issuer shall have any greater
responsibility in the operation of the Letters of Credit than is specified in
the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (1983 Revision,
International Chamber of Commerce Publication No. 400). In any foreclosure
proceeding concerning any collateral for the Obligations, each holder of an
Obligation if bidding for its own account or for its own account and the
accounts of other Banks is prohibited from including in the amount of its bid
an amount to be applied as a credit against its Obligation or Obligations or
the Obligations of the other Banks; instead, such holder must bid in cash only;
provided that this provision is for the sole benefit of the Agents and the
Banks and shall not inure to the benefit of the Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries. However, in any such foreclosure proceeding, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) submit a bid for all Banks (including
itself) in the form of a credit against the Notes of all of the Banks, and the
Administrative Agent or its designee may (but shall not be obligated to) accept
title to such collateral for and on behalf of all Banks.

12.2 Reliance by Agents. Each of the Agents shall be
entitled to rely upon any certification, notice or other communication
(including any thereof by telephone, telex, telegram or cable) believed by them
to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of
the proper Person or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel
(which may be counsel for the Company and/or the Parent and/or any Subsidiary
of the Parent), independent accountants and other experts selected by any
Agent. As to any matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement, the
Bankers' Acceptances, the Letters of Credit, or any other Loan Document, the
Agents shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from
acting, hereunder and thereunder in accordance with instructions of the
Majority Banks (or, where unanimous consent is required by the terms hereof or
of the other Loan Documents, all of the Banks), and any action taken or failure
to act pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Banks. Pursuant to
instructions of the Majority Banks (except as otherwise

83
<PAGE> 90
provided in Section 13.4 hereof), the Administrative Agent shall have the
authority to execute releases of any Liens created by the Loan Documents on
behalf of the Banks without the joinder of any Bank.

12.3 Defaults. The Agents shall not be deemed to have
knowledge of the occurrence of a Default unless they have received notice from
a Bank or the Company specifying such Default and stating that such notice is a
"Notice of Default"; provided, however, that the Paying Agent shall be deemed
to have knowledge of the non-payment of principal of or interest on Loans or
the full face amount of outstanding Bankers' Acceptances or Reimbursement
Obligations at the time of such non-payment. In the event that the
Administrative Agent receives such a notice of the occurrence of a Default, the
Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Banks. The Paying
Agent shall give each Bank prompt notice to the Banks of each non-payment of
principal of or interest on Loans, the full face amount of outstanding Bankers'
Acceptances or Reimbursement Obligations. The Administrative Agent shall
(subject to Section 12.7 hereof) take such action with respect to such Default
as shall be directed by the Majority Banks and within its rights under the Loan
Documents and at law or in equity, provided that, unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the Administrative
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or refrain from
taking such action, permitted hereby with respect to such Default as it shall
deem advisable in the best interests of the Banks and within its rights under
the Loan Documents, at law or in equity.

12.4 Rights as a Bank. With respect to their Commitments
and the Loans made, Bankers' Acceptances accepted and purchased and Letter of
Credit Liabilities, the Agents in their capacities as Banks hereunder shall
have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Bank and may exercise
the same as though they were not acting as Agents, and the term "Bank" or
"Banks" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Agents in
their individual capacities. The Agents may (without having to account
therefor to any Bank) accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage
in any kind of banking, trust, letter of credit, agency or other business with
the Parent or its Subsidiaries (and any of their Affiliates) as if they were
not acting as Agents, and the Agents may accept fees and other consideration
from the Parent or its Subsidiaries (and any of their Affiliates), in addition
to the fees heretofore agreed to between the Company and the Agents, for
services in connection with this Agreement or otherwise without having to
account for the same to the Banks.

12.5 Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify the
Agents (to the extent not reimbursed under Section 2.2(c), Section 9.7 or
Section 13.3 hereof, but without limiting the obligations of the Company under
said Sections 2.2(c), 9.7 and 13.3), ratably in accordance with their
respective Commitments, for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind and nature whatsoever (including but not limited to, the
consequences of the negligence of the Agents) which may be imposed on, incurred
by or asserted against the Agents in any way relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Bankers' Acceptances, the Letters of Credit or any other Loan
Document or any other documents contemplated by or referred to herein or
therein or the transactions

84
<PAGE> 91
contemplated hereby or thereby (including, without limitation, the costs and
expenses which the Company is obligated to pay under Sections 2.2(c), 9.8 and
13.3 hereof but excluding, unless a Default has occurred and is continuing,
normal administrative costs and expenses incident to the performance of their
agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement of any of the terms hereof or
thereof or of any such other documents, including but not limited to the
negligence of the Agents, provided that no Bank shall be liable for any of the
foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross negligence or wilful
misconduct of the party to be indemnified. The obligations of the Banks under
this Section 12.5 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
repayment of the Obligations.

12.6 Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Banks. Each Bank
agrees that it has received current financial information with respect to the
Parent and its Subsidiaries and that it has, independently and without reliance
on the Agents or any other Bank and based on such documents and information as
it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis of the Parent and its
Subsidiaries and decision to enter into this Agreement and that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Agents or any other Bank, and based
on such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own analysis and decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents. The Agents shall not
be required to keep themselves informed as to the performance or observance by
any Relevant Party of this Agreement, the Bankers' Acceptances, the Letters of
Credit or any of the other Loan Documents or any other document referred to or
provided for herein or therein or to inspect the properties or books of the
Parent or its Subsidiaries. Except for notices, reports and other documents
and information expressly required to be furnished to the Banks by the Agents
hereunder, under the Bankers' Acceptances, under the Letters of Credit or the
other Loan Documents, the Agents shall not have any duty or responsibility to
provide any Bank with any credit or other information concerning the affairs,
financial condition or business of the Parent or its Subsidiaries (or any of
their Affiliates) which may come into the possession of the Agents.

12.7 Failure to Act. Except for action expressly required
of the Agents hereunder, under the Bankers' Acceptances, under the Letters of
Credit and under the other Loan Documents, the Agents shall in all cases be
fully justified in failing or refusing to act hereunder and thereunder unless
they shall receive further assurances to their satisfaction by the Banks of
their indemnification obligations under Section 12.5 hereof against any and all
liability and expense which may be incurred by them by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.

12.8 Resignation or Removal of Agents. Subject to the
appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as provided below, any Agent
may resign at any time by giving notice thereof to the Banks and the Company,
and any Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause by the Majority
Banks. Upon any such resignation or removal, the Majority Banks shall have the
right to appoint a successor Agent, provided deposits with such successor Agent
shall be insured by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation or its successor.
If no

85
<PAGE> 92
successor Agent shall have been so appointed by the Majority Banks and shall
have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Agent's giving
of notice of resignation or the Majority Banks' removal of the retiring Agent,
then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a successor Agent.
Any successor Agent shall be a bank which has an office in Canada and a
combined capital and surplus of at least U.S. $250,000,000. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent, and the retiring
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. Any
successor Paying Agent shall promptly specify by notice to the Company its
Payment Office referred to in Sections 3.1 and 5.1. After any retiring Agent's
resignation or removal hereunder as Agent, the provisions of this Section 12
shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or
omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as the Agent.

SECTION 13. MISCELLANEOUS.

13.1 Waiver. No waiver of any Default shall be a waiver of
any other Default. No failure on the part of any Agent or any Bank to exercise
and no delay in exercising, and no course of dealing with respect to, any
right, power or privilege under any Loan Document shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, power or
privilege thereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The remedies provided in the
Loan Documents are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law
or in equity.

13.2 Notices. All notices and other communications
provided for herein (including, without limitation, any modifications of, or
waivers or consents under, this Agreement) shall be given or made by telex,
telegraph, telecopy (confirmed by mail), cable, mail or other writing and
telexed, telecopied, telegraphed, cabled, mailed or delivered to the intended
recipient at the "Address for Notices" specified below its name on the
signature pages hereof; or, as to any party, at such other address as shall be
designated by such party in a notice to the Company and the Administrative
Agent given in accordance with this Section 13.2. Except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement, all such communications shall be deemed to have been duly
received when transmitted by telex or telecopier during regular business hours,
delivered to the telegraph or cable office or personally delivered or, in the
case of a mailed notice, three (3) days after deposit in the Canadian mails,
postage prepaid, registered mail with return receipt requested (or upon actual
receipt, if earlier), in each case given or addressed as aforesaid.

13.3 Indemnification. The Company shall indemnify the
Agents, the Banks, and each Affiliate thereof and their respective directors,
officers, employees and agents from, and hold each of them harmless against,
any and all losses, liabilities, claims or damages to which any of them may
become subject (except as provided in clause (c) of this Section 13.3,
regardless of whether caused in whole or in part by the simple (but not gross)
negligence of the Person indemnified), insofar as such losses, liabilities,
claims or damages arise out of or result from any

86
<PAGE> 93
(i) actual or proposed use by the Company of the proceeds of any extension of
credit (whether a Loan, Bankers' Acceptance or a Letter of Credit) by any Bank
hereunder, (ii) breach by the Company or any other Relevant Party of this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, (iii) violation by the Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries of any Legal Requirement, including but not limited to those
relating to Hazardous Substances, (iv) Liens or security interests previously
or hereafter granted on any real or personal property, to the extent resulting
from any Hazardous Substance located in, on or under any such property, (v)
ownership by the Banks or the Agents of any real or personal property following
foreclosure, to the extent such losses, liabilities, claims or damages arise
out of or result from any Hazardous Substance located in, on or under such
property, including, without limitation, losses, liabilities, claims or damages
which are imposed upon Persons under laws relating to or regulating Hazardous
Substances solely by virtue of ownership, (vi) Banks' or Agents' being deemed
an operator of any such real or personal property by a court or other
regulatory or administrative agency or tribunal in circumstances in which
neither any of the Agents nor any of the Banks is generally operating or
generally exercising control over such property, to the extent such losses,
liabilities, claims or damages arise out of or result from any Hazardous
Substance located in, on or under such property, (vii) investigation,
litigation or other proceeding (including any threatened investigation or
proceeding) relating to any of the foregoing, and the Company shall reimburse
each Agent, each Bank, and each Affiliate thereof and their respective
directors, officers, employees and agents, upon demand, for any expenses
(including legal fees) incurred in connection with any such investigation or
proceeding or (viii) taxes (excluding income taxes and franchise taxes) payable
or ruled payable by any Governmental Authority in respect of the principal and
interest of the Loans, the Bankers' Acceptances or any other Loan Document,
together with interest and penalties, if any; provided, however, that the
Company shall not have any obligations pursuant to this Section 13.3 with
respect to any losses, liabilities, claims, damages or expenses (a) arising
from or relating solely to events, conditions or circumstances which, as to
clauses (iv), (v) or (vi) above, first came into existence or which first
occurred after the date on which the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries conveyed
to an unrelated third party all of the Parent's or the applicable Subsidiary's
rights, titles and interests to the applicable real or personal property
(whether by deed, deed-in-lieu, foreclosure or otherwise) other than a
conveyance made in violation of any Loan Document, (b) incurred by the Person
seeking indemnification by reason of the gross negligence or wilful misconduct
of such Person, (c) in the case of liability arising with respect to Bankers'
Acceptances, incurred by the Person seeking indemnification by reason of the
negligence or wilful misconduct of such Person or (d) resulting from
withholding tax liability incurred in connection with payments made by the
Company to any Agent, any Bank or any Affiliate thereof. If the Company ever
disputes a good faith claim for indemnification under this Section 13.3 on the
basis of the proviso set forth in the preceding sentence, the full amount of
indemnification provided for shall nonetheless be paid, subject to later
adjustment or reimbursement at such time (if any) as a court of competent
jurisdiction enters a final judgment as to the applicability of any such
exceptions.

13.4 Amendments, Etc. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement, the Notes or any other Loan Document, nor any
consent to any departure by the Company or

87
<PAGE> 94
any other Relevant Party therefrom, shall in any event be effective unless the
same shall be agreed or consented to by the Majority Banks and the Company, and
each such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance
and for the specific purpose for which given; provided, that no amendment,
waiver or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by each Bank affected
thereby, do any of the following: (a) increase the Commitment of such Bank (it
being understood that the waiver of any reduction in the Commitments or any
mandatory repayment other than (x) the repayment of all Loans at the end of the
Revolving Credit Availability Period and (y) the mandatory reductions of the
Commitments provided for in Section 2.3(a) and (z) the mandatory prepayments
required by the terms of Section 3.2(b), shall not be deemed to be an increase
in any Commitment) or subject the Banks to any additional obligation; (b)
reduce the principal of, or interest on, any Loan, Reimbursement Obligation or
fee hereunder or the face amount of any outstanding Bankers' Acceptances; (c)
postpone any scheduled date fixed for any payment or mandatory prepayment of
principal of, or interest on, any Loan, Reimbursement Obligation, fee or the
face amount of any outstanding Bankers' Acceptances or other sum to be paid
hereunder; (d) change the percentage of any of the Commitments or of the
aggregate unpaid principal amount of any of the Loans or the face amount of any
outstanding Bankers' Acceptances and Letter of Credit Liabilities, or the
number of Banks, which shall be required for the Banks or any of them to take
any action under this Agreement; (e) change any provision contained in Sections
2.2(c), 9.7 or 13.3 hereof or this Section 13.4 or Section 6.7 hereof, or (f)
release all or substantially all of any security for the obligations of the
Company under this Agreement or any Note or all or substantially all of the
personal liability of any obligor created under any of the Loan Documents.
Anything in this Section 13.4 to the contrary, no amendment, waiver or consent
shall be made with respect to Section 12 without the consent of the applicable
Agent or Agents affected thereby.

13.5 Successors and Assigns. (a) This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company, the Agents and the Banks
and their respective successors and assigns. The Company may not assign or
transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of all of the Banks. Each Bank may sell participations to any Person
which is a resident of Canada under the Income Tax Act (Canada) in all or part
of any Loan, Bankers' Acceptance or Letter of Credit, or all or part of its
Notes or Commitments, in which event, without limiting the foregoing, the
provisions of Section 6 shall inure to the benefit of each purchaser of a
participation and the pro rata treatment of payments, as described in Section
5.2, shall be determined as if such Bank had not sold such participation. In
the event any Bank shall sell any participation, such Bank shall retain the
sole right and responsibility to enforce the obligations of the Company or any
other Relevant Party relating to the Loans, Bankers' Acceptances or Letters of
Credit, including, without limitation, the right to approve any amendment,
modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement other than
amendments, modifications or waivers with respect to (i) any fees payable
hereunder to the Banks and (ii) the amount of principal or the rate of interest
payable on, or the dates fixed for the scheduled repayment of principal of, the
Loans.

88
<PAGE> 95
(b) Each Bank may assign to one or more Banks or any other
Person, in each case which is a resident of Canada under the Income Tax Act
(Canada), all or a portion of its interests, rights and obligations under this
Agreement, provided, however, that (i) other than in the case of an assignment
to another Bank that is, at the time of such assignment, a party hereto or an
Affiliate of such Bank which is a resident of Canada under the Income Tax Act
(Canada), the Company must give its prior written consent, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld, (ii) the aggregate amount of the Commitment
and/or Loans, the face amount of all outstanding Bankers' Acceptances or
Letters of Credit of the assigning Bank subject to each such assignment
(determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance (as defined below)
with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall
in no event be less than U.S. $10,000,000 (or U.S. $5,000,000 in the case of an
assignment to an Affiliate of a Bank or between Banks), (iii) no assignment
shall have the effect of reducing the pro rata share of the Loans, the face
amount of all outstanding Bankers' Acceptances or Letters of Credit and the
Commitments held by the assignor and its Affiliates below U.S. $10,000,000,
(iv) notwithstanding any other term or provision of this Agreement, unless the
Company shall have otherwise consented in writing (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld), each such assignment shall be pro rata with respect to
the Loans, the Bankers' Acceptances, the Letters of Credit and the Commitment
of the assignor, and (v) the parties to each such assignment shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent, for its acceptance and recording in the
Register (as defined below), an Assignment and Acceptance in the form of
Exhibit F hereto (each an "Assignment and Acceptance") with blanks
appropriately completed, together with any Note or Notes subject to such
assignment and a processing and recordation fee of U.S. $2,500 paid by the
assignee (for which the Company shall have no liability). Upon such execution,
delivery, acceptance and recording, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Acceptance, which effective date shall be at least five
Business Days after the execution thereof, (A) the assignee thereunder shall be
a party hereto and, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance,
have the rights and obligations of a Bank hereunder and (B) the Bank thereunder
shall, to the extent provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, be released
from its obligations under this Agreement.

(c) By executing and delivering an Assignment and
Acceptance, the Bank assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to
and agree with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other
than the representation and warranty that it is the legal and beneficial owner
of the interest being assigned thereby free and clear of any adverse claim,
such Bank assignor makes no representation or warranty and assumes no
responsibility with respect to any statements, warranties or representations
made in or in connection with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness, sufficiency
or value of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any other
instrument or document furnished pursuant thereto; (ii) such Bank assignor
makes no representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect
to the financial condition of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or the
performance or observance by the Company or any other Relevant Party of any of
its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any
other instrument or document furnished pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee

89
<PAGE> 96
confirms that it has received a copy of this Agreement, together with copies of
the financial statements referred to in Section 8.6 and such other documents
and information as it has deemed appropriate to make its own credit analysis
and decision to enter into such Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee
will, independently and without reliance upon any Agent, such Bank assignor or
any other Bank and based on such documents and information as it shall deem
appropriate at the time, continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or
not taking action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; (v) such
assignee appoints and authorizes the Agents to take such action as agent on its
behalf and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents as are delegated to the Agents by the terms hereof, together with
such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vi) such assignee agrees
that it will perform in accordance with their terms all obligations that by the
terms of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are required to be
performed by it as a Bank.

(d) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its office
a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Banks and the Commitments of, and
principal amount of the Loans owing to, and the face amount of all Bankers'
Acceptances accepted and purchased by, each Bank from time to time (the
"Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive, in the absence
of manifest error, and the Company, the Agents and the Banks may treat each
person the name of which is recorded in the Register as a Bank hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. The Register
shall be available for inspection by the Company or any Bank at any reasonable
time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

(e) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Bank and the assignee thereunder together with any
Note or Notes subject to such assignment, the written consent to such
assignment executed by the Company and the fee payable in respect thereto, the
Administrative Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been
completed with blanks appropriately filled, (i) accept such Assignment and
Acceptance, (ii) record the information contained therein in the Register and
(iii) give prompt notice thereof to the Company. Within five Business Days
after receipt of notice, the Company, at its own expense, shall execute and
deliver to the Administrative Agent in exchange for the surrendered Notes new
Notes to the order of such assignee in an amount equal to the Commitments
and/or Loans or the face amount of outstanding Bankers' Acceptances or Letters
of Credit assumed by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance and, if the
assigning Bank has retained Commitments and/or Loans hereunder, new Notes to
the order of the assigning Bank in an amount equal to the Commitment and/or
Loans retained by it hereunder. Such new Notes shall be in an aggregate
principal amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of such surrendered
Notes, shall be dated the effective date of such Assignment and Acceptance and
shall otherwise be in substantially the form of the respective Note.
Thereafter, such surrendered Notes shall be marked renewed and substituted and
the originals delivered to the Company (with copies, certified by the Company
as true, correct and complete, to be retained by the Administrative Agent).

90
<PAGE> 97
(f) Any Bank may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section
13.5, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant, any information relating to the Parent or its Subsidiaries
furnished to such Bank by or on behalf of the Parent or its Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that, prior to any such disclosure, the Parent shall have
consented thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, and each
such assignee or participant, or proposed assignee or participant, shall
execute an agreement whereby such assignee or participant shall agree to
preserve the confidentiality of any Confidential Information (defined in
Section 13.12) on terms substantially the same as those provided in Section
13.12.

(g) The Company will have the right to consent to any material
intercreditor arrangements in connection with an assignment by any Bank of any
interest, right or obligation under this Agreement which is not pro rata with
respect to the Loans, or the face amount of outstanding Bankers' Acceptances,
the Letters of Credit and the Commitment of the assignor and the Company may
deny its consent to any such arrangements which, in the reasonable judgement of
the Company, would adversely affect the Company in a material respect.

13.6 Limitation of Interest. The Company and the Banks
intend to strictly comply with all applicable laws, including applicable usury
laws. Accordingly, the provisions of this Section 13.6 shall govern and
control over every other provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document
which conflicts or is inconsistent with this Section, even if such provision
declares that it controls. As used in this Section, the term "interest"
includes the aggregate of all charges, fees, benefits or other compensation
which constitute interest under applicable law, provided that, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable law, (a) any non-principal payment shall be
characterized as an expense or as compensation for something other than the
use, forbearance or detention of money and not as interest, and (b) all
interest at any time contracted for, reserved, charged or received shall be
amortized, prorated, allocated and spread, in equal parts during the full term
of the Obligations. In no event shall the Company or any other Person be
obligated to pay, or any Bank have any right or privilege to reserve, receive
or retain, (a) any interest in excess of the maximum amount of nonusurious
interest permitted under the laws of the Province of Alberta or the applicable
laws (if any) of Canada or of any other applicable jurisdiction, or (b) total
interest in excess of the amount which such Bank could lawfully have contracted
for, reserved, received, retained or charged had the interest been calculated
for the full term of the Obligations at the Highest Lawful Rate. On each day,
if any, that the interest rate (the "Stated Rate") called for under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate, the rate
at which interest shall accrue shall automatically be fixed by operation of
this sentence at the Highest Lawful Rate for that day, and shall remain fixed
at the Highest Lawful Rate for each day thereafter until the total amount of
interest accrued equals the total amount of interest which would have accrued
if there were no such ceiling rate as is imposed by this sentence. Thereafter,
interest shall accrue at the Stated Rate unless and until the Stated Rate again
exceeds the Highest Lawful Rate when the provisions of the immediately
preceding sentence shall again automatically operate to limit the interest
accrual rate. The daily interest rates to be used in calculating interest at
the Highest Lawful

91
<PAGE> 98
Rate shall be determined by dividing the applicable Highest Lawful Rate per
annum by the number of days in the calendar year for which such calculation is
being made. None of the terms and provisions contained in this Agreement or in
any other Loan Document which directly or indirectly relate to interest shall
ever be construed without reference to this Section 13.6, or be construed to
create a contract to pay for the use, forbearance or detention of money at an
interest rate in excess of the Highest Lawful Rate. If the term of any
Obligation is shortened by reason of acceleration of maturity as a result of
any Default or by any other cause, or by reason of any required or permitted
prepayment, and if for that (or any other) reason any Bank at any time,
including but not limited to, the stated maturity, is owed or receives (and/or
has received) interest in excess of interest calculated at the Highest Lawful
Rate, then and in any such event all of any such excess interest shall be
canceled automatically as of the date of such acceleration, prepayment or other
event which produces the excess, and, if such excess interest has been paid to
such Bank, it shall be credited pro tanto against the then-outstanding
principal balance of the Company's obligations to such Bank, effective as of
the date or dates when the event occurs which causes it to be excess interest,
until such excess is exhausted or all of such principal has been fully paid and
satisfied, whichever occurs first, and any remaining balance of such excess
shall be promptly refunded to its payor.

13.7 Interest Act (Canada); Interest Generally. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the Notes and the other Loan Documents, whenever
interest or fees to be paid hereunder are to be calculated on the basis of a
year of 365 or 360 days, the yearly rate of interest to which the rate
determined pursuant to such calculation is equivalent is the rate so determined
multiplied by the actual number of days in the 12 month period commencing on
the first day of the period for which such calculation is made and divided by
365 or 360, as applicable. The theory of deemed reinvestment shall not apply
to the calculation of interest or payment of fees or other amounts hereunder or
under the Notes or under the other Loan Documents, notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement or in the Notes or in the other Loan Documents, or
in any other instrument referred to herein or in the Notes or in the other Loan
Documents, and all interest and fees payable by the Borrower to the Lender
shall accrue from day to day and be computed as described herein or in the
Notes or in the other Loan Documents in accordance with the "nominal rate"
method of interest calculation. To the extent permitted by law, any provision
of the Judgment Interest Act (Alberta) and the Interest Act (Canada) which
restricts the rate of interest on any judgment debt shall be inapplicable to
this Agreement and is hereby waived by the Borrower.

13.8 Certain Saskatchewan Legislation. The Land Contracts
(Actions) Act of the Province of Saskatchewan shall have no application to any
action, as defined in the said Land Contracts (Actions) Act, with respect to
this Agreement; and the Limitation of Civil Rights Act in the Province of
Saskatchewan shall have no application to this Agreement. The Company agrees
that the provisions of both the Land Contracts (Actions) Act and the Limitation
of Civil Rights Act are hereby waived.

92
<PAGE> 99
13.9 Survival. The obligations of the Company under
Sections 2.2(c), 6, 9.7 and 13.3 hereof and the obligations of the Banks under
Section 13.6 hereof shall survive the repayment of the Loans and Reimbursement
Obligations and the termination of the Commitments and the Letters of Credit.

13.10 Captions. Captions and section headings appearing
herein are included solely for convenience of reference and are not intended to
affect the interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

13.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and
the same agreement and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by
signing any such counterpart.

13.12 Governing Law. This Agreement and the Notes and the
Bankers' Acceptances and (except as therein provided) the other Loan Documents
are performable in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, which shall be a proper place of
venue for suit on or in respect thereof. The Company irrevocably agrees that
any legal proceeding in respect of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents
shall be brought in the courts of the Province of Alberta and the courts of
appeal therefrom (collectively, the "Specified Courts"). The Company hereby
irrevocably submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of such courts. The
Company hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to any Loan Document

Confidential Information furnished to such Person; provided, however, that such
Person may disclose Confidential Information (i) upon the Parent's consent;

13.15 Intercreditor Agreement. Reference is hereby made to
the Intercreditor Agreement, which provides for certain matters relating to
both the Obligations and the Canadian Facility. To the extent of any conflict
between the terms hereof and the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Intercreditor Agreement shall control. The Administrative Agent is hereby
authorized and directed to execute and deliver the Intercreditor Agreement in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit I on behalf of the Banks. Any Bank that
becomes a party to this Agreement after the date hereof agrees to be bound by
the terms and provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

13.16 Judgement Currency. Notwithstanding that this
Agreement is governed by the laws of the Province of Alberta, Canada, monies
outstanding in connection herewith may be stipulated in terms of lawful money
of the United States of America (which stipulation or expression is of the
essence) and payments to be made in regard thereto pursuant to this Agreement,
or otherwise, are and are intended to be payable in lawful money of the United
States of America; and to the extent permitted by law any judgment in respect
of any such monies outstanding as aforesaid or any obligation pertaining
thereto arising under this Agreement may be obtained or enforced either in
lawful money of the United States of America or the equivalent in lawful money
of Canada, as the Administrative Agent may elect, and the Administrative Agent
shall to the extent permitted by law be entitled to such election and the
benefit (if any) from the consequent conversion of currency at the date of
payment or enforcement of the judgment. Any such payment obligation stipulated
or expressed in lawful money of the United States of America shall not be
discharged by an amount paid in lawful money of Canada, whether pursuant to a
judgment or otherwise, to the extent that the amount so paid on prompt
conversion into lawful money of the United States of America does not, after
deduction of any and all premiums and/or costs of exchange paid or payable by
the Administrative Agent in connection with such conversion, yield the required
amount of payment expressed in terms of lawful money of the United States of
America. In the event that any payment in lawful money of Canada in respect of
a payment in lawful money of Canada in respect of a payment obligation
stipulated or expressed in terms of lawful money of the United States of
America as aforesaid, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, upon
conversion as aforesaid does not, after deduction of any and all premiums
and/or costs of exchange paid or payable by any Agent or any Bank in connection
with such conversion, yield the required amount expressed in terms of lawful
money of the United States of America, the Administrative Agent shall, on
behalf of and for the benefit of the affected Person, have a separate cause of
action for the additional amount required to yield the required amount
expressed in terms of lawful money of the United States of America.

13.17 Withholding Tax Remittances. If any withholding for,
or on account of, any present or future tax, duty or charge of whatsoever
nature is imposed or levied by or on behalf of any taxing jurisdiction or
authority (together with any interest and penalties thereon and additions
thereto) in respect of any payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement or
the Notes, the Company shall be entitled to withhold and remit such payment to
the applicable taxing authority whereupon such payment, for the purposes of
this Agreement and the Notes,

95
<PAGE> 102
shall be deemed to have been made as required hereunder or under the Notes,
notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in the Notes.

be duly executed and delivered as of the day and year first above written.

7
<PAGE> 8
2.6 CO-OPERATION

Each Administrative Agent (and, where applicable, the Lenders under
the respective Credit Agreements) agrees with the other Administrative Agent
(and, where applicable, the Lenders under the other Credit Agreement) that:

a. to the extent available, it will from time to time promptly
provide such information to the other Administrative Agent as
may be reasonably necessary to enable the other Administrative
Agent to make any calculation referred to in or necessary to
implement Section 3 or otherwise reasonably required by the
other Administrative Agent for any other purpose hereof;

b. to the extent reasonably possible, it will from time to time
consult with the other Administrative Agent in good faith
regarding the enforcement of its and each of the Lender's
rights and remedies under its Credit Agreement with a view to
recovering amounts due under the Credit Agreements in an
effective and cost-efficient manner;

c. if, after an Event of Default, it gains access to a Borrower's

extent it may legally do so; and

d. each Lender will promptly notify its Administrative Agent in
writing of the receipt by such Lender of any Reallocable
Payment and the applicable Administrative Agent will promptly
notify the other Administrative Agent of such receipt.

2.7 ENFORCEMENT

From and after Acceleration:

a. where reasonably practicable in the circumstances and in any
event prior to the appointment of a receiver or
receiver-manager or filing a bankruptcy petition in respect of
its Borrower, the Administrative Agent proposing to do so (the
"Enforcing Lender") agrees to consult and cooperate with the
other Administrative Agent in good faith regarding the
enforcement of its and each of its Lenders' rights with a view
to recovering amounts due under the Credit Agreements in an
efficient and cost-efficient manner;

b. any receiver or receiver-manager or bankruptcy trustee or
custodian appointed by an Enforcing Lender must be an
insolvency firm of national standing in Canada and the United
States of America (and, where applicable, each Enforcing
Lender

8
<PAGE> 9
agrees that it will request any applicable court to similarly
appoint an insolvency firm of national standing in Canada and
the United States of America); and

c. if a receiver or receiver-manager is appointed pursuant to
clause b. above, the Lenders under each of the Credit
Agreements shall cause to be provided any reasonable indemnity
which may be necessary for such receiver or receiver-manager
or trustee, to the extent of their respective Operative
Sharing Percentages in respect to the obligations to which the
indemnity relates.

SECTION 3: PARI PASSU SHARING

3.1 OVERALL INTENT

It is the intention of the Lenders that, following the occurrence of
any Borrowing Base Deficiency or the Reference Date, they shall share in any
required payments or Security Documents delivered by the U.S. Borrower or the
Canadian Borrower to cure such Borrowing Base Deficiency and in any Reallocable
Payments received following the Reference Date pro rata to their respective
proportions of the Combined Outstandings.

3.2 PAYMENTS TO CURE BORROWING BASE DEFICIENCY

Upon the delivery of a notice of Borrowing Base Deficiency to the U.S.
Borrower under Section 3.2(b)(2) of the U.S. Credit Agreement, the
Administrative Agents shall determine the Sharing Percentages of the Canadian
Lenders and the U.S. Lenders at the time of such notice. The U.S. Borrower and
the Canadian Borrower agree that any payments required to cure such Borrowing
Base Deficiency shall be made by the U.S. Borrower to the U.S. Lenders and by
the Canadian Borrower to the Canadian Lenders (with the Maximum Outstanding
Amount--as such term is defined in the Canadian Credit Agreement--to be reduced
by the amount of such payments by the Canadian Borrower) in accordance with
their respective Sharing Percentages as so determined. For this purpose, if
any such payment is made in Canadian Dollars under the Canadian Credit
Agreement, the Equivalent U.S. Dollar Amount thereof shall be considered to
have been made. For purposes of this Section 3.2, the Sharing Percentages of
the Lenders shall be recalculated as of each January 1, April 1, June 1 and
September 1 using the Combined Outstandings at the time of the applicable
notice of Borrowing Base Deficiency but using the then current Equivalent U.S.
Dollar Amount with respect to any of such Combined Outstandings denominated in
Canadian Dollars.

3.3 EQUALIZATION FOLLOWING THE OCCURRENCE OF THE REFERENCE DATE

a. As of the Reference Date, the Operative Sharing Percentages of
the respective Lenders shall be determined.

b. Upon any receipt by any Administrative Agent (or by the Paying
Agent under the

9
<PAGE> 10
Canadian Credit Agreement) of any Reallocable Payments (after
giving effect to application of such receipts), the Post
Default Proportions of the U.S. Lenders and the Canadian
Lenders shall be determined.

c. If the Post Default Proportion of the U.S. Lenders and the
Post Default Proportion of the Canadian Lenders calculated
pursuant to Section 3.3.b above are not equal to their
respective Operative Sharing Percentages, then the Lenders
whose Post Default Proportion is less than their Operative
Sharing Percentages shall firstly, repurchase participations
previously sold by them to other Lenders (such participation
interests to be allocated pro rata among the sellers in
accordance with their respective Operative Sharing
Percentages) and then purchase participations in the U.S.
Credit Outstandings or the Canadian Credit Outstandings, as
the case may be (such participation interests to be allocated
pro rata among the sellers in accordance with their respective
Operative Sharing Percentages), in U.S. Dollars on a
non-recourse basis so that, after such payment by the
purchasing Lenders and receipt thereof by the selling Lenders,
their respective Post Default Proportions shall equal their
Operative Sharing Percentages; provided, however, that if
after any amount is paid under this Section 3.3.c. a Borrower
or any trustee, liquidator, receiver or receiver-manager or
Person with analogous powers recovers any amount from any
Lenders ("Disgorging Lenders") in respect of any amount
theretofore applied to the U.S. Credit Outstandings or the
Canadian Credit Outstandings, then such amount (including any
interest paid by the Lenders) shall be treated for all
purposes:

i. as between the relevant Borrower and the Disgorging
Lenders; and

ii. as between the Disgorging Lenders and the other
Lenders (the "Non-Disgorging Lenders"),

to be outstanding as U.S. Credit Outstandings or Canadian
Credit Outstandings (as applicable), in which case the Post
Default Proportions shall thereupon be adjusted and this
Section 3.3.c. again applied.

d. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or the
Credit Agreements, the purchase of participations in the
Canadian Credit Outstandings hereunder by the U.S. Lenders and
the acquisition of an undivided interest in any property by
the U.S. Lenders from any Canadian Lender or the Canadian
Agent or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, pursuant to
Section 6.12 hereof shall not constitute an acquisition by the
U.S. Lenders of any beneficial interest in the Canadian Credit
Agreement or any amount owing thereunder but shall constitute
risk sharing payments among the Canadian Lenders and the U.S.
Lenders and the beneficial interest in the Canadian Credit
Agreement and all amounts owing thereunder shall at all times
remain with the Canadian Lenders.

10
<PAGE> 11
3.4 INFORMATION

From time to time following the occurrence of an Acceleration, each
Lender shall promptly provide its Administrative Agent with all necessary

Outstandings or U.S. Credit Outstandings, Operative Sharing Percentages and
Post Default Proportions of the Lenders, including any payments received.

Loans, the Notes, the Bankers' Acceptances, the Letter of Credit Liabilities,
the Reimbursement Obligations, the Interest Rate Obligations, the Contract
Obligations or any of the Loan Documents or defending against any claims
arising directly or indirectly in respect of or on account of any of the Debt.

Obligor means any person or entity now or hereafter primarily or
secondarily obligated to pay all or any part of the Debt, including Borrower

Unless redefined in this Guarantee, any capitalized term used in this Guarantee
has the meaning ascribed to it in the Credit Agreement.

ARTICLE 2

Section 2.1. Execution of Loan Documents. Borrower has executed and
delivered the Notes and the other documents evidencing the Debt to Agents and
Banks, and the Debt is secured by certain of the liens, security interests,
collateral assignments and other security devices created, evidenced or carried
forward by the Loan Documents.

Section 2.2. Consideration. In consideration of the credit and
financial accommodations contemplated to be extended to Borrower by Agents and
Banks pursuant to the documents evidencing the Debt, the other Loan Documents
or otherwise, which Guarantor has determined will substantially benefit it
directly or indirectly, and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which Guarantor hereby acknowledges, Guarantor
executes and delivers this Guarantee to Administrative Agent with the intention
of being presently and legally bound by its terms.

ARTICLE 3

Section 3.1. Payment Guarantee. Guarantor, as a primary obligor and
not as a surety, unconditionally guarantees to Administrative Agent for the
ratable benefit of Banks the full, prompt and punctual payment of the Debt when
due (whether at its stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) in
accordance with the Loan Documents. This Guarantee is irrevocable,
unconditional and absolute, and if for any reason all or any portion of the
Debt shall not be paid when due, Guarantor will immediately pay the Debt to
Paying Agent or other Person entitled to it, in U.S. Dollars or in Canadian
Dollars, whichever currency or currencies in which the Debt is then
denominated, regardless of (a) any defense, right of set-off or counterclaim
which any Obligor may have or assert, (b) whether any Agent or any other Person
shall have taken any steps to enforce any rights against any Obligor or any
other Person to collect any of the Debt, and (c) any other circumstance,
condition or contingency.

<PAGE> 3

Section 3.2. Application of Payments or Prepayments. The parties
hereto agree that any payment or prepayment by Borrower or any other Person
against the Debt shall be deemed paid in such order and manner as
Administrative Agent shall determine in its sole discretion.

Section 3.3. Obligations Not Affected. Guarantor's covenants,
agreements and obligations under this Guarantee shall in no way be released,
diminished, reduced, impaired or otherwise affected by reason of the happening
from time to time of any of the following things, for any reason, whether by
voluntary act, operation of law or order of any competent governmental
authority and whether or not Guarantor is given any notice or is asked for or
gives any further consent (all requirements for which, however arising,
Guarantor hereby WAIVES):

(a) release or waiver of any obligation or duty to
perform or observe any express or implied agreement, covenant, term or

guaranty for the payment or performance of any or all of the Debt or the
obligations of any Obligor.

(l) occurrence or discovery of any irregularity,
invalidity or unenforceability of any of the Debt or Loan Documents or any

against any Obligor or any other Person or any direct or indirect security for
any part of the Debt or other obligation of Borrower, any new agreement between

obligation to give Guarantor any notice of any kind under any

4
<PAGE> 5

circumstances whatsoever with respect to or in connection with the Debt or the
Loan Documents.

(o) occurrence of any event or circumstances which might
otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, any Obligor,

under the Loan Documents, by law or otherwise available to any Agent or any
Bank.

(q) occurrence of any act, error or omission of any Agent
or any other Person, except behavior which is proven to be in bad faith to the
extent (but no further) that the Guarantor cannot effectively waive the right
to complain.

Section 3.4. Waiver of Certain Rights and Notices. Guarantor hereby
WAIVES and RELEASES all right to require marshalling of assets and liabilities,
sale in inverse order of alienation, notice of acceptance of this Guarantee and
of any liability to which it applies or may apply, notice of the creation,
accrual, renewal, increase, extension, modification, amendment or rearrangement
of any part of the Debt, presentment, demand for payment, protest, notice of
nonpayment, notice of dishonor, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of
acceleration and all other notices and demands, collection, suit and the taking
of any other action by any Agent or any Bank.

Section 3.5. Not a Collection Guarantee. This is an absolute
guarantee of payment, and not of collection, and Guarantor WAIVES any right to
require that any action be brought against any Obligor or any other Person, or
that any Agent or any Bank be required to enforce or exhaust any of its rights,
benefits or privileges under any of the Loan Documents, by law or otherwise;
provided that nothing herein shall be construed to prevent any Agent or any
Bank from exercising and enforcing at any time any right, benefit or privilege
which it may have under any Loan Document or by law from time to time, and at
any time, and Guarantor agrees that Guarantor's obligations hereunder are--and
shall be--absolute, independent and unconditional under any and all
circumstances. Should any Agent or any Bank seek to enforce Guarantor's
obligations by action in any court, Guarantor WAIVES any requirement,
substantive or procedural, that such Agent or such Bank pursue any foreclosure
action or that a judgment first be sought or rendered against any Obligor or
any other Person or that any Obligor or any other Person be joined in such
cause or that a separate action be brought against any Obligor or any other
Person. Guarantor's obligations under this Guarantee are several from those of
any other Obligor or any other Person, and are primary obligations concerning
which Guarantor is the

5
<PAGE> 6

principal obligor. All waivers in this Guarantee or any of the Loan Documents
shall be without prejudice to any Agent or any Bank at its option to proceed
against any Obligor or any other Person, whether by separate action or by
joinder. Guarantor agrees that this Guarantee shall not be discharged except
by payment of the Debt in full, complete performance of all obligations of the
Obligors on the Debt and termination of the obligation--if any--to make any
further advances under the Loan Documents or extend other financial
accommodations to any Obligor.

Section 3.6. Subrogation. Guarantor agrees that it shall not be
entitled to exercise any rights of subrogation to any Agent's or any Bank's
rights against any Obligor or any other Person or any collateral or offset
rights held by any Agent or any Bank for payment of the Debt until final
termination of this Guarantee.

Section 3.7. Reliance on Guarantee. All extensions of credit and
financial accommodations heretofore or hereafter made by any Agent or any Bank
under or in respect of the Debt or Loan Documents shall be conclusively
presumed to have been made in acceptance of this Guarantee.

Section 3.8. Demands are Conclusive. A certificate submitted to
Guarantor by any Administrative Agent setting forth the basis for any demand by
Administrative Agent hereunder shall constitute a demand hereunder and shall be
conclusive, absent manifest error, as to the matters therein stated, including
the amount due.

Section 3.9. Joint and Several. If any Person makes any guaranty of
any of the obligations guaranteed hereby or gives any security for them,
Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall be joint and several with the
obligations of such other Person pursuant to such agreement or other papers
making the guaranty or giving the security.

Section 3.10. Payments Returned. Guarantor agrees that, if at any
time all or any part of any payment previously applied by any Agent or any Bank
to the Debt is or must be returned by any Agent or any Bank--or recovered from
any Agent or any Bank--for any reason (including the order of any bankruptcy
court), this Guarantee shall automatically be reinstated to the same effect as
if the prior application had not been made, and, in addition, Guarantor hereby
agrees to indemnify Agents and Banks against, and to save and hold Agents and
Banks harmless from any required return by any Agent or any Bank--or recovery
from any Agent or any Bank-- of any such payment because of its being deemed
preferential under applicable bankruptcy, receivership or insolvency laws, or
for any other reason.

ARTICLE 4

Guarantor warrants and represents as follows:

6
<PAGE> 7

Section 4.1. Relationship to Borrower. Guarantor has determined that
its liability and obligation under this Guarantee may reasonably be expected to
substantially benefit Guarantor directly or indirectly, and Guarantor's board
of directors has made that determination. Borrower and Guarantor are mutually
dependent on each other in the conduct of their respective businesses and are,
and do business together with the other Subsidiaries of Guarantor as, an
integrated business enterprise involved in the development, exploration,
production, marketing and transportation of oil, gas and other minerals. The
maintenance and improvement of Borrower's financial condition is vital to
sustaining the business of Guarantor and the transactions contemplated in the
Credit Agreement produce distinct and identifiable financial and economic
direct or indirect benefits to Guarantor. Such identifiable benefits include
the availability of the proceeds of the Revolving Credit Loans to Guarantor on
an as needed basis by way of intercompany loans and/or capital contributions
for general corporate or other purposes. Guarantor has had full and complete
access to the underlying papers relating to the Debt and all other papers
executed by any Obligor or any other Person in connection with the Debt, has
reviewed them and is fully aware of the meaning and effect of their contents.
Guarantor is fully informed of all circumstances which bear upon the risks of
executing this Guarantee and which a diligent inquiry would reveal. Guarantor
has adequate means to obtain from Borrower on a continuing basis information
concerning Borrower's financial condition, and is not depending on any Agent or
any Bank to provide such information, now or in the future. Guarantor agrees
that neither any Agent nor any Bank shall have an obligation to advise or
notify Guarantor or to provide Guarantor with any data or information. The
execution and delivery of this Guarantee is not a condition precedent (and
neither any Agent nor any Bank has in any way implied that the execution of
this Guarantee is a condition precedent) to any Agent's or any Bank's making,
extending or modifying any loan or any other financial accommodation to or for
Guarantor.

Section 4.2. Proceedings. No bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings are
pending or contemplated by or--to the best of Guarantor's knowledge--against
Guarantor.

ARTICLE 5

Section 5.1. Term. Subject to the automatic reinstatement provisions
of Article 3 above, this Guarantee shall terminate and be of no further force
or effect upon full payment of the Debt, complete performance of all of the
obligations of the Obligors under the Loan Documents and final termination of
the obligation--if any--to make any further advances under the Loan Documents
or to provide any other financial accommodations to any Obligor.

ARTICLE 6

Section 6.1. Binding on Successors; No Assignment by Guarantor. All
guaranties, warranties, representations, covenants and agreements in this
Guarantee shall bind the successors and assigns of Guarantor and shall benefit
Agents and Banks and their respective successors and

7
<PAGE> 8

assigns, and any holder of any part of the Debt. Guarantor shall not assign or
delegate any of its obligations under this Guarantee or any of the Loan
Documents without Administrative Agent's and the Banks' express prior written
consent.

Section 6.2. Subordination of Borrower's Obligations to Guarantor.
Guarantor agrees that if, for any reason whatsoever, Borrower now or hereafter
becomes liable, obligated or indebted to Guarantor, all such liabilities,
obligations and indebtedness, together with all interest thereon and fees and
other charges in connection therewith, and all liens, security interests,
charges and other security devices, shall at all times, be second, subordinate
and inferior in right of payment, in lien priority and in all other respects to
the Debt and all liens, collateral assignments, security interests and other
security devices securing the Debt.

Section 6.3. Waiver of Suretyship Rights. By signing this Guarantee,
Guarantor WAIVES each and every right to which it may be entitled by virtue of
any suretyship law, including any rights it may have under applicable laws to
require that any action or proceeding be commenced against Borrower or any
other Person as a condition to the institution of any action or proceeding
relating to the obligations of Guarantor hereunder.

Section 6.4. Amendments in Writing. This Guarantee shall not be
changed orally but shall be changed only by agreement in writing signed by
Guarantor and Administrative Agent. Any waiver or consent with respect to this
Guarantee shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the specific
purpose for which given. No course of dealing between the parties, no usage of
trade and no parole or extrinsic evidence of any nature shall be used to
supplement or modify any of the terms or provisions of this Guarantee.

Section 6.5. Notices. Any notices or other communications required or
permitted to be given hereunder shall be given or made by telex, telegraph,
telecopy (confirmed by mail), mail, cable or other writing and telexed,
telecopied, telegraphed, cabled, mailed or delivered to the intended recipient
at the address set forth below for such recipient or at such other address as

and from whomever given or received, shall always be effective when received.

Section 6.6. Gender; "Including" is Not Limiting; Section Headings.
The masculine and neuter genders used in this Guarantee each includes the
masculine, feminine and neuter genders, and the singular number includes the
plural where appropriate, and vice versa. Wherever the term "including" or a
similar term is used in this Guarantee, it shall be read as if it were written
"including by way of example only and without in any way limiting the
generality of the clause or concept referred to." The headings used in this
Guarantee are included for reference only and shall not be considered in
interpreting, applying or enforcing this Guarantee.

Section 6.7. Right of Setoff. Guarantor hereby agrees with and
consents to the provisions of Section 11.4 of the Credit Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Guarantor consents to the granting of
the security interest in and the collateral transfer of all of the deposits,
funds or property of Guarantor or Indebtedness of any Bank to Guarantor for the
purposes set forth in Section 11.4 of the Credit Agreement.

Section 6.8. Venue. This Guarantee is performable in Calgary,
Alberta, Canada, which shall be a proper place of venue for suit on or in
respect of this Guarantee. Guarantor irrevocably agrees that any legal
proceeding in respect of this Guarantee shall be brought in the courts of the
Province of Alberta and the courts of appeal therefrom (collectively, the
"Specified Courts"). Guarantor hereby irrevocably submits to the nonexclusive
jurisdiction of such courts.

9
<PAGE> 10

Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to any Loan Document
brought in any Specified Court, and hereby further irrevocably waives any
claims that any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has
been brought in an inconvenient forum. Guarantor further (1) agrees to
designate and maintain an agent for service of process in Calgary, Alberta,
Canada in connection with any such suit, action or proceeding and to deliver to
Administrative Agent evidence thereof and (2) irrevocably consents to the
service of process out of any of the aforementioned courts in any such suit,
action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered mail,
return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to Guarantor at its address as
provided in this Guarantee or as otherwise provided by governing law. Nothing
herein shall affect the right of any Agent or any Bank to commence legal
proceedings or otherwise proceed against Guarantor in any jurisdiction or to
serve process in any manner permitted by applicable law. Guarantor agrees that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law. THIS GUARANTEE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF THE PROVINCE OF ALBERTA AND OF CANADA
FROM TIME TO TIME IN EFFECT.

Section 6.9. Survival. The representations, covenants and agreements
set forth in this Guarantee shall continue and survive until final termination
of this Guarantee.

Section 6.10. Rights Cumulative; Delay Not Waiver. Any Agent's or
any Bank's exercise of any right, benefit or privilege under any of the Loan
Documents or any other papers or at law or in equity shall not preclude the
concurrent or subsequent exercise of any of any Agent's or any Bank's other
present or future rights, benefits or privileges. The remedies provided in
this Guarantee are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by
law, the Loan Documents or any other papers. No failure by any Agent or any
Bank to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right under any Loan Document
or any other papers shall operate as a waiver thereof.

Section 6.11. Severability. If any provision of this Guarantee is
held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable under present or future laws, the
legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Guarantee shall not be affected thereby, and this Guarantee shall be liberally
construed so as to carry out the intent of the parties to it.

Section 6.12. Entire Agreement. THIS GUARANTEE EMBODIES THE ENTIRE
AGREEMENT AND UNDERSTANDING AMONG GUARANTOR, AGENTS AND BANKS WITH RESPECT TO
ITS SUBJECT MATTER AND SUPERSEDES ALL PRIOR CONFLICTING OR INCONSISTENT
AGREEMENTS, CONSENTS AND UNDERSTANDINGS RELATING TO SUCH SUBJECT MATTER.
GUARANTOR ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THERE IS NO ORAL AGREEMENT AMONG
GUARANTOR,

10
<PAGE> 11

AGENTS AND BANKS WHICH HAS NOT BEEN INCORPORATED IN THIS GUARANTEE.

Section 6.13. Usury Not Intended; Saving Provisions.
Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in any Loan Document,
it is expressly provided that in no case or event shall the aggregate of any
amounts accrued or paid pursuant to this Guarantee which under applicable laws
are or may be deemed to constitute interest ever exceed the maximum nonusurious
interest rate permitted by applicable laws of the Province of Alberta or the
applicable laws of Canada, whichever permit the higher rate. In this
connection, Guarantor, Agents and Banks stipulate and agree that it is their
common and overriding intent to contract in strict compliance with applicable
usury laws. In furtherance thereof, none of the terms of this Guarantee shall
ever be construed to create a contract to pay, as consideration for the use,
forbearance or detention of money, interest at a rate in excess of the maximum
rate permitted by applicable laws. No Guarantor shall ever be liable for
interest in excess of the maximum rate permitted by applicable laws. If, for
any reason whatever, such interest paid or received during the full term of the
applicable indebtedness produces a rate which exceeds the maximum rate
permitted by applicable laws, Agents or Banks, as the case may be, shall credit
against the principal of such indebtedness (or, if such indebtedness shall have
been paid in full, shall refund to the payor of such interest) such portion of
said interest as shall be necessary to cause the interest paid to produce a
rate equal to the maximum rate permitted by applicable laws. All sums paid or
agreed to be paid to any Agent or any Bank for the use, forbearance or
detention of money shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be
amortized, prorated, allocated and spread in equal parts throughout the full
term of the applicable indebtedness, so that the interest rate is uniform
throughout the full term of such indebtedness. The provisions of this Section
shall control all agreements, whether now or hereafter existing and whether
written or oral, among Guarantor, Agents and Banks.

Section 6.14. Acknowledgement of Terms of Credit Agreement Binding
Upon Guarantor. Guarantor acknowledges and agrees to the covenants,
agreements, representations, warranties and other provisions of the Credit
Agreement which refer to the "Parent".

THIS GUARANTEE is executed as of the date first above written.
