MARKET PRICE OF COMMON STOCK AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS

The Company's common stock and certain of its preferred
series are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The common
stock is also traded on the Boston, Cincinnati, Midwest, Pacific
and Philadelphia stock exchanges. Common stock options are
traded on the American Stock Exchange. The ticker symbol is
"NMK".
Preferred dividends were paid on March 31, June 30,
September 30 and December 31. Common stock dividends were paid
on February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30. The Company
presently estimates that none of the 1993 common or preferred
stock dividends will constitute a return of capital and therefore
all of such dividends are subject to Federal tax as ordinary
income.
The table below shows quoted market prices and dividends per
share for the Company's common stock:

Dividends Price Range

4th Quarter .20 19 7/8 18 3/8

OTHER STOCKHOLDER MATTERS: The holders of Common Stock are
entitled to one vote per share and may not cumulate their votes
for the election of Directors. Whenever dividends on Preferred
Stock are in default in an amount equivalent to four full
quarterly dividends and thereafter until all dividends thereon
<PAGE>

are paid or declared and set aside for payment, the holders of
such stock can elect a majority of the Board of Directors.
Whenever dividends on any Preference Stock are in default in an 

<PAGE> 4

amount equivalent to six full quarterly dividends and thereafter
until all dividends thereon are paid or declared and set aside
for payment, the holders of such <PAGE> 4

stock can elect two members to the Board of Directors. No
dividends on Preferred Stock are now in arrears and no Preference
Stock is now outstanding. Upon any dissolution, liquidation or
winding up of the Company's business, the holders of Common Stock
are entitled to receive a pro rata share of all of the Company's
assets remaining and available for distribution after the full
amounts to which holders of Preferred and Preference Stock are
entitled have been satisfied.
The indenture securing the Company's mortgage debt provides
that surplus shall be reserved and held unavailable for the
payment of dividends on Common Stock to the extent that
expenditures for maintenance and repairs plus provisions for
depreciation do not exceed 2.25% of depreciable property as
defined therein. Such provisions have never resulted in a
restriction of the Company's surplus.
At year end, about 109,000 stockholders owned common shares
of the Company and about 5,000 held preferred stock. The chart
below summarizes common stockholder ownership by size of holding:

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION 
-----------------------------------------------------------
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
-------------------------

Overview of 1993
----------------

Earnings improved to $240.0 million or $1.71 per share as
compared to $219.9 million or $1.61 per share in 1992,
principally as a result of rate increases to electric and gas
customers. Although earnings improved, the Company's earned
return on equity of 10.2% was below the allowed return on utility
operations of 11.4%. Expectations for 1994 earnings indicate
only a slight improvement without an increase in electric base
rates and a modest increase in gas rates. Cost sharing
mechanisms for industrial customer discounts and the potential
for loss of industrial customers in 1994 will place earnings at
additional risk.
Even with modest earnings growth, the Company's relatively
low payout ratio, as compared to the rest of the electric and gas
utility industry, permitted an increase in the common stock
dividend to an annual rate of $1.00 from $.80, or 25% in 1993.
The Company is increasingly challenged to maintain its
financial condition under traditional regulation and in the face
of expanding competition. While utilities across the nation must
address these concerns to varying degrees, the Company may be
more vulnerable than others to competitive threats. The
following sections present an assessment of competitive threats
and steps being taken to improve the Company's strategic and
financial position.
Rating agencies, which evaluate the credit-worthiness of
various securities, including the Company's, have expressed
heightened concern about the future business prospects of the
utility industry. Standard & Poors Corporation has included the
Company in its "Below Average," or lowest rated group in its
assessment of business position. A more extensive discussion of
rating agency views is included under "Liquidity and Capital
Resources."

Changing Competitive Environment
--------------------------------

In 1993, the Company continued to address concerns relating
to increasing competition in the utility industry. The enactment
of the 1992 Federal Energy Policy Act (Act) has accelerated the
trend toward competition and deregulation in the wholesale market
(principally sales to others who will resell power to the retail
market), by creating a class of generators, called Exempt
Wholesale Generators (EWGs), which are able to sell power without
the regulatory constraints placed on generators such as the
Company. To further encourage wholesale competition, the Act
<PAGE>

opens access to utility transmission systems. The rules by which
such access will 

<PAGE> 9

be prioritized and priced have not been issued, and the potential
impact on the Company, as owner and lessee of significant
transmission assets, cannot be determined. Although the Act
prohibits direct sales to a utility's retail customer, New York
State retains the right to allow retail competition. In view of
these developments, the Company undertook a Comprehensive
Industry Restructuring and Competitive Assessment for the year
2000 (CIRCA 2000) to evaluate the means by which retail
competition may develop and the Company's ability to respond to
the associated threats and opportunities. While the future of
wholesale and retail markets is uncertain, the Company determined
through its CIRCA 2000 study that it must (a) reduce its total
cost of doing business and (b) improve its responsiveness to
changing business conditions.
Under the terms of its 1994 Rate Agreement, the Company is
required to file a "competitiveness" study with the New York
State Public Service Commission (PSC) by April 1, 1994.

Cost Control
------------

Cost control extends beyond those areas traditionally
thought to be under utility control, to all aspects of utility
pricing, including unregulated generator purchases, tax burdens
and mandated social and environmental programs. As a step
towards improving its competitive position, in early 1993 the
Company announced its intent to reduce its workforce by at least
1,400 positions by the end of 1995. While considerable progress
was made toward this goal in 1993, rapidly changing competitive
pressures made it clear that deeper cuts will be necessary.
Consequently, in January 1994, the Company decided that further
and faster workforce reductions would be necessary and announced
a layoff over the next several months of approximately 900
employees, increasing the total reduction to approximately 1,500.
Further reductions may be necessary.

Price Responsiveness
--------------------

As described in more detail below under "1995 Five-Year Rate
Plan Filing," the Company filed a five-year rate plan which would
establish prices for 1995 and a method by which prices would be
set for 1996 through 1999. The plan would cap the average annual
rate at approximately the annual rate of inflation, but would
also allow greater flexibility for Company pricing decisions
within each rate class (e.g., residential, commercial and
industrial) subject to the overall cap. The Company could, at
its discretion, offer discounts to customers that might be able
to leave the Company's system, but would in turn be limited to
<PAGE>

how much, if any, of the discounts could be recouped from other
classes. While the focus of pricing innovation has principally
been to retain industrial customers, the Company is also
evaluating innovative pricing alternatives for residential and
commercial customers.

<PAGE> 10

The flexibility and responsiveness of the plan to changing
business conditions is designed to better position the Company to
meet the challenges of increasing competition to protect
shareholder value. However, the Company must be disciplined in
its spending based upon its projections of price increases, if
any, sales and potential discounts during the five-year period.
The financial success of the Company under its price
indexing rate proposal is dependent on the ability of the Company
to control all of its costs. Because price indexing begins with
base prices set for 1995, inclusive of such things as fuel,
purchased power and taxes, the establishment of an appropriate
base is critical to the financial results of the Company during
the five-year period.
An ongoing generic investigation is being conducted by the
PSC into the issue of how to design rates for customers with
competitive electric and gas service alternatives. The Company
is developing proposals to further permit the necessary rate
flexibility to respond to competitive conditions in the industry.

UNREGULATED GENERATORS

In recent years, a leading factor in the increases in
customer bills and deterioration of the Company's competitiveness
is the requirement to purchase power from unregulated generators
at prices in excess of the Company's internal cost of production
and in volumes greater than the Company's needs. The Public
Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA), New York State
Law and PSC policies and procedures have collectively required
that the Company purchase this power from qualified unregulated
generators. The price used in negotiating purchased power
contracts with unregulated generators (Long Run Avoided Costs or
LRACs) is established periodically by the PSC. Until repeal in
1992, the statute which governed many of these contracts had
established the floor on avoided costs at $0.06/kwh (the Six-Cent
Law). The Six-Cent Law, in combination with other factors,
attracted large numbers of unregulated generators projects to New
York State and, in particular, to the Company's service
territory. 
As of December 31, 1993, 147 of these unregulated generators
with a combined capacity of 2,253 MW were on line and selling
power to the Company. The following table illustrates the actual
and estimated growth in capacity, payments and relative magnitude
of unregulated generator purchases compared to Company
requirements:

<PAGE>

<PAGE> 12

Most of the additional capacity will be grandfathered under
the Six-Cent Law. Without any other actions, the Company's
installed capacity reserve margin was projected to grow to 40%-
50% before declining in the late 1990's, as compared to the
minimum mandated requirement of 18%. While the Company favors
the availability of unregulated generators in satisfying its
generating needs, the Company believes it is paying a premium to
unregulated generators for energy it does not currently need. The
Company has initiated a series of actions to address this
situation but expects in large part that the higher costs will
continue. 
On August 18, 1992, the Company filed a petition with the
PSC which calls for the implementation of "curtailment
procedures." Under existing Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(FERC) and PSC policy, this petition would allow the Company to
limit its purchases from unregulated generators when demand is
low. While the Administrative Law Judge has submitted
recommendations to the PSC, the Company cannot now predict the
outcome of this case. Also, the Company has commenced settlement
discussions with certain unregulated generators regarding
curtailments.
On October 23, 1992, the Company also petitioned the PSC to
order unregulated generators to post letters of credit or other
firm security to protect ratepayers' interests in advance
payments made in prior years to these generators. The PSC
dismissed the original petition without prejudice, which the
Company believes would permit reinstatement of its request at a
later date. The Company is conducting discussions with
unregulated generators representing over 1,600 MW of capacity,
addressing the issues contained in its petitions.
On February 4, 1994 the Company notified the owners of nine
projects with contracts that provide for advance payments of the
Company's demand for adequate assurance that the owners will
perform all of their future repayment obligations, including the
obligation to deliver electricity in the future at prices below
the Company's avoided cost and to repay any advance payment which
remains outstanding at the end of the contract. The projects at
issue total 426 MW. The Company's demand is based on its
assessment of the amount of advance payments to be accumulated
under the terms of the contracts, future avoided costs and future
operating costs of the projects. The Company cannot predict the
outcome of this notification.
The Company and certain of its officers and employees have
been named in complaints resulting from the alleged termination,
among other matters, of purchase power contracts with Inter-Power
of New York, Inc. and Fourth Branch Associates Mechanicville.
The Company believes it has substantial defenses to both
complaints but is unable to predict the outcome of these matters
and, accordingly, has not established a provision for liability,
if any, in the Company's financial statements.

ASSET MANAGEMENT STUDIES - FOSSIL

The Company continually examines its competitive situation
and future strategic direction. Among other things, it has
studied the economics of continued operation of its fossil-fueled
generating plants, given current forecasts of excess capacity.
Growth in unregulated generator supply sources and compliance
requirements of the Clean Air Act are key considerations in
evaluating the Company's internal generation needs. While the
Company's coal-burning plants continue to be cost advantageous,
certain older units and certain gas/oil-burning units are being
carefully assessed to evaluate their economic value and estimated
remaining useful lives. Due to projected excess capacity, the
Company plans to retire or put certain units in long-term cold
standby. A total of 340 MW's of aging coal fired capacity is to
be retired by the end of 1999 and 850 MW's of oil fired capacity
is to be placed in long-term cold standby in 1994. The Company
is also continuing to evaluate under what circumstances the
standby plants would be returned to service, but barring
unforseen circumstances it is not likely that a return would
occur before the end of 1999. This action will permit the
reduction of operating costs and capital expenditures for retired
and standby plants. The Company believes that the remaining
investment in these plants of approximately $300 million at
December 31, 1993, will be fully recoverable in rates.

ASSET MANAGEMENT STUDIES - NINE MILE POINT NUCLEAR STATION 
UNIT NO.1

Under the terms of an earlier regulatory agreement, the
Company agreed to prepare and update studies of the advantages
and disadvantages of continued operation of Nine Mile Point
Nuclear Station Unit No. 1 (Unit 1). In the November 1992 study,
the continued operation of the unit under an "improved
performance case" was expected to provide a net present value
benefit in excess of $100 million. The unit operated within the
parameters of the improved performance case in 1993 and the
Company believes that continued operation of the Unit is
warranted. The Company's net investment in Unit 1 is
approximately $580 million and the estimated cost to decommission
the Unit based on the Company's 1989 study is $257 million in
1993 dollars. The next update is due to be submitted to the PSC
in late 1994. See NOTE 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements under "Unit 1 Economic Study").

GAS COMPETITION

Portions of the natural gas industry have undergone
significant structural changes. A major milestone in this
process occurred in November 1993 with the implementation of FERC
<PAGE>

Order 636. FERC Order 636 requires interstate pipelines to
unbundle pipeline sales services from pipeline transportation
service. These changes enable the Company to arrange for its gas
supply directly with producers, gas marketers or pipelines, at
its 

<PAGE> 14

discretion, as well as to arrange for transportation and gas
storage services. The flexibility provided to the Company by
these changes should enable it to protect its existing market and
still expand its core and non-core market offerings. With these
expanded opportunities come increased competition from gas
marketers and other utilities.
In short, the electric and gas utility industry is
undergoing changes and faces an uncertain future, therefore,
those utilities that succeed must be prepared to respond quickly
to change. Hence, the Company must be successful in, among other
things, managing the economic operation of its nuclear units and
addressing growing electric competition, expanded gas supply
competition, and various cost impacts, which include excess high-
cost unregulated generator power and increasing taxes. In
addition, the Company must implement the requirements of the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and also remediate hazardous
waste sites. While the Company believes that full recovery of
its investment will be provided through the rate setting process
with respect to all of the issues described herein, a review of
political and regulatory actions during the past 15 years with
respect to industry issues indicates that utility shareholders
may ultimately bear some of the burden of solving these problems.

REGULATORY AGREEMENTS

The Company's results during the past several years have
been strongly influenced by several agreements with the PSC. A
brief discussion of the key terms of certain of these agreements
is provided below.

1991 FINANCIAL RECOVERY AGREEMENT

The 1991 Financial Recovery Agreement (1991 Agreement)
established a $190.0 million electric rate increase effective
January 1, 1991 and also provided for electric rate increases of
2.9% ($75.4 million) effective July 1, 1991 and 1.9% ($55.7
million) effective July 1, 1992. Gas rates increased 1.0% ($5.5
million) on July 1, 1992. The 1991 Agreement also implemented
the Niagara Mohawk Electric Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (NERAM)
and the Measured Equity Return Incentive Term (MERIT), which are
discussed in more detail below.
The NERAM requires the Company to reconcile actual results
to forecast electric public sales gross margin used in
establishing rates. The NERAM produces certainty in the amount
of electric gross margin the Company will receive in a given
<PAGE>

period to fund its operations. While reducing risk during
periods of economic uncertainty and mitigating the variable
effects of weather, the NERAM does not allow the Company to
benefit from unforeseen growth in sales. Recovery or refund of
accruals pursuant to the NERAM is accomplished by a surcharge
(either plus or minus) to customers over a twelve month period,
to begin when cumulative amounts reach certain levels specified
in the 1991 Agreement. As of December 31, 1993, the Company had
a recoverable NERAM balance (amounts subject to reconciliation)
of $21.4 million. 
The Company has proposed discontinuation of NERAM beginning
in 1995 in exchange for greater pricing flexibility as discussed
further below under the "1995 Five-Year Rate Plan Filing."

<PAGE> 15

The MERIT program is the incentive mechanism which
originally allowed the Company to earn up to $180 million of
additional return on equity through May 31, 1994. The program
was later amended to extend the performance period through 1995
and add $10 million to the total available award. 
The PSC granted the full $30 million of MERIT award the
Company claimed for the period January 1991 through May 1991,
which was reflected in earnings in the third quarter of 1991
($.14 per common share). The second MERIT period, June 1991
through December 1991, had a maximum award of $30 million. Of
this amount, the PSC granted $22.8 million, or approximately $.11
per share, which the Company included in June 1992 earnings.
Measurement criteria for the $25 million of MERIT for 1992
focused on implementation of self-assessment recommendations,
including measurements of responsiveness to customers, nuclear
performance, cost management and environmental performance. The
Company claimed, and the PSC approved in 1993, a MERIT award of
approximately $14.3 million of which $4 million was included in
1992 earnings. The shortfall from the full award available
reflected the increasing difficulty of achieving the targets
established in customer service and cost management, as well as
lower than anticipated nuclear operating performance.
Overall goal targets and criteria for the 1993-1995 MERIT
periods are results-oriented and are intended to measure change
in key overall performance areas. The targets emphasize three
main areas: (1) responsiveness to customer needs, (2) efficiency
through cost management, improved operations and employee
empowerment, and (3) aggressive, responsible leadership in
addressing environmental issues.
A report supporting the achievement of MERIT goals for 1993
is anticipated to be submitted in February 1994 to the parties to
the 1991 Agreement. The Company anticipates claiming an award of
approximately $20 million, which would be expected to be billed
to customers over a twelve-month period, after PSC confirmation
of the earned award. The Company recorded $10 million of this
award in 1993 based on management's assessment of the achievement
<PAGE>

of objectively measured criteria. The shortfall from the full
award reflects the increasing difficulty of achieving the targets
established in customer service and cost benchmarking with other
utilities.

1993 RATE AGREEMENT

On January 27, 1993, the PSC approved a 1993 Rate Agreement
authorizing a 3.1% increase in the Company's electric and gas
rates providing for additional annual revenues of $108.5 million
(electric $98.4 million or 3.4%; gas $10.1 million or 1.8%).
Retroactive application of the new rates to January 1, 1993 was
authorized by the PSC.
The increase reflected an allowed return on equity of 11.4%,
as compared to 12.3% authorized for 1992. The agreement also
included extension of the NERAM through December 1993 and
provisions to defer expenses related to mitigation of unregulated
generator costs, (aggregating $50.7 million at December 31, 1993)
including contract buyout costs and certain other items. 

<PAGE> 16

The Company and the local unions of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, agreed on a two-year nine-
month labor contract effective June 1, 1993. The new labor
contract includes general wage increases of 4% on each June 1st
through 1995 and changes to employee benefit plans including
certain contributions by employees. Agreement was also reached
concerning several work practices which should result in improved
productivity and enhanced customer service. The PSC approved a
filing resulting from the union settlement and authorized $8.1
million in additional revenues ($6.8 million electric and $1.3
million gas) for 1993.

1994 RATE AGREEMENT

On February 2, 1994, the PSC approved an increase in gas
rates of $10.4 million or 1.7%. The gas rates became effective
as of January 1, 1994 and include for the first time a weather
normalization clause.
The PSC also approved the Company's electric supplement
agreement with the PSC Staff and other parties to extend certain
cost recovery mechanisms in the 1993 Rate Agreement without
increasing electric base rates for calendar year 1994. The goal
of the supplement is to keep total electric bill impacts for 1994
at or below the rate of inflation. Modifications were made to
the NERAM and MERIT provisions which determine how these amounts
are to be distributed to various customer classes and also
provide for the Company to absorb 20% of margin variances (within
certain limits) originating from SC-10 rate discounts (as
described below) and certain other discount programs for
industrial customers as well as 20% of the gross margin variance
from NERAM targets for industrial customers not subject to
<PAGE>

discounts. The Company estimates its total exposure on such
variances for 1994 to be approximately $10 million, depending on
the amount of discounts given. The supplement also allows the
Company to begin recovery over three years of approximately $15
million of unregulated generator buyout costs, subject to final
PSC determination with respect to the reasonableness of such
costs. 
The Company is experiencing a loss of industrial load
through bypass across its system. Several substantial industrial
customers, constituting approximately 85 MW of demand, have
chosen to purchase generation from other sources, either from
newly constructed facilities or under circumstances where they
directly use the power they had been generating and selling to
the Company under power purchase contracts mandated by PURPA and
New York laws and PSC programs.
As a first step in addressing the threat of a loss of
industrial load, the PSC approved a new rate (referred to as SC-
10) under which the Company is allowed to negotiate individual
contracts with some of its largest industrial and commercial
customers to provide them with electricity at lower prices.
Under the new rate, customers must demonstrate that leaving the
Company's system is an economically viable alternative. The
Company estimates that as many as 75 of its 235 largest customers
may be inclined to bypass the utility's system by making
electricity on 

<PAGE> 17

their own unless they receive price discounts, which would cost
about $26 million per year, while losing those 75 customers would
reduce net revenues by an estimated $100 million per year. As of
January 1994, the Company has offered annual SC-10 discounts to
customers totaling $6.6 million, of which $2.7 million have been
accepted.
On July 28, 1993, the Company petitioned the PSC for
permission to offer competitively priced natural gas to customers
who presently purchase gas from non-utility sources. The new
rate is designed to regain a share of the industrial and
commercial sales volume the Company lost in the 1980's when large
customers were allowed to buy gas from non-utility sources. The
Company will delay any implementation of this rate until the
issues are further addressed in a comprehensive generic
investigation, currently being conducted by the PSC, into the
issue of how to design rates for customers with competitive
electric and gas service alternatives.

1995 FIVE-YEAR RATE PLAN FILING
-------------------------------
On February 4, 1994, the Company made a combined electric
and gas rate filing for rates to be effective January 1, 1995
seeking a $133.7 million (4.3%) increase in electric revenues and
a $24.8 million (4.1%) increase 
in gas revenues. The electric filing includes a proposal to
institute a methodology to establish rates beginning in 1996 and
<PAGE>

running through 1999. The proposal would provide for rate
indexing to a quarterly forecast of the consumer price index as
adjusted for a productivity factor. The methodology sets a price
cap, but the Company may elect not to raise its rates up to the
cap. Such a decision would be based on the Company's assessment
of the market. NERAM and certain expense deferrals would be
eliminated, while the fuel adjustment clause would be modified to
cap the Company's exposure to fuel and purchased power cost
variances from forecast at $20 million annually. However,
certain items which are not within the Company's control would be
outside of the indexing; such items would include legislative,
accounting, regulatory and tax law changes as well as
environmental and nuclear decommissioning costs. These items and
the existing balances of certain other deferral items such as
MERIT and demand-side management (DSM), would be recovered or
returned using a temporary rate surcharge. The proposal would
also establish a minimum return on equity which, if not achieved,
would permit the Company to refile and reset base rates subject
to indexing or to seek some other form of rate relief.
Conversely, in the event earnings exceed an established maximum
allowed return on equity, such excess earnings would be used to
accelerate recovery of regulatory or other assets. The proposal
would provide the Company with greater flexibility to adjust
prices within customer classes to meet competitive pressures from
alternative electric suppliers while increasing the risk that the
Company will earn less than its allowed rate of return. Gas rate
adjustments beyond 1995 would follow traditional regulatory
methodology.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
---------------------

Earnings for 1993 were $240.0 million or $1.71 per share
compared with $219.9 million or $1.61 per share in 1992 and
$203.0 million or $1.49 per share in 1991. The primary factor
contributing to the increase in earnings in 1993 as compared to
1992 was the impact of electric and gas rate increases effective
January 1, 1993 and July 1, 1992. The 1992 increase over 1991
was due primarily to the rate increases for gas and electric
customers effective July 1, 1992 and July 1, 1991, and cost
management of operating expenses relative to amounts provided in
rates, offset by oil and gas writeoffs. 
In 1993, the Company's return on common equity improved
slightly to 10.2% from 10.1% in 1992 and 10.0% in 1991. The
Company's return on common equity for utility operations
authorized in the rate setting process was 11.4% for the year
ended December 31, 1993. Factors contributing to the earnings
deficiency in 1993 included lower than anticipated results from
the Company's subsidiaries, certain operating expenses which were
not included in rates and exclusion of Nine Mile Point Nuclear
Station Unit No. 2 (Unit 2) tax assets from the Company's rate
base (upon which the Company would otherwise earn a return) as a
<PAGE>

consequence of prior year write-off of disallowed Unit 2 costs.
The earnings deficiency experienced in 1992 resulted from similar
causes, as well as from write-downs of Canadian oil and gas
investments. 
Non-cash earnings in 1993 were only about 3% of earnings
available to common stockholders as compared to 16% in 1992. The
Company estimates non-cash earnings will represent approximately
9% of total earnings in 1994.
The Company anticipates a return on equity of about 10% in
1994. The ability to achieve or exceed this level of earnings is
dependent upon a number of key factors, including the ongoing
control of expenses, earning MERIT and DSM incentives and
realization of an anticipated growth in gas sales.
The following discussion and analysis highlights items
having a significant effect on operations during the three-year
period ended December 31, 1993. It may not be indicative of
future operations or earnings. It also should be read in
conjunction with the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
and other financial and statistical information appearing
elsewhere in this report.
ELECTRIC REVENUES increased $663.2 million or 24.8% over the
three-year period. This increase results primarily from rate
increases, NERAM revenues and other factors as indicated in the
table below. Approximately one-half of the increase in base
rates in 1991 through 1993 is the result of an increase in the
base cost of fuel, which would typically result in a similar
decrease in fuel and purchased power cost revenues, thus having a
revenue neutral impact. However, purchased power costs have
increased 

<PAGE> 19

significantly during this period, offsetting much of the
otherwise expected decrease in Fuel Adjustment Clause (FAC)
revenues. See "Regulatory Agreements" above for a discussion of
the rate increases and provisions of the regulatory agreements in
effect during this period.

While sales to ultimate customers in 1993 were up slightly
from 1992, this level of sales was substantially below the
forecast used in establishing rates for the year. As a result,
the Company accrued NERAM revenues of $65.7 million ($.31 per
share) during 1993 as compared to $41.7 million ($.20 per share)
of NERAM revenues in 1992.
Changes in fuel and purchased power cost revenues are
generally margin-neutral, while sales to other utilities, because
of regulatory sharing mechanisms, generally result in low margin
contribution to the Company. Thus, fluctuations in these revenue
components do not generally have a significant impact on net
operating income. Electric revenues reflect the billing of a
separate factor for DSM programs which provide for the recovery
of program related rebate costs and a Company incentive based on
10% of total net resource savings.
Electric kilowatt-hour sales were 37.7 billion in 1993, an
increase of 3.0% from 1992 and an increase of 2.7% over 1991.
The 1993 increase reflects increased sales to other electric
systems, while sales to ultimate consumers were generally flat.
(See Electric and Gas Statistics - Electric Sales). The Company
expects growth of approximately 1.2% in sales to ultimate
consumers in 1994. The effects of the recession that began in
1990 are expected to continue to put downward pressure on
industrial sales, which may be offset by growth in commercial and
residential sales. The electric margin effect of actual sales in
1994 will be adjusted by the NERAM except for the large
industrial customer class within which the Company will absorb
20% of the variance from the NERAM sales forecast. Industrial-
Special sales are New York State Power Authority allocations of
low-cost power to specified customers.

As indicated in the table below, internal generation from
fossil fuel sources continued to decline in 1993, principally at
the Oswego oil-fired facility and Albany gas-fired station,
corresponding to the increase in required unregulated generator
purchases. Nuclear generation levels increased due to fewer
unscheduled outages. Despite scheduled refueling and maintenance
outages for both units during 1993, Unit 1 operated at a capacity
factor of approximately 81% for 1993, while Unit 2 operated at
approximately 78%. The next nuclear refueling outages at each
unit are scheduled for 1995.

GAS REVENUES increased $115.5 million or 23.8% over the
three-year period. As shown by the table below, this increase is
primarily attributable to increased sales to ultimate customers,
increased base rates and increased spot market sales. While spot
market sales activity produced much of the revenue growth in
1993, these sales are generally from the higher priced gas
available and therefore yield margins substantially lower than
traditional sales to ultimate customers. Deregulation in the gas
production and pipeline sectors has enabled the Company to expand
into this activity. Rates for transported gas also yield lower
margins than gas sold directly by the Company, therefore changes
in gas revenues from transportation services have not had a
significant impact on earnings. Also, changes in purchased gas
adjustment clause revenues are generally margin-neutral.

GAS SALES, excluding transportation of customer-owned gas
<PAGE>

and spot market sales, were 83.2 million dekatherms in 1993, a
5.1% increase from 1992 and a 16.0% increase from 1991. (See
Electric and Gas Statistics - Gas Sales.) The increase in 1993
includes a 1.8% increase in residential sales, a 6.5% increase in
commercial sales, which were strongly influenced by weather, and
a 143.6% increase in industrial sales. The Gas SBU has added
19,000 new customers since 1991, primarily in the residential
class, an increase of 3.9%, and expects a continued increase in
new customers in 1994. During 1993, there also was a shift from
the transportation sales class to the industrial sales class
resulting from the implementation of a stand-by industrial rate.
The increase for 1992 included a 12.0% increase in sales in the
residential class and a 10.2% increase in sales in the commercial
class, reflecting milder weather factors, offset by a 2.2%
decrease in sales in the industrial class reflecting the
recession and fuel switching. 
In 1993, the Company transported 67.8 million dekatherms (a
slight increase from 1992) for customers purchasing gas directly
from producers but expects a substantial increase in such
transportation volumes in 1994 leading to a forecast increase in
total gas deliveries in 1994 of 13.2% above 1993 weather-adjusted
deliveries. Public sales are expected to decrease almost 1.0%. 

<PAGE> 28

Factors affecting these forecasts include the economy, the
relative price differences between oil and gas in combination
with the relative availability of each fuel, the expanded number
of cogeneration projects served by the Company and increased
marketing efforts. As authorized by the PSC, the Company accrued
$20.9 million of unbilled gas revenues as of December 31, 1993,
which have been deferred and are expected to be used to reduce
future gas revenue requirements. Changes in gas revenues and
dekatherm sales by customer group are detailed in the table
below:

The cost of gas purchased increased 13.6% in 1993 and 16.1%
in 1992 after having decreased 13.4% in 1991. The cost
fluctuations generally correspond to sales volume changes,
particularly in 1993, as spot market sales activity increased.
The Company sold 13.2 million dekatherms on the spot market in
1993 as compared to 1.1 million in 1992. This activity accounted
for two-thirds of the 1993 purchased gas expense increase. The
purchase gas cost increase associated with purchases for ultimate
consumers in 1993 resulted from a 8.7% increase in dekatherms
purchased combined with a 2.1% increase in rates charged by
suppliers offset by a $17.8 million decrease in purchased gas
costs and certain other items recognized and recovered through
the purchased gas adjustment clause. The increase associated
with purchases for ultimate consumers for 1992 was the result of
a 10.0% increase in dekatherms purchased, a 2.7% increase in
rates charged by the Company's suppliers, combined with an
increase of $5.2 million in purchased gas costs and certain other
items recognized and recovered through the purchased gas
adjustment clause. The Company's net cost per dekatherm
purchased for sales to ultimate consumers decreased to $3.34 in
1993 from $3.47 in 1992 which was higher than the net cost of
$3.31 in 1991.
Through the electric and purchased gas adjustment clauses,
costs of fuel, purchased power and gas purchased, above or below
the levels allowed in approved rate schedules, are billed or
credited to customers. The Company's electric fuel adjustment
clause provides for partial pass-through of fuel and purchased
power cost fluctuations from those forecast in rate proceedings,
with the Company absorbing a specific portion of increases or
retaining a portion of decreases to a maximum of $15 million per
rate year. The amounts absorbed in 1991 through 1993 are not
material. 
OTHER OPERATION expense, including wage increases in each
year, increased $73.2 million or 9.8% in 1993 as compared to
increases of 5.9% in 1992 and 7.8% in 1991. The 1993 increase is
otherwise due to an increase in DSM program expenses, nuclear
expenses related to increased production at Unit 1 and Unit 2 and
refueling outages, amortization of regulatory assets deferred in
prior years, increased recognition of other postretirement
benefit costs and inflation. The 1992 increase was also due to
increased computer software expenses and higher medical benefits
paid. The 1991 increase was also due to increases in bad debt
expense, environmental site investigation and remediation costs,
DSM program expenses and research and development costs. Bad
debts have increased during the recession and increased
collection efforts and innovative collection management also
contributed to the increased writeoffs.
MAINTENANCE EXPENSE increased 4.5% in 1993 principally due
to nuclear expenses incurred during the refueling outages at Unit
1 and Unit 2 offset by lower expenses on the fossil stations
because of economically driven shutdowns at the Oswego and Albany
plants as described above. Maintenance expense decreased
<PAGE>

slightly in 1992 as increased costs associated with outages at
Unit 1 and refueling 

<PAGE> 31

Unit 2 were offset by reduced transmission line maintenance
expenses. Maintenance expense decreased 1.8% in 1991 due to
lower Unit 2 maintenance partly offset by transmission line ice
storm damage.
DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION expense for 1993 and 1992
increased 0.9% and 5.9% over 1992 and 1991, respectively. The
increase is attributable to normal plant growth.
NET FEDERAL AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES for 1993 decreased due
to the tax benefit derived from the Company's Canadian subsidiary
upon the sale of its oil and gas investments. Net Federal and
foreign income taxes for 1992 and 1991 increased because of
increases in book taxable income. The increase in
OTHER TAXES in the three-year period is due principally to higher
property taxes resulting from property additions combined with
increased payroll and revenue-based taxes. 
OTHER ITEMS, NET, excluding Federal income taxes and
allowance for funds used during construction (AFC), increased
$23.4 million in 1993 and decreased $2.7 million in 1992. The
1993 increase was the effect of the recording in 1992 of a $45
million reserve against the carrying value of Canadian subsidiary
oil and gas reserves, offset in part by the recognition of the
Company's share of Unit 2 contractor litigation proceeds and
increased earnings by the Company's independent power subsidiary.
The 1991 decrease is primarily the result of a similar $22.7
million write-down of oil and gas reserves.
Net INTEREST CHARGES decreased $9.3 million in 1993 and
$10.9 million in 1992, primarily as the result of the refinancing
of debt at lower interest rates. Dividends on preferred stock
decreased $4.7 million, $3.9 million and $1.9 million in 1993,
1992 and 1991, respectively, because of reductions in amounts of
stock outstanding. The weighted average long-term debt interest
rate and preferred dividend rate paid, reflecting the actual cost
of variable rate issues, changed to 7.97% and 6.70%,
respectively, in 1993, from 8.29% and 7.04%, respectively, in
1992, and from 8.74% and 7.53%, respectively, in 1991.

EFFECTS OF CHANGING PRICES

The Company is especially sensitive to inflation because of
the amount of capital it typically needs and because its prices
are regulated using a rate base methodology that reflects the
historical cost of utility plant.
The Company's consolidated financial statements are based on
historical events and transactions when the purchasing power of
the dollar was substantially different from the present. The
effects of inflation on most utilities, including the Company,
are most significant in the areas of depreciation and utility
plant. The Company could not replace its utility plant and
equipment for the historical cost value at which they are
<PAGE>

recorded on the Company's books. In addition, the Company would
not replace these assets with identical ones due to technological
advances and regulatory changes that have occurred. In light of
these considerations, the 

<PAGE> 32

depreciation charges in operating expenses do not reflect the
current cost of providing service. The Company, however, will
seek additional revenue or reallocate resources to cover the
costs of maintaining service as assets are replaced or retired.

FINANCIAL POSITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
___________________________________________________

FINANCIAL POSITION

The Company's capital structure at December 31, 1993 was
54.6% long-term debt, 6.5% preferred stock and 38.9% common
equity, as compared to 56.4%, 7.4% and 36.2%, respectively, at
December 31, 1992. Book value of the common stock was $17.25 per
share at December 31, 1993 as compared to $16.33 per share at
December 31, 1992. The improvement in the capital structure and
book value is attributable primarily to reinvested earnings and
sales of common stock, although preferred stock redemptions also
contributed.
The 1993 ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 2.31 as
compared to an average ratio nationally of approximately 3.0 for
electric and gas utilities. The ratios of earnings to fixed
charges for 1992 and 1991 were 2.24 and 2.09, respectively. 
Firms which publish securities ratings have begun to impute
certain items into the Company's interest coverage calculations
and capital structure, the most significant of which is the
inclusion of a "leverage" factor for unregulated generator
contracts. These firms believe that the financial structure of
the unregulated generators (which typically have very high debt-
to-equity ratios) and the character of their power purchase
agreements increase the financial risk of utilities. The
Company's reported interest coverage and debt-to-equity ratios
have recently been discounted by varying amounts for purposes of
establishing credit ratings. Because of growing commitments for
unregulated generator purchases, the imputation can have a
material negative impact on the Company's financial indicators. 

CONSTRUCTION AND OTHER CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS
-------------------------------------------

The Company's total capital requirements consist of amounts
for the Company's construction program, working capital needs,
maturing debt issues and sinking fund provisions on preferred
stock, and have been affected by the Company's efforts in recent
years to lower capital costs through refinancing. Annual
expenditures for the years 1991 to 1993 for construction and
<PAGE>

nuclear fuel, including related AFC and overheads capitalized,
were $522.5 million, $502.2 million and $519.6 million,
respectively. 
The 1994 estimate for construction additions, including
overheads capitalized, nuclear fuel and AFC, is approximately
$510 million, of which approximately 90% is expected to be funded
by cash provided from operations. Mandatory and optional debt
and 

<PAGE> 33

preferred stock retirements and other requirements are expected
to add approximately another $545 million (expected to be
refinanced from external sources) to the Company's capital
requirements, for a total of $1,055 million. Current estimates
of total capital requirements for the years 1995 to 1998 decrease
considerably to $442, $474, $401 and $483 million, respectively,
of which $363, $405, $351, and $413 million relates to expected
construction additions. The reductions are linked to the
completion of debt refinancings as well as the reduced
construction spending. The estimate of construction additions
included in capital requirements for the period 1995 to 1998 will
be reviewed by management during 1994 with the objective of
further reducing these amounts where possible. 
The provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990
(Clean Air Act) are expected to have an impact on the Company's
fossil generation plants during the period through 2000 and
beyond. The Company is studying options for compliance with
Phase I of the Clean Air Act, which becomes effective January 1,
1995 and continues through 1999.
With respect to meeting sulfur dioxide emission limits in
Phase I of the Clean Air Act, only Dunkirk units 3 and 4 are
affected. Options under evaluation to comply with sulfur dioxide
emission limits at these units include switching to a lower
sulfur coal, reducing utilization of the units, and the purchase
of emission allowances. The Company also must lower its nitrous
oxide (NOx) emissions in Phase I. The Company spent
approximately $19 million in 1993 and has included $46 million in
its construction forecast for 1994 through 1997 to make
combustion modifications at its fossil fired plants including the
installation of low NOx burners at the Dunkirk and Huntley
plants. With respect to Phase II, greater reductions will be
required for both sulfur dioxide and NOx emissions. The Company
has conducted studies on its fossil fired units to examine
compliance options. Preliminary estimates for Phase II
compliance anticipate approximately $124 million in capital costs
and $21 million in annual expenses. The Company believes that
these capital costs, as well as incremental annual operating and
maintenance costs and fuel costs, will be recoverable from
ratepayers.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash flows to meet the Company's requirements for operating,
<PAGE>

investing and financing activities during the past three years
are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
During 1993, the Company raised approximately $892 million
from external sources, consisting of $635 million of First
Mortgage Bonds, $116.7 million of common stock and a net increase
of $140.3 million of short and intermediate term debt. The
proceeds of the $635 million of First Mortgage Bonds were used to
provide for the early redemption of approximately $602 million of
higher coupon First Mortgage Bonds. The Company continues to
investigate options 
<PAGE> 34

to reduce its embedded cost of long-term debt by taking advantage
of current lower interest rates.
External financing of approximately $750 million is expected
for 1994, of which approximately $545 million would be used for
scheduled and optional refundings. This external financing is
projected to consist of $425 million in long-term debt, $200
million from sales of common stock, $200 million of preferred
stock and a $75 million decrease in short-term debt. Common
stock sales at this amount will require shareholder approval to
increase the Company's common shares authorized and are
consistent with management's goal to improve the Company's
capital structure. External financing plans for 1995 to 1998 are
subject to periodic revision as underlying assumptions are
changed to reflect developments; still, the Company currently
anticipates external financing over this period will diminish in
the aggregate to approximately $420 million. Substantially all
financing is for refunding, as cash provided by operations is
expected to continue to provide funds for the Company's
construction program. The ultimate level of financing during
this four year period will reflect, among other things, the
Company's competitive positioning, uncertain energy demand due to
economic conditions and capital expenditures relating to
distribution and transmission load reliability projects, as well
as expansion of the gas business. Environmental standards
compliance costs, the effects of rate regulation and various
regulatory initiatives, the level of internally generated funds
and dividend payments, the availability and cost of capital and
the ability of the Company to meet its interest and preferred
stock dividend coverage requirements, to satisfy legal
requirements and restrictions in governing instruments and to
maintain an adequate credit rating also will impact the amount
and type of future external financing.
The Company has initiated a ten to fifteen year site
investigation and remediation program that seeks a) to identify
and remedy environmental contamination hazards in a proactive and
cost-effective manner and b) to ensure financial participation by
other responsible parties. The program involves sponsorship of
investigation, remediation and selected research projects for 42
Company-owned waste sites and, where appropriate, participation
in remedial action at 40 waste sites owned by others but where
the Company is one of a number of potentially responsible parties
(PRP).
<PAGE>

The Company has accrued a minimum liability of $240 million
at December 31, 1993 for its estimated liability for
investigation and remediation of certain Company-owned and
Company-associated hazardous waste sites, which represents the
low end of a range of estimates developed from the Company's
ongoing site investigation and remediation program. Of the $240
million accrued, $210 million relates to Company-owned sites and
$30 million represents the Company's estimated cost contribution
to sites with which it may be associated. The accrual of the
Company's cost contribution for PRP sites is derived by
estimating the total cost of clean-up of the sites and then
applying a contribution factor to the estimated 

<PAGE> 35

total cost. Total costs to investigate and remediate sites with
which the Company is associated as a PRP are estimated to be
approximately $590 million. 
The Company believes that costs incurred in the
investigation and remediation process are recoverable in the
ratesetting process as currently in effect. (See Note 8 of Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements under "Environmental
Contingencies"). Rate agreements since 1991 have included a
recovery mechanism and an annual allowance for costs expected to
be incurred for waste site investigation and remediation. The
recovery mechanism provides that expenditures over or under the
allowance be deferred for future rate consideration. The Company
does not expect these costs to impact external financing,
although any such impact is dependent upon the timing of
expenditures and associated recovery.
The Company also is undertaking environmental compliance
audits at many of its facilities. These audits may result in
additional expenditures for investigation and remediation that
the Company cannot currently estimate. 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) issued regulations
in 1988 requiring owners of nuclear power plants to place costs
associated with decommissioning activities for contaminated
portions of nuclear facilities into an external trust. Further,
the NRC established guidelines for determining minimum amounts
that must be available in the trust for these specified
decommissioning activities at the time of decommissioning.
Applying the NRC guidelines, the Company has estimated that the
minimum requirements for Unit 1 and its share of Unit 2,
respectively, will be $372 million and 
$169 million in 1993 dollars. The Company is seeking an increase
in its rate allowance for Unit 1 and Unit 2 decommissioning in
1995 to reflect new NRC minimum requirements. Amounts collected
for the NRC minimum are being placed in an external trust. (See
Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under
"Nuclear Plant Decommissioning").
The Company believes that traditionally available sources of
financing should be sufficient to satisfy the Company's external
financing needs during the period 1994 through 1998. As of
<PAGE>

December 31, 1993, the Company could issue an additional $1,899
million aggregate principal amount of First Mortgage Bonds. This
includes approximately $921 million from retired bonds without
regard to an interest coverage test and approximately $978
million supported by additional property currently certified and
available, assuming an 8% interest rate, under the applicable
tests set forth in the Company's mortgage trust indenture. The
Company also has authorized unissued Preferred Stock totaling
approximately $390 million and a total of $200 million of
Preference Stock is currently authorized for sale. The Company
will continue to explore and use, as appropriate, other methods
of raising funds. 
Ordinarily, construction related short-term borrowings are
refunded with long-term securities on a regular basis. This
approach generally results in the Company showing a working
capital deficit. Working capital deficits also may be
temporarily created 

<PAGE> 36

because of the seasonal nature of the Company's operations as
well as timing differences between the collection of customer
receivables and the payment of fuel and purchased power costs.
However, the Company has sufficient borrowing capacity to fund
such a deficit as necessary. Bank credit arrangements which, at
December 31, 1993, totaled $461 million are used by the Company
to enhance flexibility as to the type and timing of its long-term
security sales. 
The Company's charter restricts the amount of unsecured
indebtedness that may be incurred by the Company to 10% of
consolidated capitalization plus $50 million. The Company has
not reached this restrictive limit.
The Company's securities ratings at December 31, 1993, were:

Secured Preferred Commercial
Debt Stock Paper

Standard & Poors
Corporation BBB BBB- A-2 
Moody's Investors 
Service Baa2 baa3 P-2
Duff & Phelps BBB BBB- Not applicable
Fitch Investors 
Service BBB BBB- Not applicable

The security ratings set forth above are subject to revision
and/or withdrawal at any time by the respective rating
organizations and should not be considered a recommendation to
buy, sell or hold securities of the Company.
The Company's cost of financing and access to markets could
be negatively affected by events outside its control. The
Company's securities ratings could be negatively affected by,
<PAGE>

among other things, the continued growth in and its reliance on
unregulated generator purchase power requirements. Rating
agencies have expressed concern about the impact on Company
financial indicators and risk that unregulated generator
financial leveraging may have.
On October 27, 1993, Standard & Poors Corporation (S&P)
issued their revised electric utility financial ratio benchmarks.
S&P has made its benchmarks more stringent to counter increasing
business risk caused by accelerating competition in the electric
power industry as well as environmental and nuclear operating
cost pressure and slow earnings growth prospects. While the
Company was not downgraded (currently rated BBB), S&P revised the
Company's rating outlook from "stable" to "negative." Moody's
Investors Service also has indicated that it expects utility bond
ratings will come under increasing pressure over the next three
to five years because of changes in the business environment.
These assessments may increase the cost to issue new securities.
S&P also observed that because of the more disparate
business prospects for electric utilities, it was segregating
companies into <PAGE> 37

groups based upon competitive position, business prospects and
predictability of cash flows to withstand greater financial
risks. The Company was included in the "Below Average," or
lowest rated group in S&P's assessment of business position.
While the Company has not been informed of the specific reasons
for the classification, the Company's high cost structure, driven
principally by required unregulated generator purchases, sunk
costs of assets for serving customer load and operating taxes,
may be viewed as a significant disadvantage, particularly if and
to the extent that large portions of its business may be opened
up to competition. S&P's views are shared by others who follow
the Company and the electric utility industry. The Company is
taking a number of steps to address this matter as stated
elsewhere in this report.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT
____________________

The consolidated financial statements of Niagara Mohawk Power
Corporation and its subsidiaries were prepared by and are the
responsibility of management. Financial information contained
elsewhere in this Annual Report is consistent with that in the
financial statements.
To meet its responsibilities with respect to financial
information, management maintains and enforces a system of
internal accounting controls, which is designed to provide
reasonable assurance, on a cost effective basis, as to the
integrity, objectivity and reliability of the financial records
and protection of assets. This system includes communication
through written policies and procedures, an organizational
structure that provides for appropriate division of
responsibility and the training of personnel. This system is
also tested by a comprehensive internal audit program. In
<PAGE>

addition, the Company has a Corporate Policy Register and a Code
of Business Conduct which supply employees with a framework
describing and defining the Company's overall approach to
business and requires all employees to maintain the highest level
of ethical standards as well as requiring all management
employees to formally affirm their compliance with the Code.
The financial statements have been audited by Price
Waterhouse, the Company's independent accountants, in accordance
with generally accepted auditing standards. In planning and
performing their audit, Price Waterhouse considered the Company's
internal control structure in order to determine auditing
procedures for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
financial statements, and not to provide assurance on the
internal control structure. The independent accountants' audit
does not limit in any way management's responsibility for the
fair presentation of the financial statements and all other
information, whether audited or unaudited, in this Annual Report.
The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting of five
outside directors who are not employees, meets regularly with
management, internal auditors and Price Waterhouse to review and
discuss internal accounting controls, audit examinations and 

financial reporting matters. Price Waterhouse and the Company's
internal auditors have free access to meet individually with the
Audit Committee at any time, without management being present.

<PAGE> 39

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS
--------------------------------
To the Stockholders and
Board of Directors of
Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets
and the related consolidated statements of income and retained
earnings and of cash flows present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Niagara Mohawk Power
Corporation and its subsidiaries at December 31, 1993 and 1992,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each
of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our
audits of these statements in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards which require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for the
<PAGE>

opinion expressed above.
As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the financial statements,
the Company adopted the provisions of Statements of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and
No. 106, Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions, respectively, in 1993.
As discussed in Note 8, the Company is a defendant in
lawsuits relating to its actions with respect to certain
purchased power contracts. Management is unable to predict
whether the resolution of these matters will have a material
effect on its financial position or results of operations.
Accordingly, no provision for any liability that may result upon
resolution of this uncertainty has been made in the accompanying
1993 financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
------------------------------------------

NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The Company is subject to regulation by the PSC and FERC
with respect to its rates for service under a methodology which
establishes prices based on the Company's cost. The Company
maintains its accounting records on the basis of such regulation,
which it believes complies with generally accepted accounting
principles. The Company's accounting policies conform to
generally accepted accounting principles, as applied to regulated
public utilities, and are in accordance with the accounting
requirements and ratemaking practices of the regulatory
authorities.
Principles of Consolidation: The consolidated financial
statements include the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated. Assets and liabilities of its Canadian energy
subsidiary, Opinac Energy Corporation, are translated into U.S.
dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date.
Revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average
exchange rate in effect during the year. Currency translation
adjustments are recorded as a component of equity and do not have
a significant impact on financial condition. The results of
operations of the Company's oil and gas subsidiary are included
in other income and deductions on the Consolidated Statements of
Income and Retained Earnings.
Subsidiary oil and gas properties: During 1993, the Company sold
its interest in its Canadian oil and gas company, Opinac
Exploration Limited. This was done to streamline the Company's
business and focus on its core electric and gas utility assets.
The sale did not have a material impact on the Company's results
of operations or financial condition. The Company retained its
ownership of Opinac Energy Corporation and the Company's
subsidiary, Canadian Niagara Power Limited, an Ontario electric
utility company.
The net book value of oil and gas properties and equipment,
less related deferred income taxes, was limited to the sum of the
after tax present value of net revenues from proved oil and gas
reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved
properties. The calculation of future net revenues was based
upon prices and costs in effect at the end of the year. Based
upon the calculation of this "ceiling test" at December 31, 1991
and March 31, 1992, the Company recorded reserves of
approximately $23 million and $21 million, or an after tax effect
of $.07 and $.09 per share, respectively. At December 31, 1992,
the Company recorded a valuation reserve of $24 million, or an
after tax effect of $.09 per share, in light of a significant
decline in previous estimates of proved reserves as indicated by
lower than expected production volumes. The net investment in
such properties was approximately $101 million at December 31,
1992.
Utility Plant: The cost of additions to utility plant and of
<PAGE>

replacements of retirement units of property is capitalized.
Cost includes direct material, labor, overhead and AFC.
Replacement of minor items of utility plant and the cost of
current repairs and maintenance is charged to expense. Whenever
utility plant is retired, its original cost, together with the
cost of removal, less salvage, is charged to accumulated
depreciation. 
Allowance for Funds Used During Construction: The Company
capitalizes AFC in amounts equivalent to the cost of funds
devoted to plant under construction. AFC rates are determined in
accordance with FERC and PSC regulations. The AFC rate in effect
at December 31, 1993 was 6.5%. AFC is segregated into its two
components, borrowed funds and other funds, and is reflected in
the Interest Charges section and the Other Income and Deductions
section, respectively, of the Consolidated Statements of Income.
In 1985, pursuant to PSC authorization, the Company
discontinued accruing AFC on construction work in progress (CWIP)
for which a cash return was being allowed through inclusion in
rate base of that portion of the investment in Unit 2. Amounts
equal to Unit 2's AFC which was no longer accrued have been
accumulated in deferred debit and credit accounts up to the
commercial operation date of Unit 2, (each amounting to $239.9
million at December 31, 1993 and 1992), and await future
ratemaking disposition by the PSC. A portion of the deferred
credit could be utilized to reduce future revenue requirements
over a period shorter than the life of Unit 2, with a like amount
of deferred debit amortized and recovered in rates over the
remaining life of Unit 2.
Depreciation, Amortization and Nuclear Generating Plant
Decommissioning Costs: For accounting and regulatory purposes,
depreciation is computed on the straight-line basis using the
average or remaining service lives by classes of depreciable
property. The total provision for depreciation and amortization,
including amounts charged to clearing accounts, was $277.9
million for 1993, $275.3 million for 1992, and $260.2 million for
1991. The percentage relationship between the total provision
for depreciation and average depreciable property was 3.2% for
1993, 3.3% for 1992 and 3.2% for 1991. The Company performs
depreciation studies on a continuing basis and, upon approval by
the PSC, periodically adjusts the rates of its various classes of
depreciable property. 
Estimated decommissioning costs (costs to remove a nuclear
plant from service in the future) for the Company's Unit 1 and
its share of decommissioning costs of Unit 2 are being accrued
over the service life of the Unit, recovered in rates through an
annual allowance and charged to operations through depreciation
(See Note 7. "Nuclear Plant Decommissioning"). The Company
expects to commence decommissioning shortly after cessation of
operations using a method which removes or decontaminates Unit
components promptly.
Amortization of the cost of nuclear fuel is determined on
the basis of the quantity of heat produced for the generation of
electric energy. The cost of disposal of nuclear fuel, which
presently is $.001 per kilowatt-hour of net generation available
<PAGE>

for sale, is based upon a contract with the U.S. Department of
Energy. These costs are charged to operating expense and
recovered from customers through base rates or through the fuel
adjustment clause.
Revenues: Revenues are based on cycle billings rendered to
certain customers monthly and others bi-monthly. Although the
Company commenced the practice in 1988 of accruing electric
revenues for energy consumed and not billed at the end of the
fiscal year, the impact of such accruals has not yet been fully
recognized in the Company's results of operations. At December
31, 1993 and 1992, approximately $95.0 million and $77.8 million,
respectively, of unbilled revenues remained unrecognized in
results of operations and are included in Deferred Credits, and
may be used to reduce future revenue requirements. The amount of
the remaining deferred credit balance fluctuates as the amount of
accrued electric unbilled revenues is recalculated each year end.
At December 31, 1993, pursuant to PSC authorization the Company
accrued $20.9 million of unbilled gas revenues which will
similarly be used to reduce future gas revenue requirements, with
a portion to be used in 1994.
The Company's tariffs include electric and gas adjustment
clauses under which energy and purchased gas costs, respectively,
above or below the levels allowed in approved rate schedules, are
billed or credited to customers. The Company, as authorized by
the PSC, charges operations for energy and purchased gas cost
increases in the period of recovery. The PSC has periodically
authorized the Company to make changes in the level of allowed
energy and purchased gas costs included in approved rate
schedules. As a result of such periodic changes, a portion of
energy costs deferred at the time of change would not be
recovered or may be overrecovered under the normal operation of
the electric and gas adjustment clauses. However, the Company
has been permitted to defer and bill or credit such portions to
customers, through the electric and gas adjustment clauses, over
a specified period of time from the effective date of each
change. 
The Company's electric fuel adjustment clause provides for
partial pass-through of fuel and purchased power cost
fluctuations from amounts forecast, with the Company absorbing a
specific portion of increases or retaining a portion of decreases
up to a maximum of $15 million per rate year. Thereafter, 100%
of the fluctuation is to be passed on to ratepayers. The Company
also shares with ratepayers fluctuations from amounts forecast
for net resale margin and transmission benefits, with the Company
retaining/absorbing 20% and passing 80% through to ratepayers.
The amounts absorbed in 1991 through 1993 are not material.
Beginning in 1991, the Company's rate agreements provide for
NERAM, which requires the Company to reconcile actual results to
forecast electric public sales gross margin as defined and
utilized in establishing rates. Depending on the level of actual
sales, a liability to customers is created if sales exceed the
forecast and an asset is recorded for a sales shortfall, thereby
generally holding recorded electric gross margin to the level
forecast in establishing rates. The 1994 rate settlement
<PAGE>

provides for the operation of the NERAM through December 31,
1994. Recovery or refund of accruals pursuant to the NERAM is
accomplished by a surcharge (either plus or minus) to customers
over a twelve month period, to begin when cumulative amounts
reach certain specified levels.
Rate agreements since 1991 also include MERIT, under which
the Company has the opportunity to achieve earnings above its
allowed return on equity based on attainment of specified goals
associated with its self-assessment process. The MERIT program
provides for specific measurement periods and reporting for PSC
approval of MERIT earnings. Approved MERIT awards are billed to
customers over a period not greater than twelve months. The
Company records MERIT earnings when attainment of goals is
approved by the PSC or when objectively measured criteria are
achieved.
Federal Income Taxes: In accordance with PSC requirements, the
tax effect of book and tax timing differences is flowed through
except as required by the Internal Revenue Code or unless
authorized by the PSC to be deferred. As directed by the PSC,
the Company defers any amounts payable pursuant to the
alternative minimum tax rules. The Company has claimed
investment tax credits and deferred the benefits of such credits
as realized in accordance with PSC directives. Deferred
investment credits are amortized to Other Income and Deductions
over the useful life of the underlying property. For purposes of
computing capital cost recovery deductions and normalization, the
asset basis has been reduced by all or a portion of the credit
claimed consistent with then current tax laws. 
Since it is the Company's intention to reinvest the
undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries, no provision
is made for federal income taxes on these earnings. At December
31, 1993, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings of
foreign subsidiaries on which the Company has not provided
deferred taxes was approximately $109 million. It is expected
that the federal income taxes associated with these undistributed
earnings would be substantially reduced by foreign tax credits.
On January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for
Income Taxes. The adoption of SFAS 109 changes the Company's
method of accounting for income taxes from the deferred method to
an asset and liability approach. The asset and liability
approach requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and
assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary
differences between the recorded book bases and the tax bases of
assets and liabilities. The adoption of SFAS 109 did not have a
significant impact on the Company's 1993 results of operations,
and accordingly the effect of adoption has been included in
federal and foreign income taxes.
Amortization of Debt Issue Costs: The premium or discount and
debt expenses on long-term debt issues and on certain debt
retirements prior to maturity are amortized ratably over the
lives of the related issues and included in interest on long-term
debt in accordance with PSC directives.
Statement of Cash Flows: The Company considers all highly liquid
<PAGE>

investments, purchased with a remaining maturity of three months
or less, to be cash equivalents.
Reclassifications: Certain amounts from prior years have been
reclassified on the accompanying Consolidated Financial
Statements to conform with the 1993 presentation.

NOTE 2. BANK CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS 
---------------------------------

At December 31, 1993, the Company had $461 million of bank
credit arrangements with 19 banks. These credit arrangements
consisted of $220 million in commitments under Revolving
Credit Agreements (including a Revolving Credit Agreement for
HYDRA-CO Enterprises, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company), $140 million in one-year commitments under Credit
Agreements, $1 million in lines of credit and $100 million under
a Bankers Acceptance Facility Agreement. The Revolving Credit
Agreements which extend into 1994 are renewed annually, and the
interest rate applicable to borrowing is based on certain rate
options available under the Agreements. All of the other bank
credit arrangements are subject to review on an ongoing basis
with interest rates negotiated at the time of use. The Company
also issues commercial paper. Unused bank credit facilities are
held available to support the amount of commercial paper
outstanding. In addition to these credit arrangements, the
Company obtained $100 million in bank loans which will expire in
1994.
The Company pays fees for substantially all of its bank
credit arrangements. The Bankers Acceptance Facility Agreement,
which is used to finance the fuel inventory for the Company's
generating stations, provides for the payment of fees only at the
time of issuance of each acceptance. 
The following table summarizes additional information

</TABLE>
<PAGE>

Several series of First Mortgage Bonds and Notes were issued
to secure a like amount of tax-exempt revenue bonds issued by the
New York State Energy Research and Development Authority
(NYSERDA). Approximately $414 million of such notes bear
interest at a daily adjustable interest rate (with a Company
option to convert to other rates including a fixed interest rate
which would require the Company to issue First Mortgage Bonds to
secure the debt) which averaged 2.14% for 1993 and 2.43% for 1992
and are supported by bank direct pay letters of credit. Pursuant
to agreements between NYSERDA and the Company, proceeds from such
issues were used for the purpose of financing the construction of
certain pollution control facilities at the Company's generating
facilities or refund outstanding tax-exempt bonds and notes.
The $115.7 million of tax-exempt bonds due 2014 will be
refinanced at 7.2% during 1994 pursuant to a forward refunding
agreement entered into in 1992.
Notes Payable include a Swiss franc bond issue maturing in
1995 equivalent to $50 million in U.S. funds. Simultaneously
with the sale of these bonds, the Company entered into a currency
exchange agreement to fully hedge against currency exchange rate
fluctuations.
Other long-term debt in 1993 consists of obligations under
capital leases of approximately $45.3 million (See Note 8.
"Lease Commitments"), a liability to the U.S. Department of
Energy for nuclear fuel disposal of approximately $93.5 million
(See Note 7. "Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs") and liabilities for
unregulated generator contract termination of approximately $38.1
million.
Certain of the Company's debt securities provide for a
mandatory sinking fund for annual redemption. The aggregate
maturities of long-term debt for the five years subsequent to
December 31, 1993, excluding capital leases, are approximately
$211 million, $73 million, $61 million, $46 million and $66 
million, respectively.

NOTE 5. PENSION AND OTHER RETIREMENT PLANS 
-------------------------------------------

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries have non-
contributory, defined-benefit pension plans covering
substantially all their employees. Benefits are based on the
employee's years of service and compensation level. The pension
cost was $16.9 million for 1993, $23.2 million for 1992 and $23.9
million for 1991 ($5.6 million for 1993, $6.2 million for 1992
and $6.0 million for 1991 was related to construction labor and,
accordingly, was charged to construction projects). The
Company's general policy is to fund the pension costs accrued
with consideration given to the maximum amount that can be
deducted for Federal income tax purposes. Contributions are
intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service
to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future.

In 1993 and 1992, the discount rate and rate of increase
in future compensation levels used in determining the
actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligations
were 7.3% and 8.25% and 3.25% and 4.25% (plus merit
increases), respectively. The expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets was 9.00% in 1993 and 1992.
In addition to providing pension benefits, the Company and
its subsidiaries provide certain health care and life
insurance benefits for active and retired employees and
dependents. Under current policies, substantially all of the
Company's employees may be eligible for continuation of some
of these benefits upon normal or early retirement. These
benefits are provided through insurance companies whose
charges and premiums are based on the claims paid during the
year.
On January 1, 1993, the Company adopted SFAS No. 106,
Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions (OPEB). This Statement requires accrual accounting
by employers for postretirement benefits other than pensions
reflecting currently earned benefits. During 1993 the
Company established various trust funds to begin the funding
of the OPEB obligation. The Company made an initial
contribution, equal to the amount received in 1993 rates, of
approximately $12 million and anticipates contributing
approximately $23 million in 1994.

Net postretirement benefit cost for 1993 included the
following components:

in assumptions 

Unrecognized transition obligation to be amortized
over 20 years 388,600

Accrued postretirement benefit liability included $35,507
in the consolidated balance sheet 

At December 31, 1993, a pre-65 and post-65 health care
cost trend rate of 10.05% and 7.05%, respectively, was
assumed, trending down to 4.8% by 1999. If the health care
cost trend rate was increased by one percent, the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 1993
would increase by approximately 8.7% and the aggregate of the
service and interest cost component of net periodic
postretirement benefit cost for the year would increase by
approximately 7.8%. The discount rate used in determining
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.3%. 
During 1993, the PSC issued a Statement of Policy (SOP)
regarding the accounting for pension and postretirement
costs. With respect to postretirement benefits, the PSC
mandated a transition to full accrual accounting in rates
over a period not to exceed five years, with recovery of any
resultant deferrals over a period not to exceed twenty years
from the year of adoption. In accordance with its rate
agreement and the SOP, the Company has a $30.7 million
<PAGE>

regulatory asset at December 31, 1993 relating to the rate
transition for postretirement costs. The SOP requires
deferral of the difference between actual costs and rate
allowances and ten year amortization of actuarial gains and
losses for both pensions and postretirement costs effective
January 1, 1993. The 1993 pension cost was reduced by
approximately $8 million to reflect the effect of the change
in the amortization period of an actuarial gain of $90.6
million as of January 1, 1993. The Company does not expect
the true-up requirements or the change to amortization of
actuarial gains and losses to have a material impact on its
periodic benefit costs or results of operations. 
In November 1992, the FASB issued SFAS No. 112 "Employees'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits" which is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993. This
Statement, which the Company will adopt for 1994, requires
employers to recognize the obligation to provide
postemployment benefits if the obligation is attributable to
employees' past services, rights to those benefits are
vested, payment is probable and the amount of the benefits
can be reasonably estimated. The Company typically accounts
for such costs on a cash basis. The Company estimates the
postemployment benefit obligation to be approximately $11.4
million at January 1, 1994. In its 1994 rates, the Company
has included approximately $2.9 million, including capital,
representing the pay-as-you-go portion of the postemployment
benefit. The difference between the postemployment benefit
obligation and the rate allowance will be deferred, with the
proposed recovery occurring equally over three years
beginning in 1995. The Company believes that these costs
will be recovered based on current ratemaking principles.

The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA of
1993) was signed into law in August 1993. One of the
provisions of the OBRA of 1993 raises the federal corporate
statutory tax rate from 34% to 35%, retroactive to January
1, 1993. A provision of the 1993 Settlement provides for the
deferral of the effects of tax law changes.
SFAS 109 increased the accumulated deferred income tax
liability at January 1, 1993 by approximately $507 million,
represented substantially by tax benefits flowed-through to
rate payers in prior years (in the form of lower rates) upon
which deferred taxes had not been provided. At December 31,
1993, the deferred tax liabilities (assets) were comprised of

Accumulated deferred income taxes $1,313,483

The Company believes that the more significant effects of
adopting this pronouncement are (i) providing deferred taxes
for tax benefits flowed through to ratepayers, (ii)
adjustment of deferred tax assets and liabilities for enacted
changes in tax law or rates and (iii) prohibition of net-of-
tax accounting.
The Company routinely collects the increased tax liability
from previously flowed-through tax benefits. In addition,
the PSC issued effective January 15, 1993 a Statement of
Interim Policy on Accounting and Ratemaking Procedures to
implement SFAS 109. The statement required adoption of SFAS
109 on a revenue-neutral basis, recognizing the PSC's policy
of rate recovery when prior flow-through items reverse. The
Company has recorded income taxes recoverable, a regulatory
asset, in the amount of approximately $528 million, which is
comprised of previously flowed-through tax benefits, and
offset by temporary differences associated with deferred
investment tax credits and excess deferred taxes established
at tax rates greater than 35%. Substantially all of the
excess deferred taxes relate to property and are not subject
to immediate refund to customers in accordance with federal
law.

OPERATIONS ---------- 

The Company is the owner and operator of the 613 MW Unit 1
and the operator and a 41% co-owner of the 1,062 MW Unit 2.
Unit 1 was placed in commercial operation in 1969 and Unit 2
in 1988. 
Unit 1 Economic Study: Under the terms of a previous
regulatory agreement, the Company agreed to prepare and
update studies of the advantages and disadvantages of
continued operation of Unit 1 prior to the start of the next
two refueling outages. The first report, which recommended
continued operation of Unit 1 over the remaining term of its
license (2009), was filed with the PSC in March 1990.
On November 20, 1992 the Company submitted to the PSC an
updated economic analysis which indicated that Unit 1 can be
expected to provide value to customers and shareholders
through its next fuel cycle, which will end in early 1995.
The study also indicated that the Unit could continue to
provide benefits for the full term of its license if
operating costs can be reduced and generating output improved
above its historical average. 
The study analyzed a number of scenarios resulting in
break-even capacity factors, ranging from 44% to 122%. The
"base case" assumes a capacity factor of 61%, consistent with
the target reflected in the Unit 1 operating incentive
mechanism, and also assumes future operating and capital
costs slightly lower than historical performance. While a
marginal benefit would be realized from operating the Unit
for at least the next two years (one fuel cycle) under the
"base case," there would be a negative net present value in
excess of $100 million if the Unit were to be operated over
its remaining 17-year license period. Under an "improved
performance case", the Unit is assumed to operate at a 70%
capacity factor with future operating and capital costs
consistent with average industry performance. The Company
believes these goals are achievable for Unit 1, as indicated
by Unit 1 operating and financial performance in 1993 that
was better than the improved performance case. The "improved
performance case" results in positive net present value in
excess of $100 million if the Unit is operated over its
remaining life. Such results demonstrate the volatility of
the assumptions and uncertainties involved in developing the
Unit's economic forecast. These assumptions include various
levels of the Unit's capacity factor, operating and capital
costs, demand for electricity, supply of electricity
including unregulated generator power, implementation and
compliance costs of the Clean Air Act and other federal and
state environmental requirements and fuel availability and
prices, especially natural gas. Given the potential for
rapid and substantial change in any or all of these
assumptions, the Company has developed operational and
external criteria, other than refueling, which would initiate
a prompt reassessment of the economic viability of the Unit.
<PAGE>

An agreement with the PSC allows recovery of all
reasonable and prudently-incurred sunk costs and costs of
retirement, should a prudent decision be made to retire Unit
1 before early 1995. All parties to the 1991 Agreement
reserve the right to petition the PSC to institute a formal
investigation to review the prudence of any Company decision
to retire Unit 1. Any such decision by the Company will be
made in consultation with governmental and regulatory
authorities. The Company's net investment in Unit 1 is
approximately $580 million, exclusive of decommissioning
costs. See Nuclear Plant Decommissioning.
Unit 1 Status: On February 20, 1993, Unit 1 was taken out of
service for a planned 55 day refueling and maintenance
outage. On April 15, 1993, Unit 1 returned to service ahead
of schedule. The next refueling outage is scheduled to begin
in February 1995. Unit 1's capacity factor for 1993 was
approximately 81%. 
Unit 2 Status: On October 2, 1993, Unit 2 was taken out of
service for a planned 60 day refueling and maintenance
outage. On November 29, 1993, Unit 2 returned to service
ahead of schedule. The next refueling outage is scheduled to
begin in the spring of 1995. Unit 2's capacity factor for
1993 was approximately 78%.
Nuclear Plant Decommissioning: Based on a 1989 study, the
cost of decommissioning Unit 1, which is expected to begin in
the year 2009, is estimated by the Company to be
approximately $416 million at that time ($257 million in 1993
dollars). The Company's 41% share of the total cost to
decommission Unit 2, expected to begin in 2027, is estimated
by the Company to be approximately $316 million ($109 million
in 1993 dollars). The annual decommissioning allowance
reflected in ratemaking is based upon these estimates, which
include amounts for both radioactive and non-radioactive
dismantlement costs. The non-radioactive dismantlement costs
are estimated in the 1989 study to be $24 million for Unit 1
and $18 million for its share of Unit 2, in 1993 dollars.
Decommissioning costs recovered in rates are reflected in
Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization on the Balance
Sheet and amount to $113.9 million and $90.5 million at
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively. The annual
allowance for Unit 1 and the Company's share of Unit 2 for
the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 was
approximately $18.7, $23.1 and $23.0 million, respectively. 
The Company will update its Unit 1 decommissioning study
in 1994 in support of the update of the Unit 1 economic
study. The Unit 2 decommissioning study is also expected to
be updated in 1994. Rate allowance adjustments will be
sought when appropriate. There is no assurance that the
decommissioning allowance recovered in rates will ultimately
aggregate a sufficient amount to decommission the units.
However, the Company believes that if decommissioning costs
are higher than currently estimated they would ultimately be
recovered in the rate process. 
<PAGE>

The NRC issued regulations in 1988 requiring owners of
nuclear power plants to place funds into an external trust to
provide for the cost of decommissioning contaminated portions
of nuclear facilities as well as establishing minimum amounts
that must be available in such a trust for these specified
decommissioning activities at the time of decommissioning.
As of December 31, 1993, the Company has accumulated in an
external trust $63.1 million for Unit 1 and $15.4 million for
its share of Unit 2, which are included in Other Property and
Investments. Earnings on such investments aggregated $8.6
million through December 31, 1993 and, because they are
available to fund decommissioning, have also been included in
Accumulated Depreciation and Amortization. Amounts recovered
for non-radioactive dismantlement are accumulated in an
internal reserve fund which has an accumulated balance of
$35.4 million at December 31, 1993. 
Based upon studies applying the 1988 NRC regulations, the
Company had estimated that the minimum funding requirements
for Unit 1 and its share of Unit 2, respectively, would be
$191 million and $87 million in 1993 dollars. In May 1993,
the NRC established new labor, energy and burial cost factors
for determining the NRC minimum funding requirements. A
substantial increase in burial costs, partly offset by
reduced estimates in the volumes of waste to be disposed,
increased the NRC minimum requirement for Unit 1 to $372
million in 1993 dollars and the Company's share of Unit 2 to
$169 million in 1993 dollars. The Company has requested an
annual aggregate increase of approximately $10 million in the
Unit 1 and Unit 2 decommissioning allowances as part of its
1995 rate request, to reflect the increased NRC minimum
requirements. 
Nuclear Liability Insurance: The Atomic Energy Act of 1954,
as amended, requires the purchase of nuclear liability
insurance from the Nuclear Insurance Pools in amounts as
determined by the NRC. At the present time, the Company
maintains the required $200 million of nuclear liability
insurance.
In August 1993, the statutory liability limits for the
protection of the public under the Price-Anderson Amendments
Act of 1988 (the Act) were further increased. With respect
to a nuclear incident at a licensed reactor, the statutory
limit, which is in excess of the $200 million of nuclear
liability insurance, was increased to approximately $8.8
billion. This limit would be funded by assessments of up to
$75.5 million for each of the 116 presently licensed nuclear
reactors in the United States, payable at a rate not to
exceed $10 million per reactor per year. Such assessments
are subject to periodic inflation indexing and to a 5%
surcharge if funds prove insufficient to pay claims.
The Company's interest in Units 1 and 2 could expose it to
a potential loss, for each accident, of $106.5 million
through assessments of $14.1 million per year in the event of
a serious nuclear accident at its own or another licensed
U.S. commercial nuclear reactor. The amendments also
<PAGE>

provide, among other things, that insurance and indemnity
will cover precautionary evacuations whether or not a nuclear
incident actually occurs.
Nuclear Property Insurance: The Nine Mile Point Nuclear Site
has $500 million primary nuclear property insurance with the
Nuclear Insurance Pools (ANI/MRP). In addition, there is
$800 million in excess of the $500 million primary nuclear
insurance with the Nuclear Insurance Pools (ANI/MRP) and $1.4
billion, which is also in excess of the $500 million primary
and the $800 million excess nuclear insurance, with Nuclear
Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL). NEIL is a utility
industry-owned mutual insurance company chartered in Bermuda.
The total nuclear property insurance is $2.7 billion. NEIL
also provides insurance coverage against the extra expense
incurred in purchasing replacement power during prolonged
accidental outages. The insurance provides coverage for
outages for 156 weeks after a 21 week waiting period.
NEIL insurance is subject to retrospective premium
adjustment under which the Company could be assessed up to
approximately $11.3 million per loss.
Low Level Radioactive Waste: The Federal Low Level
Radioactive Waste Policy Act requires states to join compacts
or individually develop their own low level radioactive waste
disposal site. In response to the Federal law, New York
State decided to develop its own site because of the large
volume of low level radioactive waste it generates and
committed by January 1, 1993 to develop a plan for the
management of low level radioactive waste in New York State
during the interim period until a disposal facility is
available.
New York State is developing disposal methodology and
acceptance criteria for a disposal facility. A revised New
York State low level radioactive waste site development
schedule now assumes two possible siting scenarios, a
volunteer approach and a non-volunteer approach, either of
which would begin operation in 2001. An extension of access
to the Barnwell, South Carolina waste disposal facility was
made available to out-of-region low level radioactive waste
generators by the state of South Carolina through June 30,
1994, and New York State has elected to use this option. The
Company has a low level radioactive waste management program
and contingency plan so that Unit 1 and Unit 2 will be
prepared to properly handle interim on-site storage of low
level radioactive waste for at least a 10 year period, if
required.
Nuclear Fuel Disposal Cost: In January 1983, the Nuclear
Waste Policy Act of 1982 (the Nuclear Waste Act) established
a cost of $.001 per kilowatt-hour of net generation for
current disposal of nuclear fuel and provides for a
determination of the Company's liability to the Department of
Energy (DOE) for the disposal of nuclear fuel irradiated
prior to 1983. The Nuclear Waste Act also provides three
payment options for liquidating such liability and the
Company has elected to delay payment, with interest, until
<PAGE>

1998, the year in which the Company had initially planned to
ship irradiated fuel to an approved DOE disposal facility.
Progress in developing the DOE facility has been slow and it
is anticipated that the DOE facility will not be ready to
accept deliveries until at least 2010. The Company does not
anticipate that the DOE will accept all of its spent fuel
immediately upon opening of the facility, but rather expects
a transfer period of as long as 20 years. With Unit 1
expected to be retired in 2009, the Company must consider
some form of storage if it intends to begin immediate
dismantlement. The Company has several alternatives under
consideration to provide additional storage facilities, as
necessary. Each alternative will likely require NRC
approval, may require other regulatory approvals and would
likely require the incurrance of additional costs. The
Company does not believe that the possible unavailability of
the DOE disposal facility until 2006 will inhibit operation
of either Unit.
The Energy Policy Act provides for the establishment of a
federal decontamination and decommissioning fund to provide
for the environmentally safe closure of DOE uranium
processing facilities, funded in part by nuclear utilities.
The Company has recorded its estimated liability to this fund
based on prior DOE nuclear fuel processing services it
received and its initial assessment during 1993. The
liability is expected to be recovered as a fuel expense as
provided by the Act and is payable over 14 years ending in
2007, with annual assessments indexed for inflation.

NOTE 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
--------------------------------------

Construction Program: The Company is committed to an ongoing
construction program to assure reliable delivery of its
electric and gas services. The Company presently estimates
that the construction program for the years 1994 through 1998
will require approximately $1.57 billion, excluding AFC,
nuclear fuel and certain overheads capitalized. For the
years 1994 through 1998, the estimates are $408 million, $295
million, $287 million, $291 million and $285 million,
respectively. These amounts are reviewed by management as
circumstances dictate. 
Long-term Contracts for the Purchase of Electric Power: At
January 1, 1994,the Company had long-term contracts to
purchase electric power from the following generating
facilities owned by the New York Power Authority (NYPA):
<PAGE>

<TABLE>

(a) 40,000 kw for summer of 1994; 63,000 kw for winter of 1994-95.
</TABLE>
<PAGE>

The purchase capacities shown above are based on the
contracts currently in effect. The estimated annual capacity
costs are subject to price escalation and are exclusive of
applicable energy charges. The total cost of purchases under
these contracts was approximately $72.2 million, $64.4
million and $61.2 million for the years 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively. 
Under the requirements of the Federal Public Utility
Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, the Company is required to
purchase power generated by unregulated generators, as
defined therein. Of the 147 facilities providing energy to
the Company at December 31, 1993, five require the Company to
make capacity payments, including payments when a production
plant is not operating, and are subject to price escalation.
Each facility must meet certain availability and performance
obligations prior to receiving capacity payments. The terms
of these five contracts allow the Company to schedule energy
deliveries from the facilities and then pay for the energy
that is delivered. These five facilities account for
approximately 380,000 kw of capacity with contract lengths
ranging from 20 to 35 years. The total cost of purchases
under these five contracts in 1993 was $56.6 million and the
1994 estimated annual capacity and energy payments are
estimated to be approximately $105.5 million and $50 million,
respectively, subject to scheduling, the availability and
tested capacity of these facilities, and price escalation.
Capacity payments under these five contracts for 1995 to 1998
would be $109 million, $120 million, $127 million and $130
million, respectively and would aggregate to approximately
$3.5 billion over the terms of the contracts. Contracts
relating to the remaining facilities in service at December
31, 1993, require the Company to pay only when energy is
delivered. 
The Company paid approximately $736 million (including the
amount discussed above), $543 million and $268 million in
1993, 1992 and 1991 for 11,720,000 mwhrs, 8,632,000 mwhrs and
4,303,000 mwhrs, respectively, of energy under all
unregulated generator contracts. 
Through December 31, 1993, the Company had entered into
agreements with current and prospective unregulated
generators for approximately 2,400 MW of capacity. The
ultimate amount of the commitment and the available capacity
are dependent upon the completion of these projects. Based
upon these contracts as of December 31, 1993, the Company
estimates that it will be obligated to make payments to
unregulated generators of (in millions): $932 in 1994,
$1,057 in 1995, $1,111 in 1996, $1,174 in 1997 and $1,220 in
1998. The Company recovers all payments to unregulated
generators through base rates or through the FAC.
Sale of Customer Receivables: The Company has an agreement
whereby it can sell an undivided interest in a designated
pool of customer receivables, including accrued unbilled
<PAGE>

electric revenues, up to a maximum of $200 million. At
December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively, $200 million of
receivables had been sold under this agreement. The
undivided interest in the designated pool of receivables was
sold with limited recourse. The agreement provides for a
loss reserve pursuant to which additional customer
receivables are assigned to the purchaser to protect against
bad debts. To the extent actual loss experience of the pool
receivables exceeds the loss reserve, the purchaser absorbs
the excess. For receivables sold, the Company has retained
collection and administrative responsibilities as agent for
the purchaser. As collections reduce previously sold
undivided interests, new receivables are customarily sold.
Tax assessments: The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has
conducted an examination of the Company's Federal income tax
returns for the years 1987 and 1988 and has submitted a
Revenue Agents' Report to the Company. The IRS has proposed
various adjustments to the Company's federal income tax
liability for these years which could increase the Federal
income tax liability by approximately $80 million before
assessment of penalties and interest. Included in these
proposed adjustments are several significant issues involving
Unit 2. The Company is vigorously defending its position on
each of the issues, and submitted a protest to the IRS in
1993. Pursuant to the Unit 2 settlement entered into in
1990, to the extent the IRS is able to sustain disallowances,
the Company will be required to absorb a portion of any
disallowance. The Company believes any such disallowance
will not have a material impact on its financial position or
results of operations.
Litigation: On March 22, 1993, a complaint was filed in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, Albany County,
against the Company and certain of its officers and
employees. The plaintiff, Inter-Power of New York, Inc.
(Inter-Power), alleges, among other matters, fraud, negligent
misrepresentation and breach of contract in connection with
the Company's alleged termination of a power purchase
agreement in January 1993. The power purchase agreement was
entered into in early 1988 in connection with a 200 MW
cogeneration project to be developed by Inter-Power in
Halfmoon, New York. The plaintiff is seeking enforcement of
the original contract or compensatory and punitive damages on
fourteen causes of action in an aggregate amount that would
not exceed $1 billion, excluding pre-judgment interest.
The Company believes it has done no wrong, and intends to
vigorously defend against this action. On May 7, 1993, the
Company filed an answer denying liability and raising certain
affirmative defenses. Thereafter, the Company and Inter-
Power filed cross-motions for summary judgement. The court
dismissed two of Inter-Power's fourteen causes of action but
otherwise denied the Company's motion. The court also
dismissed two of the Company's affirmative defenses and
otherwise denied Inter-Power's cross-motion. Both parties
have filed Notices of Appeals regarding these dismissals.
<PAGE>

Discovery is in progress. The ultimate outcome of the
litigation cannot presently be determined. 
On November 12, 1993, Fourth Branch Associates
Mechanicville ("Fourth Branch"), filed suit against the
Company and several of its officers and employees in the New
York Supreme Court, Albany County, seeking compensatory
damages of $50 million, punitive damages of $100 million and
injunctive and other related relief. The suit grows out of
the Company's termination of a contract for Fourth Branch to
operate and maintain a hydroelectric plant the Company owns
in the Town of Halfmoon, New York. Fourth Branch's complaint
also alleges claims based on the inability of Fourth Branch
and the Company to agree on terms for the purchase of power
from a new facility that Fourth Branch hoped to construct at
the Mechanicville site. On January 3, 1994, the defendants
filed a joint motion to dismiss Fourth Branch's complaint.
The Company believes that it has substantial defenses to
Fourth Branch's claims, but is unable to predict the outcome
of this litigation.
Accordingly, no provision for liability, if any, that may
result from either of these suits has been made in the
Company's financial statements. Environmental Contingencies:
The public utility industry typically utilizes and/or
generates in its operations a broad range of potentially
hazardous wastes and by-products. These wastes or by-
products may not have previously been considered hazardous,
and may not be considered hazardous currently, but may be
identified as such by Federal, state or local authorities in
the future. The Company believes it is handling identified
wastes and by-products in a manner consistent with Federal,
state and local requirements and has implemented an
environmental audit program to identify any potential areas
of concern and assure compliance with such requirements. The
Company is also currently conducting a program to investigate
and restore, as necessary to meet current environmental
standards, certain properties associated with its former gas
manufacturing process and other properties which the Company
has learned may be contaminated with industrial waste, as
well as investigating identified industrial waste sites as to
which it may be determined that the Company contributed. The
Company has been advised that various Federal, state or local
agencies believe that certain properties require
investigation and has prioritized the sites based on
available information in order to enhance the management of
investigation and remediation, if determined to be necessary.
The Company is currently aware of 82 sites with which it
has been or may be associated, including 42 which are
Company-owned. The Company-owned sites include 23 former
coal gasification (MGP) sites, 14 industrial waste sites and
5 operating property sites where corrective actions may be
deemed necessary to prevent, contain and/or remediate
contamination of soil and/or water in the vicinity. Of these
Company-owned sites, Saratoga Springs is on the Federal
National Priorities List for Uncontrolled Hazardous Waste
<PAGE>

Sites (NPL) as published by the Environmental Protection
Agency in the Federal Register. The 40 non-owned sites with
which the Company has been or may be associated are generally
industrial waste sites where the Company is alleged to be a
PRP and may be required to contribute some proportionate
share towards investigation and clean-up. Not included in
the 82 sites are seven sites where the Company has reached
settlement agreements with other PRP's and three sites where
remediation activities have been completed. There also exist
approximately 20 formerly-owned MGP sites with which the
Company has been or may be associated that may require future
investigation and remediation. To date, the Company has not
been made aware of any claims. Also, approximately 22 fire
training sites owned or used by the Company have been
identified but not investigated. Presently, the Company is
unable to determine its potential involvement with such sites
and has made no provision for liability, if any, at this
time.
Investigations at each of the Company-owned sites are
designed to (1) determine if environmental contamination
problems exist, (2) determine the extent, rate of movement
and concentration of pollutants, (3) if necessary, determine
the appropriate remedial actions required for site
restoration and (4) where appropriate, identify other parties
who should bear some or all of the cost of remediation.
Legal action against such other parties, if necessary, will
be initiated. After site investigations have been completed,
the Company expects to determine site-specific remedial
actions necessary and to estimate the attendant costs for
restoration. However, since technologies are still
developing and the Company has not yet undertaken any full-
scale remedial actions following regulatory requirements at
any identified sites, nor have any detailed remedial designs
been prepared or submitted to appropriate regulatory
agencies, the ultimate cost of remedial actions may change
substantially as investigation and remediation progresses. 
The Company has estimated that it is probable that 36 of
the 42 owned sites will require some degree of investigation,
remediation and monitoring. This conclusion is based upon a
number of factors, including the nature of the identified or
potential contaminants, the location and size of the site,
the proximity of the site to sensitive resources, the status
of regulatory investigation and knowledge of activities at
similarly situated sites. Although the Company has not
extensively investigated many of those sites, it believes it
has sufficient information to estimate a range of cost of
investigation and remediation. As a consequence of site
characterizations and assessments completed to date, the
Company has accrued a liability of $210 million for these
owned sites, representing the low end of the range of the
estimated cost for investigation and remediation. The high
end of the range is presently estimated at approximately $520
million.
The majority of these cost estimates relate to the MGP
<PAGE>

sites. Of the 23 MGP sites, Harbor Point (Utica, NY) and
Saratoga Springs are subject to regulatory enforcement
actions and to date have remedial investigation and/or
feasibility study work in progress. The remaining 21 MGP
sites are the subject of an Order on Consent executed with
the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
(DEC) providing for an investigation and remediation program
over approximately ten years. Preliminary site assessments
have been conducted or are in process at five of these 21
sites, with remedial investigations either currently in
process or scheduled for 1994. Remedial investigations were
also conducted for two industrial waste sites and for three
operating properties where corrective actions were considered
necessary. 
The Company does not currently believe that a clean-up
will be required at the 6 remaining Company-owned sites,
although some degree of investigation of these sites is
included in its investigation and remediation program.
With respect to the 40 sites with which the Company has
been or may be associated as a PRP, 9 are on the NPL. Total
costs to investigate and remediate the sites with which the
Company is associated as a PRP are estimated to be
approximately $590 million; however, the Company estimates
its share of this total at approximately $30 million and this
amount has been accrued at December 31, 1993. 
The seven settlement agreements reached with other PRP's
were settled in an amount not material to the Company. Two
of these (Ludlow Landfill and Wide Beach) are on the NPL and
have been settled by the Company in an aggregate amount of
less than $300,000. For the 9 sites included on the NPL, the
Company's potential contribution factor varies for each site.
The estimated aggregate liability for these sites is not
material and is included in the determination of the amounts
accrued.
Estimates of the Company's potential liability for PRP
sites are derived by estimating the total cost of site clean-
up and then applying the related Company contribution factor
to that estimate. Estimates of the total clean-up costs are
determined by using the Company's investigation to date, if
any, discussions with other PRPs and, where no information is
known at the time of estimate, the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) estimates based on average costs disclosed in
the Federal Register of June 23, 1993. The contribution
factor is calculated using either the Company's percentage
share based upon the total number of PRPs named or otherwise
identified, which assumes all PRPs will contribute equally,
or the percentage agreed upon with other PRPs through
steering committee negotiations or by other means. Actual
Company expenditures for these sites are dependent upon the
total cost of investigation and remediation and the ultimate
determination of the Company's share of responsibility for
such costs as well as the financial viability of other
identified responsible parties since clean-up obligations are
joint and several. The Company has denied any responsibility
<PAGE>

in certain of these PRP sites and is contesting liability
accordingly.
The EPA advised the Company by letter that it is one of
833 PRPs under Superfund for the investigation and cleanup of
the Maxey Flats Nuclear Disposal Site in Morehead, Kentucky.
The Company has contributed to a study of this site and
estimates that the cost to the Company for its share of
investigation and remediation based on its contribution
factor of 1.3% would approximate $1 million, which the
Company believes will be recoverable in the ratesetting
process.
On July 21, 1988, the Company received notice of a motion
by Reynolds Metals Company to add the Company as a third
party defendant in an ongoing Superfund lawsuit in Federal
District Court, Northern District of New York. This suit
involves PCB oil contamination at the York Oil Site in Moira,
New York. Waste oil was transported to the site during the
1960's and 1970's by contractors of Peirce Oil Company
(owners/operators of the site) who picked up waste oil at
locations throughout Central New York, allegedly including
one or more Company facilities. On May 26, 1992, the Company
was formally served in a Federal Court action initiated by
the government against 8 additional defendants. Pursuant to
the requirements of a case management order issued by the
Court on March 13, 1992, the Company has also been served in
related third and fourth-party actions for contribution
initiated by other defendants. Discovery is now in progress.
The goal of this effort is to provide adequate information to
form a basis for achieving a voluntary allocation of
liability among the parties.
The Company believes that costs incurred in the
investigation and restoration process for both Company-owned
sites and sites with which it is associated will be
recoverable in the ratesetting process. Rate agreements in
effect since 1991 provide for recovery of anticipated
investigation and remediation expenditures, although the PSC
Staff reserves the right to review the appropriateness of the
costs incurred. While the PSC Staff has not challenged any
remediation costs to date, the PSC Staff asserted in the
recently-decided gas rate proceeding that the Company must,
in future rate proceedings, justify why it is appropriate
that remediation costs associated with non-utility property
owned by the Company be recovered from ratepayers. The
Company's 1994 rate settlement includes $21.7 million for
site investigation and remediation. Based upon management's
assessment that remediation costs will be recovered from
ratepayers, a regulatory asset has been recorded representing
the future recovery of remediation obligations accrued to
date.
The Company also agreed in rate agreements to a cost
sharing arrangement with respect to one industrial waste
site. The Company does not believe that this cost sharing
agreement, as it relates to this particular industrial waste
site, will have a material effect on the Company's financial
<PAGE>

position or results of operations.
The Company is also in the process of providing notices of
insurance claims to carriers with respect to the
investigation and remediation costs for manufactured gas
plant and industrial waste sites. The Company is unable to
predict whether such insurance claims will be successful.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Order 636: In 1992, the
FERC issued Order 636, which requires interstate pipelines to
unbundle pipeline sales services from pipeline transportation
service. These changes enable the Company to arrange for its
gas supply directly with producers, gas marketers or
pipelines, at its discretion, as well as arrange for
transportation and gas storage services. 
As a result of these structural changes, pipelines face
"transition" costs from implementation of the Order. The
principal costs are: unrecovered gas cost that would
otherwise have been billable to pipeline customers under
previously existing rules, costs related to restructuring
existing gas supply contracts and costs of assets needed to
implement the order (such as meters, valves, etc.). Under
the Order, pipelines are allowed to recover 100% of prudently
incurred costs from customers. Prudence will be determined
by FERC review.
The amount of restructuring costs ultimately billed to the
Company will be determined in accordance with pipeline
restructuring plans which have been submitted to the FERC for
approval. There are four pipelines to which the Company has
some liability. The Company is actively participating in
FERC hearings on these matters to ensure an equitable
allocation of costs. The restructuring costs will be
primarily reflected in demand charges paid to reserve space
on the various interstate pipelines and will be billed over a
period of approximately 7 years, with billings more heavily
weighted to the first 3 years. 
Based upon information presently available to the Company
from the petitions filed by the pipelines, the Company's
participation in settlement negotiations, and the three
settlements to which it is a party, its liability for the
pipelines' unrecovered gas costs is expected to be as much as
$31 million and its liability for pipeline restructuring
costs could be as much as $38 million. The Company has
recorded a liability of $31 million at December 31, 1993,
representing the low end of the range of such transition
costs. The Company is unable to predict the final outcome of
current pipeline restructuring settlements and the ultimate
amounts for which it will be liable or the period over which
this liability will be billed.
Based upon Management's assessment that transition costs
will be recovered from ratepayers, a regulatory asset has
been recorded representing the future recovery of transition
costs accrued to date. Currently, such costs billed to the
Company are treated as a cost of purchased gas and
recoverable through the operation of the gas adjustment
clause mechanism.

NOTE 9 - DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS ------------------------------------------------
------------

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate
the fair value of each class of financial instruments:
Cash and short-term investments: The carrying amount
approximates fair value because of the short maturity of the
financial instruments.
Long-term investments: The carrying value and market value
are not material to the financial statements.
Mandatorily redeemable preferred stock: Fair value of the
mandatorily redeemable preferred stock has been determined by
one of the Company's brokers or estimated by management based
on discounted cash flows.
Long-term debt: The fair value of the Company's long-term
debt has been estimated by one of the Company's brokers. The
carrying value of NYSERDA bonds, the Oswego Facilities Trust
and other long-term debt are considered to approximate fair
value.
The estimated fair values of the Company's financial
instruments are as follows:

damage or disaster of sufficient severity to prevent the conduct and
management of the affairs, business and property of the Bank by its directors
and officers as contemplated by these By-Laws, any two or more available
members of the then-incumbent Executive Committee shall constitute a quorum
of that committee for the full conduct and management of the affairs,
business and property of the Bank. In the event of the unavailability at
such time of a minimum of two members of the then-incumbent Executive
Committee, any three available directors shall constitute the Executive
Committee for the full conduct and management of the affairs, business and
property of the Bank. This by-law shall be subject to implementation by
resolutions of the Board passed from time to time for that purpose, and any
provisions of these By-Laws (other than this section) and any resolutions
which are contrary to the provisions of this section or to the provisions of
any such implementary resolutions shall be suspended until it shall be
determined by any interim Executive Committee acting under this section that
it shall be to the advantage of the Bank to resume the conduct and management
of its affairs, business and property under all of the other provisions of
these By-Laws.

Section 8.5 Indemnification.

a. The Bank shall indemnify each person made or threatened to be
made a party to any action or proceeding, whether civil or criminal, by
reason of the fact that such person or such person's testator or intestate is
or was a director or officer of the Bank, or, while a director or officer,
serves or served, at the request of the Bank, any other corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise
in any capacity, against judgments, fines, penalties, amounts paid in
settlement and reasonable expenses, including attorney's fees, incurred in
connection with such action or proceeding, or any appeal therein, provided
that no such indemnification shall be made if a judgment or other final
adjudication adverse to such director or officer establishes that his or her
acts were committed in bad faith or were the result of active and deliberate
dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so adjudicated, or that
he or she personally gained in fact a financial profit or other advantage to
which he or she was not legally entitled, and provided further that no such
indemnification shall be required with respect to any settlement or other
nonjudicated disposition of any threatened or pending action or proceeding
unless the Bank has given its prior consent to such settlement or other
disposition.

b. The Bank shall advance or promptly reimburse upon request any
director or officer seeking indemnification hereunder for all expenses,
including attorneys' fees, reasonably incurred in defending any action or
proceeding in advance or the final disposition thereof upon receipt of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such person to repay such amount if such
person is ultimately found not to be entitled to indemnification or, where
indemnification is granted, to the extent the expenses so advanced or
reimbursed exceed the amount to which such person is entitled.

c. This Section 8.5 shall be given retroactive effect, and the
full benefits hereof shall be available in respect of any alleged or actual
occurrences, acts or failures to act prior to the date of the adoption of
this Section 8.5. The right to indemnification of advancement of expenses
under this Section 8.5 shall be a contract right.

Section 8.6 Amendments. These By-Laws may be added to, amended,
altered or repealed at any regular meeting of the Board by a vote of a
majority of the total number of the directors, or at any meeting or
stockholders, duly called and held, by a majority of the stock represented at
such meeting.

I, Helen Kujawa, CERTIFY that I am the duly appointed Secretary of
Marine Midland Bank and, as such officer, have access to its official records
and the foregoing By-Laws are the By-Laws of the Bank, and all of them are
now lawfully in force and effect.

IN TESTIMONY WHEREOF, I have hereunto affixed my official signature
and the seal of the Bank, in New York, on January 27, 1994.
