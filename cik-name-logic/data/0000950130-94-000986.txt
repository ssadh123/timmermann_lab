Item: 2. Disposition of Assets
---------------------

(a) On June 29, 1994, Varity Corporation (the Company) completed the
previously announced sale of the stock of Massey Ferguson Group
Limited and certain assets which collectively comprise its
worldwide Massey Ferguson (MF) farm equipment business to AGCO
Corporation (AGCO) for $310 million in cash and 500,000 shares of
AGCO common stock. The transaction excluded cash and
indebtedness as well as certain liabilities primarily pertaining
to pension and retiree medical benefits for all former North
American MF employees, for which the Company will continue to be
responsible. The nature and amount of consideration was
determined by arms-length negotiations between representatives of
the Company and AGCO.

The Company has had an ongoing relationship with AGCO. In 1993,
the Company appointed AGCO exclusive distributor of farm
equipment in North America for MF and sold to AGCO substantially
all of the net assets, primarily dealer accounts receivable and
inventories, of MF's North American operations as well as a 50%
interest in Agricredit Acceptance Corporation (Agricredit), MF's
North American retail finance business. In 1994, AGCO purchased
the remaining 50% of Agricredit.

In connection with the current sale, the Perkins Group, a wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Company, entered into a long-term supply
agreement with AGCO for the continued use of Perkins diesel
engines in MF products.

NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

(a) To reflect sales of Perkins' diesel engines to MF as third party under the
long-term supply agreement with AGCO. Such sales were previously accounted
for as intercompany and accordingly were eliminated in consolidation. It
is impractical to determine the precise gross margin on such sales and as a
result, the actual gross margin realized in future periods in all
likelihood will be different than that used for pro forma purposes.

(b) To record the benefit of reduced pension expense resulting from planned
contributions to underfunded pension plans, principally in the Company's
automotive products segment. A portion of the proceeds from the sale is
intended to fund such contributions. (See adjustment (e)).

(c) To reflect the reduction in interest expense associated with the debt that
would have been repaid based on the intended use of proceeds of $310
million and to reflect interest income earned on residual cash proceeds.
For pro forma purposes the debt paydown was made on subordinated debt with
interest rates ranging from 4.75% to 13.75% and senior debt with interest
rates ranging from 5.0% to 9.75%. In addition, a portion of the remaining
proceeds would have been used to repay short-term borrowings. Residual
proceeds, after planned contributions to underfunded pension plans and the
planned purchase of annuity contracts for MF pension plans, are reported as
interest earning cash. No tax effect is recorded as any net increase in
pretax income would have been offset through the use of tax loss
carryforwards.

(d) To recognize interest accretion on residual postretirement benefits
retained by the Company.

(e) Represents the application of $310 million of proceeds arising from the
sale, including $60 million to be contributed to underfunded pension plans
and $13 million to be used to purchase insurance contracts to annuitize
vested benefits under retained MF pension plans. In accordance with
certain provisions in the purchase and sale agreement, approximately $78
million in cash is to be received from AGCO within 49 days from closing,
which for pro forma purposes has been assumed to have been received.

7
<PAGE>

(f) To record the AGCO common stock consideration received in connection with
the sale. These securities are available-for-sale as defined in Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, "Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." For pro forma purposes, it has
been assumed that there has not been any change in the underlying share
price of AGCO's common stock, and the price as of June 29, 1994 has been
used as a surrogate in the balance sheet as of April 30, 1994.

(g) To record receivables arising from the sale of Perkins' diesel engines to
MF as third party under the long-term supply agreement with AGCO. Such
receivables were previously accounted for as intercompany and accordingly
were eliminated in consolidation.

(h) To eliminate the net MF assets sold to AGCO.

(i) To record the accrual of additional expenses and liabilities relating to
the sale, including previously unrecognized actuarial losses in connection
with retained postretirement benefits, professional fees and other
liabilities for retained obligations. (See (k) below).

(j) To reduce the additional minimum pension liability and corresponding
stockholders' equity reduction, relating primarily to the automotive
products segment, due to planned contributions to underfunded pension
plans. (See adjustment (e)).

(k) To record the gain from the sale of the farm equipment business. The pro
forma consolidated statements of operations exclude the $23.2 million gain
arising from the sale.

(l) To eliminate previously deferred foreign currency translation losses in
connection with the sale of MF. (See (k) above).
