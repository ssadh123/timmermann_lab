For Immediate Release

R.R. DONNELLEY TO APPEAL DECISION IN
MEREDITH/BURDA LITIGATION

CHICAGO, January 5, 1994--R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company will appeal an initial 
decision favoring the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in its challenge to the 
company's 1990 acquisition of the Meredith/Burda companies. Administrative Law 
Judge Lewis F. Parker found the acquisition has or may substantially lessen 
competition in a "high-volume publication gravure printing" market and ordered 
the divestiture of four plants involved in the original acquisition.

"The company believes the acquisition was legally proper," stated David C. 
Hart, vice president and general counsel of R.R. Donnelley. "Judge Parker's 
decision is wrong and contrary to the findings of U.S. District Court Judge 
Stanley Harris, who allowed the acquisition to proceed despite the FTC's 
attempt to enjoin its consummation on the same grounds. We will appeal this 
ruling to the full Federal Trade Commission and on to the Federal courts, if
needed." Hart added that the appeal will have the effect of staying the judge's
order.
