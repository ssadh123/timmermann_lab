ITEM 5: OTHER EVENTS

The Company reported a loss of 56 cents per
share for the fourth quarter of 1993, compared to losses
of 38 cents in the fourth quarter of 1992 and 65 cents in
the third quarter of 1993. Excluding non-recurring items
in each quarter, the Company incurred a 35 cent loss in
the fourth quarter of 1993, compared to losses of 56
cents in the fourth quarter of 1992 and 40 cents in the
third quarter of 1993.

For the year, the loss per share of $1.98
compared to a loss of $5.05 in 1992. Excluding non-
recurring items in each period, the Company incurred a
loss of $1.44 per share in 1993, compared to a loss of
$1.33 in 1992. The non-recurring items for 1993 included
an eight cent charge as a result of the adoption in the
fourth quarter, retroactive to January 1, 1993, of the
new Financial Accounting Standards Board accounting
standard for postemployment benefits.

Despite significant improvements in the
Company's operating performance and higher earnings in
its wood products business, results for the year and the
quarter ended December 31, 1993 were affected by
continued weak prices for pulp and certain of its paper
grades.

The Company's paper segment reported a loss
from operations for the year of $134 million compared
with a loss of $7 million in 1992. The fourth quarter
loss of $24 million compared with losses of $16 million a
year ago and $22 million in the third quarter of 1993.

The Company's wood products segment reported
income from operations of $248 million for the year, up
from $125 million in 1992. Fourth quarter income from
operations of $57 million improved from $32 million in
both the prior and year-ago quarters. The improved
earnings were due primarily to significantly higher
prices for lumber, plywood and timber.
