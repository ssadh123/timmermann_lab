Item 5. Other Events

(1) On June 14, 1994, First of America entered into a definitive
agreement to acquire F&C Bancshares, Inc., a $406 million in
assets savings and loan holding company based in Port
Charlotte, Florida. It is anticipated F&C Bancshares'
3,242,209 common shares will be exchanged tax-free for
shares of First of America Common Stock. The exchange ratio
will equal $23.25 divided by the average closing price of
First of America Common Stock during the last 15 trading
days immediately prior to, but not including, the third
business day before the completion of the transaction.
However, the exchange ratio will not exceed .6436 and will
not be less than .5519. On the basis of current market
price of First of America Common Stock, the transaction has
an indicated value of approximately $72 million. First of
America intends to account for the acquisition as a pooling
of interests. The acquisition, subject to approval by F&C
Bancshares' shareholders and regulatory authorities, is
currently expected to be completed by the end of 1994, and
will include the merger of F&C Bancshares' subsidiary, First
Federal Savings Bank of Charlotte County, into First of
America Bank - Florida, F.S.B. Concurrently with the
execution of the definitive agreement, First of America and
F&C Bancshares executed a Warrant Agreement pursuant to
which F&C Bancshares issued a Warrant to First of America
entitling First of America to purchase up to 648,400 shares
of F&C Bancshares common stock upon the occurence of certain
events set forth in the Warrant Agreement.

Effective on June 28, 1994, First of America entered into a
definitive agreement to acquire Presidential Holding
Company, a $224 million in assets savings and loan holding
company based in Sarasota, Florida. It is anticipated
Presidential's 716,188 common shares will be exchanged tax-
free for shares of First of America Common Stock. The
exchange ratio will equal $33.25 divided by the average
closing price of First of America Common Stock during the
last 15 trading days immediately prior to, but not
including, the third business day before the completion of
the transaction. However, the exchange ratio will not
exceed .9837 and will not be less than .8735. On the basis
of current market price of First of America Common Stock,
the transaction has an indicated value of $24 million.
First of America intends to account for the acquisition as a
pooling of interests. The acquisition, subject to approval
by regulatory authorities, is currently expected to be
completed in the fourth quarter 1994 or first quarter 1995,
with the merger of Presidential's subsidiary, Presidential
Bank, F.S.B., into First of America Bank - Florida, F.S.B.

(2) On July 14, 1994, First of America Bank Corporation ("First
of America") issued a news release announcing its earnings
and related financial information for the second quarter of

1994. The text of the news release and the financial
information released with it follow.

PRESS RELEASE

FIRST OF AMERICA BANK CORP. REPORTS 2ND QUARTER RESULTS;
2ND QTR EARNINGS PER SHARE $.88; AND
YTD NET INCOME DOWN 5.7% WITH RETURN ON ASSETS AT 1.04%

KALAMAZOO, Mich., July 14, 1994 -- First of America Bank
Corporation (NYSE: FOA) today reported second quarter net income
of $53.2 million, or $.88 per share, a decrease of 10.8 percent
from net income of $59.6 million, or $1.00 per share, reported
for the second quarter of 1993. Year-to-date, 1994 net income
was $111.5 million, or $1.86 per share, compared with $118.2
million, or $1.98 per share, for the same 1993 period.

Daniel R. Smith, chairman and chief executive officer, First of
America Bank Corporation, stated, "Our second quarter results
were obviously below our expectations. A reduced net interest
margin and lower gains on the sales of loans and securities
contributed to a reduction in net income when compared with last
year. Additionally, unsettled financial markets lowered revenue
in several areas. Mortgage banking revenues declined along with
the drop in mortgage refinancing activity and mutual fund sales
have flattened. These revenue shortfalls occurred while we were
taking deliberate steps to expand these lines of business. We
planned our added investment in these businesses because we
believe that they are important to our long term earnings
potential and growth in shareholder value.

"There is good news to report," Smith continued. "A large
portion of our commercial loans, residential mortgages and credit
cards are variable rate loans, and as they continue to reprice
over the next few weeks and months, revenues will rise. Our
asset quality, always high, has improved even more, and loan
growth this quarter was stronger than it has been in several
years."

Smith said, "This quarter also included our move into Florida --
an exciting development in the history of our company and the
opportunity to do business in a rapidly growing area of the
country. We have operated our Florida bank now for two and a
half months and are on target with our plans to convert their
operations to our systems this month. By year-end, we should
complete two pending acquisitions which will more than double the
size of our presence there. The combined impact of our
acquisitions in Florida and Illinois this quarter lowered
earnings per share by $.03.

"This quarter's results should be kept in perspective,"
concluded Smith. "Our company is producing revenue growth --
just not as fast as we had hoped. We will continue to scrutinize
planned expenses to make sure that they add more immediate
benefit. Both for the remainder of 1994 and the long term, the
outlook for our company remains positive."

Return on average assets was 0.96 percent for the quarter,
compared with 1.17 percent in 1993, and for the year-to-date
period, it was 1.04 percent versus 1.18 percent last year.
Return on average equity was 13.92 percent for the second quarter
of 1994 and 14.69 percent for the six-month period, compared with
17.16 percent and 17.35 percent for the respective 1993 periods. 

Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin
Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin

Net interest income was $234.8 million for the second quarter, an
increase of 3.1 percent over last year's $227.7 million. Year-
to-date, net interest income increased 3.0 percent to $461.8
million versus $448.2 million in 1993, as a result of a higher
level of earning assets. Total loan growth was 9.6 percent, and
excluding acquisitions during the last twelve months, it was 8.2
percent. During the second quarter of 1994 excluding
acquisitions, residential mortgages grew 10.4 percent,
annualized, as variable rate loans were added to the portfolio.
Consumer loans were up 30.5 percent, annualized, for the quarter
and 22.7 percent for the year. Commercial loans grew 11.9
percent, annualized, for the quarter. 

The net interest margin for the second quarter was 4.65 percent
down from 4.92 percent in 1993. For the six-month period, the
net interest margin was 4.73 percent compared with 4.92 percent a
year ago. Factors compressing the margin were the repricing of a
significant portion of the fixed rate credit card portfolio,
growth in other consumer loans at aggressive pricing levels and
the run-up in short term rates since March. In addition, the
thrift deposits added in Illinois and Florida this year lowered
the second quarter net interest margin by 7 basis points compared
with a year ago and the year-to-date margin by 4 basis points. 

Non-interest Income
Non-interest Income

Non-interest income was up only slightly for the quarter and 3.7
percent for the six-month period. Both gains on the sale of
securities and gains on the sale of residential mortgages were
lower in 1994, while trust and financial services income,
mortgage servicing income and credit card fees continued to grow.

Traditional trust fees were up 8.0 percent for the quarter and
7.4 percent for the six-month period. Financial service fees
from cash management, brokerage and investment management were
$5.3 million in the second quarter of 1994 versus $5.4 million a
year ago; for the six-month period they increased 6.5 percent to
$10.8 million in 1994 compared with $10.1 million last year.

Income from mortgage banking activities was affected by the
decreased refinancing activity, which more than offset the
continued growth in the servicing portfolio. Mortgage servicing
income increased to $2.4 million for the quarter, up 40.4 percent
from a year ago, and for the six-month period, was $4.5 million,

up 27.6 percent from last year. Residential mortgage originations
during the second quarter of 1994 were $598 million versus $756
million a year ago, while gains on the sale of such loans were
$1.9 million compared with $5.8 million. Year-to-date, the
impact of gains on the sale of loans was $0.09 per share, down
from $0.13 per share in 1993.

Credit card fees increased, following the growth of the revolving
loan portfolio. The fees, totaling $10.2 million in the second
quarter of 1994 and $19.7 million in the six-month period, were
up 9.1 percent and 10.2 percent, respectively.

Gains on the sale of securities were $1.2 million in the second
quarter, or $0.01 per share, compared with $2.5 million, or $0.03
per share, a year ago. For the year-to-date period, the gains
were $0.09 per share versus $0.11 per share last year.

Non-interest expense
Non-interest expense

Total non-interest expense increased 7.0 percent for the quarter
and 6.8 percent for the year-to-date period, as a result of
acquisitions, other expansion initiatives and developmental
costs. Second quarter's increase of $13.3 million over last year
included $5.7 million in costs and intangible amortization from
the added operations of the Florida bank, LGF Bancorp, and
Citizens Federal branches and $3.9 million from business line
development and other expansion initiatives. Excluding these
costs, non-interest expense for the quarter increased 2.0
percent. As a percent of average assets, annualized, non-
interest expense was 3.69 percent for the second quarter of 1994
versus 3.75 percent a year ago and was level at 3.76 percent for
the year-to-date periods for both years.

The efficiency ratio for the second quarter was 66.23 percent in
1994 and 63.19 percent in 1993, as a result of the higher non-
interest expense and the lower net interest margin. For the
year-to-date periods, the efficiency ratio was 65.22 percent in
1994 and 62.76 percent in 1993. Year-to-date, the 246 basis
point increase in the efficiency ratio was due in part to the net
interest margin deterioration (194 basis points) and lower gains
on the sales of securities and loans (53 basis points). 

Asset Quality
Asset Quality

Asset quality, previously at a strong level, improved even
further with non-performing assets at 0.73 percent of total
assets compared with 0.85 percent last year. Net charge-offs as
a percent of average loans also decreased to 0.41 percent for the
second quarter versus 0.47 percent a year ago. The allowance
coverage of non-performing loans increased to 163 percent
compared with 152 percent last year. The provision for loan
losses was $2.5 million higher in the second quarter of 1994
primarily due to loan growth.

Outlook
Outlook

Thomas W. Lambert, executive vice president and chief financial
officer, commented, "We are especially pleased that loan growth
seemed to strengthen progressively during the last quarter. With
continued loan growth and the existing higher rate environment,
the net interest margin should improve over the rest of the year.
Revenue growth should outpace expense growth by a wider margin as
well. Last year the company earned $4.14 per share and if
current trends continue, we believe that we will be able to
reach, or perhaps slightly exceed, that level of earnings for
1994."
