Item 2. Acquisition of Assets.

On November 15, 1994, Commercial Metals Company, (the
"Company") acquired by merger of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, CMC
Acquisition Company, with Owen Steel Company, Inc. ("Owen"), all outstanding
common stock of Owen and two affiliated corporations, Owen Miscellaneous
Metals, Inc. and South Carolina Steel Corporation (the "Owen Affiliates"). The
acquisition was effected pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger among
Owen, the Owen Affiliates, CMC Acquisition Company, the Company and the selling
stockholders identified therein dated September 26, 1994 (the "Agreement").
The Agreement is filed as Exhibit 2 to this report and is incorporated herein
by reference. All selling stockholders are unrelated to the Company or the
officers, directors or other affiliates of the Company.

The Company paid approximately $50 million consisting of
$25,055,895 in cash and issuance of 932,301 shares, valued at $26.875 per
share, of the Company's Common Stock to certain selling stockholders. The
Company also provided funds for the retirement of approximately $32 million of
Owen debt at the closing. The purchase price may be subject to further
post-closing adjustments. The Company obtained funds for the acquisition in
the ordinary course of business on a short term unsecured basis from Chase
Manhattan Bank, N.A.

The Company also acquired, by virtue of Owen's ownership of
all common stock of subsidiary corporations, control of Owen Steel Company of
N.C., Inc., Owen of Georgia, Inc., Owen Steel Company of Florida, Owen Supply
Company, Inc., Owen Industrial Products, Inc., Owen Joist Corporation, Owen
Electric Steel Company of South Carolina and Owen Joist of Florida, Inc. Owen,
the Owen Affiliates and subsidiaries are engaged in steel manufacturing,
fabrication and recycling. Owen is headquartered in Columbia, South Carolina.

The surviving corporation in the merger changed its name to
SMI-Owen Steel Company, Inc., and will continue the Owen businesses as a part
of the Steel Group in the Company's manufacturing segment. The acquisition
includes a steel minimill at Cayce, near Columbia, South Carolina, with an
annual melting capacity of about 350,000 tons and rolling capacity of
approximately 250,000 tons. Additionally the Company acquired six rebar
fabricating shops, five structural fabrication shops, two joist manufacturing
plants, three scrap metal processing facilities, and one construction supply
company operation, located in South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia, Georgia
and Florida. The acquisition expands the Company's Steel Group manufacturing
and fabrication network into the southeastern United States and will increase
the Company's annual capacity for steel production to approximately 1.7 million
tons and for steel fabrication to approximately 500,000 tons. Owen affiliated
scrap metal processing
<PAGE> 3
operations, which will also operate as a part of the Company's Steel Group, are
expected to process approximately 155,000 tons per year of scrap metal,
primarily for melting at the nearby SMI-Owen minimill.

the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission of the United States Department of

Order denying CMC Oil Company's motion for summary judgment, granting the
government's motion for summary judgment and affirming the November, 1993

agreed to in writing by Stockholders owning not less than a majority of the
Company Comon Stock (whether voting or non-voting) and a copy of such writing
is delivered to each party to this Agreement; provided, however, that the
Stockholders may not substitute or replace Melvin Lee Burton, III unless a
majority of Stockholders listed on Schedule 1.7 hereto agree in writing to such
action.

ARTICLE II

CONVERSION OF SHARES

SECTION 2.1. Conversion of Capital Stock. As of the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders of
the capital stock of the Constituent Corporations:

(a) Sub Common Stock. The issued and outstanding shares
of common stock, $.01 par value per share, of Sub ("Sub Common Stock"), all of
which is held by the Parent shall remain outstanding and, following the Merger,
shall represent all of issued and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock. All shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned directly or indirectly by the Company or by
any Subsidiary (as hereinafter defined) ("Treasury Shares") shall be cancelled
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement, each issued and outstanding share
of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Treasury Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive a pro rata share
(the "Per Share Amount") of the Merger Consideration (as hereinafter defined),
as allocated pursuant to Section 2.1(i) and as adjusted pursuant to Section
2.1(h).

5
<PAGE> 12

(d) Merger Consideration. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Merger Consideration" shall mean collectively the Cash
Consideration (as hereinafter defined) and the Stock Consideration (as
hereinafter defined).

(e) Cash Consideration. For purposes of this Agreement,
the "Cash Consideration" shall be equal to the product of .5 multiplied by the
Purchase Price (as hereinafter defined).

(f) Stock Consideration. For purposes of this Agreement,
the "Stock Consideration" shall mean the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock equal to the product of .5 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the Purchase Price and the denominator of which is $26.875; provided
however, that in the event the Average Stock Price (as hereinafter defined) of
the Parent Common Stock is greater than $28.22 per share or less than $25.53
per share, after giving effect to the adjustments contemplated in Section
2.1(h), then such denominator (the "Stock Price") shall equal the Average Stock
Price.

(g) Purchase Price. For purposes of this Agreement, the
"Purchase Price" shall mean, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.2,
$55,000,000.

(h) Adjustment of Merger Consideration as a Result of
Reclassification, Etc. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time (other than as contemplated hereby), the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or readjustment, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record
date within such period, the Per Share Amount to be received pursuant to
Section 2.1(c) shall be adjusted as appropriate.

(i) Stockholder Election. The Merger Consideration will
be allocated in the following manner: (i) the Owen Joist Stockholders shall
receive in exchange for each share of Class A Common Stock received in
connection with the Owen Joist Exchange a Per Share Amount payable in all Cash
Consideration; (ii) the Owen Electric Stockholders shall receive for each share
of Company Common Stock received in connection with the Owen Electric Exchange
a Per Share Amount payable in all Cash Consideration; and (iii) unless
otherwise instructed in accordance with the immediately following sentence, the
remainder of the Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration shall be allocated
pro rata to the remaining issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock
(exclusive of Treasury Shares). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in lieu of the
allocation of Merger Consideration contained in clause (iii) of the immediately
preceding sentence, the Stockholders may elect, by written

6
<PAGE> 13

notice executed by all of the Stockholders and delivered to Parent at least
five days prior to the Closing Date, to adjust each Stockholder's proportion of
the Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration allocated pursuant to such
clause (iii); provided however, that in no event will such adjustment alter the
aggregate Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration payable hereunder and in
any event such allocation shall be consistent with the representations
contained in Section 4.7. For purposes of the allocations effected pursuant to
this Section 2.1(i), the Stock Consideration shall be allocated on the basis of
the Stock Price.

SECTION 2.2. Net Worth Adjustment.

(a) Pre-Closing Statement. (i) At least two business
days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall furnish to Parent
and Sub a statement of the Company (the "Pre-Closing Statement"),
prepared as of a date which is no more than 10 days prior to the
Closing Date, reflecting the Company's good faith estimate of the Net
Worth of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries (as hereinafter
defined) immediately prior to the Effective Time but after giving
effect to the Stock Exchanges (the "Net Worth Estimate") as determined
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied in
a manner consistent with the 12/31/93 Balance Sheets (as hereinafter
defined) ("12/31/93 GAAP"); provided, however, that (A) no liabilities
or reserves related to inventories or allowance for doubtful accounts
reflected on the 12/31/93 Balance Sheets shall be adjusted prior to
the Effective Time except (1) by reason of a payment or credit
occurring in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practices, or (2) to the extent the subject matter of or events giving
rise to such liability or reserve occurred on or after December 31,
1993, (B) no liability or reserve for any environmental or litigation
matter reflected on the 12/31/93 Balance Sheets shall be increased on
the Pre-Closing Statement except to reflect circumstances not
disclosed on Sections 3.10 and 3.22 of the Disclosure Schedule, (C)
the aggregate amount of the fees and expenses of the Company and the
Subsidiaries incurred at or prior to the Closing in connection with
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including without limitation any investment banking, brokers,
finders, legal fees, and including the fees of the Stockholder
Representative and Philpott, Ball & Company, or transfer taxes,
conveyance and recording fees, documentary stamp taxes and all other
similar charges shall be fully reflected as a liability on the
Pre-Closing Statement, but only to the extent they have not been paid
prior to the Closing (the "Company Expenses"), (D) no prepaid expense
related to any Company Expense shall be reflected as an asset on the
Pre-Closing Statement, (E) the sum of all Debt (as hereinafter
defined) outstanding following consummation of the repayments
contemplated by Section 2.4 and immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be fully reflected on the Pre-Closing Statement, (F) the
gross amount of the Change of Control Payments (without

7
<PAGE> 14

regard to taxes or other withholdings) shall be reflected as a
liability on the Pre-Closing Statement to the extent they have not
been paid by the Company prior to the Closing, (G) all interest,
charges, fees, expenses and penalties, including prepayment penalties
on or which become due as a result of Section 2.4 or as a result of
any voluntary payments made by the Company on the Closing Date or in
contemplation of the Closing on any Debt shall be reflected as a
liability on the Pre-Closing Statement to the extent any of the
foregoing have not been paid by the Company prior to the Closing, (H)
all accrued and unpaid vacation shall be reflected as a liability on
the Pre-Closing Statement, (I) net loan origination fees relating to
the original incurrence of Designated Debt will be added back to Net
Worth after payment of the Designated Debt, (J) anticipated operating
losses arising from contracts in backlog shall not be reflected as a
liability on the Pre-Closing Statement, and (K) all property taxes
shall be treated as if accrued ratably throughout each fiscal year
(items (A) through (K) are hereinafter referred to as "Adjusted
Accounting Principles").

(ii) Based on the Pre-Closing Statement, if the
amount equal to the Net Worth Estimate minus $49.1 million (the "Net
Worth Adjustment") is a positive number, then the Purchase Price shall
be increased by such amount. If the Net Worth Adjustment is a
negative number, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by such amount.

(b) Post-Closing Statement. (i) As soon as practicable,
but in no event more than 120 days after the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall furnish the Stockholder Representative a
statement (the "Post-Closing Statement") reflecting the Net Worth of
the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries immediately prior to the
Closing but after giving effect to the Stock Exchanges (the "Closing
Net Worth Amount") prepared in accordance with 12/31/93 GAAP and the
Adjusted Accounting Principles (references in the Adjusted Accounting
Principles to Pre-Closing Statement shall be deemed references to the
Post-Closing Statement for purposes of calculating the Closing Net
Worth Amount). In connection with the preparation of the Post-Closing
Statement, a physical inventory of the Companies and the Subsidiaries
shall be taken as of midnight of the day before the Closing Date.

(ii) Within 60 days after the delivery of the
Post-Closing Statement to the Stockholder Representative, the
Stockholder Representative shall (on behalf of the Stockholders)
either accept the amount of the Proposed Closing Differential (as
hereinafter defined) as reflected on the Post-Closing Statement as
correct or object to the Proposed Closing Differential, specifying in
reasonable detail in writing the nature of its objection(s). In the
event the Stockholder Representative does not object to the Proposed
Closing Differential within said 60-day period, the Stockholder

8
<PAGE> 15

Representative shall be deemed to have accepted the Proposed Closing
Differential as the Closing Differential. In the event the
Stockholder Representative objects to the Proposed Closing
Differential, then, during a 15-day period subsequent to the receipt
by the Surviving Corporation of notice of the Stockholder
Representative's objection(s), the Surviving Corporation and the
Stockholder Representative shall attempt in good faith to resolve the
differences respecting such Proposed Closing Differential. In the
event the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholder Representative are
unable to resolve their differences within said 15-day period, the
parties agree that the matter shall be submitted to a mutually
acceptable firm of certified public accountants, the costs and
expenses of which firm shall be borne equally by the Surviving
Corporation and the Stockholder Representative. If the Surviving
Corporation and the Stockholder Representative cannot mutually agree
upon said firm of certified public accountants within 15 days, the
disputed Proposed Closing Differential shall be jointly determined by
two firms of certified public accountants, one such firm being
selected by each of the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholder
Representative, with the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholder
Representative each paying the costs and expenses of the firm selected
by it. In the event that the respective firms of certified public
accountants of the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholder
Representative are unable to so agree, such firms of certified public
accountants shall select a third firm of certified public accountants
(which shall be one of the six largest nationally recognized public
accounting firms in the United States) to determine the Closing
Differential pursuant to this Section 2.2 and whose determination
shall be final and binding upon the parties. The costs and expenses
of such third firm of certified public accountants shall be borne
equally by the Surviving Corporation and the Stockholder
Representative. During the period from the date of delivery of the
Post-Closing Statement to the Stockholder Representative through the
date of resolution of any dispute regarding the Proposed Closing
Differential as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b)(ii), Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary to provide the
Stockholder Representative and its agents and representatives
reasonable access to the books, records (including those supplemental
schedules prepared by the Surviving Corporation in connection with
preparation of the Post-Closing Statement), facilities and employees
of the Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary for purposes relevant
to the review of such Post-Closing Statement and the resolution of any
related dispute.

(iii) Based on the Post-Closing Statement, within
three (3) days after the final determination of the Closing
Differential, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted as follows: If the
amount of the Closing Differential is a positive amount, then the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted upward by an amount equal to the
Closing Differential. In such case, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall pay to the

9
<PAGE> 16

Paying Agent (as hereinafter defined) (for distribution to the holders
of Company Common Stock) the increase of the Merger Consideration
resulting from such adjusted Purchase Price. Conversely, if the
amount of the Closing Differential is a negative amount, then the
Purchase Price shall be adjusted downward by an amount equal to the
Closing Differential (expressed as a positive amount), which amount
shall be distributed to the Parent and the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

(c) Preparation of Pre-Closing Statement/Post-Closing Statement.
The Company, in the case of the Pre-Closing Statement, and the Surviving
Corporation, in the case of the Post-Closing Statement, shall prepare such
statements to reflect the Net Worth of the Company and the Subsidiaries in
accordance with 12/31/93 GAAP and shall separately reflect the Adjusted
Accounting Principles to arrive at the Net Worth Estimate and Closing Net Worth
Amount, respectively.

(d) Collection of Accounts Receivable. In the event that the
Stockholders are entitled to a payment pursuant to Section 1.5(c) of the Escrow
Agreement, such payment shall be deemed an increase in the Merger
Consideration.

SECTION 2.3. No Further Ownership Rights in Company. At and after
the Effective Time, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as a stockholder of
the Company, except for the right to surrender such stockholder's certificates
in exchange for receipt of the Merger Consideration described in Section
2.1(c), and after the Effective Time no transfer of shares of Company Common
Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
made on the stock transfer books of the Company. Any certificates presented
after the Effective Time for transfer shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
appropriate Merger Consideration. Parent shall have no obligation to deliver
to Stockholders their portion of the Merger Consideration except to the extent
that Stockholders have caused certificates representing Company Common Stock
(or affidavits of lost certificate in form and substance acceptable to Parent,
if applicable) to be tendered to Parent.

SECTION 2.4. Payment of Indebtedness. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, the Parent will advance to the Company a loan (the "Company
Loan") in an amount sufficient to repay the Designated Debt (as hereinafter
defined) and the Company shall immediately apply such proceeds, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, to the payment in full of the
Designated Debt and shall secure the release of any and all pledges, security
interests, mortgages, or other liens securing such Designated Debt.

10
<PAGE> 17

SECTION 2.5. Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Paying Agent. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, (i) with a bank or trust company
designated by Parent (the "Paying Agent") for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange through the Paying Agent in
accordance with this Article II, certificates of stock and cash (the "Exchange
Fund") equal to the Merger Consideration issuable pursuant to Section 2.1 as
calculated at the Effective Time less the Escrow Funds and (ii) with the escrow
agent (the "Escrow Agent") under the Escrow Agreement, $4,400,000 of the Cash
Consideration and the number of shares of the Parent Common Stock constituting
part of the Stock Consideration determined by dividing $4,400,000 by the Stock
Price (collectively, the "Escrow Funds"), which amounts shall be held and
subsequently distributed by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the provisions of the
Escrow Agreement (the "Escrow Agreement") in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A. The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, distribute the Merger Consideration deposited in the Exchange
Fund on the basis established pursuant to Section 2.1(i).

(b) Exchange Procedure. Parent will instruct the Paying
Agent to distribute the Merger Consideration as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time, to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates (the "Certificates") which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock other than Treasury
Shares as set forth herein. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of
lost Certificate in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and
Paying Agent, and, if Parent or Paying Agent shall reasonably request, the
posting of a bond in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent and
Paying Agent) to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by the Surviving Corporation, together with a blank stock power, duly
executed, and such other documents as may be required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
(i) a certificate evidencing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
which such holder has the right to receive in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly evidenced by such Certificate (after taking into account
all shares of Company Common Stock then held of record by such holder), and
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to Section 2.5(f), less the portion thereof deposited with
the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.5(a), and (ii) the cash consideration
into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by the
Certificate so surrendered shall have been converted, less the portion thereof
deposited with the Escrow Agent pursuant to Section 2.5(a). No interest will
be paid or will accrue on the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of any
Certificate.

11
<PAGE> 18

(c) Unregistered Transfer of Company Common Stock. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the appropriate Merger
Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the Certificate representing
such Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all
documents reasonably required by Parent, including (i) documents to evidence
and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer
taxes have been paid and (ii) documents evidencing transferee's representations
or warranties to Parent. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.5, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Merger
Consideration specified in Section 2.1(c) and any amounts distributable
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any funds or Parent
Common Stock deposited with the Paying Agent that are payable to a former
stockholder of the Company which has not submitted a claim for its portion of
the Merger Consideration as described in this Section 2.5 within six months
after the Effective Time shall be paid or delivered, as the case may be, to the
Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former stockholders of the Company
who have not theretofore complied with the instructions for exchanging their
Certificates shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment, it being acknowledged by Parent and Sub that the Surviving
Corporation's receipt of any such amounts shall not relieve it of its payment
obligations to such former stockholders. In no event will any former
stockholder of the Company be entitled to receive interest or any other amounts
earned on the Merger Consideration held by the Surviving Corporation in
accordance with this Section 2.5(d), except as otherwise expressly provided in
Section 2.5(e).

(e) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of
Parent Common Stock. Dividends and other distributions declared or made after
the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock held in the Exchange
Fund, or held by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Section 2.5(d), shall
not be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock evidenced thereby until the holder of such
Certificate shall surrender such Certificate.

(f) Fractional Shares. No fraction of a share of Parent
Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger. In lieu of any such fractional
shares, each holder of Company Common Stock upon surrender of a certificate for
exchange pursuant to this Section 2.5 shall be paid an amount in cash (without
interest), rounded to the nearest cent, determined by multiplying (i) the Stock
Price by (ii) the fractional interest to which such holder would otherwise be
entitled (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then
held of record by such holder).

12
<PAGE> 19

(g) Withholding Rights. Parent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amounts as
Parent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of such shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent.

effect to the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. No event has
occurred, including, without limitation, the failure by any of the Companies or

of the Disclosure Schedule, none of such real properties is subject to any
easements, rights of way, licenses, grants, building or use restrictions,
exceptions, reservations, limitations or other impediments which materially and
adversely affect the value thereof or which interfere with or impair the
present and continued use in the usual and normal conduct of the business of
each of Companies and their Subsidiaries. Section 3.20 of the Disclosure
Schedule lists (i) the street address of each parcel of real property owned by
each of the Companies or their Subsidiaries (the "Owned Real Property") and

"Insured"). The Companies have delivered to Parent true and complete copies of
(a) each Title Policy and (b) as to each parcel of Owned Real Property, the

Policy is valid and binding on the relevant insurer(s) in accordance with its
