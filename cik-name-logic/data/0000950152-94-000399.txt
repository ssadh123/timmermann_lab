Item 5. Other Events
------------

On March 24, 1994, Commercial Bancorporation of Colorado ("CBC"), a
bank holding company with subsidiary banks operating in the Denver,
Colorado Springs, Sterling and Fort Collins areas of Colorado, merged
with Key Bank of Colorado, a wholly-owned subsidiary of KeyCorp. 
Holders of CBC common stock received .899 KeyCorp Common Shares for
each outstanding share of CBC common stock. CBC had total assets of
$390 million at December 31, 1993. The transaction qualified for
accounting as a pooling of interests; however, financial statements
will not be restated to include the accounts and results of
operations of CBC because the transaction was not material to
KeyCorp.

SIGNATURE

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the 
Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the
undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
