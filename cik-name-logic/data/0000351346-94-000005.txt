Item 5. Other Events.

On August 12, 1994 the registrant issued the following press release.

Biomet, Inc. (NASDAQ:BMET) announced today that it has purchased
Figgie International Inc.'s entire stake in Kirschner Medical
Corporation. The interests purchased by Biomet consisted of the
685,222 Kirschner shares held by Figgie, representing 19.9% of the
issued and outstanding Kirschner shares, and a promissory note
issued to Figgie by Kirschner's Spanish subsidiary, Industrias
Quirurgicas de Levante, S.A. The purchase price for these
interests was $8.7 million in cash. 

As previously announced, Biomet and Kirschner entered into a
definitive agreement on July 16, 1994, to merge Kirschner with a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Biomet. Under the agreement, Kirschner
accepted Biomet's proposal to purchase all of the outstanding
shares of Kirschner common stock for $10.75 per share in cash or an
equivalent value in Biomet stock. Biomet will select whether to
use all cash or all stock in the transaction. If stock is used,
Kirschner shareholders will receive not less than 0.9 shares of
Biomet stock for each share of Kirschner stock.

This announcement does not constitute an offer to sell or a
solicitation of an offer to buy Biomet common shares. Any such
offer to be made in connection with the proposed transaction shall
be made only by means of a prospectus.

Biomet, Inc. and its subsidiaries design, develop, manufacture and
market products used primarily by orthopedic medical specialists in
both surgical and non-surgical therapy, including reconstructive
and trauma devices, electrical bone growth stimulators, orthopedic
support devices, operating room supplies, powered surgical
instruments, general surgical instruments, arthroscopy products and
oral-maxillofacial implants and instruments. Headquartered in
Warsaw, Indiana, Biomet and its subsidiaries currently distribute
products in approximately 100 countries.

For further information contact Jim Howie, Director of Corporate
Development and Communications, or Kathy Waggener, Manager of
Corporate Communications at (219) 267-6639.
