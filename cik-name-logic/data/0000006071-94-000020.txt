ITEM 5: OTHER EVENTS

Beginning on May 27, 1994, Ames Department Stores, Inc. ("Ames" or 
the "Company") will distribute to its banks and other lenders, 
principal trade vendors and factors, summaries of its revised 
financial plan (referred to herein as the "Revised Plan") for the 
fiscal year ending January 28, 1995 ("Fiscal 1995"). The Revised 
Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 20 and is incorporated by 
reference herein. The Revised Plan supersedes, in its entirety, the 
summary financial plan for Fiscal 1995 filed on Form 8-K dated 
February 17, 1994. The revisions contained in the Revised Plan are 
primarily a consequence of the Company's new, three-year $300 million 
revolving credit facility (Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial 
Statements included in the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year 
ended January 29, 1994), the Wertheim settlement (Note 11 to the 
January 29, 1994 Consolidated Financial Statements), an expected 
non-cash income tax provision (Note 9 to the January 29, 1994 
Consolidated Financial Statements), certain gains on disposition of 
properties, and stock appreciation rights (SARs) expense accruals. 
The net effect of all of the above adjustments resulted in an 
immaterial change to the projected annual net income as presented in 
the Form 8-K dated February 17, 1994. The Revised Plan does not 
contain any updates to the original projections for the actual 
year-to-date sales, gross margin and other normal operating results 
incurred. The Company believes that the effects of any such updates 
would result in immaterial changes in the Revised Plan.

Ames is distributing the Revised Plan to its banks and other lenders, 
principal trade vendors and factors to facilitate their credit 
analyses. The Revised Plan SHOULD NOT BE RELIED UPON FOR ANY OTHER 
PURPOSE and should be read in conjunction with the Company's January 
29, 1994 Form 10-K and the Company's Form 10-Q to be filed for the 
first quarter ended April 30, 1994. The Revised Plan is being 
reported publicly solely because it is being distributed to a large 
number of the Company's vendors for purposes of their credit 
analyses. Although Ames is publicly reporting the Revised Plan and 
expects to continue reporting its monthly results during Fiscal 1995, 
Ames does not believe it is obligated to provide such information 
indefinitely, other than as required by applicable regulations, and 
may cease making such disclosures and updates at any time. Moreover, 
Ames does not believe that it is obligated to update the Revised Plan 
to reflect subsequent events or developments. 

The Revised Plan was not prepared with a view toward compliance with 
the guidelines established by the American Institute of Certified 
Public Accountants or the rules and regulations of the Securities and 
Exchange Commission regarding financial projections. While presented 
with numerical specificity, the Revised Plan is based upon a variety 
of assumptions that may not be realized and is subject to significant 
business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, 
many of which are beyond the control of Ames. Consequently, the 
Revised Plan should not be regarded as a representation or warranty 
by Ames, or any other person, that the forecasts contained therein 
will be realized. Actual results may vary materially from those 
presented in the Revised Plan.

(A) Primarily for the write-off of deferred financing costs and debt discounts related to debt to be prepaid in June.
(B) Assumes that the April 30, 1994 accrual of $1.5 million(which was based on an average common stock price of
$5.03 per share for the ten trading days ended April 29, 1994) for the value of unexercised stock appreciation rights (SARs)
will be unchanged for the remainder of Fiscal 1995.
NOTE: EBIT is earnings (loss) before net interest expense, income taxes, and non-recurring or extraordinary items. 
Consistent with the definition in the new revolving credit facility, EBITDA is EBIT
before depreciation & amortization, LIFO expense, stock appreciation rights accruals, and other non-cash charges.
