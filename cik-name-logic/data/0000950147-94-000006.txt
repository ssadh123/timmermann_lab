Item 5. Other Events.

Through a Report on Form 8-K, dated January 5, 1993, the Company
previously reported litigation titled Cabana Limited Partnership, a South
Carolina Partnership v. Greyhound Real Estate Finance Company, et al., and
related litigation (collectively, the "Litigation"). On January 21, 1994,
the court in the above-named case granted summary judgment in favor of the
Company and the other defendants on all counts. On motion of defendants, the
court dismissed the defendants' claims without prejudice. The parties
subsequently entered into a global settlement agreement whereby all rights
to appeal have been waived by Plaintiffs. The terms of the settlement
agreement are confidential but involve the payment by the defendants to
plaintiffs' counsel of a relatively nominal amount, to secure finality,
which the Company believes will cover a portion of plaintiffs' counsels'
Litigation costs and expenses. The summary judgment in the Company's and
related defendant's favor remains unchanged.

Greyhound Real Estate Finance Company was a subsidiary of registrant
Greyhound Financial Corporation.
