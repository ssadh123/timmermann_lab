Item 5. Other Events

On September 6, 1994, Ronald S. Haft tendered to Dart Group
Corporation (DARTA) (the "Corporation") a letter:

(1) to exercise, effective immediately, options (the "Options") to
purchase, at an exercise price of $89.65 per share, 197,048
shares (the "Option Shares") of the Corporation's Class B
Common Stock pursuant to Article 4(a) of the Employment
Agreement (the "Employment Agreement") dated August 1, 1993
between Ronald S. Haft and the Corporation; and

(2) to exercise his right under the Employment Agreement,
effective immediately, to obtain a loan from the Corporation
in the amount of $17,665,353.20, for part of the exercise
price of the Options.

Together with that letter, Ronald S. Haft tendered to the Corporation:
a check payable to the Corporation in the amount of $197,048.00 as payment of
the par value of the Option Shares; and an executed unsecured promissory note
of Ronald S. Haft payable to the order of the Corporation in the amount of
$17,665,353.20, the balance of the exercise price for the Option Shares under
the Options.

The Corporation has neither accepted nor rejected the validity of
Ronald S. Haft's exercise of the Options or the adequacy of the promissory note
tendered in connection therewith. Issuance of the Option Shares has not been
recorded in the stock records of the Corporation, and the Corporation has not
issued any stock certificate to Ronald S. Haft for the Option Shares.

A pending shareholders' derivative lawsuit (Alan R. Kahn, et al. v.
Herbert H. Haft, et al., Del. Ch. No. 13154 (filed September 29, 1993), seeks a
judgment that would, inter alia, declare the Options to be null and void and
rescind their issuance. A special litigation committee of the Board of
Directors of the Corporation has been reviewing the allegations in the
complaint filed in the lawsuit.

Ronald S. Haft has filed a lawsuit against the Corporation (Ronald S.
Haft v. Dart Group Corporation, Del. Ch. 13736 (filed September 12, 1994))
seeking a court order that the Corporation issue the Option Shares to him and
grant him a loan of $17,665,353.20 to be used as part of the payment for the
Option Shares. On September 14, 1994, a Standstill Agreement agreed to on
behalf of the Corporation and Ronald S. Haft was ordered by the Court of
Chancery in this matter. The Standstill Agreement, which is included as an
exhibit to this report on Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference,
restricts certain actions by the Corporation and its stockholders until further
order of the Court.
