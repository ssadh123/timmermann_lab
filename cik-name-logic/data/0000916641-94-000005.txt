ITEM 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On April 15, 1994, the registrant, United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc.
(the "Trust"), acquired an apartment property from 5020 Busch Boulevard

acquisitions for 1994 were "significant" in the aggregate. 
A brief summary of each of the Trust's 1994 acquisitions to date is set forth
below. Each property was acquired from an unrelated seller for consideration
agreed upon through arm's length bargaining. Unless stated otherwise, to the
extent that cash was utilized to complete an acquisition, the source of that
cash was the proceeds from a $75 million public sale of senior unsecured
notes in April, 1994 and bank line borrowings.

On March 4, 1994, the Trust acquired The Shire Apartments, in Raleigh,
North Carolina, from The Shire Company Limited Partnership and Shire II
Associates Limited Partnership for $13.7 million, including closing costs,
all cash. The Shire, located in Raleigh, North Carolina, is a 302 unit
garden and townhouse complex located on 37 acres, built in two phases in 1982
and 1984.

Tampa, Florida, from the Lakewood Partners, Ltd., a Florida limited
partnership for $12.0 million, including closing costs, all cash. Lakewood

On April 8, 1994, the Trust acquired River Place Apartments, in Macon,

million, excluding closing costs, all cash. River Place is a 240 unit garden
apartment community located on 20 acres, built in 1988.

On April 14, 1994, the Trust purchased the Lakeside North Apartments, in
Altamonte Springs, Florida, from TENN-FLA Partners, a Tennessee general

which will ultimately be sold and refunded to finance the purchase. Lakeside
North is a 360 unit garden apartment community located on 18 acres, built in
