Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors and Stockholders,
FMC Corporation

We have audited the balance sheets of the Defense Systems Group of FMC 
Corporation as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the related statements 
of income and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period 
ended December 31, 1993. These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the company's management. Our responsibility is to 
express an opinion on these financial statements based upon our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit 
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements 
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a 
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the 
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting 
principles used and signficant estimates made by management, as well as 
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe 
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Defense 
Systems Group of FMC Corporation as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and 
the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years 
in the three-year period ended December 31, 1993, in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 5 to the financial statements, the company changed 
its method of accounting for post retirement benefits other than 
pensions in 1992.

DEFENSE SYSTEMS GROUP
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Dollars in Thousands)

1. GENERAL INFORMATION

The Defense Systems Group ("DSG") of FMC Corporation ("FMC") 
manufactures tracked military vehicles, gun and launching systems, and 
steel track, forgings and castings, predominently for the U. S. 
Government. On January 28, 1994, FMC and Harsco Corporation ("Harsco") 
announced completion of a series of agreements ("Agreements"), first 
announced in December 1992, to combine certain assets and liabilities of 
DSG and Harsco's BMY Combat Systems Division. The effective date of the 
combination was January 1, 1994. The combined company, United Defense, 
L. P., will operate as a limited partnership, with FMC as the Managing 
General Partner with a 60 percent equity interest and Harsco Defense 
Holding as the Limited Partner holding a 40 percent equity interest.

2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying financial statements include the historical assets, 
liabilities, revenues and expenses that are directly related to the 
operations of DSG. As described in Note 5, the financial statements 
also include allocations of certain FMC expenses in order to approximate 
the effect of DSG operating on a stand-alone basis during the periods 
presented. Management believes the allocations of expenses are made on 
a reasonable basis; however, they do not necessarily equal the costs 
which would have been, or will be incurred, by DSG on a stand-alone 
basis. Furthermore, other financial information included herein may not 
necessarily reflect the financial position and results of operations of 
DSG in the future combined operations of UDLP or what the financial 
position and results of operations of DSG would have been had it been a 
separate, stand-alone company during the periods covered.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR CONTRACTS-IN-PROGRESS

Sales are recorded when the earning process is substantially complete 
and the dollar amount is known. The completion of the earning process 
is dependent upon the contract type.

In cost type contracts, sales revenue is recognized concurrent with 
voucher billing. Sales value will be equal to actual billed costs plus 
allocable fee. Fee adjustments for over/underruns are recorded if the 
contract is modified to reduce the billing percentage for fee.

In time and material contracts, revenue is recognized concurrent with 
voucher billing. No sales are recorded for billings associated with 
undefinitized contracts.

Government fixed-price and fixed-price incentive contracts are accounted 
for under the percentage of completion method, whereby the estimated 
sales value is determined on the basis of physical completion to date 
(units of delivery or other acceptable methods of measuring progress 
toward completion). The sales unit price is the negotiated value or, in 
the case of incentive contracts, the estimated unit price at completion. 
Changes in estimates for sales, costs, and profits are recognized in the 
period in which they are determinable. Claims for required changes in 
contract performance are considered in estimated contract revenue at 
such time as realization is probable. Any anticipated losses on 
contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable.

Under certain arrangements the customer shares in product development 
costs. The estimated costs in excess of price from the customer are 
expensed at the time of contract award.

TRADE RECEIVABLES

A receivable is recorded whenever a sale is recorded and an invoice, as 
contractually allowed, is sent to the customer. A receivable is also 
recorded when a request for progress payment is issued to the customer. 

An unbilled receivable is recorded if certain conditions for recording a 
sale are met and contractual constraints prevent sending an invoice. 
Approximately $12.8 million of unbilled receivables recorded as of 
December 31, 1993, will be shipped and billed in 1995. Trade 
receivables do not contain material amounts of receivables billed under 
retainage provisions of contracts or similar items whose determination 
or ultimate realization is uncertain. DSG maintains an allowance for 
doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectibility of all trade 
receivables ($0.2 million and $0.3 million for December 31, 1993 and 
December 31, 1992, respectively).

INVENTORIES

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is 
determined on the last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis, except for certain 
inventories relating to long-term contracts ($7.0 million in 1993 and 
$21.4 million in 1992). Inventoried costs relating to long-term 
contracts not valued on the LIFO basis are stated at the actual 
production cost incurred to date, reduced by amounts recognized as cost 
of sales. The costs attributed to units delivered under such contracts 
are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be 
produced and sold under the contract.

There are no material amounts remaining in inventory relating to the 
excess of actual production cost of in-process and delivered units over 
the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced under 
contracts-in-progress, or other non-recurring costs for which ultimate 
recovery may be uncertain. Provisions have been made for additional 
cost elements and business risks expected to be incurred in completing 
the contracts.

Inventory costs include manufacturing overhead. Costs normally 
associated with general and administrative functions and independent 
research and bid and proposal costs are expensed as incurred.

The current replacement cost of inventories exceeded their LIFO values 
by approximately $13.9 million at December 31, 1993 and $13.8 million at 
December 31, 1992. During 1993, 1992 and 1991, DSG reduced LIFO 
inventories that were carried at lower than prevailing costs. These 
reductions increased pre-tax income by $2.6 million, $13.9 million, and 
$4.2 million in the respective years.

INVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATED COMPANIES

Investments in affiliated companies are carried primarily at cost, with 
income recognized as dividends are received. Dividends received were 
$9.4 million in 1993 and $8.1 million in 1992. No dividends were 
received in 1991.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost. Depreciation is 
provided principally on the sum-of-the-years digits method over 
estimated useful lives of the assets (land improvements - 20 years, 
buildings - 20 to 35 years, and machinery and equipment - 3 to 11 
years). Gains and losses realized upon sale or retirement of assets are 
either deducted from or added to depreciation for the period or 
reflected in income.

Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred ($26.0 million, $26.0 
million, and $28.3 million for 1993, 1992 and 1991 respectively). 
Expenditures that extend the useful life of property, plant and 
equipment or increase its productivity are capitalized and depreciated.

ADVANCE PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS

Amounts advanced by customers as deposits on orders not yet billed and 
progress payments on contracts-in-progress are recorded as current 
liabilities.

INCOME TAXES

Effective January 1, 1993, DSG adopted Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." SFAS No. 109 requires 
an asset and liability approach, whereby deferred tax liabilities and 
assets are recognized for expected future tax consequences of temporary 
differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and 
liabilities. The adoption of SFAS No. 109 had no material effect upon 
the financial statements of DSG. Additional U. S. income taxes are not 
provided for the undistributed earnings of foreign affiliates as it is 
management's intention that such earnings remain invested in those 
companies. Taxes are provided in the year the dividend payment is 
received. Prior to January 1, 1993, income tax provisions were based on 
income reported for financial statement purposes, adjusted for 
transactions (permanent differences) that do not enter into the 
computation of income taxes payable. The company deferred the tax 
effects of timing differences between financial reporting and taxable 
income.

DSG's taxable income is included in the Federal and State income tax 
returns filed by FMC and, accordingly, the current payable for income 
taxes has been transferred to FMC. The provisions for income taxes are 
computed as if the Group filed its own separate tax returns.

ENVIRONMENTAL

Environmental-related obligations, such as estimated contractor costs 
and fees, site study costs, reimbursements of regulatory agency costs, 
post-closure costs, litigation costs, and other remediation costs, are 
provided for when they are probable and amounts can be reasonably 
estimated. Estimated obligations to remediate sites that involve the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are generally accrued no later 
than when a Record of Decision (ROD), or equivalent, is issued, or upon 
completion of a Remediation Investigation/Feasibility Study (RI/FS) that 
is accepted by the company and the appropriate government agency or 
agencies. As remediations and investigations proceed, the estimates are 
reviewed quarterly by the company's Environmental Health and Safety 
organization, as well as financial and legal management and, if 
necessary, adjusted as additional information becomes available. The 
estimates can change substantially as additional information becomes 
available regarding the nature or extent of site contamination, required 
remediation methods, and other actions by governmental agencies or 
private parties.

Provisions for environmental costs incorporate inflation and are not 
discounted to their present values. Estimated recoveries from third 
parties are recorded when probable and reasonably estimable.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT ADOPTED

In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS 
No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Post-employment Benefits." 
Effective for fiscal year 1994, SFAS No. 112 established accounting 
standards for benefits provided to former or inactive employees after 
employment but before retirement. The impact on earnings in 1994 from 
implementation of the new statement's provisions is estimated to be 
approximately $.7 million.

The income tax provision differs from that computed by applying the 
applicable federal statutory rate (35% in 1993 and 34% in the other 
years) to income before taxes for the following reasons:

5. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

RETIREMENT PLANS

Salaried employees of DSG are covered by FMC's Salaried Retirement Plan, 
which provides pension benefits based on years of service and an average 
of the highest 60 consecutive months of compensation during the last 120 
months of consecutive employment. Plans covering hourly employees of 
DSG generally provide benefits of stated amounts for each year of 
service.

The funding policy is to make contributions based on the projected unit 
credit actuarial cost method and to limit contributions to amounts that 
are currently deductible for tax reporting purposes. In 1992, net 
pension cost includes a pension curtailment charge of $4.6 million 
relating to the elimination of certain employees in the DSG hourly 
plans.

The following table summarizes the assumptions used and the components 
of the net pension cost:

POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE

Substantially all of DSG employees are covered by FMC's postretirement 
health care and life insurance benefit program. Employees generally 
become eligible for the retiree benefit plans when they meet minimum 
retirement age and service requirements. The cost of providing most of 
these benefits is shared with retirees. FMC has reserved the right to 
change or eliminate these benefit plans. 

FMC funds a trust for retiree health and life benefits for DSG. Funding 
is based on amounts in negotiated government defense contracts, in 
conformance with Governmental Cost Accounting Standards.

Retroactive to January 1, 1992, FMC elected early adoption of SFAS No. 
106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than 
Pensions," which requires accrual of the expected cost of providing 
postretirement benefits other than pensions, during the years of 
employee service. The adoption of SFAS No. 106 resulted in a one-time 
pre-tax charge of $74.9 million ($45.7 million, net of tax). Prior to 
1992, the Group recognized postretirement health care costs using the 
cash basis of accounting, while the estimated costs of postretirement 
life insurance benefits were generally accrued over the employees' 
active working lives. These costs were $ 3.1 million in 1991.

Actuarial assumptions used to determine costs and benefit obligations 
include a discount rate of 8 percent and a weighted average expected 
return on long-term assets of 9 percent. The assumed rate of future 
increases in per capita cost of health care benefits was 13 percent in 
1993 and 1992, decreasing gradually to 6 percent by the year 2001.

The following table summarizes the components of net periodic 
postretirement benefit cost for 1993 and 1992:

Plan amendments adopted in 1993 reduced the accumulated benefit 
obligation by approximately $ 18.7 million. These amendments will be 
recognized as a reduction of plan costs over the average remaining 
service period of active plan participants. The status of the accrued 
postretirement benefit cost recognized in the balance sheet and the 
funded status of the plan as of December 31 were as follows:

EMPLOYEES' THRIFT AND STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

All salaried and non-union hourly employees are included in FMC Employee 
Thrift and Stock Purchase Plan. Under the Thrift Plan, participants may 
elect to have up to 15 percent of their compensation contributed to the 
plan. An employee's contribution, up to 5 percent of compensation, is 
matched by the Group's 15 percent to 100 percent (80 percent prior to 
April 1, 1993) depending on profits and fund elections. A participant's 
interest in the Group's contribution vests gradually during the first 
five years of active service and is fully vested thereafter. The 
employee-elected contributions may be invested in FMC stock, a fixed 
income fund or an equity fund, as a participant elects. All matching 
contributions by the Group are invested in FMC stock. Charges for these 
benefits for the years 1993, 1992 and 1991, were $ 4.9 million, $ 4.4 
million and $ 3.9 million, respectively.

7. TRANSACTIONS WITH FMC

The following summarizes the assumptions used in accounting for certain 
transactions between DSG and FMC. See also Notes 2 and 4.

WORKING CAPITAL AND FINANCING REQUIREMENTS

All capital requirements of DSG are funded through the operation of a 
centralized cash management system at FMC. Generally, all cash receipts 
are deposited to and all cash requirements are funded through the system 
on a daily basis. Cash activity is segregated and controlled through 
intercompany accounts, which are included in the accompanying financial 
statements as a component of Group Equity: Investment of FMC 
Corporation.

ADMINISTRATIVE COST ALLOCATION

The statements of income presented reflect an administrative cost 
allocation from FMC for certain expenses incurred at the corporate level 
for the benefit of the Group, aggregating $24.3 million, $20.4 million 
and $23.1 million for the years 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The 
allocations are based on sales, numbers of FMC personnel, payroll 
dollars, estimates of time spent to provide services, or other rational 
measures. These allocations include general management, treasury, tax, 
financial audits, financial reporting, benefits administration, 
insurance, communication, public affairs, information management and 
other miscellaneous services.

DIRECT CHARGES

Other costs incurred at the FMC corporate level and charged directly to 
DSG on the basis of services used include the Corporate Technology 
Center, computer processing, employee benefits, pension and thrift plan 
costs, insurance and miscellaneous other expenses. Charges related to 
services other than employee benefits aggregated approximately $15.2 
million, $17.0 million and $18.1 million in 1993, 1992 and 1991, 
respectively. Employee benefits are discussed further in Note 5.

8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS

DSG leases manufacturing space and various types of equipment under 
operating leases. Total rent expense under all leases amounted to $4.4 
million, $6.6 million and $5.7 million in the years 1993, 1992 and 1991, 
respectively. Minimum future rentals under noncancellable leases 
aggregated approximately $18.2 million as of December 31, 1993, and are 
estimated to be payable $4.6 million in 1994, $4.4 million in 1995, $3.9 
million in 1996, $1.9 million in 1997, $1.9 million in 1998 and $1.5 
million in 1999.

ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND REMEDIATION

In accordance with the environmental accounting policy, reserves of 
approximately $6.5 million and $6.7 million have been provided at the 
end of 1993 and 1992, respectively. The liability arising from 
potential environmental obligations that have not been reserved for at 
this time--because amounts cannot be reasonably determined due to 
uncertainties associated with remedial-related activities, relevant 
clean-up technologies and methods, and amounts to be recovered from 
third parties--may or may not be material to any one year's results of 
operations in the future. Management, however, believes the liability 
arising from these potential environmental obligations is not likely to 
have a material adverse effect on the Group's liquidity or financial 
condition and will be satisfied over many years.

OFF BALANCE SHEET RISK

DSG is contingently liable under outstanding letters of credit in the 
amount of approximately $32.1 million at December 31, 1993.

OTHER CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

DSG has certain contingent liabilities resulting from litigation, claims 
and commitments incident to the ordinary course of business. Management 
believes that the probable resolution of such contingencies will not 
materially affect the financial position or results of operations.

HARSCO CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
PRO FORMA CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
(Unaudited)

On January 28, 1994, FMC Corporation ("FMC") and Harsco Corporation 
("Harsco") announced completion of a series of agreements 
("Agreements"), first announced in December 1992, to combine certain 
assets and liabilities of FMC's Defense Systems Group ("DSG") and 
Harsco's BMY-Combat Systems Division ("BMY-CS"). The effective date of 
the combination was January 1, 1994. The combined company, United 
Defense, L.P. ("UDLP"), will operate as a limited partnership, with FMC 
as the Managing General Partner with a 60 percent equity interest and 
Harsco Defense Holding, Inc. as the Limited Partner holding a 40 percent 
equity interest.

The following unaudited pro forma condensed financial statements reflect 
the elimination of BMY-CS and accounting for the 40% ownership interest 
of Harsco in UDLP on the equity method of accounting. The assumption, 
for the balance sheet, is that the combination occurred on December 31, 
1993, and for the statement of income that the combination date was 
January 1, 1993. The pro forma operating results are not necessarily 
indicative of what would have occurred had the combination actually 
taken place on January 1, 1993, or of what they are expected to be in 
1994. Also, no adjustments have been made to operations for the impact 
of certain anticipated operational and administrative efficiencies which 
are expected to be realized over the first two years of the combined 
company's operation.

<F1> Under the Agreements, Harsco is required to contribute a total net 
asset value of $29.6 million including $5.2 million of cash. Harsco 
also will retain financial responsibility for certain items which are 
not contributed to the joint venture and sufficient accounts receivable 
balances to meet the total net asset value of $29.6 million. These 
adjustments are to reflect the contribution of cash, the retention of 
accounts receivable, and the retention of certain liability accounts as 
provided for in the Agreements.

<F2> The assets and liabilities contributed by FMC and Harsco to the 
joint venture are recorded at their historical net book values and, 
consequently, no recognition is given to their fair market values at 
formation. In combining the assets and liabilities under this premise, 
Harsco's initial equity interest in UDLP has a net book value of $67 
million, calculated at 40 percent of the combined net assets contributed 
by FMC and Harsco of $168 million. Therefore, Harsco's 40 percent 
equity interest in the joint venture exceeds the book value of the net 
assets contributed and acquisition costs incurred by approximately $34 
million. However, no recognition is given to this amount in the Pro 
Forma Financial Statements.

<F3> $4.4 million of general and administrative expense allocated to BMY 
in 1993 by Harsco has been retained by Harsco in order to approximate 
the operating results of Harsco assuming the transaction had occurred on 
January 1, 1993.

<F4> The Agreements provide for sharing the income before income taxes 
of the venture generally on the basis of the partners' equity ownership 
interests, after giving effect to a limited partner preferred 
distribution. The Equity in Earnings of $84 million includes the 
limited partner preferred distribution and 40% of the remaining pro 
forma pre-tax earnings of UDLP. The pro forma earnings of the venture 
give effect to various income and expense adjustments in order to 
approximate the results of operations assuming the transaction had been 
effective on January 1, 1993.

<F5> The income tax expense results from the taxable pro forma 
adjustments to income at a combined Federal and State statutory tax rate 
of approximately 40%.
