PSC sets ROE cap for Tampa Electric

TAMPA, July 5, 1994 -- The Florida Public Service
Commission today took action to cap Tampa Electric's 1994
regulatory rate of return on common equity (ROE) at 12.45
percent, and left unchanged the company's authorized ROE.

In February, the commission set Tampa Electric's
authorized ROE at a midpoint of 11.35 percent with a range
of 10.35 percent to 12.35 percent.

With respect to 1994 only, the PSC approved, with
slight modification, a proposal by the commission staff and
Tampa Electric to provide that any regulatory return above
12.45 percent ROE would be used to increase Tampa Electric's
storm damage reserve for its transmission and distribution
facilities. Any amounts in excess of this requirement and
this return would be refunded to Tampa Electric customers.

The commission will determine the appropriate amount of
the storm damage reserve later this year. The self-insurance
storm reserve was created as a result of the unavailability
of private storm insurance in the state after Hurricane
Andrew severely damaged T&D facilities in 1992.

The commission's proposed agency action today is
expected to become final 21 days after the publication of
its written order, unless a party asks for a hearing.

TECO ENERGY PROMOTES TWO TOP EXECUTIVES,
ELECTS ANDERSON TO BOARD OF DIRECTORS

TAMPA, July 19, 1994 -- Girard F. Anderson, president of

company's board of directors, it was announced today by Timothy

In addition, Keith S. Surgenor, TECO Energy's vice

president-human resources, has been named to succeed Anderson as

president and chief operating officer of Tampa Electric, TECO

Energy's largest subsidiary.

TECO Energy--2

"Jerry Anderson's involvement in the operations of all our

businesses, including Tampa Electric, will strengthen our

management effort. And, we are giving Keith Surgenor, who has

been actively involved in Tampa Electric's planning and

operations, greater responsibility as chief operating officer for

all utility operations," he said.

Guzzle said that with Anderson and Surgenor helping to

conduct day-to-day operations he would have more time to focus on

"opportunities that are strategic for the continued development

and growth of TECO Energy."

"These appointments also put the company in a better

position to deal with any health contingency on my part," he

said, pointing out that he had been treated for colon cancer last

year. "My condition continues to be monitored and treated as

needed, and the prognosis continues to be optimistic."

Guzzle himself joined TECO Energy in 1988 as president and

chief operating officer. In 1989 he assumed the responsibilities

of chief executive officer and in 1991 was elected board

chairman.

Jerry Anderson has served as president of Tampa Electric

since 1987 and was named by the board to the additional post of

executive vice president-utility operations of TECO Energy later

that same year.
