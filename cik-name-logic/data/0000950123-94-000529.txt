ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On March 11, 1994, Hecla Mining Company ("Hecla" or the
"Company") completed its acquisition of Equinox Resources Ltd., an exploration,
development and mining company headquartered in Vancouver, British Columbia
("Equinox"), whose assets consist primarily of various mining exploration
development and production properties located in the United States. The
transaction was treated as a pooling of interests for financial reporting and
accounting purposes. Hecla issued approximately 5.9 million shares of Hecla
common stock for all of Equinox's outstanding common stock representing an
exchange ratio of 0.3 shares of Hecla common stock for each share of Equinox
common stock. In addition, approximately 400,000 shares of Hecla common stock
are issuable upon exercise of outstanding Equinox warrants and outstanding
Equinox stock options. Following the acquisition, Equinox will be liquidated
so that all of its direct subsidiaries become direct subsidiaries of Hecla. In
connection with the acquisition, Hecla also issued production notes related to
production at the American Girl mine and Oro Cruz project of Equinox, with an
aggregate redemption price of Canadian $2,075,655.

Prior to the negotiations and resulting acquisition of Equinox
by Hecla, there have been no material relationships between or among the two
companies and their subsidiaries, directors or officers, or associates of any
such directors or officer. In addition, the exchange ratio of Hecla common
stock for Equinox common stock was negotiated at arms length by Hecla and
Equinox.

Attached as Exhibit 1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K, and
incorporated herein by this reference, is a copy of Hecla's press release,
dated March 11, 1994, announcing the completion of the Equinox acquisition.
Exhibit 2 to this Current Report on Form 8-K is the Acquisition Agreement,
dated as of December 29, 1993, by and among Hecla, B.P.Y.A. 1193 Holdings Ltd.,
1057451 Ontario Limited and Equinox (the "Acquisition Agreement"), pursuant to
which the acquisition of Equinox was completed, and the foregoing description
of the acquisition is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Acquisition
Agreement, which is incorporated herein by this reference.

AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Directors of
Equinox Resources Ltd.

We have audited the consolidated balance sheets of Equinox Resources Ltd. as at
December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the consolidated statements of loss and deficit
and changes in financial position for the year ended December 31, 1993, the two
months ended December 31, 1992 and the years ended October 31, 1992 and October
31, 1991. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted out audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards in Canada. Those standards require that we plan and perform an audit
to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation.

In our opinion, these consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as at December 31,
1993 and 1992 and the results of its operations and the changes in its
financial position for the year ended December 31, 1993, the two months ended
December 31, 1992 and the years ended October 31, 1992 and October 31, 1991 in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in Canada applied on a
consistent basis.

EQUINOX RESOURCES LTD.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

------------------

1. Nature of operations

The Company, directly and through joint ventures, is in the process of
exploring its resource properties and, except for the American Girl
Mine (Note 10.b.), the Van Stone Mine (Note 10.c.), and the Oro Cruz
property (Note 10.d.), has not determined whether these properties
contain economically recoverable ore reserves.

The recoverability of amounts shown for resource properties and
related deferred costs is dependent upon the discovery of economically
recoverable reserves, confirmation of the Company's interest in the
underlying mineral claims, the ability of the Company to obtain
necessary financing to complete the development, and future profitable
production from the properties or proceeds from disposition.

2. Basis of presentation

The Company received articles of amalgamation on December 8, 1992
whereby a new entity, Equinox Resources Ltd. ("New Equinox") was
formed by the amalgamation of Eastmaque Gold Mines Ltd. ("Eastmaque")
and Equinox Resources Ltd. ("Equinox") (Note 5). Significant
accounting policies of the amalgamated company are consistent with
those used by the predecessor companies.

3. Summary of significant accounting policies

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in
Canada, which do not differ materially from GAAP in the United States,
except as disclosed in Note 17.

a) Principles of consolidation

These consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and its
60%-owned subsidiary, Equinox Resources (Wash.) Inc. ("Equinox
Washington"). The American Girl mine joint venture and the
Oro Cruz joint venture are accounted for on the proportionate
consoli-

EQUINOX RESOURCES LTD.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(IN CANADIAN DOLLARS)

dation basis. The Buckhorn mine joint venture is accounted
for on the cost basis. All inter-company transactions have
been eliminated.

b) Inventory

Inventory of gold bullion, silver bullion and mineral
concentrates are valued at the lower of cost and net
realizable value. Supplies are valued at the lower of average
production cost and replacement cost. Costs associated with
ore being leached are inventoried and amortized based on the
estimated gold to be recovered.

c) Fixed assets

Office and field equipment are recorded at cost and the
Company provides for depreciation on a straight-line basis
using a 20% annual rate.

d) Resource properties

Acquisition costs of resource properties together with direct
exploration and development expenditures thereon are deferred
in the accounts. When production is attained, these costs are
amortized using the unit of production method based upon
estimated proven recoverable reserves. When deferred
expenditures on individual producing properties exceed
estimated net realizable value, the properties are
written-down to the estimated value. Costs relating to
properties abandoned are written-off when the decision to
abandon is made.

e) Foreign exchange translation

Balances denominated in foreign currencies are translated into
Canadian dollars using the temporal method. Amounts stated in
U.S. dollars are translated into Canadian dollars as follows -
monetary assets and liabilities are translated at exchange
rates prevailing at the balance sheet date; non-monetary
items, income and expenses are translated at the prevailing
exchange rates on the date of the transaction. The net gain
or loss of the foreign currency translation is included in the
operations in the respective periods.

-10-

<PAGE> 12
EQUINOX RESOURCES LTD.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(IN CANADIAN DOLLARS)

f) Reclamation costs

Current expenditures relating to ongoing environmental and
reclamation programs are charged against earnings as incurred.
Estimated future reclamation costs, where reasonably
determinable, are charged against earnings over the estimated
life of the mine.

g) Revenue recognition

Sales of precious metals and concentrate are recorded at the
estimated net realizable value when delivered. Revenue from
consulting is recorded when the services are rendered.

h) Loss per share

The calculations of loss per share are based upon the weighted
average number of common shares of the Company outstanding
each period.

4. Accounting policy change

During the year ended December 31, 1993, the Company changed its
method of recording inventory of gold bullion, from recording it at
net realizable value, to recording it at the lower of average
production cost and net realizable value.

This change, which has been applied retroactively with restatement of
prior periods, increased the net loss for the year ended December 31,
1993 by $540,000, the two month period ended December 31, 1992 by
$19,000, and the years ended October 31, 1992, and 1991 by $nil. As
at December 31, 1993, resource properties were increased by $148,000,
inventory decreased by $540,000 (December 31, 1992 - $19,000) and
deficit decreased by $373,000 (December 31, 1992 - $19,000).

5. Business combination

On December 8, 1992 Equinox amalgamated with Eastmaque under the
provisions of the Company Act of British Columbia to form a new
company, New Equinox. Both companies were involved in the exploration
and development of resource properties. This business combination has
been accounted for by the purchase method with New Equinox acquiring
Eastmaque and the results of operations of Eastmaque being included
from the date of amalgamation, December 8, 1992. The combination was
effected through

1,383,770 Class A preferred shares of New Equinox, the issue of
1,383,770 warrants (Note 13(d)), and costs of $137,439. The fair

c) Van Stone mine

The Van Stone mine is a lead-zinc property located in Stevens
County, Washington and owned by Equinox Washington, which is
owned 60% by the Company.

The initial production, started in April 1991, was suspended

resumed in August 1992, and was again suspended in January
1993 following the continuation of unfavorable metal prices.
The operations will remain on a care and maintenance program
at a cost of approximately US$15,000 per month until zinc
prices reach a more favorable level.

As a result of recent metal prices, the Company in 1993
wrote-down its investment by $1,811,643 and in October 1992
wrote-down its investment in the Van Stone mine by $6,605,651
and also wrote-off $4,091,461 of long-term debt repayable only

d) Oro Cruz property

The Company has a 44% joint venture interest in certain
mineral claims known as the Oro Cruz property located near the

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(IN CANADIAN DOLLARS)

The explanations of the pro forma adjustments are as follows:

(1) Adjusting for the operations of Eastmaque Gold Mines Ltd. for
the period to the date of acquisition. Only the American Girl
and the Oro Cruz properties have been included in the pro
forma. The other operations which have been abandoned or
terminated prior to the amalgamation date include the Kirkland
Lake Gold operations and related reclamation activities; all
general and administration costs related to the Vancouver
office, the exploration activities and property write-downs
related to the Nevada Joint Venture.

(2) Elimination of inter-company transactions.

(3) Reduction of amortization costs for the period due to the
lower valuation of the resource properties following the
amalgamation.

(4) Income tax effect of higher income before income taxes.

24. Comparative figures

Certain of the comparative figures have been reclassified to conform
with the current period's presentation.

25. Subsequent events

a) Subsequent to December 31, 1993, the Company issued 361,687
common shares for cash of $545,696 pursuant to the exercise of
stock options.

b) On February 25, 1994, the shareholders of the Company approved
the amalgamation with Hecla Mining Company ("Hecla"). Upon
completion of the transaction, the Company's common
shareholders will receive 0.3 Hecla common shares, holders of
the Company's Series "A" Production Participating Preferred
Shares will receive Hecla Production Notes with no material
change in the terms and conditions attached to such shares,
and the Company's options and warrants outstanding will become
exercisable for Hecla common shares based on the Equinox
common share conversion ratio.

CONDENSED PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The following condensed pro forma combined balance sheet and
condensed pro forma combined statements of operations (collectively, the "Pro
Forma Financial Statements") were prepared by Hecla to illustrate the estimated
effects of the business combination to be accounted for as a pooling of
interests under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
Accordingly, the financial information of Hecla and Equinox has been combined
for all periods presented. All amounts in the Pro Forma Financial Statements
are stated in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated. The Pro Forma Financial
Statements give retrospective effect to material differences between Hecla's
and Equinox's accounting policies which are expected to have a material impact
on the combined financial statements. The Pro Forma Financial Statements do
not purport to represent what the combined financial position or results of
operations actually would have been if the combination had occurred at the
beginning of the periods or to project the combined financial position or
results of operations for any future date or period.

The Pro Forma Financial Statements should be read in
conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements, including
the notes thereto, of Hecla (prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP) which are
included in Hecla's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 1993 and
of Equinox (prepared in accordance with Canadian GAAP), which are included
elsewhere in this document. Equinox's historical financial statements have
been restated into U.S. dollars and then adjusted to conform with U.S. GAAP
and Hecla's accounting policies, format and classification.

The Pro Forma Financial Statements are presented utilizing the
pooling-of-interests method of accounting whereby the recorded assets,
liabilities, shareholders' equity and results of operations of Hecla and
Equinox become the combined assets, liabilities, shareholders' equity and
results of operations. The Pro Forma Financial Statements also include pro
forma adjustments which are based upon available information and certain
assumptions that management of Hecla believes are reasonable in the
circumstances.

NOTES TO CONDENSED PRO FORMA COMBINED BALANCE SHEET
(ALL AMOUNTS ARE IN U.S. DOLLARS UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED)

The Equinox Historical balance sheet at December 31, 1993 has been adjusted
to reflect (i) restatement of Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars (based on the
exchange rate as of December 31, 1993 of $0.755 U.S. dollar for each Canadian
dollar) and (ii) presentation in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the accounting
policies, format and classification utilized by Hecla. The following adjustments
were made to reflect the Equinox Canadian dollar balance sheets in conformity
with Hecla's presentation and U.S. GAAP:

(1) Equinox capitalizes exploration expenditures incurred on properties
identified as having development potential. Hecla expenses exploration costs
as incurred. Properties, plants and equipment was reduced $2,282,000 at
December 31, 1993 to reverse exploration costs which previously were
capitalized by Equinox. A reclamation bond for $70,000 was reclassed to
other noncurrent assets from properties, plants and equipment in connection
with this adjustment.

(2) Adjustments of $362,000 to other noncurrent assets and accounts payable and
accrued expenses reflect reclassifications of certain reclamation bonds and
existing accrued reclamation costs. Hecla's accounting policy is to accrue
future reclamation costs over the operating life of the facility, based on
current environmental regulatory requirements. As a result of this policy,
accrued reclamation costs were increased to the following balances as of
December 31, 1992.

----------

----------
----------
</TABLE>

During the year ended December 31, 1993, Equinox accrued $2,084,000 for
reclamation costs associated with these properties.

(3) Reduction in the carrying value of the American Girl gold mine and Oro Cruz
gold project by $2,400,000 to reflect valuation of properties using Hecla's
methodology. Depreciation expense of $309,000 recorded by Equinox for the
three-month period ended December 31, 1993 was reversed. The reduction is
based upon a fourth quarter 1993 feasibility study which indicates that less
cash flow will be received from the property than originally anticipated. As
a result, the balance of production participating preferred shares payable,
which is based upon cash flows from operations, has decreased approximately
$706,000. The write-down was effective October 1, 1993.

(4) Reversal of a portion of the write-down of Equinox's investment in Pan
American Minerals Corporation as of December 31, 1993. Equinox recorded a
write-down to $1 in the year ended December 31, 1993.

(5) Equinox has a 23.56% interest in the Buckhorn mine. Equinox wrote off its
investment in Buckhorn in 1989. Since that date, Equinox has not included
its proportionate share of Buckhorn in its consolidated financial
statements, Hecla's policy is to consolidate such investments in its
financial statements. The amounts recorded to reflect Equinox's December 31,
1993 proportional share of Buckhorn's financial statements are as follows:

(6) The exchange of each Equinox common share (without par value) for 0.3 of a

NOTES TO CONDENSED PRO FORMA COMBINED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS
(ALL AMOUNTS ARE IN U.S. DOLLARS UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED)

(1) The Equinox historical statements of operations for the years ended
December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 have been adjusted to reflect (a)
translation of Canadian dollar amounts into U.S. dollars using the average
exchange rate for each period (approximately $0.775 U.S. dollar for each
Canadian dollar for the year 1993, $0.839 in the year 1992, and $0.871 in
the year 1991) and (b) presentation in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the
accounting policies, format and classification utilized by Hecla.

Prior to November 1, 1992, Equinox's fiscal year end was October 31.
Accordingly, the December 31, 1992 and 1991 condensed pro forma combined
statements of operations include the fiscal year results for Hecla for the
year ended December 31 and for Equinox for the fiscal year ended October
31. Subsequent to October 31, 1992, Equinox had a December 31 year end.
Accordingly, the year ended December 31, 1993 reflects operating results
from January 1 through December 31, 1993 for both Hecla and Equinox.
Equinox pro forma sales and net loss for the two month period ended
December 31, 1992 were $1,901,000 and $3,076,000, respectively. The net
loss was added to the combined December 31, 1992 deficit on a pro forma
basis.

NEWS RELEASE

HECLA COMPLETES ACQUISITION OF EQUINOX
For Release: March 11, 1994

COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho -- Hecla Mining Company (HL & HL-B:NYSE) 
announced today that it had completed its acquisition of 
Equinox Resources Ltd. (EQX:TSE), a gold exploration and 
development company based in Vancouver, Canada. Equinox 
shareholders approved the transaction late last month. The 
Ontario Court of Justice approved the plan of arrangement on 
Monday, March 7.

Hecla will issue approximately 5.9 million shares of common 
stock in exchange for all of Equinox's outstanding common 
shares. Each Equinox shareholder will receive three shares 
of Hecla common stock for every 10 shares of Equinox common 
stock held. Holders of Equinox production shares will 
receive Hecla production notes. In addition, approximately 
400,000 shares of Hecla common stock are issuable upon 
exercise of outstanding Equinox warrants.

"This acquisition, combined with production from our other 
gold operations, provides Hecla with the opportunity to 
become a 200,000 ounce-per-year gold producer," said Arthur 
Brown, Hecla's chairman, president and chief executive 
officer. Hecla's principal reason for acquiring Equinox was 
the opportunity to obtain the Rosebud gold project in Pershing 
County, Nevada, and the American Girl gold mine in Imperial 
County, California.

"Equinox's primary asset, the 100 percent-owned Rosebud, is 
one of the better underground projects Hecla has seen," Brown 
said. "Because of our expertise in underground mining, this 
project is a good fit with our company." The Rosebud deposit 
contained 512,000 ounces of proven and probable gold reserves 
as of December 31, 1993, and has significant exploration and 
development potential.

Hecla intends to develop the Rosebud gold project upon 
satisfactory completion of feasibility study which is 
currently expected to be finalized by late-1995. 
Construction could begin shortly thereafter, with production 
commencing as early as the fourth quarter of 1996. The 
feasibility study will assess the property's potential to 
produce between 70,000 and 80,000 ounces of gold annually.

Equinox's share of gold production at the American Girl mine 
in 1993 was approximately 35,000 ounces. Hecla's share of 
the 1994 production from American Girl will be approximately 
30,000 ounces. The American Girl mine has sufficient ore 
reserves to last until mid-1995, at which time mining is 
expected to start at the adjacent Oro Cruz gold project. 
Both are managed by MK Gold in a joint-venture arrangement.

The Equinox acquisition also brings Hecla nearly 30 other 
exploration projects, most of which are currently being 
explored by joint-venture partners in the United States, 
Canada and Bolivia.

Hecla Mining Company has its headquarters in Coeur d'Alene, 
Idaho. During its 103-year history, Hecla has been a 
leading U.S. producer of silver and lead, and more recently, 
a significant supplier of gold and industrial minerals.
