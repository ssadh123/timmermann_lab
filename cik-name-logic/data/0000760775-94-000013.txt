MEMORANDUM Exhibit No. 99.1

TO: Analysts and Brokers

FROM: Delbert Seitz

DATE: August 9, 1994

SUBJECT: INFORMATION ABOUT THE CUDDY TRANSACTION

I. Cuddy Assets Purchased (in millions)

Working Capital. . . . . . . . . . $40.4
Plant, Property & Equipment . . . 32.2
Other Assets . . . . . . . . . . . 1.2

TOTAL . . . . . . . . . . . . $73.8

Assets were purchased at approximately book value and will
not require any allocation of value to goodwill. These
values are subject to post-closing adjustments which are not
thought to be material.

Payment will be made with $43.0 million of cash financed
with variable rate interest loans and $30.8 million of
equity. Shares issued may range from 1,283,333 shares of
common stock at $24.00 per share to 1,100,000 shares at
$28.00 per share. Post-closing adjustments will be adjusted
with equity, not cash.

Each dollar invested in Cuddy buys $2.7 of sales ($200.0
million sales divided by $73.8 million of investment). This
compares favorably to our recent Moorefield, West Virginia
chicken expansion that added approximately $1.7 of sales per
dollar invested. The Cuddy transaction acquires existing
turkey production capacity and markets and does not expand
the industry.

II. WLR Foods Approaches One Billion Dollars in Sales

Sales for the food division of Cuddy in their last completed
fiscal year were approximately $200 million. This should
bring WLR Foods
sales to one billion in 1995.

III. WLR Foods Becomes Number Two in Turkey Processing

Based on December 1993 issue of "Turkey World", for calendar
year 1994, Wampler-Longacre will grow 502 million pounds of
live weight turkey and Cuddy 240 million pounds. The
combined total of 742 million pounds of live weight turkey
clearly puts WLR Foods second in the industry to Con Agra's
Butterball Turkey Co.

IV. Cuddy Strengthens WLR Foods Position in Further Processed 
Turkey and Food Service Markets

More than half of all Cuddy sales are further processed,
value added products with a heavy emphasis in food service
and institutional markets. This fits WLR Foods long-term
strategy for increased value added and food service sales.

V. The Addition of Approximately 1.2 Million Common Shares Adds
Shareholder Value

Because of the relative low number of shares issued for the
amount of equity acquired, the book value of all shares
outstanding will be increased by over $1.00 per share. 
Dividing $200 million of added sales by 1.2 million added
shares, results in $167 of sales for each share issued. 
This increases the sales per share for all WLR common stock
outstanding from approximately $65 per share to $75 per
share.

Based on the shares to be issued, the transaction will be
accretive as Cuddy is expected to meet WLR Foods existing
gross margin rate and later, when synergies and cost
improvements are implemented, contribute even more to
earnings per share.
