Item 4. Changes In Registrant's Certifying Accountant.

Effective April 22, 1994, Registrant dismissed its prior
Independent Auditors, Deloitte & Touche ("Deloitte") and retained
as its new Independent Auditors, Imowitz Koenig & Company.
Deloitte's Independent Auditors' Report on Registrant's financial
statements for calendar years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992
did not contain an adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and
were not qualified as to audit scope or accounting principles.
However, Deloitte's Independent Auditors' Report for the calendar
year December 31, 1993 was modified due to the uncertainty
regarding Registrant's ability to continue as a going concern
since Registrant has substantial balloon payments due on Notes in
1994; the financial statements did not include any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. In
addition, Deloitte's Independent Auditors' Report for the
calendar year December 31, 1992 was modified to emphasize that
Registrant held investments in and operated properties in real
estate markets experiencing unfavorable economic conditions and
would be required to renegotiate certain notes payable with
balloon payments, obtain financing elsewhere, or sell or
otherwise dispose of related properties. The decision to change
Independent Auditors was approved by the Managing General
Partner's Directors. During calendar years 1992, 1993 and
through April 22, 1994, there were no disagreements between
Registrant and Deloitte on any matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope of
procedure which disagreements if not resolved to the satisfaction
of Deloitte, would have caused it to make reference to the
subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its
reports.

Effective April 22, 1994, Registrant engaged Imowitz Koenig &
Company as its Independent Auditors. During the last two
calendar years and the subsequent interim periods to the date
hereof, Registrant did not consult Imowitz Koenig & Company
regarding any of the matters or events set forth in Item
304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K. 

Item 7. Financial Statement and Exhibits.

10. (a) Letter dated April 27, 1994 from Registrant's Former
