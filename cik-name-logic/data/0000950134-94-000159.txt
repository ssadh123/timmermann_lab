STATEMENT OF TELE-COMMUNICATIONS, INC, LIBERTY MEDIA
CORPORATION AND BELL ATLANTIC CORPORATION

Bell Atlantic Corporation, Tele-Communications, Inc. and Liberty Media
Corporation announced today that they have been unable to reach final agreement
on their proposed merger and have terminated negotiations.

"We are, of course, disappointed," said Ray Smith, Chairman of Bell
Atlantic, "but the unsettled regulatory climate made it too difficult for the
parties to value the future today. We have developed great respect for TCI,
Liberty and their employees, and we look forward to working with them in the
future." Smith said that the parties had resolved their major differences, but
regulatory actions announced this week made reaching agreement on a transaction
of this magnitude impossible.

John C. Malone, President of TCI, said, "Given market and regulatory
uncertainties, Ray and I concluded that this is not the time to bring our
companies together. We are discussing other ways of working together,
including possible joint ventures to build full service networks, and joint
investment in programming."

ESTIMATED EFFECT OF FCC RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT

ENGLEWOOD, COLORADO - After its initial review of the effect of the
FCC further rate reductions, TCI estimated that its cash flow could be further
decreased by approximately $144 million annually. This estimate was based upon
the FCC Executive Summary, dated February 22, 1994. The actual reduction in
annualized cash flow may differ depending on the terms of the final regulations
and more complete analysis, including an analysis of TCI's existing rates and
services, and future actions the Company may take to mitigate the impact.
Additionally, TCI is suspending $500 million of capital spending, pending
further clarification of the FCC's regulations. This represents 50% of the
Company's planned capital spending in 1994.
