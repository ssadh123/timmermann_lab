VALHI REPORTS IMPROVED EARNINGS

DALLAS, TEXAS . . July 28, 1994 . . Valhi, Inc. (NYSE:VHI) reported net
income of $3 million, or $.03 per share, for the second quarter of 1994, a $10
million improvement from the net loss of $7.1 million, or $.06 per share, in the
comparable 1993 period. Valhi's net income for the first six months of 1994 was
$2.3 million, or $.02 per share, almost $70 million better than the net loss of
$67.4 million, or $.59 per share, reported for the first half of 1993. Improved
results attributable to the Company's interest in NL Industries' (NYSE: NL)
chemicals operations were a major factor in the higher 1994 earnings.

Operating income increased 33% to $28.6 million in the second quarter on a
9% increase in sales to $211 million. For the first half of 1994, operating
income was up 24% to $47.2 million as sales increased 10% to $400 million. The
improvements in sales, earnings and margins were driven in large part by higher
volumes in the Company's refined sugar, forest products and hardware products
segments. Average sugar prices during the first half of 1994 were comparable to
first half 1993 averages, while earnings of the Company's forest products
segment were enhanced by higher average selling prices for its principal
product, medium density fiberboard. In the fast food segment, results
comparable to last year were achieved despite a slightly lower average number of
stores.

NL's chemicals operations improved through higher European pricing for
titanium dioxide pigments, higher sales volume and lower operating costs. NL
has reported that it expects to benefit from recently announced price increases
in the second half of 1994.

Lower average debt levels and lower interest rates resulted in reduced
interest expense, while lower securities earnings resulted primarily from a
decline in the market value of fixed-income investments early in the year.

As previously announced, the Company has agreed to sell its sugar business
to an agricultural cooperative of sugarbeet growers for $325 million cash. The
transaction is subject to financing and other conditions and there can be no
assurance that it will be consummated.

Valhi, Inc., headquartered in Dallas, Texas, is engaged in the refined
sugar, forest products, hardware products and fast food industries as well as
the chemicals and titanium metals industries through its interests in NL and
Tremont.
