REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors 
Johnstown Savings Bank, FSB

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial
condition of Johnstown Savings Bank, FSB at December 31, 1991 and 1990, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash
flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1991. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Bank's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe our audits provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial condition of Johnstown
Savings Bank, FSB at December 31, 1991 and 1990, and the consolidated results
of its operation and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1991 in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

The Board of Directors and Stockholders
Johnstown Savings Bank:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial
condition of Johnstown Savings Bank and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993
and 1992 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders'
equity, and cash flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial
statements are the responsibility of Johnstown Savings Bank's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial
statements based on our audits. The consolidated financial statements of
Johnstown Savings Bank and subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 1991
were audited by other auditors whose report thereon, dated January 30, 1992,
expressed an unqualified opinion on those statements.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Johnstown
Savings Bank and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the results
of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, Johnstown
Savings Bank changed its method of accounting for investment and mortgage-
backed securities in 1993 to adopt the provisions of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." As
discussed in notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, Johnstown
Savings Bank changed its method of accounting for income taxes in 1992 to adopt
provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The accounting and reporting policies followed by Johnstown Savings Bank

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of JSB and its

Inc. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts are eliminated
in consolidation.

b. Investment and mortgage-backed securities:

Investment securities and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) categorized as
held-to-maturity are carried at historical cost adjusted for amortization of
purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts computed by the
interest method. Prior to December 31, 1993, investment securities and MBS
categorized as available-for-sale were carried at the lower of amortized
historical cost or market values, with unrealized aggregate holding period
losses charged to current operations.

In May 1993, The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115 ("SFAS No. 115"),
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities." SFAS No.
115 requires that investments be classified into three categories: (1)
Securities held-to-maturity, reported at amortized historical cost; (2)
securities available-for-sale, reported at fair value; and (3) trading
securities, reported at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses for
trading securities are included in earnings while unrealized holding gains
and losses for securities available-for-sale are reported, net of taxes, as
a separate component of equity.

Effective December 31, 1993, JSB adopted SFAS No. 115. JSB reclassified
$109.4 million of investment securities and MBS to the available-for-sale
category during 1993.

Market values are determined on an aggregate basis using quoted market
prices at the financial statement date. Realized gains or losses on
securities sold are calculated on the adjusted cost of the securities sold.

Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the
time of purchase. If management has the intent and JSB has the ability at
the time of purchase to hold securities until maturity or on a long-term
basis, they are classified as held-to-maturity. Securities to be held for
indefinite periods of time are classified as available-for-sale. Securities
categorized as available-for-sale include securities that management intends
to use as part of its asset/liability management strategy and may be sold to
effectively manage interest-rate risk exposure, prepayment risk, and other
factors (such as liquidity requirements).

The amortization rate for purchase premiums and the accretion rate for
purchase discounts on investments and MBS can be materially affected by
changes in (1) general interest rates; (2) prepayment characteristics for
certain types of securities; and (3) changes in specific prepayment rates
for securities within JSB's portfolio. While management believes it uses the
best available information to make estimations of these factors in income
calculations, future adjustments to interest income may be necessary if
circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the
estimation.

c. Provision for losses:

Provisions for estimated losses on loans and real estate owned are charged
to earnings in an amount that results in an allowance sufficient, in
management's judgment, to cover anticipated losses based on management's
evaluation of portfolio risk, past and expected future loss experience and
economic conditions.

F-6

<PAGE>

Real estate acquired by foreclosure (including loans classified as in-
substance foreclosed) in connection with loan settlements is stated at the
lower of estimated fair value less estimated disposition costs, or the
carrying amount of the loan. A reserve for real estate acquired is
maintained on a property by property basis to recognize estimated potential
declines in value that might occur between appraisal dates. Provisions for
potential decrease in fair value, and net direct operating expense
attributable to these assets are included in operating expenses.

In-substance foreclosures are reflected in real estate acquired by
foreclosure when the borrower has minimal equity in the property; JSB
expects repayment of the loan to come only from the operation or sale of the
property; and the borrower either has abandoned control of the property or
is unlikely to rebuild equity or otherwise meet the terms of the loan
obligation in the foreseeable future.

While management believes it uses the best information available to make
evaluations of allowances, future adjustments of the allowances for loans
and real estate acquired through foreclosure may be necessary if
circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the
evaluations. In addition, loan classifications and loss reserves, as
determined by management, are subject to periodic examination by regulatory
agencies. Management cannot predict with certainty whether future regulatory
examinations will require any changes in JSB's loan classifications or loan
loss reserves.

In May 1993, the FASB released SFAS No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for
Impairment of a Loan". SFAS No. 114 defines the term "impaired loan" and
indicates the method used to measure the impairment. The measurement of
impairment may be based on (1) the present value of the expected future cash
flows of the impaired loan discounted at the loan's original effective
interest rate; (2) the observable market price of the impaired loan; or (3)
the fair value of the collateral of a collateral dependent loan. SFAS No.
114 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1994 and is
not expected to be material to JSB.

d. Income taxes:

In 1992, the FASB issued SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". SFAS
No. 109 requires a change from the deferred method of accounting for income
taxes of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion 11 to the asset and
liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and
liability method of SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using
enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which
those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under
SFAS No. 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change
in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the
enactment date.

Effective January 1, 1992, JSB elected to adopt SFAS No. 109, "Accounting
for Income Taxes." The cumulative effect of this change in accounting
principle at January 1, 1992, was $1.7 million, or $0.86 per share, and is
reported in the 1992 Consolidated Statements of Operations. Prior years'
financial statements have not been restated to apply the provisions of SFAS
No. 109.

Pursuant to the deferred method under APB Opinion 11, which was applied in
1991 and prior years, deferred income taxes were recognized for income and
expense items that are reported in different years for financial reporting
purposes and income tax purposes using the tax rate applicable in the year
of the calculation. Under the deferred method, deferred taxes were not
adjusted for subsequent changes in tax rates.

e. Depreciation and amortization:

Depreciation on all buildings and equipment is computed primarily by the
straight-line method. Depreciable lives are based on estimated economic
useful lives of the office properties and equipment.

F-7
<PAGE>

Improvements to leased banking premises are being amortized over the period
including the original lease term plus the first option term, where
applicable.

Cost in excess of fair market value of assets acquired with the acquisition
of SMC is being amortized over 25 years by the straight-line method. The net
unamortized amount at December 31, 1993, is $416,000.

Purchased mortgage servicing rights associated with loan servicing acquired
in the secondary mortgage market are capitalized. The purchased mortgage
servicing rights are amortized as an adjustment of future servicing income
using a method that approximates the interest method over the life of the
related loans, adjusted for estimated prepayments.

The amount capitalized upon the purchase of mortgage servicing rights is
equal to the price paid to unaffiliated sellers.

f. Loan origination and mortgage servicing:

For loans retained in JSB's portfolio, loan origination and commitment fees,
as well as certain direct loan origination and commitment costs, are
deferred and recognized as an adjustment to yield over the lives of the
related loans. Deferred fees and costs are netted against outstanding loan
balances. Accretion is suspended for loans classified as non-accrual.
Service fees are recognized as income when the related mortgage loan
payments are collected. Origination fees in excess of direct origination
cost are initially deferred and are recognized as income at the time of the
sale of loans to permanent investors.

The amortization rate for origination fees in excess of cost can be
materially affected by changes in: (1) general interest rates; (2)
prepayment characteristics for certain types of loans; or (3) specific
prepayment rates for loans within JSB's portfolio. While management believes
it uses the best information available to make estimations of these factors
in income calculations, future adjustments to income may be necessary if
circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the
estimation.

g. Mortgage loans available for sale:

Mortgage loans available for sale to investors are carried at the lower of
cost or estimated market value determined on an aggregate basis. Market
values are determined using sales commitments to permanent investors or
current market rates for loans of similar quality and type. Net unrealized
losses are recognized in a valuation allowance by charges to income.

h. Net income per share:

Income per share for the year ended December 31, 1993, was computed using
the weighted number of common shares outstanding of 1,940,160. For the years
ended December 31, 1992 and 1991, the weighted number of common shares was
1,940,150. The common equivalent shares discussed in Note 6 have not been
included in the computations since their inclusion currently does not result
in an earnings per share dilution of more than 3%.

i. Presentation of cash flows:

For purposes of reporting cash flows, JSB considers cash and due from banks
and interest-bearing deposits in other banks to be cash and cash
equivalents.

j. Reclassifications:

Items previously reported have been reclassified to conform with the current
year classifications.

During 1992, loss on investments includes $159,000 on securities deemed to be
other than temporarily impaired. This write-down resulted in a charge to
operations for the difference between the current market value of specific
investments and their historical cost. A valuation allowance to carry
securities available for sale at lower of cost or market value at December 31,
1992, also resulted in a $35,000 unrealized loss charged to operations.

NOTE 4: NON-PERFORMING ASSETS

Non-performing assets are comprised of (1) loans which are contractually past
due 90 days or more as to interest or principal payments and loans which have
been placed on non-accrual status; (2) troubled debt restructurings; and (3)
real estate acquired through foreclosure and in-substance foreclosed loans. It
is JSB's policy not to accrue interest on loans which are 90 days or more past
due.

The following table presents information concerning non-performing assets (in
thousands):

$145,000, $405,000, and $397,000 for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992,
and 1991, respectively. Interest income on restructured loans under their
original terms would have been approximately $324,000, $387,000, and $409,000,
for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively. Interest
income actually recorded on restructured loans under their modified terms was
approximately $126,000, $270,000, and $335,000, for the years ended December
31, 1993,1992, and 1991. The Bank is not committed to lend additional funds to

NOTE 6: EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

Pension Plans

On November 1, 1991, JSB adopted a defined contribution employee retirement
plan that covers substantially all employees of JSB and its subsidiaries. The
defined contribution plan was adopted in accordance with the provisions of
section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). The defined contribution
plan provides for monthly employer payments that match each participating
employee's voluntary contribution to the employee's individual tax-deferred
retirement account. The employer matching rate is 100% of the employee's
contribution up to 6% of the employee's compensation, subject to certain
individual and aggregate limits as specified in the IRC.

On December 1, 1991, JSB terminated its qualified non-contributory defined
benefit employee retirement plan which previously covered all full-time
employees who had attained a minimum age requirement and met a required period
of service. The reversal of current and prior period pension accruals resulted
in the recognition of a plan curtailment gain of $642,000 reflected in the 1991
Statement of Operations.

During 1992, JSB received permission from the Pension Benefit Guarantee
Corporation and the Internal Revenue Service to satisfy the terminated plan's
liabilities through qualified distributions of the plan's assets. Plan assets,
net of required supplementary employee distributions and federal excise taxes,
exceeded plan liabilities on the final distribution date. Accordingly, JSB
recognized a termination gain of $122,000, reflected in the 1992 Statement of
Operations.

Pension expense charged to operations and included in Salary and Employee
Benefits expense for the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, was
$177,000, $169,000, and $255,000, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Agreements

JSB has entered into deferred compensation agreements with certain officers
whereby if the respective officer is still employed by JSB on the date he
becomes 65, he may retire and, commencing on the date of such retirement, JSB
will pay deferred compensation for services rendered prior to retirement. Such
deferred compensation will be in predetermined amounts, payable in equal
monthly installments over the remaining life of the respective executive
officer. The accrued liability for the deferred compensation agreements at
December 31, 1993, is approximately $194,000.

F-13
<PAGE>

Stock Option Plan

The Board of Directors and stockholders approved a qualified employee stock
option plan under which JSB has reserved a total of 194,015 shares of its
common stock for the granting of options to key employees. The ability of the
employee to exercise such options is conditioned upon the employee's continued
employment on the exercise date.

Currently, 26,000 stock options issued at the time JSB converted to stock
form on October 29, 1986 remain outstanding. These options are currently
exercisable at the initial public offering price of $9.50 per share and expire
on April 23, 1997.

On February 18, 1992, the Board of Directors granted 60,000 options to
purchase stock, of which 47,391 remain outstanding at December 31, 1993. These
options are exercisable on or after February 18, 1995, at $5.75 per share and
expire February 18, 2002.

On February 16, 1993, the Board of Directors granted 30,000 options to
purchase stock, of which 23,969 remain outstanding at December 31, 1993, These
options are exercisable on or after February 16, 1996, at $11.15 per share and
expire on February 16, 2003.

An additional 10,000 stock options were granted on July 20, 1993, all of
which remain outstanding at December 31, 1993. These options are exercisable on
or after July 20, 1996, at $11.15 per share and expire on July 20, 2003.

NOTE 7: INCOME TAXES

As discussed in Note 1, the Bank adopted SFAS No. 109 as of January 1, 1992;
and the cumulative effect of this change is reported in the 1992 Consolidated
Statements of Operations. Prior years financial statements have not been
restated to apply the provisions of SFAS No. 109.

The provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the consolidated income
statement consists of the following (in thousands):

Under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, JSB currently has available
approximately $6.4 million of capital loss carryforwards which expire December
31, 1995. JSB's utilization of capital loss carryfowards will be limited to
capital gains generated, if any, in future periods. As of December 31, 1993,
JSB had general business tax credit and minimum tax credit carryforwards of
approximately $132,000 for federal income tax purposes. The general business
tax credit carryforwards expire in 1994 through 2000.

JSB is subject to the Pennsylvania Mutual Thrift Tax which imposes a tax on
Pennsylvania-sourced earnings substantially in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. Such taxes were substantially eliminated in
1992 and 1991 by the use of available Pennsylvania net operating loss
carryforwards. All unused Pennsylvania loss carryforwards expired on December
31, 1992.

SMC is subject to the Georgia corporate net income tax. Georgia taxable
income is determined on a separate company basis. The consolidated income
statements reflect a provision of $44,000, $53,000 and $116,000 in 1993, 1992,
and 1991, respectively, for Georgia income tax.

NOTE 8: STOCKHOLDER'S EQUITY

In connection with JSB's conversion from a mutual to stock form of
organization in 1986, JSB established a liquidation account in an amount equal
to its net worth as of June 30, 1986. The liquidation account will be
maintained for the benefit of depositors as of the December 31, 1985,
eligibility record date who continue to maintain their deposit accounts in JSB
after conversion. In the event of a complete liquidation (and only in such an
event) each eligible depositor will be entitled to receive a liquidation
distribution from the liquidation account in the proportionate amount of the
then current adjusted balance for deposits then held, before any liquidation
distribution may be made with respect to the stockholders. Except for the
repurchase of stock and payment of dividends by JSB, the existence of the
liquidation account will not restrict the use or application of such capital.
At December 31, 1993, the amount remaining in this liquidation account was $1.4
million. JSB may not declare or pay a cash dividend on, or repurchase any of,
its capital stock if the effect thereof would cause JSB's capital to be reduced
below either the amount required for the liquidation account or the capital
requirements imposed by the Department and the FDIC.

</TABLE>

The two credit arrangements described above are cross-collateralized, secured
by SMC's mortgage inventory, servicing rights and commitments.

Compensating balances held by the lender are used in determining the interest
rates charged on the mortgage warehouse lines of credit and the commercial
loan. These balances, which are derived from customer escrow balances, amounts
of collections in transit on loans serviced and corporate cash balances, can
further decrease the interest rate charged on the lines of credit if the
compensating balance is maintained at a level greater than the used portion of
the line. Under the loan agreements, the effective rate of the nonrevolving
commercial loan and the mortgage warehouse line of credit can be decreased to a
minimum rate of 1.0%. These compensating balances averaged approximately $22.8
million and $21.6 million during 1993 and 1992, respectively. The use of these
balances resulted in an effective interest rate of 1.87% and 1.59% in 1993 and
1992, respectively.

NOTE 12: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK AND CREDIT RISK

JSB is party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the
normal course of business to meet the financial needs of its customers and to
reduce its own exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These

F-19
<PAGE>

financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, letters of credit,
consumer and commercial lines of credit, fixed and variable rate mortgage loan
commitments and commitments to purchase securities. Those instruments involve,
to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest-rate risk in excess of the
amount recognized in the statement of financial position. The contract or
notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of JSB's involvement
in particular classes of financial instruments.

JSB has exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other
party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit. JSB uses
the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as
it does for on-balance-sheet instruments. Accordingly, the amount and type of
collateral obtained by JSB is based upon industry practice and JSB's credit
assessment of the customer.

The following table sets forth the dollar amount of financial instruments
whose contract amounts represent credit-risk and commitments outstanding, not
otherwise reflected on the balance sheet, as of December 31 (in thousands):

$46,489 $15,205
======= =======
Commitments to sell fixed-rate mortgage loans available
for sale................................................. $31,586 $20,625
======= =======
</TABLE>

Market risk arises if interest rates, at the time a fixed-rate commitment is
funded, have moved adversely subsequent to the extension of the commitment. JSB
believes the market risk associated with consumer loan commitments is minimal.
Commitments to fund residential mortgages and to purchase mortgage-backed
securities carry market risks similar to the risks associated with similar
assets currently reported on JSB's balance-sheet. Since a portion of JSB's
commitments to extend credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon,
the total contractual amounts do not necessarily represent future cash
requirements.

Financial institutions, such as JSB, generate profits primarily through
lending and investing activities. The risk of loss from lending and investing
activities includes the possibility that a loss may occur from the failure of
another party to perform according to the terms of the loan or investment
agreement. This possibility of loss is known as credit risk.

Credit risk is increased by lending and/or investing activities that
concentrate a financial institution's earning assets in such a way as to expose
the institution to a material loss from any single occurrence or group of
related occurrences. Diversifying the institution's assets to prevent
concentrations is one way in which the financial institution can reduce
potential losses due to credit risk.

JSB manages its credit risk by establishing and implementing strategies
appropriate to the characteristics of borrowers, collateral pledged and
geographic locations. Diversification of risk, within each of these areas is a
primary objective of JSB.

F-20
<PAGE>

At December 31, 1993, JSB's assets were deployed primarily in four principal
types of investments: (1) investment securities and MBS; (2) residential real
estate loans; (3) commercial and multi-family residential real estate loans;
and (4) consumer loans.

Investment securities and MBS. Other than investment securities and MBS
issued or backed by the U.S. Government or a U.S. Government-sponsored
enterprise, JSB has no significant concentration of any single issuer in its
MBS and investment portfolios.

Residential real estate loans. At December 31, 1993, JSB had $80.1 million in
residential mortgages, including loans available for sale. The collateral
properties for approximately $58.6 million of these loans, and a substantial
majority of JSB's mortgage loan commitments at December 31, 1993, were
concentrated primarily in western Pennsylvania. Loans and commitments of this
type are issued to an inherently diverse group of borrowers and JSB has no
significant concentration of loans to one borrower. In addition, JSB's
underwriting standards and internal control procedures are designed to
minimize, as far as possible, credit risk associated with residential mortgage
lending and the possible risks associated with concentrations of such loans in
a geographic area of limited size.

Commercial and multi-family residential loans. At December 31, 1993, JSB had
$42.8 million of commercial and multi-family residential loans, the majority of
which are located outside the state of Pennsylvania. At December 31, 1993,
$11.2 million, $4.1 million, and $5.6 million of multi-family residential and
commercial real estate loans were secured by properties located in Texas,
Colorado, and Georgia, respectively. Since 1989, JSB has not actively sought to
originate commercial real estate loans outside of western Pennsylvania. JSB's
underwriting standards and internal control procedures are designed to
minimize, as far as possible, credit risks associated with commercial real
estate lending within western Pennsylvania.

Consumer loans. At December 31, 1993, JSB had $27.5 million in consumer
loans. Substantially all of JSB's consumer loan portfolio is secured (where
applicable) by assets located in or around JSB's general market area. In
addition, substantially all of JSB's off-balance-sheet commitments to extend
consumer loan credit involve customers within JSB's general market area.
Consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher interest rates than
other types of retail loans, such as residential mortgages, because of the type
and nature of the collateral and, in certain cases, the absence of collateral.
Such loans are issued to an inherently diverse group of borrowers and JSB has
no significant concentration of loans to one borrower. JSB's underwriting
standards and internal control procedures are designed to minimize, as far as
possible, credit risk associated with concentrations of such loans in a
geographic area of limited size.

NOTE 13: STANDARD MORTGAGE CORPORATION OF GEORGIA

SMC is a mortgage banking company located in Atlanta, Georgia. It originates
and sells loans primarily in the Atlanta metropolitan area. SMC also acquires
rights to service mortgage loans from unaffiliated third parties throughout the
United States. During 1993, 1992, and 1991, SMC acquired the rights to service
approximately $147.0 million, $84.0 million, and $239.3 million of mortgage
loans at a cost of approximately $1.8 million, $595,000, and $2.1 million,
respectively.

SMC was servicing loans for others of $908.9 million, $840.5 million and $829
million at December 31, 1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

For the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, SMC paid JSB $42,000 and
$180,000, respectively, in management and other fees to compensate JSB for
direct and indirect expenditures JSB incurred on behalf of SMC during the year.
In addition, $238,000 and $302,000 for charges in-lieu of federal income taxes
were assessed by JSB to SMC during 1993 and 1992, respectively. The charge to
SMC represents 34% of SMC's federally taxable net income and was made under the
provisions of a tax-sharing agreement between the two entities.

A The carrying amount consists of approximately $34.8 million in adjustable-
rate and $12.3 million in fixed-rate residential mortgage loans. The
discount rate used to determine fair value was selected based on loans of
similar type, repricing schedule (where applicable) and remaining maturity.
B The carrying amount includes approximately $5.6 million in credit card
receivables. The fair market value of credit card receivables was determined
using quoted prices offered in an active secondary market.
C SFAS No. 107 defines the estimated fair value of deposits with no stated
maturity, such as demand deposits, savings, NOW and money market demand
accounts, to be equal to the amount payable on demand (i.e., their carrying
amounts).
D Other borrowed funds include $15.2 million of advances subject to daily
repricing. SFAS No. 107 defines the estimated fair value of borrowed funds
repricing within 90 days as equal to the carrying value.

F-24
<PAGE>

The estimation methods, approaches and significant assumptions used in
determining the fair market values of each category of financial instrument are
as follows:

Cash and Due From Banks

The recorded book balance approximates fair value due to the due on demand
nature of these financial instruments.

Investment and Mortgage-backed Securities

Investment and mortgage-backed securities, of the type held by JSB, are
actively traded in a secondary market and have been valued using quoted market
prices.

Loans Receivable

For certain homogeneous categories of loans, such as residential mortgages
and credit card receivables, fair market value is estimated by using quoted
market prices for similar loans or securities backed by similar loans, adjusted
for differences in loan characteristics, if any. The fair value of other types
of loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current
rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit
ratings and maturities.

Fair market values for residential mortgages available for sale are
determined using sales commitments to permanent investors or current market
rate for loans of similar quality.

Non-performing Loans

Estimated fair market value represents the net realizable value of the loan
collateral including an allowance for credit risk based upon JSB's historical
credit loss experience and disposition costs for similar assets. Fair market
value is based upon either appraisals obtained from independent sources or upon
JSB's determination of fair market value based upon the capitalization of
current and estimated future cash flows from the collateral property.

FHLB Stock

FHLB stock is not actively traded on a secondary market. FHLB stock is held
exclusively by financial institutions that are members of the Federal Home Loan
Bank system. The stock is generally redeemable at par. Accordingly, the fair
market value of the FHLB stock approximates the carrying value.

Accrued Interest Receivable

The fair market value of accrued interest receivable approximates the
carrying value.

Deposit Liabilities

SFAS No. 107 defines the estimated fair value of deposits with no stated
maturity, which includes demand deposits and money market and other savings
accounts, to be equal to the amount payable on demand. Although market premiums
paid for depository institutions reflect an additional value for these low-cost
deposits, SFAS No. 107 prohibits adjusting fair value for any value expected to
be derived from retaining those deposits for a future period of time or from
the benefit that results from ability to fund interest-earning assets with
these deposit liabilities. The fair value of fixed-maturity deposits is
estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current market rates
offered in active secondary markets for advances with similar terms and
remaining maturities.

F-25
<PAGE>

Accrued Interest Payable

The fair market value of accrued interest payable approximates the carrying
value.

Other Borrowings and FHLB Advances

The fair market value of other borrowed funds and advances is estimated by
discounting the future cash flows using the current market rates offered in
active secondary markets for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities.

Off-Balance-Sheet Financial Instruments

JSB's off-balance-sheet financial instruments are primarily commitments to
extend credit, commitments to fund residential mortgages and commitments to
purchase MBS. The commitments to fund residential mortgages and to purchase MBS
were made proximate to December 31, 1993, at the prevailing market rates and/or
prices. Accordingly, the committed funding amount for residential mortgages and
the committed purchase price for MBS approximates the fair market value of
those financial instruments at December 31, 1993. Commitments to extend credit
generally are not sold or traded, and estimated fair values are not readily
available. For a further discussion of JSB's off-balance-sheet financial
instruments, see Note 12, Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet and
Credit Risk.

NOTE 16: PURCHASED MORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS

At December 31, 1993, SMC serviced $908.9 million in loans for others.
Servicing rights are acquired through both purchases and loan origination
activities. Direct acquisition expenses for purchased servicing rights are
capitalized and amortized over the estimated economic life of the related
servicing asset. The following is an analysis of the changes in purchased
mortgage loan servicing rights asset balances for the years ended 1993, 1992
and 1991 (in thousands):

NOTE 17: LEASE COMMITMENTS

At December 31, 1993, JSB had entered into four operating lease agreements
for office and branch facility space which will expire at various times from
December 1995 to December 2014. JSB recognized $212,000, $153,000 and $140,000
of rent expense in 1993, 1992 and 1991, respectively. The minimum lease
payments for the years subsequent to 1993 are as follows (in thousands):

NOTE 18: ACQUISITION BY USBANCORP, INC.

On January 18, 1994, Johnstown Savings Bank and USBANCORP, Inc. (USBANCORP)
jointly announced that they had reached agreement on revised terms to the
definitive agreement pursuant to which JSB would merge with United States
National Bank in Johnstown, one of USBANCORP's banking subsidiaries. The
definitive agreement was signed by the parties on November 10, 1993.

JSB has the right to terminate the amended agreement in the event that the
average closing price of USBANCORP common stock for the ten trading days
immediately preceding the closing is less than $20.50 per share. USBANCORP
common stock is traded on the NASDAQ National Market System.

At the time the amendment was signed by the parties, financial advisors for
each party provided a written opinion to the Boards of Directors of JSB and
USBANCORP that the revised merger consideration set forth in the amendment is
fair from a financial point of view to USBANCORP and the stockholders of JSB.

The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and to the approvals of
the stockholders of JSB and USBANCORP.
