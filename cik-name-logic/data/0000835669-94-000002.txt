Item 5. Other Events

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued
Financial Accounting Standard No. 115 (FASB-115), "Accounting for
Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993. The Company
intends to apply FASB-115 to its financial statements for its
December 31, 1993 fiscal year end.

Until December 15, 1993, the Company had been applying Emerging
Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 89-4 "Accounting for a
Purchased Investment in a Collateralized Mortgage Obligation
Instrument or in a Mortgage-Backed Interest-Only Certificate" in
its quarterly valuation of its Mortgage Derivative Securities. 
EITF 89-4 requires a valuation adjustment when, under market based
assumptions as to future mortgage prepayment speeds and interest
rate levels, the nominal cash flows expected from a Mortgage
Derivative Security asset are less than the current carrying value
of the asset. 

FASB-115 requires that impaired investments be carried at fair
market value. The EITF has tentatively concluded that an
impairment has occurred if the future cash flows, discounted at a
risk free rate (the yield associated with a U.S. Treasury Security
with a maturity approximating the average life of the future cash
flows from the Company's portfolio of investments), are less than
the investment's carrying value. After consideration of the
alternative, the Company has determined to adopt FASB-115 as of
December 31, 1993 instead of waiting until 1994. The application
of FASB-115 will cause the Company to reduce the carrying value of
its Mortgage Derivative Securities to their estimated fair market
value at December 31, 1993. Based on preliminary calculations, the
Company estimates the write down to be in an approximate amount of
$7-8 million, which will result in a reduction of shareholders'
equity as of December 31, 1993 to a range of $5.7 to $6.7 million.
