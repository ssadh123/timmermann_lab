and not jointly, at a purchase price of 98.881% of the principal amount
thereof plus accrued interest from March 1, 1994 to the Closing Date (as
hereinafter defined), the respective principal amounts of Purchased Bonds
set forth opposite the names of the Underwriters in the Prospectus

thereof by the Underwriters shall be made on the basis of the
representations, warranties, and agreements contained in the Underwriting
Agreement (the "Underwriting Agreement"), dated August 3, 1993, relating to
the issuance and sale of up to $400,000,000 of the Company's First Mortgage

Such purchase price will be deemed to have been received by the Company upon
the Company's receipt of the Fed Wire reference number relating to such
transfer of funds. On March 3, 1994, the Company will pay to the
Underwriters, by means of transfer of funds by Fed Wire to a bank account
designated by the Underwriters, interest on the purchase price for one day
at the March 2, 1994 Fed Funds Effective Rate. Closing shall occur at the
office of the Company, 400 North Fifth Street, Phoenix, Arizona, at 8:00
