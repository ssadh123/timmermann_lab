INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT

Item 5. Other Events

On January 21, 1994, a judgment was entered by the Superior Court of
the State of California, County of Los Angeles, in favor of Amoco Chemical
Company and Amoco Reinforced Plastics Company, subsidiaries of Amoco Company
and Amoco Corporation, against certain underwriters at Lloyd's of London and
various other British and European insurance carriers, in AMOCO CHEMICAL
COMPANY, et al, vs. CERTAIN UNDERWRITERS AT LLOYD'S OF LONDON, et al. In
that case Amoco alleged that the defendant insurers wrongfully refused to
pay for the defense and settlement of product liability lawsuits arising
from Amoco Reinforced Plastics Company's manufacture of irrigation and sewer
pipe in the 1970's. Judgment was entered for $36,120,129.20 in compensatory
damages and $376,545,097.64 in punitive damages. The judgment is slightly
lower than the jury verdicts that were previously reported by Amoco
Corporation.

The judgment is subject to appeal by the defendants. Accordingly, it
is impossible at this time to predict the ultimate outcome of this case or
its impact, if any, on the financial position, results of operations, and
cash flows of Amoco Company.
