Report of Independent Auditors

Shareholder and Board of Directors
Summers Group, Inc.

We have audited the balance sheets of Summers Group, Inc. as of December 31,
1992, 1991, and 1990, and the related statements of income, shareholder's
equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December
31, 1992. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Summers Group, Inc. at
December 31, 1992, 1991, and 1990, and the results of its operations and its
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1992,
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ORGANIZATION

Summers Group, Inc. (Summers or the Company), a Delaware corporation, is a
wholly owned subsidiary of SGDHC, Inc. (SGDHC) and an indirect, wholly owned
subsidiary of BTR Dunlop, Inc. (the Parent), a company incorporated in the
United States. The Parent is an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of BTR plc
(BTR), a company incorporated in the United Kingdom. The Company has
significant transactions with SGDHC, the Parent, BTR, and their affiliates,
which transactions are recorded on the bases determined by the parties (Notes 2
and 4).

The Company is a wholesale distributor selling electrical equipment and
supplies to commercial building contractors, public utilities and industrial
companies in various locations in the United States and operating under
numerous trade names.

Prior to January 1, 1990, the operations of the Company were conducted by
Summers Electric Company (and its wholly owned subsidiary, Summers Electric of
Oklahoma), Glasco Electric Company, and ESD (collectively referred to hereafter
as the Predecessor Companies). Each of the Predecessor Companies was a wholly
owned subsidiary of SGDHC. Effective January 1, 1990, the Company was formed
and issued, in the aggregate, 9,040 shares of its common stock to the
Predecessor Companies in exchange for the net operating assets of the
Predecessor Companies and 960 shares to Summers Electric of Oklahoma in
exchange for its net assets. Effective December 31, 1990, each of the
Predecessor Companies was liquidated into SGDHC and Summers Electric of
Oklahoma was liquidated into the Company. As a result of these transactions,
at December 31, 1990, SGDHC held 9,040 shares of the Company's common stock and
the remaining 960 shares, previously held by Summers Electric of Oklahoma, were
held in treasury by the Company. In March 1991, the treasury shares were
canceled and the Company issued 960 new shares of its common stock to SGDHC.
Accordingly, subsequent to March 1991, all 10,000 shares of the Company's
common stock are held by SGDHC.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

Accounts receivable represent amounts due from customers related to the sale of
electrical equipment and supplies. Credit is extended based upon an evaluation
of the customer's financial condition, and generally, collateral is not
required. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable
are limited because of the large number of customers in the Company's customer
base and their dispersion across geographic areas. The Company provides
allowances for potentially uncollectible accounts and cash discounts expected
to be taken by its customers.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

1. ORGANIZATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

INVENTORIES

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost being
determined on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis. For purposes of the LIFO
calculation, the current cost of the Company's inventories is measured by
invoice cost less allowances for cash and volume purchase discounts earned.
Replacement cost exceeded the carrying value of the Company's inventories by
$8,897,000, $9,607,000, and $10,669,000 at December 31, 1992, 1991, and 1990,
respectively.

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Additions to and major improvements of property, plant, and
equipment are capitalized. Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as
incurred. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of the
assets and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
and any gain or loss is reflected in other income for the period. Net gains on
disposals of property, plant and equipment included in other income totaled
$1,086,000 and $636,000 in 1992 and 1991, respectively.

Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful
lives of the Company's assets (20 to 30 years for buildings, 5 to 10 years for
computer equipment and software, and 5 to 10 years for fixtures and equipment).
Amortization of leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lives of
the respective leases or the estimated useful lives of the improvements.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and noncompete agreements and
are amortized on a straight-line basis over terms that do not exceed 40 years.

INCOME TAXES

Income tax expense is provided on transactions recognized for financial
reporting purposes regardless of when such items are reported for tax purposes.
Deferred taxes are provided for the tax effects of timing differences between
financial statement reporting and income tax reporting of certain income and
expense items.

2. RELATED PARTIES

The Company is involved in a combined cash management program with other BTR
subsidiaries located in the United States. The amounts due (to) from
affiliates under these arrangements were ($8,151,000), ($11,777,000), and
$15,414,000 at December 31, 1992, 1991, and 1990, respectively. The advances
due (to) from affiliates fluctuate based upon the cash inflows and requirements
of the Company, but are repayable upon demand and do not bear interest.

In 1991, the Company distributed $35 million to SGDHC. This distribution was
recorded by increasing the balance of the Company's advances payable to
affiliate and, at the instruction of the Parent, represented a $17 million
dividend and a $18 million return of capital charged against the additional
paid-in capital of the Company.

The parent company charge represents an allocation of various costs from the
Parent and BTR.

3. PROPERTY, PLAN, AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant, and equipment costs of the following:

Less accumulated depreciation
and amortization 15,969 15,262 12,766
$19,139 $19,230 $15,710

4. INCOME TAXES

The Company's operations are included in the consolidated federal income tax
return of the BTR Dunlop Holdings, Inc. (Holdings), a U.S. corporation that is
the immediate parent company of the Parent. The Company's federal tax
provisions are

<PAGE>
Summers Group, Inc.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

4. INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED)

computed as though the Company were filing separate returns utilizing the tax
elections made by Holdings and in accordance with the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 11, "Accounting for Income Taxes." An amount
equal to the provision as computed is remitted to the Parent annually through
intercompany advances.

The provision for income taxes includes the following components:

[CAPTION]
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31
1992 1991 1990
(In Thousands)

[S] [C] [C] [C]
Current $2,646 $3,774 $5,145
Deferred 847 908 321
$3,493 $4,682 $5,466

The recorded tax provisions exceed the amounts resulting from the
multiplication of consolidated income before income taxes by the 34% statutory
federal income tax rate primarily due to state income taxes.

The deferred tax provision is attributable primarily to excess tax over book
depreciation and amortization of the Company's fixed assets. The tax effects
of such differences were $742,000, $404,000, and $273,000 in 1992, 1991, and
1990, respectively.

In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes,"
which the Company will be required to adopt as of January 1, 1993. SFAS No.
109 requires a change from the deferred to the liability method of computing
income taxes. Under the liability method, deferred taxes are provided on
differences in the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and
tax reporting purposes and are adjusted for enacted changes in tax rates and
laws. The Company has not yet implemented SFAS No. 109, and the impact of
adoption, if any, on the Company's financial statements has not been
determined.

5. CAPITALIZED LEASE OBLIGATIONS

The Company leases certain buildings under capital leases that expire at
various dates through 2003. The present value of the Company's obligations
under capital lease arrangements, based upon imputed interest rates ranging
from 8.0% to 10.2%,

<PAGE>
Summers Group, Inc.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

5. CAPITALIZED LEASE OBLIGATIONS (CONTINUED)

aggregated $531,000, $630,000, and $225,000 at December 31, 1992, 1991, and
1990, respectively. The carrying value of buildings held under capital lease
arrangements and included in the Company's balance sheet aggregated $519,000,
$576,000, and $139,000 at December 31, 1992, 1991, and 1990, respectively.

6. OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS

The Company leases its corporate office and most of its branch warehouse
operational space under noncancelable operating leases. In addition, the
Company leases certain transportation, computer, and office equipment. Rental
expense under operating leases was $3,217,000, $3,330,000, and $3,338,000 in
1992, 1991, and 1990, respectively.

Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases, including
certain leases for properties abandoned by the Company, as of December 31,
1992, are as follows (in thousands):

1993 $ 3,199
1994 2,416
1995 1,853
1996 1,222
1997 1,106
Thereafter 3,230
$13,026

When a property is vacated or abandoned by the Company prior to the expiration
of its lease term, the present value of future minimum lease payments is
accrued in the period of abandonment. Accruals for abandoned leases are
included in other noncurrent liabilities and totaled $1,255,000, $1,335,000,
and $1,434,000 at December 31, 1992, 1991, and 1990, respectively.

7. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

RETIREMENT AND SAVINGS PLAN

The Company has a retirement and savings plan (the Plan). All full-time
employees with at least one year of qualifying continuous service are eligible
to participate in the Plan. Participating employees are permitted to make
voluntary contributions to the Plan on a pretax salary reduction basis in
accordance with the provisions of Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Under the provisions of the Plan, the Company matches 50% of the employees'
contributions,

<PAGE>
Summers Group, Inc.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued)

7. EMPLOYEES BENEFITS (CONTINUED)

up to 3% of each employee's compensation. Company matching contributions to
the Plan were $1,161,000, $1,183,000, and $1,024,000 in 1992, 1991, and 1990,
respectively.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

In December 1990, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 106,
"Employer's Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," which
the Company will be required to implement in 1993. SFAS No. 106 requires
recognition of a liability for postretirement benefits as the employees render
service. While the Company has not yet completed the analysis required to
calculate the impact of adoption of SFAS No. 106, it does not believe that such
adoption will have a material impact on the Company's future financial position
or results of operations.

8. ACQUISITIONS

On September 25, 1992, the Company acquired the inventory, trade accounts
receivable, and fixed assets of Sterett Supply, Inc., which operates electrical
and utility supply houses throughout south Central Texas. The total
consideration paid was $3,577,000. The acquisition was recorded as a purchase,
and the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets
acquired ($861,000) has been recorded as goodwill and is being amortized on a
straight-line basis over 40 years.

On March 27, 1990, the Company acquired the inventory, trade accounts
receivable, and fixed assets of Southern Electric, which operates electrical
supply houses throughout northwest Arkansas. The total consideration paid was
$4,209,000. The acquisition was recorded as a purchase, and the excess of
purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired ($373,000)
has been recorded as goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-line basis
over 40 years.

On December 1, 1990, the Company acquired the inventory, fixed assets, and
certain trade accounts receivable of Cummins Supply, Inc., which operates
electrical and utility supply houses throughout Texas. The total consideration
paid was $13,573,000. The acquisition was recorded as a purchase, and the
excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired
($5,132,000) has been recorded as goodwill and is being amortized on a straight-
line basis over 40 years.

9. CONTINGENCIES

In March 1993, a competitor filed suit against the Company and one of the
Predecessor Companies (collectively Companies) in the District Court in Dallas
County, Texas. The suit asserts that the Companies interfered with existing
contracts, prospective contracts, and business relations of the competitor,
which prevented the competitor from becoming an authorized distributor for a
supplier. The competitor is seeking $2,057,000 in actual damages and
$15,000,000 in punitive damages, and the trial is currently scheduled for
January 24, 1994. The Company, after consultation with legal counsel, believes
that the suit is without merit and is vigorously defending its position.
Certain other claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of
the Company's business are pending against the Company. Management believes
that neither the aforementioned suit nor these other claims or lawsuits,
individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the
Company's financial position or results of operations; therefore, no provision
has been recorded in the financial statements.
