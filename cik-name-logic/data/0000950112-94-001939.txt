<PAGE>

outstanding, together with the aggregate face amount of Commercial Paper

---------------------------
Borrowing shall be made upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, given by the
Borrower to the Administrative Agent not later than (i) 9:30 A.M. (New York City

event such Short-Term Loan Borrowing is to be comprised of Base Rate Loans, and
(ii) 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the date
of the proposed Short-Term Loan Borrowing, in the event such Short-Term Loan
Borrowing is to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Loans.

(b) The Administrative Agent shall give to each Bank prompt notice
(but in any event on the same day) of its receipt of a Notice of Borrowing in
respect of Short-Term Loans and, if Eurodollar Rate Loans are properly requested

-23-

<PAGE>

in such Notice of Borrowing, upon its determination thereof, notice of the
applicable interest rate under Section 5.3(b). Each Bank shall, before 11:00
A.M. (or in the case of a Short-Term Loan Borrowing being made on the same day,
before 12:00 noon) (New York City time) on the date of the proposed Short-Term
Loan Borrowing, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office
to the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in Section 13.2, in
immediately available funds, such Bank's Ratable Portion of such proposed Short-
Term Loan Borrowing. After the Administrative Agent's receipt of such funds and
upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article VI, the
Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower at the
Administrative Agent's aforesaid address.

(c) Each Short-Term Loan Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.2 shall
be in an aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000 or an integral multiple of
$5,000,000 in excess thereof.

(d) Each Notice of Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.2 shall be
irrevocable and binding on the Borrower. In the case of any proposed Short-Term
Loan Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the Borrower shall indemnify
each Bank against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Bank as a result of
any failure to fulfill on or before the date specified in such Notice of
Borrowing for such proposed Borrowing the applicable conditions set forth in
Article VI, including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of the
margin payable in accordance with Section 5.2 on the amount of principal not
borrowed as a result of such failure), cost or expense incurred by reason of the
liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Bank to
fund any Eurodollar Rate Loan to be made by such Bank as part of such proposed
Short-Term Loan Borrowing when such Eurodollar Rate Loan, as a result of such
failure, is not made on such date.

(e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Bank prior to the date of any proposed Short-Term Loan Borrowing pursuant to
this Section 2.2 that such Bank will not make available to the Administrative
Agent such Bank's Ratable Portion of such Short-Term Loan Borrowing, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such Ratable Portion
available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such Short-Term Loan
Borrowing in accordance with this Section 2.2 and the Administrative Agent may,
in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent that such Bank 

-24-

<PAGE>

shall not have so made such Ratable Portion available to the Administrative
Agent and the Administrative Agent has so made available such amount, such Bank
and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith
on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon, for each day
from the date such amount is made available to the Borrower until the date such
amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of the
Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to the Short-Term Loans
comprising such Short-Term Loan Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the
Federal Funds Rate. If such Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent such
corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's Short-
Term Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. If the
Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such
payment shall not relieve such Bank of any obligation it may have to the
Borrower hereunder.

(f) The failure of any Bank to make the Short-Term Loan to be made by
it as part of any Short-Term Loan Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.2 shall
not relieve any other Bank of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its
Short-Term Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Bank shall be responsible
for the failure of any other Bank to make the Short-Term Loan to be made by such
other Bank on the date of any such Short-Term Loan Borrowing.

-------- -------
reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000 or an

(ii) effect a Capital Market Transaction, then (a) the Short-Term Loan
Commitment of each Bank shall be automatically reduced by an amount equal to

Market Transaction, up to an aggregate of $2.5 billion for all Banks; provided,
--------
however, that:
- - -------

(x) no such reduction of any Short-Term Loan Commitment shall be
required for a period of 12 months from the related sale date in respect of
Net Cash 

-25-

<PAGE>

Proceeds from the sale of those publishing assets identified on

required for a period of 12 months from the related sale date in respect of
other Net Cash Proceeds in an aggregate amount of (A) up to $100 million,
plus (B) after the aggregate Short-Term Loan Commitments have been reduced
----

Cash Proceeds plus (C) after the aggregate Short-Term Loan Commitments have
----
been reduced to $1.5 billion, up to an additional $250 million of Net Cash
Proceeds received in excess of amounts previously or subsequently applied
under (A) and (B) if at the time of receipt thereof the Total Leverage
Ratio is equal to or less than 6.50x. 

In the event that Net Cash Proceeds are not reinvested (or a purchase agreement
has not been executed) in the 12-month period provided above, the Short-Term
Loan Commitment of each Bank shall be reduced by such Bank's Ratable Portion of
any Net Cash Proceeds referred to in clause (x) or (y) above (i) in respect of
which no such reduction shall previously have occurred and (ii) which have not
been reinvested (and no purchase agreement in respect of such reinvestment has
been executed) on or prior to such date, provided, however, for purposes of this
-------- -------
Section 2.3(b), reinvestment of Net Cash Proceeds within the 12 month period
provided above shall be deemed to include assets purchased after the date hereof
but within six months prior to the transactions which produced such Net Cash
Proceeds. After the Short-Term Loan Commitments have been reduced to $0 and all
Short-Term Loans have been repaid, no mandatory reductions of any Commitment
shall be required from such Net Cash Proceeds.

(c) Payment of Commitment Fee. Simultaneously with any termination
-------------------------
or reduction of the Short-Term Loan Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.3,
the Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank
the applicable Commitment Fee, if any, on the amount of the Short-Term Loan
Commitments so terminated or reduced and owed to such Bank through the date of

principal amount of the prepayment, and if such notice is given the Borrower
shall, prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Short-Term Loans, in whole
or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the date of such
prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that the Borrower
-------- -------
shall indemnify the Banks pursuant to Section 13.4(c) in the event that any
prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made on a day other than the
last day of an Interest Period for such Loans; and provided further, however,
-------- ------- -------
that each partial prepayment permitted under this Section 2.5 shall be in an
aggregate amount of not less than $5,000,000 or integral multiples of $1,000,000
in excess thereof.

Short-Term Loans outstanding will not at any time exceed the Short-Term Loan
Commitments of the Banks, and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Revolving Loans
and Short-Term Loans outstanding, together with the aggregate face amount of
Commercial Paper outstanding, will not at any time exceed the aggregate amount
of the Short-Term Loan Commitments and Revolving Loan Commitments of the Banks. 
Any prepayments required to assure that the aggregate unused amount of the
Short-Term Loan Commitments and the Revolving Loan Commitments is not less than
the face amount of outstanding Commercial Paper shall be applied first to the
Revolving Loans and then to the Short-Term Loans.

------------------------
Loan Commitment Termination Date that the Borrower prepays in full any
Subsidiary Loans (as defined in the Subsidiary Facility) to an MSub under the

Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, to convert an
outstanding portion of the Short-Term Loans to additional Term Loans in an
amount equal to the principal amount of such Subsidiary Loans (as defined in the
Subsidiary Facility) being prepaid. Such conversion shall be made ratably among
the respective outstanding Short-Term Loans of the Banks and shall be effective
simultaneously with the prepayment of the relevant MSub Loans. The Term Loans
resulting from such conversion shall for all purposes be treated as outstanding
Term Loans hereunder, provided, however, that the principal amount of such
-------- -------
resulting Term Loans shall be payable in quarterly installments on January 1,
April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing 

-27-

Agent may assume that such Bank has made such Ratable Portion available to the
Administrative Agent on the date of such Revolving Loan Borrowing in accordance
with this Section 3.2 and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. 
If and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such Ratable Portion
available to the 

-30-

<PAGE>

Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent has so made available such
amount, such Bank and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to
the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent,
at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to
the Revolving Loan comprising such Revolving Loan Borrowing and (ii) in the case
of such Bank, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Bank shall repay to the
Administrative Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall
constitute such Bank's Revolving Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of
this Agreement. If the Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent such
corresponding amount, such payment shall not relieve such Bank of any obligation
it may have to the Borrower hereunder.

(f) The failure of any Bank to make the Revolving Loan to be made by
it as part of any Revolving Loan Borrowing pursuant to this Section 3.2 shall
not relieve any other Bank of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its
Revolving Loan on the date of such Borrowing, but no Bank shall be responsible
for the failure of any other Bank to make the Revolving Loan to be made by such
other Bank on the date of any such Revolving Loan Borrowing.

3.3. Termination/Reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments. (a) 
-------------------------------------------------------
Scheduled Reductions. The Revolving Loan Commitment of each Bank shall be
- - --------------------
automatically reduced on each date specified in column (x) below (each such
date, a "Scheduled Revolving Loan Commitment Reduction Date") by an amount equal
to such Bank's Ratable Portion of the amount specified in column (y) below
opposite such date:

-------------------
least three Business Days' prior notice to the Administrative Agent, to
terminate in whole or permanently reduce ratably in part the unused portions of
the respective Revolving Loan Commitments of the Banks; provided, however, that
-------- -------
each partial reduction shall be in the aggregate amount of not less than
$5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $5,000,000 in excess thereof; and provided
--- --------
further, however, that if any such optional reduction of the Revolving Loan
- - ------- -------
Commitment that is made at the Borrower's option as a result of the receipt by
the Borrower of Net Cash Proceeds of asset sales or Capital Market Transactions
shall be made (a) 50% in order of scheduled commitment reductions, and (b) 50%
pro rata among all remaining scheduled commitment reductions applicable to the
Revolving Loan Commitment; except as provided in the second proviso above,
optional reductions may be allocated against Scheduled Revolving Loan Commitment
Reduction Dates in any manner requested by the Borrower.

(c) Payment of Commitment Fee. Simultaneously with any termination
-------------------------
or reduction of the Revolving Loan Commitments pursuant to this Section 3.3, the
Borrower shall pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Bank the
applicable Commitment Fee, if any, on the amount of the Revolving Loan
Commitments so terminated or reduced and owed to such Bank through the date of
such termination or reduction.

3.4. Repayment of the Revolving Loan. The Borrower shall repay the
-------------------------------
outstanding principal amount of the Revolving Loan (together with all accrued
but unpaid interest thereon) in full on the Commitment Termination Date.

3.5. Optional Prepayments of the Revolving Loan. The Borrower may,
------------------------------------------
upon at least three Business Days' prior notice (or at least one Business Day's
prior notice in the case of Base Rate Loans), to the Administrative Agent
stating the proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and
if such notice is given the Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal
amount of the Revolving Loan comprising a part of the same Revolving Loan
Borrowing, in whole or ratably in part, together with accrued interest to the
date of such prepayment on the principal amount prepaid; provided, however, that
-------- -------
the Borrower shall indemnify the Banks pursuant to Section 13.4(c) in the event
that any prepayment of any Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made on a day other
than the last day of an Interest Period for such Loans; and provided further,
-------- -------
however, that each partial prepayment permitted under this 
- - -------

-32-

<PAGE>

Section 3.5 shall be in an aggregate amount not less than $5,000,000 or integral
multiples of $1,000,000 in excess thereof.

3.6. Mandatory Prepayment. The Borrower shall prepay Revolving Loans
--------------------
to the extent necessary to ensure that (i) the aggregate amount of all Revolving
Loans outstanding will not at any time exceed the Revolving Loan Commitments of
the Banks and (ii) the aggregate amount of all Revolving Loans and Short-Term
Loans outstanding, together with the aggregate face amount of Commercial Paper
outstanding, will not at any time exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving
Loan Commitments and the Short-Term Loan Commitments of the Banks. Any
prepayments required to assure that the aggregate unused amount of the Short-
Term Loan Commitments and the Revolving Loan Commitments is not less than the
face amount of outstanding Commercial Paper shall be applied first to the
Revolving Loans and then to the Short-Term Loans.

ARTICLE IV

THE TERM LOANS

4.1. The Term Loans. (a) The Term Loans. On the terms and subject
-------------- --------------
to the conditions contained in this Agreement, each Bank severally agrees to
make a Term Loan to the Borrower on the Initial Funding Date in an amount not to
exceed the amount set forth opposite such Bank's name on Schedule II as its
"Term Loan Commitment" (as adjusted from time to time by reason of assignments
in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.7 and as such amount may be
reduced pursuant to Section 4.3, such Bank's "Term Loan Commitment").

(b) Evidence of Debt. (i) Each Bank shall maintain in accordance
----------------
with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the Indebtedness to
such Bank resulting from the Term Loan made by such Bank to the Borrower,
including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Bank
from time to time hereunder.

(ii) The Register maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to
Section 13.7(g) shall include a "Term Loan contract control account" for each
Bank, in which account shall be recorded (A) the date and amount of any Term
Loan Borrowing hereunder, (B) the amount and type of each Bank's Term Loan
comprising such Borrowing and any Interest Period applicable thereto, (C) the
amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become 

-33-

<PAGE>

due and payable from the Borrower to each Bank with respect to each such Term
Loan hereunder and (D) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative
Agent from the Borrower with respect to such Term Loans hereunder and each
Bank's Ratable Portion thereof.

(iii) The entries made in the Register in respect of Term Loans shall
be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

4.2. Making the Term Loans. (a) The Term Loan Borrowing shall be
---------------------
made upon receipt of a Notice of Borrowing, given by the Borrower to the
Administrative Agent not later than (i) 9:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the
Initial Funding Date, in the event the Term Loan Borrowing is to be comprised of
Base Rate Loans, and (ii) 11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business
Day prior to the Initial Funding Date, in the event the Term Loan Borrowing is
to be comprised of Eurodollar Rate Loans.

(b) The Administrative Agent shall give to each Bank prompt notice
(but in any event on the same day) of its receipt of a Notice of Borrowing in
respect of Term Loans and, if Eurodollar Rate Loans are properly requested in
such Notice of Borrowing, upon its determination thereof, notice of the
applicable interest rate under Section 5.3(b). Each Bank shall, before
11:00 A.M. (or in the case of a Term Loan Borrowing being made on the same day,
before 12:00 noon) (New York City time) on the date of the proposed Term Loan
Borrowing, make available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to
the Administrative Agent at its address referred to in Section 13.2, in
immediately available funds, such Bank's Ratable Portion of such proposed Term
Loan Borrowing. After the Administrative Agent's receipt of such funds and upon
fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in Article VI, the
Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the Borrower at the
Administrative Agent's above-referenced address.

(c) The Notice of Borrowing shall be irrevocable and binding on the
Borrower. In the case of a proposed Term Loan Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar
Rate Loans, the Borrower shall indemnify each Bank against any loss, cost or
expense incurred by such Bank as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before
the date specified in the Notice of Borrowing the applicable conditions set
forth in Article VI, including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of
the margin payable in accordance with Section 5.2 on the amount of principal not
borrowed as a result of such failure), cost or expense incurred by reason of the
liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds 

-34-

<PAGE>

acquired by such Bank to fund the Eurodollar Rate Loan to be made by such Bank
as part of the proposed Term Loan Borrowing when such Eurodollar Rate Loan, as a
result of such failure, is not made on such date.

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a
Bank prior to the date of the proposed Term Loan Borrowing that such Bank will
not make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's Ratable Portion of
the Term Loan Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has
made such Ratable Portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of
the Term Loan Borrowing in accordance with this Section 4.2 and the
Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to
the Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If and to the extent that
such Bank shall not have so made such Ratable Portion available to the
Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent has so made available such
amount, such Bank and the Borrower severally agree to repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available to
the Borrower until the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent,
at (i) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to
the Term Loans comprising the Term Loan Borrowing and (ii) in the case of such
Bank, the Federal Funds Rate. If such Bank shall repay to the Administrative
Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such
Bank's Term Loan as part of such Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. If
the Borrower shall repay to the Administrative Agent such corresponding amount,
such payment shall not relieve such Bank of any obligation it may have to the
Borrower hereunder.

(e) The failure of any Bank to make its Term Loan shall not relieve
any other Bank of its obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Term Loan on the
date of such Borrowing, but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any
other Bank to make the Term Loan to be made by such other Bank.

4.3. Repayment of Term Loans. (a) The principal amount of the Term
-----------------------
Loan of each Bank shall be payable in quarterly installments on January 1,
April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing July 1, 1997, and ending
on July 1, 2002, in an amount equal to such Bank's Ratable Portion of the
quarterly amount set forth in column (y) below opposite the period specified in
column (x) during which such date occurs:

January 1, 1998 through
October 1, 1999 $87,560,000

January 1, 2000 through
October 1, 2000 $109,450,000

January 1, 2001 through
July 1, 2002 $131,340,000
The amounts under (y) shall be adjusted in the amounts and in the manner
required under Section 4.4.

(b) The Borrower shall repay the outstanding principal amount of the
Term Loans (together with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon) in full on
the Commitment Termination Date.

4.4. Optional Prepayments of the Term Loans. The Borrower may, upon
--------------------------------------
at least three Business Days' prior notice (or at least one Business Day's prior
notice in the case of Base Rate Loans) to the Administrative Agent stating the
proposed date and aggregate principal amount of the prepayment, and if such
notice is given the Borrower shall, prepay the outstanding principal amount of
the Term Loans, in whole or in part, together with accrued interest to the date
of such prepayment; provided, however, that the Borrower shall indemnify the
-------- -------
Banks pursuant to Section 13.4(c) in the event that any prepayment of any
Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be made on a day other than the last day of an
Interest Period for such Loans. Amounts borrowed under Section 4.1(a) and
prepaid pursuant to this Section 4.4 may not be reborrowed. Any such prepayment
of the Term Loans that is made at the Borrower's option as a result of the
receipt by the Borrower of Net Cash Proceeds of asset sales or Capital Market
Transactions shall be applied (a) 50% in order of maturity, and (b) 50% pro rata
among all remaining maturities applicable to the Term Loan Commitment; any other
prepayment made at the Borrower's option may be allocated among remaining
maturities in any manner requested by the Borrower.

ARTICLE V

CONVERSION, INTEREST, PAYMENTS, FEES, ETC.

5.1. Conversion/Continuation Option. The Borrower may elect (i) at
------------------------------
any time to convert Base Rate Loans or any portion thereof to Eurodollar Rate
Loans or (ii) at the end of any Interest Period with respect thereto, to convert
Eurodollar Rate Loans or any portion thereof into Base Rate Loans, or to
continue such Eurodollar Rate Loans or any portion thereof as Eurodollar Rate
Loans for an additional Interest Period; provided, however, that the aggregate
-------- -------
of the Eurodollar Rate Loans of the Borrower so converted or so continued for
each Interest Period must be in the amount of $5,000,000 or an integral multiple
of $5,000,000 in excess thereof. Each such election shall be in substantially
the form of Exhibit D hereto (a "Notice of Conversion or Continuation") and
shall be made by giving the Administrative Agent at least one Business Day's, in
the case of a conversion to a Base Rate Loan, and three Business Days', in the
case of a conversion to or a continuation of a Eurodollar Rate Loan, prior
written notice thereof specifying (A) the amount and type of conversion or
continuation, (B) in the case of a conversion to or a continuation of Eurodollar
Rate Loans, the Interest Period therefor, and (C) in the case of a conversion
the date of conversion (which date shall be a Business Day and, if a conversion
from a Eurodollar Rate Loan, shall also be the last day of the Interest Period
therefor). The Administrative Agent shall promptly (but in any event on the
same day) notify each Bank of its receipt of a Notice of Conversion or
Continuation and of the contents thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
conversion in whole or in part of Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Loans, and
no continuation in whole or in part of Eurodollar Rate Loans upon the expiration
of any Interest Period therefor, shall be permitted at any time at which an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. If, within the time
period required under the terms of this Section 5.1, the Administrative Agent
does not receive a Notice of Conversion or Continuation from the Borrower
containing an election to continue all or any portion of the Eurodollar Rate
Loans for an additional Interest Period or to convert all or any portion of such
Loans, then, upon the expiration of the Interest Period therefor, such Loans or
the portions thereof for which an election to continue or convert has not been
made will be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans. Each Notice of
Conversion or Continuation shall be irrevocable.

-37-

<PAGE>

5.2. Interest. The Borrower shall pay interest on the unpaid
--------
principal amount of each Loan from the date thereof until the principal amount
thereof shall be paid in full, at the following rates per annum:

(a) Base Rate Loans. For Base Rate Loans, at a rate per annum equal
---------------
at all times to the Base Rate in effect from time to time, payable
quarterly in arrears on the last day of each September, December, March and
June, on the Commitment Termination Date and on the date any Base Rate Loan
is converted or paid in full.

(b) Eurodollar Rate Loans. For Eurodollar Rate Loans, at a rate per
---------------------
annum equal at all times during the applicable Interest Period for each
Eurodollar Rate Loan to the sum of the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest
Period plus the Applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin, payable in arrears (i)
on the last day of such Interest Period and (ii) if such Interest Period
has a duration of more than three months, on each day during such Interest
Period that occurs every three months from the first day of such Interest
Period.

(c) Default Rate of Interest. If any amount of principal of any Loan
------------------------
is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or
otherwise, the interest rate applicable to any such amount shall be
increased by 2.00% per annum, payable on demand, and if any interest, fee
or other amount payable hereunder is not paid when due, such amount shall
bear interest at a rate per annum equal at all times to the Base Rate in
effect from time to time plus 2% per annum payable on demand.

5.3. Interest Rate Determination and Protection. (a) In the event
------------------------------------------
that the Eurodollar Rate is not available from the Telerate Page, the Eurodollar
Rate for each Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be determined by
the Administrative Agent on the basis of applicable rates furnished to and
received by the Administrative Agent from the Reference Banks two Business Days
before such Interest Period. Each Reference Bank agrees to furnish to the
Administrative Agent timely information for the purpose of determining each
Eurodollar Rate. If any of the Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely
information to the Administrative Agent for the purpose of determining any such
interest rate, the Administrative Agent shall determine such interest rate on
the basis of timely information furnished by the other Reference Bank or
Reference Banks.

-38-

<PAGE>

(b) The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Borrower
and the Banks of the applicable interest rate determined by the Administrative
Agent for purposes of Section 5.2(a) or (b), and the applicable rate, if any,
furnished by each Reference Bank for the purpose of determining the applicable
interest rate under Section 5.2(b).

(c) If, with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans, the Majority Banks
determine in good faith and notify the Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar
Rate for any Interest Period will not adequately reflect the cost to such Banks
of making such Loans or funding or maintaining their respective Eurodollar Rate
Loans for such Interest Period, the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so
notify the Borrower and the Banks, whereupon

(i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan will automatically, on the last day of
the then existing Interest Period therefor, convert into a Base Rate Loan
unless the Majority Banks notify the Administrative Agent that the
circumstances causing such conversion no longer exist and the Borrower
delivers a timely Notice of Conversion or Continuation with respect to such
Loans; and

(ii) the obligations of the Banks to make Eurodollar Rate Loans or to
convert Loans into Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until the
Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower and the Banks that the
circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

5.4. Fees. (a) The Borrower will pay on the last day of each Fiscal
----
Quarter to each of the Banks quarterly in arrears a fee (the "Commitment Fee")
accruing from the tenth Business Day after the Documentation Agent has notified
the Borrower that the Agreement has been executed by the Banks (or such earlier
date on or after the execution hereof as the Merger Date shall have occurred),
in the case of each Bank listed on the signature pages hereof, and from any
later effective date of the assignment pursuant to which it became a Bank, in
the case of each other Bank, until the Commitment Termination Date, on such
Bank's aggregate average daily unused Commitment as in effect from time to time
at the rate set forth below opposite the Credit Rating applicable to the
Borrower on such date:

-39-

<PAGE>

CREDIT RATING COMMITMENT FEE
------------- --------------

A-/A3 or better .1500%
BBB+/Baa1 .2000%
BBB/Baa2 .2250%
BBB-/Baa3 .2500%
BB+/Ba1 .3125%
BB/Ba2 .3750%
BB-/Ba3 or lower .5000%

; provided, however, that if the ratings assigned by S&P and Moody's shall
-------- -------
differ by one level, the Credit Rating shall be the rating which is the higher
level, or if they differ by more than one level, the Credit Rating shall be the
rating that is one rating level immediately above the lower of such ratings. 
Any change in the Credit Rating of the Borrower shall be effective to adjust the
Commitment Fee as of the date such change is announced.

(b) The Borrower has agreed to pay to the Banks, Managing Agents,
Agents, Co-Agents and Arrangers certain other fees which are earned on the date
of the signing of this Agreement and payable on the earlier of (x) the Initial
Funding Date or (y) September 30, 1994,
as separately agreed.

5.5. Increased Costs. (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction of
---------------
or any change (other than any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve
requirements included in the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage) in, or in the
interpretation of, any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance with any
guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the
cost (other than with respect to income, franchise or withholding taxes or other
taxes of a similar nature) to any Bank of agreeing to make or making, funding or
maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loans, then (A) such Bank shall, as soon as such
Bank becomes aware of such increased cost, but in any event not later than 60
days after such increased cost was incurred, deliver to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent a certificate stating (1) the actual amount of such
increased cost incurred by such Bank and (2) that it is such Bank's customary
practice, from and after the date of this Agreement, to charge its borrowers for
increased costs incurred by it; (B) the Borrower shall, within 30 days after its
receipt of such certificate, at its sole option, either (1) pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank amounts sufficient to
compensate such Bank for the increased cost incurred by it as set forth in the
certificate referred to above or (2) replace such Bank in 

-40-

<PAGE>

accordance with the provisions of Section 5.10, provided that if the Borrower
--------
does not exercise the option specified in clause (2) above within 30 days after
receipt of the certificate referred to above, then (x) such Bank shall deliver
to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a second certificate stating the
increased cost incurred by such Bank and (y) the Borrower shall promptly upon
receipt of such second certificate pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of such Bank amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank for such
increased cost; and (C) such Bank shall use its reasonable best efforts to
designate another of its then existing offices as its Applicable Lending Office
if the making of such designation would, without any detrimental effect to such
Bank, avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, future increased costs which
are probable of being incurred by such Bank. The amount of increased costs
payable by the Borrower to any Bank as stated in any such certificate delivered
to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 5.5(a) shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error. In determining any such amount, such Bank may use reasonable averaging
and attribution methods. If the Borrower so notifies the Administrative Agent
within five Business Days after receipt of any certificate delivered to the
Borrower pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.5(a), the Borrower may
either (x) prepay in full all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Bank then
outstanding in accordance with Section 5.8 and, additionally, reimburse such
Bank for such increased cost in accordance with this Section 5.5(a) or
(y) convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of all Banks then outstanding into Base
Rate Loans in accordance with Section 5.1 and, additionally, reimburse such Bank
for such increased cost in accordance with this Section 5.5(a).

(b) If any Bank shall be required under Regulation D to maintain
reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including
Eurocurrency Liabilities, then (i) such Bank shall, within 60 days after the end
of any Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loan during which
such Bank was so required to maintain such reserves, deliver to the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent a certificate stating (A) that such Bank was required
to maintain reserves and as a result such Bank incurred additional costs in
connection with making Eurodollar Rate Loans, (B) in reasonable detail, such
Bank's computations of the amount of additional interest payable by the Borrower
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.5(b)(ii) and (C) that it is such
Bank's customary practice, from and after the date of this Agreement, to charge
its borrowers for reserves so maintained by it, and 

-41-

<PAGE>

(ii) the Borrower shall, promptly upon receipt of any such certificate, pay to
the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Bank, additional interest on
the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate Loan of such Bank
outstanding during the Interest Period with respect to which the
above-referenced certificate was delivered to the Borrower, at a rate per annum
equal to the difference obtained by subtracting (x) the Eurodollar Rate for such
Interest Period from (y) the rate obtained by dividing such Eurodollar Rate by a
percentage equal to 100% minus the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage of such
Bank for such Interest Period. The amount of interest payable by the Borrower
to any Bank as stated in any certificate delivered to the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.5(b) shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

(c) The payments required under Sections 5.5(a) and (b) are in
addition to any other payments and indemnities required under this Agreement.

5.6. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
----------
Agreement, if the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation of
any law or regulation, in each case after the date hereof, shall make it
unlawful, or any central bank or other Governmental Authority shall assert that
it is unlawful, for any Bank or its Eurodollar Lending Office to make Eurodollar
Rate Loans or to continue to fund or maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans, then, on
notice thereof and demand therefor by such Bank to the Borrower through the
Administrative Agent, (i) the obligation of such Bank to make or to continue
Eurodollar Rate Loans and to convert Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Rate Loans
shall be suspended until such Bank through the Administrative Agent shall notify
the Borrower that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist and
(ii) the Borrower shall forthwith prepay in full all Eurodollar Rate Loans of
such Bank then outstanding, together with interest accrued thereon, unless the
Borrower, within five Business Days of such notice and demand, converts all
Eurodollar Rate Loans of all Banks then outstanding into Base Rate Loans in
accordance with the notice periods of Section 5.1; provided, however, that
-------- -------
before making any such demand, each Bank agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts to designate another of its then existing offices as its Applicable
Lending Office if the making of such a designation would, without any
detrimental effect to such Bank, cause the making of Eurodollar Rate Loans to
not be subject to this Section 5.6.

-42-

<PAGE>

5.7. Capital Adequacy. If any Bank shall, at any time, reasonably
----------------
determine that (a) the adoption (i) after the date of this Agreement, of any
capital adequacy guidelines or (ii) at any time, of any other applicable law,
government rule, regulation or order regarding capital adequacy of banks or bank
holding companies, (b) any change in (i) any of the foregoing or (ii) the
interpretation or administration of any of the foregoing by any Governmental
Authority, central bank or comparable agency or (c) compliance with any policy,
guideline, directive or request regarding capital adequacy (whether or not
having the force of law and whether or not failure to comply therewith would be
unlawful) of any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency,
would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Bank
to a level below that which such Bank could have achieved but for such adoption,
change or compliance (taking into consideration the policies of such Bank with
respect to capital adequacy in effect immediately before such adoption, change
or compliance) and (x) such reduction is as a consequence of the Commitment of,
or the making, converting or continuing of any Loans by, such Bank hereunder and
(y) such reduction is reasonably deemed by such Bank to be material, then
(1) such Bank shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent a
certificate stating the reduction in the rate of return such Bank will in the
future suffer as a result of its Commitment or the making, converting or
continuing any Loans by it to the Borrower hereunder and (2) the Borrower shall,
within 30 days after its receipt of such certificate, at its sole option, either
(A) pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank from time to
time as specified by such Bank such amount as shall be sufficient to compensate
such Bank for such reduced return, or (B) replace such Bank in accordance with
the provisions of Section 5.10; provided, however, that if the Borrower does not
-------- -------
exercise the option specified in clause (B) above within 30 days after receipt
of the certificate referred to above, then (1) such Bank shall deliver to the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent a second certificate stating the reduction
in the rate of return of such Bank and (2) the Borrower shall promptly pay, as
specified by such Bank, to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank
amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank for the reduction in its rate of
return. The amount stated in any certificate delivered to the Borrower pursuant
to the provisions of this Section 5.7 shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error. In determining any such amount, such Bank may

<PAGE>

5.8. Payments and Computations. (a) The Borrower shall make each
-------------------------
payment payable by it hereunder not later than 11:00 A.M. (New York City time)
on the day when due, in Dollars, to the Administrative Agent at its address
referred to in Section 13.2 in immediately available funds without set-off or
counterclaim. The Administrative Agent will promptly thereafter (but in any
event on the same day) cause to be distributed like funds relating to the
payment of principal or interest or fees ratably (other than amounts payable
pursuant to Section 5.5, 5.6 or 5.7) to the Banks for the account of their
respective Applicable Lending Offices, and like funds relating to the payment of
any other amount payable to any Bank to such Bank for the account of its
Applicable Lending Office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. Payment received by the Administrative Agent after
11:00 A.M. (New York City time) shall be deemed to be received on the next
Business Day; provided, however, that the Administrative Agent shall use its
-------- -------
reasonable best efforts to invest any amounts so received by the Administrative
Agent in overnight investments satisfactory to the Borrower, and any earnings on
any such investments shall be for the Borrower's account and may be credited
against any interest payable hereunder during such period.

(b) All computations of the Commitment Fee or of interest based on
the rate of interest specified in clause (a) of the definition of Base Rate and
of fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 365
or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest based on the
Eurodollar Rate or the Federal Funds Rate shall be made by the Administrative
Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the actual number of
days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the
period for which such interest and fees are payable. All computations of the
Commitment Fee shall be based on the aggregate average daily unused Commitment
of each Bank. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest
rate hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error.

(c) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day
other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding
Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the
computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case may be.

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Banks
hereunder that the Borrower 

-44-

<PAGE>

will not make such payment in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that the
Borrower has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date
and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be
distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then due
such Bank. If and to the extent that the Borrower shall not have so made such
payment in full to the Administrative Agent, each Bank shall repay to the
Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank
together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
distributed to such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the
Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

5.9. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Bank shall obtain any payment
-------------------------
(whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of set-off,
or otherwise) on account of the Loans made by it (other than pursuant to Section
5.5, 5.6 or 5.7) in excess of its Ratable Portion of payments on account of the
Loans obtained by all the Banks, such Bank shall forthwith purchase from the
other Banks such participations in the Loans made by them as shall be necessary
to cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess payment ratably with each of
them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is
-------- -------
thereafter recovered from such purchasing Bank, such purchase from each Bank
shall be rescinded and each such Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank the
purchase price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to
such Bank's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such
Bank's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the
purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Bank in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower
agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation from another Bank pursuant to
this Section 5.9 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its
rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with respect to such
participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct creditor of the Borrower
in the amount of such participation.

5.10. Replacement Banks. Upon the election of the Borrower to
-----------------
replace any Bank pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.5(a)(B)(2) or
5.7(2)(B), the Borrower shall provide to the Administrative Agent a notice
setting forth the replacement Bank or Banks, and the Bank being so replaced
shall take all actions as may be necessary to transfer to such replacement Bank
or Banks all of the rights and obligations of such Bank hereunder and such
replacement 

-45-

all Loans made by such Bank hereunder (with appropriate provisions for other

an assignment in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.7.

telegraphed, telexed, telecopied, cabled or delivered, be effective when
deposited in the mails, delivered to the telegraph company, confirmed by telex
answerback, telecopied with confirmation of receipt, delivered to the cable
company or delivered by hand to the addressee or its agent, respectively, except
that notices and communications to the Administrative Agent pursuant to
Article II, III, IV or XII shall not be effective until received by the
Administrative Agent.

13.3. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any Bank, the
-------------------
Managing Agents or any Facility Agent to exercise, and no delay in exercising,
any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are
cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

13.4. Costs; Expenses; Indemnities. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay
----------------------------
on demand all costs and expenses in connection with the preparation, execution,
delivery, administration, modification and amendment of this Agreement, the
other Loan Documents and the other documents to be delivered hereunder or
thereunder, including, without limitation, the specified reasonable fees and
out-of-pocket expenses of one counsel to the Managing Agents and the Facility
Agents and the Arrangers with respect thereto and with respect to advising the
Managing Agents, the Facility Agents and the Arrangers as to their rights and
responsibilities under this Agreement, and all costs and expenses of the
Managing Agents, the Facility Agents and the Banks (including, without
limitation, reasonable counsel fees and expenses) in connection with the
enforcement 

-71-

<PAGE>

(whether through negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the other documents to be delivered
hereunder and thereunder.

(b) The Borrower agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless each
of the Managing Agents, the Facility Agents, the Arrangers and the Banks and
their respective affiliates and their respective directors, officers, attorneys,
agents, employees, successors and assigns (each, an "Indemnified Person") from
and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties,
actions, claims, judgments, suits, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind
or nature whatsoever (including, without limitation, fees and disbursements of
counsel of the Managing Agents, the Facility Agents, the Arrangers or the Banks)
which may be incurred by or asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Person,
in each case arising in any manner of or in connection with or by reason of the
Merger, the Merger Agreement, the Tender Offer, this Agreement, the other Loan
Documents, the Commitments or any undertakings in connection therewith, or the
proposed or actual application of the proceeds of the Loans (all of the
foregoing collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities") and will reimburse each
Indemnified Person on a current basis for all expenses (including counsel fees
as they are incurred by such party) in connection with investigating, preparing
or defending any such action, claim or suit, whether or not in connection with
pending or threatened litigation irrespective of whether such Indemnified Person
is designated a party thereto; provided that the Borrower shall not have any
--------
liability hereunder to any Indemnified Person with respect to Indemnified
Liabilities which are determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen primarily from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person; and provided
--------
further, that if the Borrower has determined in good faith that such Indemnified
- - -------
Liabilities were primarily the result of such Indemnified Person's gross
negligence or willful misconduct, it shall not be obligated to pay such
Indemnified Liabilities until a court of competent jurisdiction has determined
whether such Indemnified Person acted with gross negligence or willful
misconduct. If for any reason the foregoing indemnification is unavailable to
an Indemnified Person or insufficient to hold an Indemnified Person harmless,
then the Borrower shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Indemnified Person as a result of any Indemnified Liability in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits received by the
Borrower and each Managing Agent, each Facility Agent, each Arranger and each
Bank, but 

-72-

<PAGE>

also the relative fault of the Borrower and each Managing Agent, each Facility
Agent, each Arranger and each Bank, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The foregoing indemnity shall be in addition to any rights that
any Indemnified Person may have at common law or otherwise, including, but not
limited to, any right to contribution.

(c) If any Bank receives any payment of principal of, or is subject
to a conversion of, any Eurodollar Rate Loan other than on the last day of an
Interest Period relating to such Loan, as a result of any payment or conversion
made by the Borrower or acceleration of the maturity of the amounts due under
this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1 or for any other reason, the Borrower
shall, upon demand by such Bank (with a copy of such demand to the
Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Bank any amounts required to compensate such Bank for any additional losses,
costs or expenses which it may reasonably incur as a result of such payment or
conversion, including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss of the
margin payable in accordance with Section 5.2 on the amount of principal so
paid, or any loss), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or
reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Bank to fund or
maintain such Loan. The foregoing obligations of the Borrower contained in
paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of this Section 13.4, and the obligations of the
Borrower contained in Sections 5.5(b) and 5.7, shall survive the payment of the
Loans.

13.5. Right of Set-Off. Upon (i) the occurrence and during the
----------------
continuance of any Event of Default and (ii) the making of the request or the
granting of the consent specified by Section 11.1 to authorize the
Administrative Agent to declare all amounts under this Agreement due and payable
pursuant to the provisions of Section 11.1 or the automatic acceleration of such
amounts pursuant to the proviso to that Section, each Bank is hereby authorized
at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to
set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing
by such Bank to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any and
all of the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this
Agreement irrespective of whether or not such Bank shall have made any demand
under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each Bank
agrees promptly to notify the Borrower after any such set-off and application
made by such Bank; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall
-------- -------
not affect the validity of such set-off and 

-73-

<PAGE>

application. The rights of each Bank under this Section 13.5 are in addition to
any other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, any other rights
of set-off) which such Bank may have.

13.6. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective when it
--------------
shall have been executed by the Borrower, each of the Managing Agents, each of
the Facility Agents and each of the Arrangers and when the Managing Agents shall
have been notified by each of the Banks that such Bank has executed it and
thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Borrower, each
of the Managing Agents, each of the Facility Agents, each of the Arrangers and
each of the Banks and their respective successors and assigns, except that
(i) the Borrower shall have no right to assign its rights hereunder or any
interest herein without the prior written consent of the Banks and (ii) no Bank
may sell, transfer, assign, pledge or grant participations in any of its Loans
or any of its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with Section
13.7 or as expressly required hereunder.

13.7. Assignments and Participations; Additional Banks. (a) Any
------------------------------------------------
Bank may, at any time, by notice substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto
(each, a "Notice of Assignment and Acceptance") delivered to the Administrative
Agent for its acceptance and recording, together with a recording fee in the
amount of $3,000, assign all or any part of its rights and obligations and
delegate its duties under this Agreement (A) to any other Bank or any affiliate
of any Bank which actually controls, is controlled by, or is under common
control with such Bank or to any Federal Reserve Bank (in either case without
limitation as to amount), or (B) with the prior consent of the Borrower (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld), to any other Person (but if in part,
in a minimum amount of $25,000,000 or, if less, the balance of such Bank's 
Short-Term Loan Commitment, the Revolving Loan Commitment and the Term Loan
Commitment); provided, however, that each assigning Bank must assign an
-------- -------
identical percentage of a Loan and its related Commitment and, in the case of
any assignment of a Term Loan and the related Commitment, a uniform, and not a
varying, percentage of each of its Term Loans and Term Loan Commitment and
Subsidiary Loans and Subsidiary Loan Commitments under the Subsidiary Facility;
provided further, however, that no Bank may make any such assignment or
- - -------- ------- -------
delegation of, or sell or grant (as provided in paragraph (b) below) any
participation in, any of its rights or duties under this Agreement until the one
hundredth day after the Initial Funding Date (or such other date as may be
determined in accordance with the Syndication 

-74-

<PAGE>

Letter, dated as of June 8, 1994), except (i) through a coordinated pooled
syndication organized by the Arrangers and (ii) to any affiliate of such Bank
which actually controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such
Bank or to any Federal Reserve Bank.

(b) Any Bank may at any time sell or grant participations in its
Commitment, or the obligations owing to or from any Person existing under this
Agreement; provided, however, that (i) as between such Bank and the Borrower,
-------- -------
the existence of such participations shall not give rise to any direct rights or
obligations between the Borrower and the participants; (ii) such Bank shall
remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of
such obligations; (iii) the Borrower, the Managing Agents, the Facility Agents
and the other Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in
connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement; and
(iv) no such sale or grant of a participation shall, without the consent of the
Borrower, require the Borrower to file a registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission or apply to qualify the Commitments or the
Loans under the securities laws of any state.

(c) If an assignment is made by any Bank in accordance with the
provisions of paragraph (a) above, upon acceptance and recording by the
Administrative Agent, and approval by the Borrower, where applicable, of each
Notice of Assignment and Acceptance, (i) the assignee thereunder shall become a
party to this Agreement and the Borrower shall release and discharge the
assigning Bank from its duties, liabilities or obligations under this Agreement
to the extent the same are so assigned and delegated by such Bank, provided that
--------
no such consent, release or discharge shall have effect until the Borrower shall
have received a fully executed copy of the Notice of Assignment and Acceptance
relating to such assignment and (ii) Schedule II shall be deemed amended to give
effect to such assignment. The Borrower agrees that each such disposition will
give rise to a direct obligation of the Borrower to any such assignee.

(d) The Borrower authorizes each Bank to disclose to any prospective
assignee or participant and any assignee or participant any and all financial
information in such Bank's possession concerning the Borrower and this
Agreement; provided, however, that, prior to any such disclosure, the assignee
-------- -------
or participant or proposed assignee or participant shall agree to preserve the
confidentiality of any confidential information relating to the Borrower 

-75-

<PAGE>

received by it from such Bank in accordance with Section 13.10.

(e) Any Bank which sells or grants participations in any Loans or its
Commitment may not grant to the participants the right to vote other than on
amendments, consents, waivers, modifications or other actions which change the
principal amount of, postpone the scheduled maturity of, or decrease the
interest rates applicable to, any Loans under, or increase the amount of, such
Commitment (except with respect to participating Affiliates actually controlled
by, controlling or under common control with, such Bank); provided, however,
-------- -------
that as between the Bank and the Borrower, only the Bank shall be entitled to
cast such votes.

(f) No participant in any Bank's rights or obligations shall be
entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 5.5 or 5.7 than such Bank
would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights participated, and
no participation shall be sold or granted to any Person as to which the events
specified in Section 5.6 have occurred on or before the date of participation.

(g) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address referred
to in Section 13.2 a copy of each Notice of Assignment and Acceptance received
by it and a register, containing the terms of each Notice of Assignment and
Acceptance, for the recordation of the names and addresses of each Bank and the
Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to, each Bank from time
to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Banks,
the Facility Agents and the Managing Agents may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.
The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any Bank, any
Facility Agent or any Managing Agent at any reasonable time and from time to
time upon reasonable prior notice.

---------------------------
OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. WHEREVER POSSIBLE, EACH
PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE INTERPRETED IN SUCH MANNER AS TO BE
EFFECTIVE AND VALID UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, BUT IF ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT

RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS.

(b) The Borrower irrevocably consents to the service of process of
any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or proceeding by the mailing

Borrower at its address specified for notices in or pursuant to Section 13.2

manner permitted by law or commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed
against the Borrower in any other jurisdiction.

by jury in any proceeding arising out of this Agreement.

hereto (or otherwise obtained from the Borrower in connection with this
Agreement) confidential in accordance with such Person's customary practices and
agrees that it will only use such information in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and not disclose any of such
information other than (i) to such Person's employees, counsel, representatives

than by such Person, or such Person's employees, counsel, representatives or
agents, in violation of this Section 13.10.

13.11. Section Titles. The Section titles contained in this
--------------
Agreement are and shall be without substantive meaning or content of any kind
whatsoever and are not a part of the agreement between the parties hereto.

with respect to each such Subsidiary Loan made to it, in the amount set forth
opposite such Bank's name under such Subsidiary Borrower's column on
Schedule II hereto as such Bank's "Subsidiary Commitment" for such Subsidiary
Borrower (as adjusted from time to time by reason of assignments in

commitments to the Subsidiary Borrowers being such Bank's "Subsidiary
Commitment").

(b) Evidence of Debt. (i) Each Bank shall maintain in accordance
----------------
with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the Indebtedness of
each Subsidiary Borrower to each Bank resulting from the Subsidiary Loans

principal and interest payable and paid to such Bank from time to time
hereunder.

---------------------------
of each Subsidiary Borrower shall be made upon receipt of a Notice of
Borrowing, given by such Subsidiary Borrower to the Administrative Agent not
later than 9:30 A.M. (New York City time) on the Funding Date, in the event
such Subsidiary Borrowing is to be comprised of Base Rate Loans, and (ii)
11:00 A.M. (New York City time) on the third Business Day prior to the
Initial Funding Date, in the event such Subsidiary Borrowing is to be
comprised of Eurodollar Rate Loans.

-16-

<PAGE>

(b) The Administrative Agent shall give to each Bank prompt notice
(but in any event on the same day) of its receipt of a Notice of Borrowing
and, if Eurodollar Rate Loans are properly requested in such Notice of
Borrowing, upon its determination thereof, notice of the applicable interest
rate under Section 3.2. Each Bank shall, before 11:00 A.M. (or in the case
of a Subsidiary Borrowing being made on the same day, before 12:00 noon)
(New York City time) on the date of the proposed Subsidiary Borrowing, make
available for the account of its Applicable Lending Office to the
Administrative Agent at its address referred to in Section 10.2, in
immediately available funds, such Bank's Ratable Portion of each such
proposed Subsidiary Borrowing. After the Administrative Agent's receipt of
such funds and upon fulfillment of the applicable conditions set forth in
Article IV, the Administrative Agent will make such funds available to the
Subsidiary Borrowers at the Administrative Agent's aforesaid address.

(c) Each Notice of Borrowing pursuant to this Section 2.2 shall be
irrevocable and binding on the applicable Subsidiary Borrower. In the case
of a proposed Subsidiary Borrowing comprised of Eurodollar Rate Loans to any
Subsidiary Borrower, the Subsidiary Borrower requesting such Subsidiary
Borrowing shall indemnify each Bank against any loss, cost or expense
incurred by such Bank as a result of any failure to fulfill on or before the
date specified in such Notice of Borrowing the applicable conditions set
forth in Article IV, including, without limitation, any loss (excluding loss
of the margin payable in accordance with Section 3.2 on the amount of
principal not borrowed as a result of such failure), cost or expense incurred
by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds
acquired by such Bank to fund any Eurodollar Rate Loan to be made by such
Bank to such Subsidiary Borrower as part of any such proposed Subsidiary
Borrowing when such Eurodollar Rate Loan to such Subsidiary Borrower, as a
result of such failure, is not made on such date.

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from a Bank prior to the date of any proposed Subsidiary Borrowing pursuant
to this Section 2.2 that such Bank will not make available to the
Administrative Agent such Bank's Ratable Portion of such Subsidiary
Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made such
Ratable Portion available to the Administrative Agent on the date of such
Subsidiary Borrowing in accordance with this Section 2.2 and the
Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to
the applicable Subsidiary Borrower on such date a corresponding amount. If
and to the extent that such Bank shall not have so made such Ratable Portion
available 

-17-

<PAGE>

to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent has so made
available such amount, such Bank and such Subsidiary Borrower severally agree
to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding
amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount
is made available to such Subsidiary Borrower until the date such amount is
repaid to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Subsidiary
Borrower, the interest rate applicable at the time to the Subsidiary Loans
comprising such Subsidiary Borrowings and (ii) in the case of such Bank, the
Federal Funds Rate. If such Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent
such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bank's
Subsidiary Loan as part of any such Subsidiary Borrowing for purposes of this
Agreement. If such Subsidiary Borrower shall repay to the Administrative
Agent such corresponding amount, such payment shall not relieve such Bank of
any obligation it may have to the Subsidiary Borrowers hereunder.

(e) The failure of any Bank to make any Subsidiary Loan to be made
by it to any Subsidiary Borrower shall not relieve any other Bank of its
obligation, if any, hereunder to make its Subsidiary Loan to such Subsidiary
Borrower on the date of such Subsidiary Borrowing, but no Bank shall be
responsible for the failure of any other Bank to make the Subsidiary Loan to
be made by such other Bank to such Subsidiary Borrower.

2.3. Repayment of the Subsidiary Loans. (a) Each Subsidiary
---------------------------------
Borrower shall pay the principal amount of the Subsidiary Loans of each Bank
to such Subsidiary Borrower in quarterly installments on January 1, April 1,
July 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing July 1, 1997, and ending on
July 1, 2002, in an amount equal to such Bank's Ratable Portion of the
quarterly amount set forth in column (y) in Schedule 2.3 hereto opposite the
period specified in column (x) in such Schedule during which such date
occurs.

(b) Each Subsidiary Borrower shall repay the outstanding principal
amount of the Subsidiary Loans to such Subsidiary Borrower (together with all
accrued and unpaid interest thereon) in full on the Termination Date.

2.4. Optional Prepayments of the Subsidiary Loans. Each
--------------------------------------------
Subsidiary Borrower may, upon at least three Business Days' prior notice (or
at least one Business Day's prior notice in the case of Base Rate Loans) to
the Administrative Agent stating the proposed date and aggregate principal
amount of the prepayment of, and if such notice is given by any Subsidiary
Borrower such Subsidiary Borrower 

-18-

<PAGE>

shall, prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Subsidiary Loans made
to such Subsidiary Borrower, in whole or ratably in part, together with
accrued interest to the date of such prepayment on the principal amount
prepaid; provided, however, that each Subsidiary Borrower shall indemnify the
-------- -------
Banks pursuant to Section 10.4(c) in the event that any prepayment of any
Eurodollar Rate Loans made by such Subsidiary Borrower shall be made on a day
other than the last day of an Interest Period for such Subsidiary Loans. 
Amounts borrowed under Section 2.1 and prepaid pursuant to this Section 2.5
may not be reborrowed. Any partial prepayment may be allocated to scheduled
installments of the Subsidiary Loans in any manner requested by the
appropriate Subsidiary Borrower. 

2.5. Mandatory Prepayments of the Subsidiary Loans of the MSubs. 
----------------------------------------------------------
The Subsidiary Loans of an MSub shall be due and payable on the date on which
such MSub ceases to be a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Viacom
or Viacom International.

ARTICLE III

CONVERSION, INTEREST, PAYMENTS, FEES, ETC.

3.1. Conversion/Continuation Option. Any Subsidiary Borrower may
------------------------------
elect (i) at any time to convert Base Rate Loans to such Subsidiary Borrower
or any portion thereof to Eurodollar Rate Loans or (ii) at the end of any
Interest Period with respect thereto, to convert Eurodollar Rate Loans to
such Subsidiary Borrower or any portion thereof into Base Rate Loans, or to
continue such Eurodollar Rate Loans or any portion thereof as Eurodollar Rate
Loans for an additional Interest Period; provided, however, that the
-------- -------
aggregate of the Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Subsidiary Borrower so
converted or so continued for each Interest Period must be in the amount of
$5,000,000 or an integral multiple of $5,000,000 in excess thereof. Each
such election shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit E hereto (a
"Notice of Conversion or Continuation") and shall be made by giving the
Administrative Agent at least one Business Day's, in the case of a conversion
to a Base Rate Loan, and three Business Days', in the case of a conversion to
or a continuation of a Eurodollar Rate Loan, prior written notice thereof
specifying (A) the amount and type of conversion or continuation, (B) in the
case of a conversion to or a continuation of Eurodollar Rate Loans, the
Interest Period therefor, and (C) in the case of a conversion, the date of
conversion (which date shall be a Business Day and, if a conversion from a
Eurodollar Rate Loan, shall also be the last day of the Interest Period
therefor). The Administrative Agent shall promptly (but in 

-19-

<PAGE>

any event on the same day) notify each Bank of its receipt of a Notice of
Conversion or Continuation and of the contents thereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no conversion in whole or in part of Base Rate Loans to Eurodollar
Rate Loans of any Subsidiary Borrower, and no continuation in whole or in
part of Eurodollar Rate Loans of any Subsidiary Borrower upon the expiration
of any Interest Period therefor, shall be permitted at any time at which an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. If, within the time
period required under the terms of this Section 3.1, the Administrative Agent
does not receive a Notice of Conversion or Continuation from any Subsidiary
Borrower containing an election to continue all or any portion of the
Eurodollar Rate Loans to such Subsidiary Borrower for an additional Interest
Period or to convert all or any portion of such Subsidiary Loans, then, upon
the expiration of the Interest Period therefor, such Subsidiary Loans or the
portions thereof for which an election to continue or convert has not been
made will be automatically converted to Base Rate Loans. Each Notice of
Conversion or Continuation shall be irrevocable.

3.2. Interest. Each Subsidiary Borrower shall pay interest on the
--------
unpaid principal amount of each Subsidiary Loan to such Subsidiary Borrower
from the date thereof until the principal amount thereof shall be paid in
full, at the following rates per annum:

(a) Base Rate Loans. For Base Rate Loans, at a rate per annum
---------------
equal at all times to the Base Rate in effect from time to time, payable
quarterly in arrears on the last day of each September, December, March
and June, on the Termination Date and on the date any Base Rate Loan is
converted or paid in full.

(b) Eurodollar Rate Loans. For Eurodollar Rate Loans, at a rate
---------------------
per annum equal at all times during the applicable Interest Period for
each Eurodollar Rate Loan to the sum of the Eurodollar Rate for such
Interest Period plus the Applicable Eurodollar Rate Margin, payable in
arrears (i) on the last day of such Interest Period and (ii) if such
Interest Period has a duration of more than three months, on each day
during such Interest Period that occurs every three months from the
first day of such Interest Period.

(c) Default Rate of Interest. If any amount of principal of any
------------------------
Subsidiary Loan to any Subsidiary Borrower is not paid when due, whether
at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, the interest rate
applicable to any such amount shall be increased by 2.00% per annum,
payable on demand, and if any 

-20-

<PAGE>

interest, fee or other amount payable by any Subsidiary Borrower
hereunder is not paid when due, such amount shall bear interest at a
rate per annum equal at all times to the Base Rate in effect from time
to time plus 2% per annum payable on demand.

3.3. Interest Rate Determination and Protection. (a) In the
------------------------------------------
Event that the Eurodollar Rate is not available from the Telerate Page, the
Eurodollar Rate for each Interest Period for Eurodollar Rate Loans to any
Subsidiary Borrower shall be determined by the Administrative Agent on the
basis of applicable rates furnished to and received by the Administrative
Agent from the Reference Banks two Business Days before such Interest Period. 
Each Reference Bank agrees to furnish to the Administrative Agent timely
information for the purpose of determining each Eurodollar Rate. If any of
the Reference Banks shall not furnish such timely information to the
Administrative Agent for the purpose of determining any such interest rate,
the Administrative Agent shall determine such interest rate on the basis of
timely information furnished by the other Reference Bank or Reference Banks.

(b) The Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the
Subsidiary Borrowers and the Banks of the applicable interest rate determined
by the Administrative Agent for purposes of Section 3.2(a) or (b), and the
applicable rate, if any, furnished by each Reference Bank for the purpose of
determining the applicable interest rate under Section 3.2(b).

(c) If, with respect to Eurodollar Rate Loans to any Subsidiary
Borrower, the Majority Banks determine in good faith and notify the
Administrative Agent that the Eurodollar Rate for any Interest Period will
not adequately reflect the cost to such Banks of making such Subsidiary Loans
to such Subsidiary Borrower or funding or maintaining their respective
Eurodollar Rate Loans to such Subsidiary Borrower for such Interest Period,
the Administrative Agent shall forthwith so notify such Subsidiary Borrower
and the Banks, whereupon

(i) each Eurodollar Rate Loan to such Subsidiary Borrower will
automatically, on the last day of the then existing Interest Period
therefor, convert into a Base Rate Loan unless the Majority Banks notify
the Administrative Agent that the circumstances causing such conversion
no longer exist and such Subsidiary Borrower delivers a timely Notice of
Conversion or Continuation with respect to such Subsidiary Loans; and

-21-

<PAGE>

(ii) the obligations of the Banks to make Eurodollar Rate Loans to
such Subsidiary Borrower or to convert Subsidiary Loans to such
Subsidiary Borrower into Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended until
the Administrative Agent shall notify such Subsidiary Borrower and the
Banks that the circumstances causing such suspension no longer exist.

3.4. Fees. (a) Each Subsidiary Borrower will pay on the last day
----
of each Fiscal Quarter to each of the Banks in arrears a fee (the "Commitment
Fee") accruing from the tenth Business Day after the Documentation Agent has
notified each Subsidiary Borrower that the Agreement has been executed by the
Banks (or such earlier date on or after the execution hereof as the Merger
Date shall have occurred), in the case of each Bank listed on the signature
pages hereof, and from any later effective date of the assignment pursuant to
which it became a Bank, in the case of each other Bank, until the earlier of
the Funding Date and the Termination Date, on such Bank's aggregate average
daily unused Subsidiary Commitment with respect to such Subsidiary Borrower
as in effect from time to time at the rate of 0.3125% on any date prior to
the date on which Viacom's long-term, senior unsecured debt is rated by S&P
or Moody's, and on any date thereafter at the rate set forth below opposite
the Credit Rating applicable to Viacom on such date:

CREDIT RATING COMMITMENT FEE
------------- --------------

A-/A3 or better .1500%
BBB+/Baa1 .2000%
BBB/Baa2 .2250%
BBB-/Baa3 .2500%
BB+/Ba1 .3125%
BB/Ba2 .3750%
BB-/Ba3 or lower .5000%

; provided, however, that if the ratings assigned by S&P and Moody's shall
-------- -------
differ by one level, the Credit Rating shall be the rating which is the
higher level, or if they differ by more than one level, the Credit Rating
shall be the rating that is one rating level immediately above the lower of
such ratings. Any change in the Credit Rating of Viacom shall be effective
to adjust the Commitment Fee as of the date such change is announced.

(b) Viacom has agreed to pay to the Banks, Managing Agents,
Facility Agents, Agents, Co-Agents and Arrangers certain other fees which are
earned on the date of the signing of this Agreement and payable on the
earlier of 

-22-

<PAGE>

(x) the Funding Date or (y) September 30, 1994, as separately agreed.

3.5. Increased Costs. (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction
---------------
of or any change (other than any change by way of imposition or increase of
reserve requirements included in the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage) in,
or in the interpretation of, any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance
with any guideline or request from any central bank or other Governmental
Authority (whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any
increase in the cost (other than with respect to income, franchise or
withholding taxes or other taxes of a similar nature) to any Bank of agreeing
to make or making, funding or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loans to any
Subsidiary Borrower, then (A) such Bank shall, as soon as such Bank becomes
aware of such increased cost, but in any event not later than 60 days after
such increased cost was incurred, deliver to such Subsidiary Borrower and the
Administrative Agent a certificate stating (1) the actual amount of such
increased cost incurred by such Bank and (2) that it is such Bank's customary
practice, from and after the date of this Agreement, to charge its borrowers
for increased costs incurred by it; (B) such Subsidiary Borrower shall,
within 30 days after its receipt of such certificate, at its sole option,
either (1) pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Bank
amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank for the increased cost incurred by
it as set forth in the certificate referred to above or (2) replace such Bank
in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.10, provided that if such
--------
Subsidiary Borrower does not exercise the option specified in clause (2)
above within 30 days after receipt of the certificate referred to above, then
(x) such Bank shall deliver to such Subsidiary Borrower and the
Administrative Agent a second certificate stating the increased cost incurred
by such Bank and (y) such Subsidiary Borrower shall promptly upon receipt of
such second certificate pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of
such Bank amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank for such increased cost;
and (C) such Bank shall use its reasonable best efforts to designate another
of its then existing offices as its Applicable Lending Office with respect to
the Subsidiary Loans of such Subsidiary Borrower if the making of such
designation would, without any detrimental effect to such Bank, avoid the
need for, or reduce the amount of, future increased costs which are probable
of being incurred by such Bank. The amount of increased costs payable by any
Subsidiary Borrower to any Bank as stated in any such certificate delivered
to such Subsidiary Borrower and the Administrative Agent pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 3.5(a) shall be conclusive and binding for all
purposes, absent manifest error. In 

-23-

<PAGE>

determining any such amount, such Bank may use reasonable averaging and
attribution methods. If such Subsidiary Borrower so notifies the
Administrative Agent within five Business Days after receipt of any
certificate delivered to such Subsidiary Borrower pursuant to the provisions
of this Section 3.5(a), such Subsidiary Borrower may either (x) prepay in
full all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Bank to such Subsidiary Borrower then
outstanding in accordance with Section 3.8 and, additionally, reimburse such
Bank for such increased cost in accordance with this Section 3.5(a) or
(y) convert all Eurodollar Rate Loans of all Banks to such Subsidiary
Borrower then outstanding into Base Rate Loans in accordance with Section 3.1
and, additionally, reimburse such Bank for such increased cost in accordance
with this Section 3.5(a).

(b) If any Bank shall be required under Regulation D to maintain
reserves with respect to liabilities or assets consisting of or including
Eurocurrency Liabilities with respect to the Subsidiary Loans of any
Subsidiary Borrower, then (i) such Bank shall, within 60 days after the end
of any Interest Period with respect to any Eurodollar Rate Loan to such
Subsidiary Borrower during which such Bank was so required to maintain such
reserves, deliver to such Subsidiary Borrower and the Administrative Agent a
certificate stating (A) that such Bank was required to maintain reserves and
as a result such Bank incurred additional costs in connection with making
Eurodollar Rate Loans to such Subsidiary Borrower, (B) in reasonable detail,
such Bank's computations of the amount of additional interest payable by such
Subsidiary Borrower pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.5(b)(ii) and
(C) that it is such Bank's customary practice, from and after the date of
this Agreement, to charge its borrowers for reserves so maintained by it, and
(ii) such Subsidiary Borrower shall, promptly upon receipt of any such
certificate, pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of such Bank,
additional interest on the unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Rate
Loan of such Bank to such Subsidiary Borrower outstanding during the Interest
Period with respect to which the above-referenced certificate was delivered
to such Subsidiary Borrower, at a rate per annum equal to the difference
obtained by subtracting (x) the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period from
(y) the rate obtained by dividing such Eurodollar Rate by a percentage equal
to 100% minus the Eurodollar Rate Reserve Percentage of such Bank for such
-----
Interest Period. The amount of interest payable by such Subsidiary Borrower
to any Bank as stated in any certificate delivered to such Subsidiary
Borrower and the Administrative Agent pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 3.5(b) shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent
manifest error.

-24-

<PAGE>

(c) The payments required under Sections 3.5(a) and (b) are in
addition to any other payments and indemnities required under this Agreement.

3.6. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
----------
Agreement, if the introduction of or any change in or in the interpretation
of any law or regulation, in each case after the date hereof, shall make it
unlawful, or any central bank or other Governmental Authority shall assert
that it is unlawful, for any Bank or its Eurodollar Lending Office to make
Eurodollar Rate Loans to any Subsidiary Borrower or to continue to fund or
maintain Eurodollar Rate Loans to any Subsidiary Borrower, then, on notice
thereof and demand therefor by such Bank to such Subsidiary Borrower through
the Administrative Agent, (i) the obligation of such Bank to make or to
continue Eurodollar Rate Loans to such Subsidiary Borrower and to convert
Base Rate Loans to such Subsidiary Borrower into Eurodollar Rate Loans shall
be suspended until such Bank through the Administrative Agent shall notify
such Subsidiary Borrowers that the circumstances causing such suspension no
longer exist and (ii) such Subsidiary Borrower shall forthwith prepay in full
all Eurodollar Rate Loans of such Bank to such Subsidiary Borrower then
outstanding, together with interest accrued thereon, unless such Subsidiary
Borrower, within five Business Days of such notice and demand, converts all
Eurodollar Rate Loans of all Banks to such Subsidiary Borrower then
outstanding into Base Rate Loans in accordance with the notice periods of
Section 3.1; provided, however, that before making any such demand, each Bank
-------- -------
agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to designate another of its then
existing offices as its Applicable Lending Office with respect to the
Subsidiary Loans of such Subsidiary Borrower if the making of such a
designation would, without any detrimental effect to such Bank, cause the
making of Eurodollar Rate Loans to such Subsidiary Borrower to not be subject
to this Section 3.6.

3.7. Capital Adequacy. If any Bank shall, at any time, reasonably
----------------
determine that (a) the adoption (i) after the date of this Agreement, of any
capital adequacy guidelines or (ii) at any time, of any other applicable law,
government rule, regulation or order regarding capital adequacy of banks or
bank holding companies, (b) any change in (I) any of the foregoing or (II)
the interpretation or administration of any of the foregoing by any
Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency or (c) compliance
with any policy, guideline, directive or request regarding capital adequacy
(whether or not having the force of law and whether or not failure to comply
therewith would be unlawful) of any Governmental Authority, central bank or
comparable agency, would have the effect of 

-25-

<PAGE>

reducing the rate of return on the capital of such Bank to a level below that
which such Bank could have achieved but for such adoption, change or
compliance (taking into consideration the policies of such Bank with respect
to capital adequacy in effect immediately before such adoption, change or
compliance) and (x) such reduction is as a consequence of the Subsidiary
Commitment with respect to any Subsidiary Borrower of, or the making,
converting or continuing of any Subsidiary Loans to any Subsidiary Borrower
by, such Bank hereunder and (y) such reduction is reasonably deemed by such
Bank to be material, then (1) such Bank shall deliver to such Subsidiary
Borrower and the Administrative Agent a certificate stating the reduction in
the rate of return such Bank will in the future suffer as a result of its
Subsidiary Commitment with respect to such Subsidiary Borrower or the making,
converting or continuing any Subsidiary Loans to any Subsidiary Borrower by
it to such Subsidiary Borrower hereunder and (2) such Subsidiary Borrower
shall, within 30 days after its receipt of such certificate, at its sole
option, either (A) pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of such
Bank from time to time as specified by such Bank such amount as shall be
sufficient to compensate such Bank for such reduced return, or (B) replace
such Bank in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.10; provided,
--------
however, that if such Subsidiary Borrower does not exercise the option
-------
specified in clause (B) above within 30 days after receipt of the certificate
referred to above, then (1) such Bank shall deliver to such Subsidiary
Borrower and the Administrative Agent a second certificate stating the
reduction in the rate of return of such Bank and (2) such Subsidiary Borrower
shall promptly pay, as specified by such Bank, to the Administrative Agent
for the account of such Bank amounts sufficient to compensate such Bank for
the reduction in its rate of return. The amount stated in any certificate
delivered to such Subsidiary Borrower pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 3.7 shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error. In determining any such amount, such Bank may use reasonable
averaging and attribution methods. The payments required under this
Section 3.7 are in addition to any other payments and indemnities required
hereunder.

3.8. Payments and Computations. (a) Each Subsidiary Borrower
-------------------------
shall make each payment payable by it hereunder not later than 11:00 A.M.
(New York City time) on the day when due, in Dollars, to the Administrative
Agent at its address referred to in Section 10.2 in immediately available
funds without set-off or counterclaim. The Administrative Agent will
promptly thereafter (but in any event on the same day) cause to be
distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or
fees 

-26-

<PAGE>

ratably (other than amounts payable pursuant to Section 3.5, 3.6 or 3.7) to
the Banks for the account of their respective Applicable Lending Offices with
respect to such Subsidiary Borrower, and like funds relating to the payment
of any other amount payable to any Bank to such Bank for the account of its
Applicable Lending Office with respect to such Subsidiary Borrower, in each
case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Payment
received by the Administrative Agent after 11:00 A.M. (New York City time)
shall be deemed to be received on the next Business Day; provided, however,
-------- -------
that the Administrative Agent shall use its reasonable best efforts to invest
any amounts so received by the Administrative Agent in overnight investments
satisfactory to the Subsidiary Borrowers, and any earnings on any such
investments shall be for the applicable Subsidiary Borrower's account and may
be credited against any interest payable hereunder during such period.

(b) All computations of the Commitment Fee or of interest based on
the rate of interest specified in clause (a) of the definition of Base Rate
and of fees shall be made by the Administrative Agent on the basis of a year
of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and all computations of interest
based on the Eurodollar Rate or the Federal Funds Rate shall be made by the
Administrative Agent on the basis of a year of 360 days, in each case for the
actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day)
occurring in the period for which such interest and fees are payable. All
computations of the Commitment Fee shall be based on the aggregate average
daily unused Subsidiary Commitment of each Bank. Each determination by the
Administrative Agent of an interest rate hereunder shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

(c) Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a
day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next
succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be
included in the computation of payment of interest or fees, as the case may
be.

(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice
from any Subsidiary Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to
the Banks hereunder that such Subsidiary Borrower will not make such payment
in full, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Subsidiary Borrower
has made such payment in full to the Administrative Agent on such date and
the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, cause to be
distributed to each Bank on such due date an amount equal to the amount then
due such Bank. If and to the extent that such 

-27-

<PAGE>

Subsidiary Borrower shall not have so made such payment in full to the
Administrative Agent, each Bank shall repay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such amount distributed to such Bank together with
interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is distributed to
such Bank until the date such Bank repays such amount to the Administrative
Agent, at the Federal Funds Rate.

3.9. Sharing of Payments, Etc. If any Bank shall obtain any
-------------------------
payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
set-off, or otherwise) on account of the Subsidiary Loans made by it to any
Subsidiary Borrower (other than pursuant to Section 3.5, 3.6 or 3.7) in
excess of its Ratable Portion of payments on account of the Subsidiary Loans
to such Subsidiary Borrower obtained by all the Banks, such Bank shall
forthwith purchase from the other Banks such participations in such
Subsidiary Loans made by them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing
Bank to share the excess payment ratably with each of them; provided,
--------
however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is thereafter
-------
recovered from such purchasing Bank, such purchase from each Bank shall be
rescinded and each such Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank the purchase
price to the extent of such recovery together with an amount equal to such
Bank's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such
Bank's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the
purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Bank in respect of the total amount so recovered. Each Subsidiary
Borrower agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation from another Bank
pursuant to this Section 3.9 may, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
exercise all its rights of payment (including the right of set-off) with
respect to such participation as fully as if such Bank were the direct
creditor of such Subsidiary Borrower in the amount of such participation.

3.10. Replacement Banks. Upon the election of any Subsidiary
-----------------
Borrower to replace any Bank pursuant to the provisions of
Section 3.5(a)(B)(2) or 3.7(2)(B), such Subsidiary Borrower shall provide to
the Administrative Agent a notice setting forth the replacement Bank or
Banks, and the Bank being so replaced shall take all actions as may be
necessary to transfer to such replacement Bank or Banks all of the rights and
obligations of such Bank hereunder (with appropriate provisions for other
amounts due to the Bank being replaced) and such replacement Bank or Banks
shall pay to the Bank being so replaced the amount outstanding of all
Subsidiary Loans made by such Bank to such Subsidiary Borrower hereunder, all
as though such replacement Bank or Banks were an assignee or assignees of 

-28-

such Bank to which such Bank were making an assignment in accordance with the

successor Facility Agent shall be a Bank or another commercial bank organized
under the laws of the United States of America or of any State thereof and
having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000). Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as a Facility Agent hereunder by any successor

become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the
retiring Facility Agent, and such retiring Facility Agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring
Facility Agent's resignation or removal hereunder, the provisions of this

-------------
notices and other communications provided for hereunder shall be in writing

designated by such party in a written notice to the other parties and, as to
each other party, at such other address as shall be designated by such party
in a written notice to the Subsidiary Borrowers and the Administrative Agent. 
All such notices and communications shall, when mailed, telegraphed, telexed,
telecopied, cabled or delivered, be effective when deposited in the mails,
delivered to the telegraph company, confirmed by telex answerback, telecopied
with confirmation of receipt, delivered to the cable company or delivered by

Each of the Subsidiary Borrowers hereby authorizes Viacom to
deliver any written notices or requests contemplated hereunder on its behalf,
and each other party hereto may rely upon any such notice or request from
Viacom from time to time, until notice to the contrary is received in writing
from any Subsidiary Borrower.

10.3. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any Bank,
-------------------
the Managing Agents or any Facility Agent to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right hereunder 

-42-

<PAGE>

shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise
of any such right preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and
not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

10.4. Costs; Expenses; Indemnities. (a) Each Subsidiary Borrower
----------------------------
agrees to pay on demand all costs and expenses in connection with the
preparation, execution, delivery, administration, modification and amendment
of this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the other documents to be
delivered hereunder or thereunder, including, without limitation, the
specified reasonable fees and out-of-pocket expenses of one counsel to the
Managing Agents and the Facility Agents and the Arrangers with respect
thereto and with respect to advising the Managing Agents, the Facility Agents
and the Arrangers as to their rights and responsibilities under this
Agreement, and all costs and expenses of the Managing Agents, the Facility
Agents and the Banks (including, without limitation, reasonable counsel fees
and expenses) in connection with the enforcement (whether through
negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise) of this Agreement, the other
Loan Documents and the other documents to be delivered hereunder and
thereunder.

(b) Each Subsidiary Borrower agrees to defend, indemnify and hold
harmless each of the Managing Agents, the Facility Agents, the Arrangers and
the Banks and their respective affiliates and their respective directors,
officers, attorneys, agents, employees, successors and assigns (each, an
"Indemnified Person") from and against any and all liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, claims, judgments, suits, costs,
expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever (including,
without limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel of the Managing Agents,
the Facility Agents, the Arrangers or the Banks) which may be incurred by or
asserted or awarded against any Indemnified Person, in each case arising in
any manner of or in connection with or by reason of the Merger, the Merger
Agreement, the Tender Offer, this Agreement, the other Loan Documents, the
Subsidiary Commitments or any undertakings in connection therewith, or the
proposed or actual application of the proceeds of the Subsidiary Loans (all
of the foregoing collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities") and will
reimburse each Indemnified Person on a current basis for all expenses
(including counsel fees as they are incurred by such party) in connection
with investigating, preparing or defending any such action, claim or suit,
whether or not in connection with pending or threatened litigation
irrespective of whether such Indemnified Person is designated a party 

-43-

<PAGE>

thereto; provided that no Subsidiary Borrower shall have any liability
--------
hereunder to any Indemnified Person with respect to Indemnified Liabilities
which are determined by a final and nonappealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction to have arisen primarily from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Indemnified Person; and provided further, that if
-------- -------
the Subsidiary Borrowers have determined in good faith that such Indemnified
Liabilities were primarily the result of such Indemnified Person's gross
negligence or willful misconduct, they shall not be obligated to pay such
Indemnified Liabilities until a court of competent jurisdiction has
determined whether such Indemnified Person acted with gross negligence or
willful misconduct. If for any reason the foregoing indemnification is
unavailable to an Indemnified Person or insufficient to hold an Indemnified
Person harmless, then each Subsidiary Borrower shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by such Indemnified Person as a result of any Indemnified
Liability in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the
relative benefits received by such Subsidiary Borrower and each Managing
Agent, each Facility Agent, each Arranger and each Bank, but also the
relative fault of such Subsidiary Borrower and each Managing Agent, each
Facility Agent, each Arranger and each Bank, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The foregoing indemnity shall be in addition to
any rights that any Indemnified Person may have at common law or otherwise,
including, but not limited to, any right to contribution.

(c) If any Bank receives any payment of principal of, or is
subject to a conversion of, any Eurodollar Rate Loan of any Subsidiary
Borrower other than on the last day of an Interest Period relating to such
Subsidiary Loan, as a result of any payment or conversion made by any
Subsidiary Borrower or acceleration of the maturity of the amounts due under
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 or for any other reason, such
Subsidiary Borrower shall, upon demand by such Bank (with a copy of such
demand to the Administrative Agent), pay to the Administrative Agent for the
account of such Bank any amounts required to compensate such Bank for any
additional losses, costs or expenses which it may reasonably incur as a
result of such payment or conversion, including, without limitation, any loss
(excluding loss of the margin payable in accordance with Section 3.2 on the
amount of principal so paid, or any loss), cost or expense incurred by reason
of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by
such Bank to fund or maintain such Subsidiary Loan. The foregoing
obligations of the Subsidiary Borrowers contained in paragraphs (a), (b) and
(c) of this Section 10.4, and the obligations of the Subsidiary Borrowers
contained in Sections 3.5 and 3.7, shall survive the payment of the
Subsidiary Loans.

-44-

<PAGE>

10.5. Right of Set-Off. Upon (i) the occurrence and during the
----------------
continuance of any Event of Default and (ii) the making of the request or the
granting of the consent specified by Section 8.1 to authorize the
Administrative Agent to declare all amounts under this Agreement due and
payable pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.1 or the automatic
acceleration of such amounts pursuant to the proviso to that Section, each
Bank is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general
or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other
indebtedness at any time owing by such Bank to or for the credit or the
account of any Subsidiary Borrower against any and all of the obligations of
such Subsidiary Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement
irrespective of whether or not such Bank shall have made any demand under
this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. Each Bank
agrees promptly to notify such Subsidiary Borrower after any such set-off and
application made by such Bank; provided, however, that the failure to give
-------- -------
such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. 
The rights of each Bank under this Section 10.5 are in addition to any other
rights and remedies (including, without limitation, any other rights of set-
off) which such Bank may have.

10.6. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall become effective when
--------------
it shall have been executed by each of the Subsidiary Borrowers, each of the
Managing Agents, each of the Facility Agents and each of the Arrangers and
when the Managing Agents shall have been notified by each of the Banks that
such Bank has executed it and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Subsidiary Borrowers, each of the Managing Agents, each of
the Facility Agents, each of the Arrangers and each of the Banks and their
respective successors and assigns, except that (i) the Subsidiary Borrowers
shall have no right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein
without the prior written consent of the Banks and (ii) no Bank may sell,
transfer, assign, pledge or grant participations in any of its Subsidiary
Loans or any of its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with
Section 10.7 or as expressly required hereunder.

10.7. Assignments and Participations; Additional Banks. (a) Any
------------------------------------------------
Bank may, at any time, with notice substantially in the form of Exhibit F
hereto (each, a "Notice of Assignment and Acceptance") delivered to the
Administrative Agent for its acceptance and recording, together with a
recording fee in the amount of $3,000, assign all or any part of its rights
and obligations and 

-45-

<PAGE>

delegate its duties under this Agreement (A) to any other Bank or any
affiliate of any Bank which actually controls, is controlled by, or is under
common control with such Bank or to any Federal Reserve Bank (in either case
without limitation as to amount), or (B) with the prior consent of the
Subsidiary Borrowers (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), to any
other Person (but if in part, in a minimum amount that, taken together with
amounts assigned to the same transferee under the Parent Facility, equals at
least $25,000,000 or, if less, the balance of such Bank's Subsidiary
Commitment); provided, however, that each assigning Bank must assign an
-------- -------
identical percentage of a Loan and its related Commitment and, in the case of
any assignment of a Term Loan and the related Commitment, a uniform, and not
a varying, percentage of each of its Subsidiary Loans and Subsidiary Loan
Commitments under this Agreement and Term Loans and Term Loan Commitment
under the Parent Facility; provided further, however, that no Bank may make
---------------- -------
any such assignment or delegation of, or sell or grant (as provided in
paragraph (b) below) any participation in, any of its rights or duties under
this Agreement until the one hundredth day after the Funding Date (or such
other date as may be determined in accordance with the Syndication Letter,
dated as of June 8, 1994), except (i) through a coordinated pooled
syndication organized by the Arrangers and (ii) to any affiliate of such Bank
which actually controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with
such Bank or to any Federal Reserve Bank.

(b) Any Bank may at any time sell or grant participations in its
Subsidiary Commitment with respect to any Subsidiary Borrower, or the
obligations owing to or from any Person existing under this Agreement;
provided, however, that (i) as between such Bank and such Subsidiary
-------- -------
Borrower, the existence of such participations shall not give rise to any
direct rights or obligations between such Subsidiary Borrower and the
participants; (ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other
parties hereto for the performance of such obligations; (iii) such Subsidiary
Borrower, the Managing Agents, the Facility Agents and the other Banks shall
continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such
Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement; and (iv) no such sale or
grant of a participation shall, without the consent of such Subsidiary
Borrower, require such Subsidiary Borrower to file a registration statement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission or apply to qualify the
Subsidiary Commitments with respect to such Subsidiary Borrower or the
Subsidiary Loans to such Subsidiary Borrower under the securities laws of any
state.

-46-

<PAGE>

(c) If an assignment is made by any Bank in accordance with the
provisions of paragraph (a) above, upon acceptance and recording by the
Administrative Agent, and approval by the Subsidiary Borrowers, where
applicable, of each Notice of Assignment and Acceptance, (i) the assignee
thereunder shall become a party to this Agreement and the Subsidiary
Borrowers shall release and discharge the assigning Bank from its duties,
liabilities or obligations under this Agreement to the extent the same are so
assigned and delegated by such Bank, provided that no such consent, release
--------
or discharge shall have effect until the Subsidiary Borrowers shall have
received a fully executed copy of the Notice of Assignment and Acceptance
relating to such assignment, and (ii) Schedule II shall be deemed amended to
give effect to such assignment. Each Subsidiary Borrower agrees that each
such disposition will give rise to a direct obligation of any Subsidiary
Borrower to any such assignee.

(d) Each Subsidiary Borrower authorizes each Bank to disclose to
any prospective assignee or participant and any assignee or participant any
and all financial information in such Bank's possession concerning such
Subsidiary Borrower and this Agreement; provided, however, that, prior to any
-------- -------
such disclosure, the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant shall agree to preserve the confidentiality of any confidential
information relating to such Subsidiary Borrower received by it from such
Bank in accordance with Section 10.11.

(e) Any Bank which sells or grants participations in any
Subsidiary Loans to any Subsidiary Borrower or its Subsidiary Commitment with
respect to any Subsidiary Borrower may not grant to the participants the
right to vote other than on amendments, consents, waivers, modifications or
other actions which change the principal amount of, postpone the scheduled
maturity of, or decrease the interest rates applicable to, any Subsidiary
Loans to such Subsidiary Borrower under, or increase the amount of, such
Subsidiary Commitment with respect to such Subsidiary Borrower (except with
respect to participating Affiliates actually controlled by, controlling or
under common control with, such Bank); provided, however, that as between the
-------- -------
Bank and such Subsidiary Borrower, only the Bank shall be entitled to cast
such votes.

(f) No participant in any Bank's rights or obligations shall be
entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 3.5 or 3.7 than such
Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the rights
participated, and no participation shall be sold or granted to any Person as
to which the events specified in Section 3.6 have occurred on or before the
date of participation.

-47-

<PAGE>

(g) The Administrative Agent shall maintain at its address
referred to in Section 10.2 a copy of each Notice of Assignment and
Acceptance received by it and a register, containing the terms of each Notice
of Assignment and Acceptance, for the recordation of the names and addresses
of each Bank and the Subsidiary Commitment of each Bank with respect to each
Subsidiary Borrower, and principal amount of the Subsidiary Loans owing to
each Bank from each Subsidiary Borrower, from time to time (the "Register"). 
The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error, and each Subsidiary Borrower, the Banks, the Facility
Agents and the Managing Agents may treat each Person whose name is recorded
in the Register as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement. The
Register shall be available for inspection by any Subsidiary Borrower, any
Bank, any Facility Agent or any Managing Agent at any reasonable time and
from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

10.8. Majority Banks are Third Party Beneficiaries. It is the
--------------------------------------------
intention of the parties hereto that no third party shall be deemed to be a
third party beneficiary or have any rights under or by virtue of this
Agreement except that the Banks under the Parent Facility shall be third
party beneficiaries of those provisions of this Agreement pursuant to which
they are given the right to vote with respect to certain matters under this
Agreement.

10.9. GOVERNING LAW; SEVERABILITY. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS
---------------------------
AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. WHEREVER POSSIBLE, EACH
PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE INTERPRETED IN SUCH MANNER AS TO BE
EFFECTIVE AND VALID UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, BUT IF ANY PROVISION OF THIS
AGREEMENT SHALL BE PROHIBITED BY OR INVALID UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, SUCH
PROVISION SHALL BE INEFFECTIVE TO THE EXTENT OF SUCH PROHIBITION OR
INVALIDITY, WITHOUT INVALIDATING THE REMAINDER OF SUCH PROVISION OR THE
REMAINING PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

10.10. SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.

OR ANY DOCUMENT RELATED HERETO MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF

----------
ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH RESPECTIVE JURISDICTIONS.

(b) Each Subsidiary Borrower irrevocably consents to the service
of process of any of the aforementioned courts in any such action or
proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by registered or certified mail,
postage prepaid, to it at its address specified for notices in or pursuant to
Section 10.2 hereof, such service to become effective 30 days after such

of any Managing Agent, any Facility Agent or any Bank to serve process in any

WHEREAS, the Documentation Agent, the Administrative Agent,
the Syndication Agent (collectively the "Facility Agents"), the
Managing Agents, the Co-Agents, the Agents and the Banks have entered
into a credit agreement dated as of July 1, 1994 (said agreement, as
it may hereafter be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from
time to time, being the "Parent Facility", and the terms defined
therein and not otherwise defined herein being used herein as therein
defined) with Viacom Inc., a corporation organized and existing under
the laws of the State of Delaware (the "Borrower"), or any successor
thereto;

WHEREAS, the Banks, the Facility Agents, the Managing
Agents, the Agents and the Co-Agents have entered into the Subsidiary
Facility simultaneously with the Parent Facility pursuant to which the

SECTION 2. Guarantee Absolute. The Guarantor guarantees
------------------
that the Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the
terms of the Parent Facility, regardless of any law, regulation or
order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of
such terms or the rights of any Bank, Facility Agent, Managing Agent,
Agent or Co-Agent with respect thereto. The liability of the
Guarantor under this Guarantee shall be absolute and unconditional
irrespective of:

(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of the
Parent Facility or any other agreement or instrument
relating thereto;

(ii) any change in the time, manner or place of
payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the
Obligations, or any other amendment or waiver of or any
consent to departure from the Parent Facility;

(iii) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any
collateral, or any release or amendment or waiver of or
consent to departure from any other guaranty, for all or any

probable liability of the Guarantor on its debts, excluding debt in
respect of this Guarantee, as they become absolute and matured.

-------------
GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE

SECTION 7. No Waiver; Remedies. No failure on the part of any
-------------------
Bank, Facility Agent, Managing Agent, Agent or Co-Agent to exercise, and no
delay in exercising, any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof;
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right hereunder preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right. The
remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies
provided by law.

SECTION 8. Right of Set-off. Upon the occurrence and during the
----------------

granting of the consent specified by Section 8.1 of the Subsidiary Facility
to authorize the Administrative Agent to declare all amounts under the
Subsidiary Facility due and payable pursuant to the provisions of said
Section 8.1, each Bank is hereby authorized at any time and from time to
time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set-off and apply any and
all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at
any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Bank to or for
the credit or the account of the Guarantor against any and all of the
obligations of the Guarantor now or hereafter existing under this Guarantee,
irrespective of whether or not such Bank shall have made any demand under
this Guarantee and although such obligations may be contingent and unmatured. 
Each Bank agrees promptly to notify the Guarantor after any such set-off and
application made by such Bank; provided, however, that the failure to give

such notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application. 
The rights of each Bank under this Section are in addition to other rights
and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of set-off) which
such Bank may have.

SECTION 9. Continuing Guarantee; Transfer of Interest. This
------------------------------------------
Guarantee is a continuing guaranty and shall (i) remain in full force and
effect until indefeasible payment in full of the Obligations and all other
amounts payable under this Guarantee, (ii) be binding upon the Guarantor, its
successors and assigns, and (iii) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable
by any Bank, Facility Agent, Managing Agent, Agent or Co-Agent, and their
respective successors, transferees, and assigns. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing clause (iii), any Bank may assign or otherwise
transfer all or any part of its rights and obligations under the Subsidiary
Facility in accordance therewith, and such other person or entity shall
thereupon become vested with all the rights in respect thereof granted to
such Bank herein or otherwise, subject, however, to the provisions of Article

force and effect and continue to be effective should any petition be filed by
or against any Loan Party (as defined in the Subsidiary Facility) for
liquidation or reorganization, should any Loan Party become insolvent or make
an assignment for the benefit of creditors or should a receiver or trustee be
appointed for all or any significant part of any Loan Party's assets, and
shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, continue to be

effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment and
performance of this Obligations, or any part thereof, is, pursuant to
applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored
or returned by any obligee of the Obligations, whether as a "voidable
preference", "fraudulent conveyance", or otherwise, all as though such
payment or performance had not been made. In the event that any payment, or
any part thereof, is rescinded, reduced, restored, or returned, the
Obligations shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be reinstated and
deemed reduced only by such amount paid and not so rescinded, reduced,
restored or returned.

SECTION 11. GOVERNING LAW. THIS Guarantee SHALL BE GOVERNED BY,

AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT
REGARD TO THE PROVISIONS THEREOF RELATING TO CONFLICT OF LAWS.

hereunder, unless and until all of the Obligations shall have been paid to
the Banks and discharged, in full, and if any payment shall be made to the
Guarantor on account of such subrogation or reimbursement rights at any time
when the Obligations shall not have been paid and discharged, in full, each
and every amount so paid shall forthwith be paid to the Banks to be credited

(e) There is no pending or threatened action or proceeding
affecting the Guarantor before any court, governmental agency or arbitrator,

effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment and
performance of this Obligations, or any part thereof, is, pursuant to
applicable law, rescinded or reduced in amount, or must otherwise be restored
or returned by any obligee of the Obligations, whether as a "voidable

-------------
AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, WITHOUT
