FOR RELEASE:
January 31, 1994
MK ACQUIRES SUPPLIER OF LOCOMOTIVE COOLING SYSTEMS

BOISE - Morrison Knudsen Corporation announced today that MK has acquired
Touchstone, Inc., of Jackson, Tennessee, a leading supplier of new and
remanufactured locomotive cooling systems.

``Once again, we are adding a first-class company to our nationwide network
of components suppliers to the railroad industry,'' said William J. Agee, MK
chairman and chief executive officer. ``Touchstone's product quality and
competitive pricing have resulted in a continual increase in market share over
the last several years.''

Touchstone presently has a strong position in the locomotive cooling system
aftermarket in the U.S. The company supplies both new and remanufactured
locomotive cooling systems, mostly to Class I railroads in the U.S. The company
also sells locomotive brake rigging and rail-car outlet gates.

Agee said Touchstone has some sales in Mexico and Australia and, as part of
MK, will seek international expansion. The company employs 118 people in
Jackson.

Touchstone is the second locomotive components manufacturer MK has acquired
in the past three months. Recently, the company purchased Clark Industries, of
Gilman, Illinois, a manufacturer of cylinder heads, pistons and liner assemblies
for locomotives. MK also owns Motor Coils Manufacturing Company, of Pittsburgh,
a manufacturer of traction motors and related equipment, and MK Engine Systems
Company, Inc., a manufacturer of locomotive turbochargers and other engine
components with plants in New York and California.

In addition, MK owns Power Parts Company, of Chicago, one of the world's
largest distributors of engine parts for locomotives.

Morrison Knudsen Corporation (MRN-NYSE) serves the world's transportation,
construction, environmental, industrial and power markets as an engineer,
contractor and manufacturer, offering complete development, operations and
financial services.
