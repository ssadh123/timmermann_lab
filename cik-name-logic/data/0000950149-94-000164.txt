(a) Based on a 10% discount factor on the estimated present value of future
operating lease payments.

(b) Safeway's ratios of earnings to fixed charges during 1993 were adversely 
affected by a $54.9 million charge to operating and administrative expense
for severance payments made to retail employees in the Alberta, Canada 
division as part of a voluntary employee buyout. Excluding this charge, 
the ratios of earnings to fixed charges in 1993 were 1.53 for the 24 weeks
ended June 19, 1993, and 1.66 for the 52 weeks ended January 1, 1994.

(c) Safeway's ratio of earnings to fixed charges for 1991 was adversely
affected by a $115 million charge to operating profit in connection with
the bankruptcy of AppleTree Markets, Inc. ("AppleTree"). The $115 million
charge was an estimate of the eventual net lease and related cash payments
which Safeway expected to make over a period of up to 16 years in 
connection with any liability Safeway may have on the leases assigned to 
AppleTree as part of the sale of the Company's former Houston division. 
Excluding this charge, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges for 1991 
would have been 1.44.
