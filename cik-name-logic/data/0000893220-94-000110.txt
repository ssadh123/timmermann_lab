PRO FORMA CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
(Unaudited)

Teleflex Incorporated purchased certain assets and assumed certain
liabilities of Edward Weck Incorporated, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company. Hereafter, these assets and liabilities and the
related revenues and expenses will collectively be referred to as the
"Business".

The pro forma condensed statements of operations are based on the
historical statements of operations of Teleflex Incorporated and the Business
for the nine months ended September 1993 and the twelve months ended December
1992 and reflect the pro forma effects of the acquisition by Teleflex
Incorporated. The pro forma balance sheet is based on the historical balance
sheet of Teleflex Incorporated and the Business as of September 26, 1993 and
reflects the pro forma effects of the acquisition by Teleflex Incorporated.

The pro forma balance sheet has been prepared as if the described
transaction occurred on September 26, 1993. The pro forma statements of
operations have been prepared as if the described transaction had occurred
immediately prior to the beginning of the 12 months ended December 27, 1992 and
the 9 months ended September 26, 1993.

The pro forma condensed statements of operations and the pro forma
balance sheet give effect to the acquisition of the business under the purchase
method of accounting subject to the assumptions in the accompanying notes to
the pro forma financial statements. The total purchase price will be allocated
to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of the Business based
upon their respective fair values. Such allocations will be made based upon
valuations and other studies which have not been finalized. Accordingly, the
allocations of the purchase price included in the pro forma financial
statements are preliminary.

The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for
comparative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what results of
operations or financial position would have been had such events been
consummated during the period or as of the date for which unaudited pro forma
financial information is presented.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

December 17, 1993

To the Board of Directors
and Shareholders of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company

We have audited the accompanying combined statement of assets to be acquired
and liabilities to be assumed and the related combined statement of revenues
and expenses before corporate expenses, interest and income taxes of Edward
Weck Incorporated and related international operations (the "Business") as of
June 30, 1993 and December 31, 1992 and the results of its operations for the
six- month periods ended June 30, 1993 and 1992 and the years ended December
31, 1992 and 1991. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Business' management; our responsibility is to express an opinion of these
financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the combined statement of assets to be acquired and liabilities
to be assumed and the related combined statement of revenues and expenses
before corporate expenses, interest and income taxes audited by us present
fairly, in all material respects, the assets to be acquired and liabilities to
be assumed of the Business as of June 30, 1993 and December 31, 1992 and the
results of its operations for the six-month periods ended June 30, 1993 and
1992 and the years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND BUSINESS

Edward Weck Incorporated ("Weck") is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company ("BMS"). Weck's products are sold outside
the United States through two other wholly owned subsidiaries of BMS -
Zimmer International ("Zimmer") and Convatec, S.A. ("Convatec"). 
During fiscal 1993, BMS initiated discussions to sell certain assets
and liabilities of Weck which are presented in the accompanying
statements. Hereafter, these assets and liabilities and the related
revenues and expenses of Weck and the Weck business within Zimmer and
Convatec will collectively be referred to as the "Business."

The business designs, manufactures, markets and distributes surgical
products that are used by patients, medical practitioners and medical
facilities. The Business' four major product lines include ligation
clips and appliers, hand-held instruments, skin stapling devices and
electrosurgical devices.

Historically, the Business was not defined as a distinct reporting
entity within BMS. As a result, separate historical financial
statements of the Business were not prepared. The accompanying
financial statements have been prepared from the historical
accounting records of Weck and other BMS entities to present assets 
to be acquired and liabilities to be assumed by a potential buyer as
of June 30, 1993 and December 31, 1992 and the revenues and expenses 
before corporate expenses, interest and income taxes of the Business
for the six months ended June 30, 1993 and 1992 and the years ended
December 31, 1992 and 1991. Since only certain assets and liabilities 
are to be sold or assumed, statements of financial position and cash
flows of the Business are not applicable.

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A summary of the significant accounting policies followed by the
Business in preparing these financial statements are as follows:

INVENTORIES
Inventories are presented at the lower of average cost or market value.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment are recorded at historical cost.
Expenditures for additions, renewals and betterments are capitalized
at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the
straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the
related assets as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
YEARS
<S> <C>

Land improvements 25-40
Building and building improvements 50
Machinery and equipment 5-16
Furniture, fixtures and computer equipment 3-10
</TABLE>

Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated
useful life as set forth above or the term of the lease.

REVENUE RECOGNITION
Sales and related costs of products sold are recorded upon shipment.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES
The Business is charged for various services provided by BMS or its
subsidiaries. The more significant of these services include employee
benefits, insurance, customer service, credit and collection,
information systems support, and other general and administrative
support. All liabilities resulting from intercompany allocations have
been excluded from the accompanying financial statements. In
addition, the Business receives other services, primarily legal, tax,
and treasury from BMS without allocated cost.

INCOME TAXES OF
EDWARD WECK INCORPORATED AND RELATED INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

JUNE 30, 1993 AND 1992 AND
DECEMBER 31, 1992 AND 1991 (IN THOUSANDS)

Through February 1993, the Business provided various support services
for product lines sold by other BMS subsidiaries and, accordingly,
certain fixed overhead costs were absorbed by these product lines. 
A portion of The total fixed manufacturing overhead has been allocated
to these other BMS product lines, and the impact of such treatment 
is not included in the accompanying statements. 

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS
Assets of foreign operations are translated at the current exchange
rate at the balance sheet dates and revenues and expenses are 
translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during 
the periods. Gains and losses resulting from transactions denominated 
in a currency other than the operations' functional currencies are 
included in net revenues and expenses before corporate expenses, 
interest and income taxes.

8. RETIREMENT AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

Retirement benefits are provided to all eligible employees through the
Bristol-Myers Squibb Retirement Income Plan (the "Pension Plan"). The
Pension Plan is a noncontributory, defined benefit plan. Benefits are
based primarily on years of credited service and on participants'
compensation. The Business' employees also participate in a defined
contribution plan maintained by BMS which complies with the provisions
of Section 401 (K) of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Savings Plan").

The assets, projected benefit obligation and the related costs
associated with the Pension Plan of the Business are not separately
identifiable. The Business receives an allocation for a share of BMS'
expenses related to the Pension Plan. The expense associated with the
Pension Plan was $515 and $576 for the six months ended June 30, 1993
and 1992, and $1,107 and $1,441 for the years ended December 31, 1992
and 1991. Further, the expense associated with the Savings Plan was
$276 and $314 for the six months ended June 30, 1993 and 1992, and 
$599 and $564 for the years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991. The 
liabilities for benefits under these plans are not included in the 
accompanying statements.

Additionally, BMS provides medical and life insurance benefits for
certain retired employees who reach normal retirement age while working
for the Business. The Business receives an allocation for a share of
the benefits as they are paid by BMS. The liability related to these
benefits is not included in the accompanying statements.

Zimmer and Convatec of $1,745 and $1,445 at June 30, 1993 and December

to the Business, before corporate expenses, interest and income taxes,
total $1,227 and $1,209 for the six months ended June 30, 1993 and 1992
and $2,904 and $81 for the years ended December 31, 1992 and 1991.

10. ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITY

An environmental assessment of a Business property has indicated the
presence of some relatively low levels of contamination. An outside
consultant has been hired to assist in the identification and
quantification of any contamination that may exist, as well as to
suggest appropriate remediation, if any. Weck will retain the
liability for the costs related to any remediation program.
