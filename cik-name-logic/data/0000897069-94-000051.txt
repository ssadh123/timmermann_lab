Item 5. Other Events

On March 16, 1994, the Registrant issued a press release, the
text of which is as follows:

"Lincoln Telecommunications Company today announced
that due to changes in technology, customer growth and usage
demand for cellular services in their respective markets,
Lincoln Telephone Cellular and First Cellular Omaha have entered
into an agreement with AT&T to purchase digital cellular
telephone systems to replace the existing analog systems serving
these markets. These digital systems are expected to increase
capacity and performance in these markets. The new Omaha and
Lincoln systems are expected to be operational in April, 1994
and mid-1995, respectively.

The implementation of these system upgrades will cause the
early retirement of existing analog equipment prior to the expiration
of its anticipated useful life. As a result, Lincoln
Telecommunications will, in the first quarter of 1994, write down the
value of these assets. This write down is expected to result in a
one-time, non-cash reduction of first quarter 1994 earnings of
approximately $3.2 million, or $0.10 per share."
