AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of December 5, 1994 (this

"Agreement"), among CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMPANY, INC., a Delaware corporation
- - ---------- 
("Parent"), CE ACQUISITION COMPANY, INC., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
- - -------- 
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and MAGMA POWER COMPANY, a Nevada
---------- 
corporation (the "Company").
------- 

W I T N E S S E T H:
- - - - - - - - - - 

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
have each approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, it is proposed that Merger Sub will
make a cash tender offer (the "Offer") to acquire 12,400,000 shares of the
----- 
issued and outstanding common stock, $0.10 par value, of the Company, including
the associated Preferred Stock purchase rights (the "Rights") issued pursuant to
------ 
the Rights Agreement dated October 6, 1994 between the Company and Chemical
Trust Company of California, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement") (the
---------------- 
"Company Common Stock"; all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
- - --------------------- 
Stock and the associated Rights being hereinafter collectively referred to as
the "Shares") for $39.00 per Share, or such higher price as may be paid in the
------ 
Offer (the "Per Share Cash Amount"), net to the seller in cash, subject to (i)
--------------------- 
there being validly tendered and not withdrawn before the expiration of the
Offer that number of Shares which, together with Shares beneficially owned by
Merger Sub, represents at least a majority of the Shares outstanding on a fully
diluted basis (the "Minimum Tender Condition") and (ii) Merger Sub having
------------------------ 
obtained sufficient financing to enable it to consummate the Offer (the

"Financing Condition");
- - -------------------- 

WHEREAS, also in furtherance of such acquisition, the Boards of
Directors of the Company and Merger Sub have each approved the merger (the

"Merger") of Merger Sub with and into the Company following completion of the
- - ------- 
Offer in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware

("Delaware Law") and the General Corporation Law of the State of Nevada ("Nevada
- - -------------- ------
Law") and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
- - --- 
Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has resolved to
recommend acceptance of the Offer and the Merger to the holders of Shares and
has determined that the consideration to be paid for each Share in the Offer and
the Merger is fair to the holders of such Shares;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

<PAGE>

2

ARTICLE I
THE TENDER OFFER

SECTION 1.01. The Offer. (a) Provided that this Agreement shall not
--------- 
have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.01 hereof and none of the
events set forth in Annex I hereto shall have occurred or be existing, Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, and Merger Sub shall, commence the Offer as promptly
as practicable, but in no event later than five business days after the date
hereof. The obligation of Parent to accept for payment any Shares tendered
shall be subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Annex I,
including the Minimum Tender Condition. Parent expressly reserves the right to
waive any such condition, to increase the price per Share payable in the Offer,
or to make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer (provided
that no change may be made that decreases the price per Share payable in the
Offer or that imposes additional conditions to the Offer from those set forth in
Annex I hereto). Merger Sub covenants and agrees that, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, unless the Company otherwise consents in writing,
Merger Sub will accept for payment and pay for Shares as soon as it is permitted
to do so under applicable law. The Per Share Cash Amount shall be net to the
seller in cash, subject to reduction only for any applicable Federal back-up
withholding or stock transfer taxes payable by the seller. The Company agrees
that no Shares held by the Company or any of its subsidiaries (as hereinafter
defined) will be tendered pursuant to the Offer.

(b) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the

"Offer to Purchase") having the conditions and provisions set forth in Annex I
- - ------------------ 
hereto. As soon as practicable on the date the Offer is commenced, Parent and
Merger Sub shall file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a
--- 
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule 14D-1 (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-1") with respect to the Offer. The
-------------- 
Schedule 14D-1 will comply in all material respects with the provisions of, and
satisfy in all material respects the requirements of, such Schedule 14D-1 and
all applicable Federal securities laws and will contain (including as an
exhibit) or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase (or portions thereof)
and forms of the related letter of transmittal (which documents, together with
any supplements or amendments thereto, and any other SEC schedule or form that
is filed in connection with the Offer and related transactions, are referred to
collectively herein as the "Offer Documents"). Each of Parent, Merger Sub and
--------------- 
the Company represents and warrants that the information provided and to be
provided by it and/or by its auditors, attorneys, financial advisors or other
consultants or advisors specifically for use in the Schedule 14D-1 and the Offer
Documents on the date filed with the SEC and on the date first published, sent
or given to the Company's stockholders shall not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company agrees promptly to correct any

<PAGE>

3

information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-1 or the Offer Documents
if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect and to supplement the information provided by it specifically
for use in the Schedule 14D-1 or the Offer Documents to include any information
that shall become necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and Parent and
Merger Sub further agree to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-
1, as so corrected or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and the Offer
Documents, as so corrected or supplemented, to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable Federal
securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given the right to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-1 before filing with the SEC.

SECTION 1.02. Company Action. (a) The Company hereby approves of
-------------- 
and consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that the Board of
Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and held on December 5, 1994,
at which a majority of the Directors were present, duly approved and adopted
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger, recommended that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer
and tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer, and determined that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the
Merger, are fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders of the
Company. The Company further represents that Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("Goldman
-------
Sachs") has rendered to the Board of Directors of the Company its opinion as of
- - ----- 
December 5, 1994, to the effect that the consideration to be received by the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to the Offer and the Merger is fair to such
stockholders (other than Parent and its affiliates).

(b) The Company hereby agrees to file with the SEC, as promptly as
practicable after the filing by Parent and Merger Sub of the Schedule 14D-1 with
respect to the Offer, a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on
Schedule 14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, the

"Schedule 14D-9") that will comply in all material respects with the provisions
- - --------------- 
of all applicable Federal securities laws. The Company agrees to mail such
Schedule 14D-9 to the stockholders of the Company promptly after the
commencement of the Offer. The Schedule 14D-9 and the Offer Documents shall
contain the recommendations of the Board of Directors of the Company described
in Section 1.02(a) hereof. The Schedule 14D-9, on the date filed with the SEC
and on the date first published, sent or given to the Company's stockholders,
shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except that no
representation is made by the Company with respect to written information
supplied by Parent or Merger Sub specifically for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-
9. The Company agrees promptly to correct the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the
extent that it shall become false or misleading in any material respect, and
each of Parent and Merger Sub, with respect to written information supplied by
it specifically for use in the

<PAGE>

4

Schedule 14D-9, shall promptly notify the Company of any required corrections of
such information and cooperate with the Company with respect to correcting such
information and to supplement the information contained in the Schedule 14D-9 to
include any information that shall become necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the
Company's stockholders to the extent required by applicable Federal securities
laws. Parent and Merger Sub, and their counsel, shall be given an opportunity
to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 before filing with the SEC.

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly upon
execution of this Agreement furnish Parent and Merger Sub with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and security
position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a recent
date, and shall promptly furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such additional
information, including updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels and
security position listings, and such other information and assistance as Parent
and Merger Sub or their agents may reasonably request for the purpose of
communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares.

SECTION 1.03. Directors. (a) Promptly upon the purchase by Merger
--------- 
Sub of a majority of the outstanding Shares pursuant to the Offer, and from time
to time thereafter as Shares are acquired by Merger Sub, Merger Sub shall be
entitled, subject to compliance with Section 14(f) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), to designate such number of directors, rounded
------------ 
to the nearest whole number (any number ending with .5 being rounded to the next
highest whole number), on the Board of Directors of the Company as will give
Merger Sub representation on the Board of Directors equal to that number of
directors which equals the product of the total number of directors on the Board
of Directors (giving effect to the directors appointed or elected pursuant to
this sentence and including current directors serving as officers of the
Company) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of Shares
beneficially owned by Merger Sub or any affiliate of Merger Sub (including for
purposes of this Section 1.03 such Shares as are accepted for payment pursuant
to the Offer, but excluding Shares held by the Company or any of its affiliates)
bears to the number of Shares outstanding, but in no event less than a majority
of the entire Board of Directors of the Company (regardless of vacancies). At
such times, the Company will also cause (i) each committee of the Board of
Directors, (ii) if requested by Merger Sub, the board of directors of each of
the Company's Subsidiaries (as defined below) and (iii) if requested by Merger
Sub, each committee of such board to include persons designated by Merger Sub
constituting the same percentage of each such committee or board as Merger Sub's
designees are of the Board of Directors. The Company shall, upon request by
Merger Sub, promptly increase the size of the Board of Directors or exercise its
best efforts to secure the resignations of such number of directors as is
necessary to enable Merger Sub designees to be elected to the Board of Directors
and shall cause

<PAGE>

5

Merger Sub's designees to be so elected; provided, however, that such
-------- ------- 
resignations shall not cause the number of Disinterested Directors (as defined
below) to be less than two. Subject to applicable law, the Company shall
promptly take all action necessary pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder in order to fulfill its obligations under
this Section 1.03 and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 mailed to stockholders
promptly after the commencement of the Offer (or an amendment thereof or an
information statement pursuant to Rule 14f-1 if Merger Sub has not theretofore
designated directors) such information with respect to the Company and its
officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in
order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 1.03. Parent and Merger Sub
will supply the Company and be solely responsible for any information with
respect to itself and its nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required
by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

(b) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees
pursuant to this Section 1.03 and prior to the Effective Time, any amendment of
this Agreement or the Restated Articles of Incorporation or Restated Bylaws of
the Company, any termination of this Agreement by the Company, any extension by
the Company of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of Parent or Merger Sub or waiver of any of the Company's rights hereunder,
and any other consent or action by the Board of Directors hereunder, will
require the concurrence of a majority (which shall be at least two) of the
directors of the Company then in office who are not designees of Parent or
Merger Sub (the "Disinterested Directors").
-----------------------

and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and

----------------------------------------------------
Officers. (a) Unless otherwise determined by Parent before the Effective Time,
- - -------- 
at the Effective Time the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in

(b) Subject to Section 2.09, each remaining outstanding Share shall be
converted in the Merger into the right to receive that amount of cash and that
number of shares of common stock, par value $0.0675 per share, of Parent (the

"Parent Common Stock") equal to, at the option of Parent, (i) the All Cash
- - -------------------- 
Component Amount (as defined below), net in cash, without interest thereon, or
(ii) both (A) the Mixed Cash Component Amount (as defined below), net in cash,
without interest thereon, and (B) the number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the quotient of (I) $39.00 less (II) the
Mixed Cash Component Amount divided by the Average Closing Price (as defined
below) (the All Cash Component Amount or (ii)(A) and (ii)(B), collectively, as
applicable, being the "Merger Consideration"). The "Mixed Cash Component
-------------------- --------------------
Amount" shall mean an amount equal to the quotient of (A) (x) $28.50 multiplied
- - ------
by the number of Shares outstanding at the Effective Time less (y) $39.00
multiplied by the number of Shares owned by Parent and any of its affiliates
immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (B) the number of Shares
outstanding at the Effective Time (other than Shares owned by Parent and any of
its affiliates). The "All Cash Component Amount" shall mean an amount equal to
------------------------- 
the quotient of (A) (x) $38.75 multiplied by the number of Shares outstanding at
the Effective Time less (y) $39.00 multiplied by the number of Shares owned by
Parent and any of its affiliates immediately prior to the Effective Time,
divided by (B) the number of Shares outstanding at the Effective Time (other
than Shares owned by Parent and any of its affiliates). The "Average Closing
---------------
Price" shall mean the average closing price of Parent Common Stock on the New
- - ----- 
York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") during the 15 consecutive trading days ending
---- 
on the fifth business day prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that
-------- ------- 
if such average closing price exceeds $18.73, the Average Closing Price shall be
$18.73, and if such average closing price is less than $14.27, the Average
Closing Price shall be $14.27.

(c) All Shares to be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall cease to be outstanding, shall
be canceled

and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate
representing any such Shares shall thereafter cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares, except the right to receive for each of the Shares, upon
the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 2.08, the Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as
contemplated by Section 2.09.

(d) Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub
shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, $.01 par value, of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 2.07. Dissenting Company Common Stock. (a) Notwithstanding
------------------------------- 
any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any Shares held by a holder who
has demanded and perfected his demand for appraisal of his shares of Company
Common Stock in accordance with Nevada Law and as of the Effective Time has
neither effectively withdrawn nor lost his right to such appraisal ("Dissenting
----------
Shares") shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger
- - ------ 
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.06(b), but the holder thereof shall be
entitled to only such rights as are granted by Nevada Law.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section
2.07, if any holder of shares of Company Common Stock who demands appraisal of
his shares under Nevada Law shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure
to perfect or otherwise) his right to appraisal, then, as of the Effective Time
or the occurrence of such event, whichever later occurs, such holder's shares of
Company Common Stock shall automatically be converted into and represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.06(b),
without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates
representing such shares of Company Common Stock.

(c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written
demands for appraisal or payment of the fair value of any Company Common Stock,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments served pursuant to Nevada
Law received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under Nevada Law. The
Company shall not voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal and shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, settle
or offer to settle any such demands.

SECTION 2.08. Surrender of Company Common Stock; Stock Transfer
-------------------------------------------------
Books. (a) Before the Effective Time, the Company and Parent shall designate a
- - -----
bank or trust company to act as agent for the holders of Company Common Stock
(the "Exchange Agent") to receive the funds and securities necessary to make the
-------------- 
payments contemplated by Section 2.06. Such funds shall be invested by the
Exchange Agent as directed by the Surviving Corporation, provided that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or of any agency thereof and backed by the full

<PAGE>

9

faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's Investors Services, Inc. or
Standard & Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in deposit accounts,
certificates of deposit or banker's acceptances of, repurchase or reverse
repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits purchased from,
commercial banks with capital, surplus and undivided profits aggregating in
excess of $200 million (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank which are then publicly available at the SEC or otherwise).

(b) Each holder of a certificate or certificates representing any
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock ("Certificates") canceled upon the
------------ 
Merger pursuant to Section 2.06(b) may thereafter surrender such Certificate or
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, as agent for such holder, to effect the
surrender of such Certificate or Certificates on such holder's behalf for a
period ending one year after the Effective Time.

Any portion of the Merger Consideration which remains unclaimed by the
former stockholders of the Company for one year after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent, upon demand of Parent. Parent agrees that promptly
after the Effective Time it shall cause the distribution to holders of record of
Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time appropriate materials to
facilitate such surrender, including (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates for payment therefor. Upon surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal
duly executed and any other required documents, the holder of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive for each of the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Certificates the Merger Consideration and the Certificates
so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, Certificates
shall represent solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock as contemplated by
Section 2.09 with respect to each of the shares contemplated thereby.

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of canceled
Shares is to be made to a person other than the person in whose name a
surrendered Certificate or instrument is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that the Certificate or instrument so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other taxes required by
reason of such payment in a name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificate or instrument surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid or
is not payable.

(d) At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall not be any
further registration

<PAGE>

10

of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they
shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 2.06(b). No interest shall accrue or be paid on any cash payable upon
the surrender of a Certificate or Certificates which immediately before the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock.

SECTION 2.09. No Fractional Shares. No Certificates or scrip
-------------------- 
representing less than one share of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates representing shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant to Section 2.06(b). In lieu of any such fractional share, each
holder of Shares who would otherwise have been entitled to a fraction of a share
of Parent Common Stock upon surrender of Certificates for exchange pursuant to
Section 2.06(b) shall be paid upon such surrender cash (without interest) in an
amount equal to such holder's proportionate interest in the net proceeds from
the sale or sales in the open market by the Exchange Agent, on behalf of all
such holders, of the aggregate fractional Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to
this Section 2.09. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time the
Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of full shares of
Parent Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent over (ii) the
aggregate number of full shares of Parent Common Stock to be distributed to
holders of Company Common Stock (such excess being herein called the "Excess
------
Shares"), and the Exchange Agent, as agent for the former holders of Company
- - ------ 
Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at the prevailing prices on the NYSE.
The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the
NYSE and shall be executed in round lots to the extent practicable. The
Exchange Agent shall deduct from the proceeds of the sale of the Excess Shares
all commissions, transfer taxes and other reasonable out-of-pocket transaction
costs, including any expenses of the Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with
such sale of Excess Shares. Until the net proceeds of such sale have been
distributed to the former stockholders of the Company, the Exchange Agent will
hold such proceeds in trust for such former stockholders. As soon as
practicable after the determination of the amount of cash to be paid to former
stockholders of the Company in lieu of any fractional interests, the Exchange
Agent shall make available in accordance with this Agreement such amounts to
such former stockholders.

SECTION 2.10. Stock Options; Deferred Stock. Immediately prior to
----------------------------- 
the Effective Time, (a) each unexpired and unexercised option to purchase Shares
(each, a "Company Option"), under the Company's 1987 Stock Option Plan and 1994
-------------- 
Equity Participation Plan (collectively, the "Company Stock Option Plans"),
-------------------------- 
whether or not then exercisable, shall be cancelled by the Company, and each
holder of a cancelled Company Option shall be entitled to receive at the
Effective Time or as soon as practicable thereafter from the Company in
consideration for the cancellation of such Company Option an amount in cash
equal to the product of (i) the number of Shares previously subject to such
Company Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Cash Amount or, if
the election

<PAGE>

11

contemplated by Section 2.06(b)(i) has been made by Parent, $38.75, over the
exercise price per Share previously subject to such Company Option, and (b) each
outstanding unvested share of deferred stock under the Company's 1994 Equity
Participation Plan or otherwise identified on Schedule 4.03 (each, a "Deferred
------------- --------
Share") shall be cancelled by the Company, and each holder of a cancelled
- - ----- 
Deferred Share shall be entitled to receive at the Effective Time or as soon as
practicable thereafter from the Company in consideration for the cancellation of
such Deferred Share an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Cash Amount or, if
the election contemplated by Section 2.06(b)(i) has been made by Parent, $38.75.

SECTION 2.11. Dividends; Transfer Taxes. No dividends or other
------------------------- 
distributions that are declared or made on Parent Common Stock will be paid to
persons entitled to receive certificates representing Parent Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement until such persons surrender their Certificates
representing Company Common Stock. Upon such surrender, there shall be paid to
the person in whose name the certificates representing such Parent Common Stock
shall be issued any dividends or other distributions that shall have become
payable with respect to such Parent Common Stock in respect of a record date
after the Effective Time. In no event shall the person entitled to receive such
dividends be entitled to receive interest on such dividends. Neither the
Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Shares for
any shares of Parent Common Stock or dividends thereon delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable escheat laws.

SECTION 2.12. Stockholders' Meetings. (a) The Company shall take
---------------------- 
all action necessary, in accordance with applicable law and its Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws, to convene a special meeting of the holders of Shares
(the "Company Meeting") as promptly as practicable after consummation of the
--------------- 
Offer for the purpose of considering and taking action upon this Agreement and
the Merger. The stockholder vote required for approval of the Merger will be no
greater than that set forth in Nevada Law. The Board of Directors of the
Company will recommend that holders of Shares vote in favor of and approve the
Merger. The Company will use its best efforts to solicit from stockholders of
the Company proxies in favor of the Merger and will take all other action
necessary or, in the reasonable opinion of Parent, advisable to secure any vote
of stockholders required by Nevada Law to effect the Merger. At the Company
Meeting, all of the Shares then owned by Parent, Merger Sub, or any other
subsidiary of Parent, or with respect to which Parent, Merger Sub, or any other
subsidiary of Parent holds the power to direct the voting, will be voted in
favor of approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement.

(b) Parent shall take all action necessary, unless Parent has elected
the All Cash Component under Section 2.06(b)(i), in accordance with applicable
law and its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws, to convene a special
meeting of the holders of Parent Common Stock (the "Parent Meeting") as promptly
-------------- 
as practicable after consummation of the Offer for the purpose of considering
and taking action to (i) authorize the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant
to the Merger under the applicable guidelines of the NYSE

<PAGE>

12

(the "Parent Share Proposal") and (ii) authorize the increase of the authorized
--------------------- 
Parent Common Stock from 60,000,000 shares to no more than 80,000,000 shares or
such greater number of shares as shall be required to issue the Parent Common
Stock in the Merger. The Board of Directors of Parent will (i) recommend that
holders of Parent Common Stock vote in favor of and approve the Parent Share
Proposal at the Parent Meeting and (ii) recommend that holders of Parent Common
Stock vote in favor of and approve an amendment to its Certificate of
Incorporation increasing the authorized Parent Common Stock from 60,000,000
shares to no more than 80,000,000 shares or such greater number of shares as
shall be required to issue the Parent Common Stock in the Merger (the "Charter
-------
Amendment"). Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from
- - --------- 
stockholders of Parent proxies in favor of the Parent Share Proposal and the
Charter Amendment and will take all other action necessary or, in the reasonable
opinion of the Company, advisable to secure any vote of stockholders required by
Delaware Law to effect the Merger.

SECTION 2.13. Board Nominees; Assistance in Consummation of the
-------------------------------------------------
Merger. (a) Parent will nominate and use its best efforts to cause up to two
- - ------ 
nominees of the Company designated in writing to Parent prior to the closing of
the Merger to be elected or appointed as members of the Board of Directors of

reasonable assistance to, and shall cooperate with, each other to bring about
the consummation of the Offer and the Merger as soon as possible in accordance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Parent shall cause Merger Sub

------------- 
14D-1 or in the Parent SEC Reports, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have
conducted their business only in the ordinary course and in a manner consistent

----------------- 
have good and marketable title, or valid leasehold rights in the case of leased
property, to all real property and all personal property purported to be owned

------------- 
claims, actions, suits, proceedings or investigations pending or, to the best
knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries, or any properties or rights of Parent or any of the Parent

authority or body, domestic or foreign, which are reasonably likely, in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect or would, and are reasonably likely
to, prevent or delay the performance of this Agreement. As of the date hereof,

subject to any order, judgment, injunction or decree having a Material Adverse
Effect.

SECTION 3.10. Financing Arrangements. Parent and Merger Sub have

obtained a commitment letter from Credit Suisse with respect to the financing
for the Offer and the Merger (the "Commitment Letter"). The Commitment Letter

liabilities incurred in connection with its incorporation or organization or the
negotiation and consummation of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated

-------------- 
"Parent Benefit Plans"), Parent has made available to the Company a true and
- - --------------------- 
correct copy of (i) the most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the

Parent or any Parent Subsidiary has, with respect to any Parent Benefit Plan,
engaged in or been a party to any "prohibited transaction," as such term is

Code, and each such Parent Benefit Plan will be amended in the manner required
by the Code by December 31, 1994, and has been or will be submitted to the IRS

qualification and exemption from taxation under Section 401(a) and 501(a) of the
Code. No Parent Benefit Plan has plan assets invested in any insurance company

SECTION 4.17. Employee Benefit Plans; Labor Matters. (a) With

respect to each U.S. or foreign employee benefit plan, program, arrangement and
contract (including, without limitation, any "employee benefit plan", as defined

in Section 3(3) of ERISA) and any executive compensation arrangement, whether or
not funded, maintained or contributed to by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or with respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
could incur liability under Section 4069, 4212(c) or 4204 of ERISA, as well as
any employee benefit plan that is subject to Section 412 of the Code or Title IV
of ERISA and which is maintained or contributed to by any other trade or
business (whether or not incorporated) which is treated as a single employer
with the Company under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each such
trade or business being referred to herein as a "Code Affiliate") (the "Company
-------------- -------
Benefit Plans"), the Company has made available to Parent a true and correct
- - ------------- 
copy of (i) the most recent annual report (Form 5500) filed with the IRS, (ii)
such Company Benefit Plan, (iii) each trust agreement relating to such Company
Benefit Plan, (iv) the most recent summary plan description for each Company
Benefit Plan for which a summary plan description is required, (v) the most

could be subject to any liability under the terms of such Company Benefit Plans,
ERISA, the Code or any other applicable Law which would have a Material Adverse

threatened by the IRS, the Department of Labor or

<PAGE>

33

any participant of a Company Benefit Plan that the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries has, with respect to any Company Benefit Plan, engaged in or been a
party to any "prohibited transaction", as such term is defined in Section 4975
of the Code and Section 406 of ERISA, which could result in the imposition of
either a penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502 of ERISA or a tax imposed by
Section 4975 of the Code, in each case applicable to the Company, any Subsidiary
or any Company Benefit Plan. Each Company Benefit Plan intended to qualify
under Section 401(a) of the Code does so qualify, and the trusts created

Company Benefit Plan will be amended in the manner required by the Code by

March 31, 1995 for a determination letter confirming that such Company Benefit
Plan meets the currently applicable requirements for qualification and exemption

Plan has plan assets invested in any insurance company which is or has been in
insolvency proceedings within the last 3 years. No Company Benefit Plan subject
to Section 412 of the Code has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as
defined in ERISA), whether or not waived. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries or Code Affiliates has at any time since 1987 maintained or
contributed to any Company Benefit Plan, including without limitation any
"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA), which (i) is a

the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or any state, local or foreign
agency responsible for the prevention of unlawful employment practices, and

its Subsidiaries pending or, to the Company's knowledge, threatened which may
interfere with the respective business activities of the Company or its

stoppage would not have a Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, to
the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
their respective representatives or employees, has committed any unfair labor
practices in connection with the operation of the respective businesses of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, and there is no charge or complaint against the

applicable law or rules.

Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to (x) honor all employment, change

welfare benefits) that are no less favorable, taken as a whole, than the

and bonus plans) as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the
extent that service is relevant for eligibility, vesting or benefit calculations
or allowances (including, without limitation, entitlements to vacation and sick
days) under any plan or arrangement maintained in order to provide the benefits
described in the preceding sentence, such plan or arrangement shall credit
employees for service on or prior to the Effective Time with the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

cause the Surviving Corporation to (or the Company may prior to the Effective
Time) amend each demand note made in favor of the Company by an employee of the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries (each of which has been made available to
Parent) to provide that (x) such demand note will not be repayable on demand
from the Company and (y) upon the involuntary termination without cause of the
employment of such employee, all sums owed under such demand note shall be
payable in equal quarterly installments over a period of not less than 36
months.

(d) With respect to each employee of the Company (other than employees
of the Company which are parties to a "change in control" or "severance"
agreements referred to in the Previous 14D-9) who is, within the one year period
following the closing of the Offering, either (i) terminated without cause or
(ii) terminated as a result of a reduction in force, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to make the following payments:

(1) if, upon the effective date of such employee's termination,
such employee has less than one year's service with the Company, a
payment equal to three months base salary plus an amount equal to one-
fourth of the prior years targeted bonus for such employee, payable in
twelve equal installments over the twelve months following such
termination; or

<PAGE>

46

(2) if, upon the effective date of such employee's termination, such
employee has one year or more of service with the company, a payment
equal to six months base salary plus an amount equal to one-fourth of
the prior years targeted bonus for each such employee, payable in
twelve equal installments over the twelve months following such
termination.

For the purposes of subclauses (1) and (2), if an employee was not
eligible for a bonus in the referenced prior year, then the targeted bonus for
the current year shall be used. An employee shall not be eligible for the
payments specified in subclauses (1) or (2) if such employee's termination
relates to a reduction in force referred to subclause (ii) above and such
employee has been offered a comparable position (in terms of compensation) by
Parent at any location; provided however, that no such amounts referenced in (1)
-------- ------- 
and (2) will be payable if, in the good faith determination of the Company, the
employee's job performance did not merit continued employment or offer of
relocation to a comparable position. An employee may not receive the severance
payments contemplated by this Section 6.10(d) and also receive any severance
payments under the Company's severance policy covered by Sections 6.10(a) and
(b) and identified on a schedule hereto.

CALIFORNIA ENERGY AND MAGMA POWER REACH
MERGER AGREEMENT AT $39 PER SHARE

Omaha, Nebraska and San Diego, California, December 5, 1994 - California
Energy Company, Inc. (NYSE, PSE, LSE: CE) and Magma Power Company (NASDAQ: MGMA)
today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement which
provides for Magma shareholders to receive a price of $39 net per share in a
combination of $28.50 in cash and $10.50 in market value of California Energy
common stock, or approximately $950 million in aggregate value on a fully
diluted basis.

Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, California Energy will commence no 
later than Friday, December 9 a cash tender offer for a majority of Magma's 
common stock at $39 per share in cash. The tender offer will remain open for 20 
days, and if over-subscribed, will be pro-rated. As soon as practicable 
thereafter, California Energy will complete the acquisition of all remaining

<PAGE>

shares in a second step merger transaction by issuing for each Magma share a
combination of cash and California Energy common shares totalling $39, or, at
its option, approximately $38.50 per share in cash. If California Energy stock
is to be received in the merger, the number of shares to be issued will be
increased or decreased by up to 13.5% based on the difference between $16.50 and
the average daily closing price of California Energy during the fifteen trading
days ending on the fifth business day prior to the consummation of the merger.

California Energy's tender offer is subject to valid tender of shares 
representing a majority of the voting power of Magma, funding of financing, and 
other customary closing conditions. In addition, the merger (though not the 
tender) is conditioned, if California Energy shares are to be issued, on 
approval of California Energy's shareholders. Under the agreement, Magma has 
agreed to render Magma's shareholders rights plan inapplicable to the tender 
offer and merger and to waive applicable Nevada anti-takeover statutes. The 
Hart-Scott-Rodino antitrust waiting period has expired with respect to the 
transaction. The parties have also agreed to terminate all litigation between 
them.

The agreement has been approved by the Boards of Directors of both 
companies. Magma Power's Board has determined, after thoroughly exploring 
alternatives in consultation with its independent financial advisors, that the 
terms of the offer and merger are fair to, and in the best interests of, its 
stockholders and recommends that stockholders tender their Magma shares into 
California Energy's tender offer.

Following the merger, the combined companies will have projected annual
revenues in excess of $400 million, its facilities will produce in excess of
545MW of power and will have an additional 530MW of power under construction.
The combined companies will constitute the largest independent geothermal power
company in the world with operations in the U.S., Philippines and Indonesia.

David L. Sokol, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of California Energy, 
said: "The combination of our two organizations creates a geothermal company 
with unparalleled technical, geological, developmental and operational skills. 
We fully believe that this merger will accelerate the achievement of our 
strategic objectives and will enhance our international expansion efforts. We 
welcome the family of talented Magma employees onto our team and we anticipate a
smooth transition."

Paul Pankratz, Chairman of Magma, said: "We believe this transaction 
reflects Magma's inherent strengths and outstanding prospects. The combined 
company will be the largest and most technically advanced global competitor in 
the geothermal energy industry -- well positioned to capitalize on growth 
opportunities worldwide.

Ralph Boeker, President and Chief Executive Officer of Magma, said: "Magma 
brings excellent people, technology and projects into this combination. We look 
forward to working with California Energy to ensure the success of this great 
combined company."
