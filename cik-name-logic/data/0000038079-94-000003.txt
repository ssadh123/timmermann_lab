Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On December 30, 1993, Forest Oil Corporation (Forest)
completed the purchase of a 35.65% working interest in the Loma
Vieja/Martinez Field located in Zapata and Jim Hogg Counties,
Texas, from Wagner & Brown, Ltd. for a total consideration of $60
million. The property had gross daily production of
approximately 61 million cubic feet of natural gas from 11 wells.

Forest completed the purchase on December 10, 1993 of the
interest of Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO) in Chandeleur Sound
32 offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and two onshore fields, Barbers
Hill Field and the Katy Field in the Gulf Coast area for $26.5
million. These properties have daily net production of
approximately 6.5 million cubic feet of natural gas and 600
barrels of oil.

On December 14, 1993, Forest also purchased interests in
five offshore fields in the Gulf Coast area from Sandefer
Offshore Company (Sandefer) for $24.7 million. The estimated
recoverable reserves from these properties are approximately 19.3
billion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.5 million barrels of oil
and condensate.

Forest acquired additional working interests in two of the
properties it acquired in late 1993 from ARCO. The interests
acquired were the remaining 30% working interest (and operatorship) 
in Chandeleur Sound 32 from Davis Petroleum Corp. for $3.5 million 
on December 28, 1993 and an additional 1% working interest in the 
Katy Field in Texas from Eland for $860,000 on January 6, 1994.

On December 30, 1993, Forest closed a non-recourse loan
agreement arranged by Enron Finance Corp., an affiliate of Enron
Gas Services, that provides for borrowings of up to $70 million.
Approximately $51.6 million was advanced to Forest in 1993 to
provide financing for a portion of the offshore Louisiana and
South Texas properties acquired from Wagner & Brown, Ltd. and
Sandefer, as described above.

Another $5.8 million of the loan proceeds were advanced in
1993 for development work. Under the terms of the loan agreement, 
additional funds may be advanced to fund a portion of the development 
projects which will be undertaken by Forest on the properties pledged 
as security for the loan.

Forest entered into a $50,000,000 secured master credit
facility with The Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. as agent on December
1, 1993. Under the credit facility, Forest may initially borrow
up to $25,000,000 for the acquisition or development of proved
oil and gas reserves, which amount is subject to semi-annual
redetermination, and up to $10,000,000 for working capital and
general corporate purposes. The credit facility is secured by a
mortgage on substantially all of Forest's existing proved oil and
gas properties and related assets, subject to existing liens of
volumetric production payment agreements. The maturity date of
loans under the facility is December 31, 1996.
