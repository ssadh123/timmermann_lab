Summary: Rochester Tel and WCT Sign Extended Letter of Intent at 
Same Cash Consideration of $7.10 Per Share

Rochester, New York -- October 15, 1994 -- Rochester Telephone
Corporation (NYSE: RTC) and WCT Communications (NASDAQ: WCTI) today
announced that they have executed an amended and restated Letter of
Intent that extends the period to November 7 under which the parties
will seek to execute definitive agreements. The Letter of Intent
provides for the same consideration of $7.10 per share as was
previously announced. The parties have also agreed to effect the
transaction by means of a cash merger.

As a result, the parties agreed that the previously announced tender
offer, which was scheduled to commence on Monday, October 17 by Rochester
Tel for all the outstanding shares of WCT at $7.10 per share, would be
withdrawn because the parties have not yet signed definitive agreements.

The restated Letter of Intent may be terminated by either party if
definitive agreements have not been executed and the respective Boards
of Directors of Rochester Tel and WCT have not approved the acquisition
by November 7, 1994. The Letter of Intent contemplates the satisfactory
completion of due diligence by Rochester Tel by November 7, 1994.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Since definitive agreements remain to be negotiated, there can be
no assurance that a transaction will ultimately be consummated. The
transaction remains subject to several conditions, including necessary
regulatory approvals, including those of the New York State Public
Service Commission, if required, and the California Public Utilities
Commission. However, since due diligence will be completed prior to
execution of the definitive agreements, the consummation of the cash
merger will not be subject to further due diligence.

Rochester Telephone Corporation is a provider of integrated
telecommunications solutions to more than 1.5 million customers in the
Northeast, South and Midwest through its long distance, local telephone
and wireless communications operations.
