ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

Effective July 31, 1994, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (the "Company")
purchased from CRSS Inc. ("CRSS") the engineering and construction management
service businesses of CRSS (the "Business to be Acquired"). The cash purchase
price was equal to the net book value of the Business to be Acquired on the
closing date, plus $14.0 million. On the closing date, the Company paid CRSS
$33.5 million; an amount equal to the estimated net book value of the Business
to be Acquired on that date, plus $14.0 million. The net book value on the
closing date of the Business to be Acquired is subject to an audit which will
determine the final purchase price and any difference between that amount and
the amount paid on the closing date will be settled between the parties.

In the transaction, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets 
of CRS Sirrine Engineers, Inc. ("CRS Sirrine"), subject to certain assumed 
liabilities, all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of CRSS 
Constructors, Inc. and CRSS International, Inc. and the assets, subject to 
certain assumed liabilities, or all of the issued and outstanding equity 
securities, of certain insignificant subsidiaries of CRSS. Excluded from the 
businesses acquired were the assets and liabilities of four power plant projects
of CRS Sirrine. These projects were either substantially complete or in the 
later stages of completion. Additionally, CRSS agreed to share in the future 
profit margin improvement or deterioration on certain projects defined in the 
purchase agreement.

On August 5, 1994, the Company filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") which described this
transaction. That report indicated that the financial statements required by
Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X and the pro forma financial information required by
Article 11 of Regulation S-X will be filed by the Company in accordance with the
rules and regulations of the Commission. This form 8-K/A files all such

responsibility of the Company. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test

the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As described in Note 1, these financial statements reflect the financial
position and operations of the Business to be Acquired From CRSS
Services, Inc., which was sold to Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. on July
29, 1994.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial position of the

the combined results of its operations and its cash flows for the year

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION

The accompanying financial statements represent the combined financial
position, operating results, and cash flows of all of the issued and
outstanding equity securities of CRSS Constructors, Inc., CRSS International,
Inc., and CRSS of New York, Inc., and substantially all the assets of CRS
Sirrine Engineers, Inc. ("Engineers"), CRSS Civil Engineers, Inc. ("Civil
Engineers"), and CRSS of Illinois, Inc. ("Illinois"), subject to agreed upon
liabilities of Engineers, CRSS Enterprises, Inc., Civil Engineers, and Illinois,
collectively referred to as the "Business to be Acquired From CRSS Services,
Inc.," which was sold to Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. ("Jacobs") as part of the
Purchase Agreement between Jacobs and CRSS Inc. dated July 29, 1994.

The entities referred to above as the Business to be Acquired From CRSS
Services, Inc., are wholly owned subsidiaries of CRSS Services, Inc.
("Services"), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of CRSS Inc.

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost
basis of accounting reflected in the financial and accounting records of
Services.

The operating results and financial position of the Business to be Acquired From
CRSS Services, Inc., presented in the accompanying financial statements do not
necessarily reflect the operating results and financial position which would
have occurred had the Business to be Acquired from CRSS Services, Inc., been an
unaffiliated, stand-alone entity for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.

The Business to be Acquired From CRSS Services, Inc., provides comprehensive
engineering, construction management, and program management services to
industrial, institutional, commercial, and public sector clients in both the
domestic and international markets.

All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Revenues earned on long-term contracts are reported using the percentage-of-
completion method, based primarily on contract costs incurred to date versus
total anticipated contract costs. Where a single contract has both design and
construction as identifiable

BUSINESS TO BE ACQUIRED FROM CRSS SERVICES, INC.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

segments, revenue recognition is segmented resulting in market levels of
profitability for each segment. Where there is a change in the estimate to
complete a project, the Business to be Acquired From CRSS Services, Inc.,
follows the "cumulative catch-up" method. Charges are made to operations for
estimated losses when such losses become known.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed primarily
on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related
assets. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; improvements
are capitalized.

JOINT PROJECTS

The Business to be Acquired From CRSS Services, Inc., is involved in several
associations with unrelated parties formed for the purpose of undertaking a
single, agreed-upon project. The joint projects generally maintain contract-
related trade receivables, payables, and cash without any long-term assets or
liabilities and require little, if any, initial investment by the Business to be
Acquired From CRSS Services, Inc. The Company's share of joint project
operations is included within the combined financial statements.

INCOME TAXES

The Business to be Acquired From CRSS Services, Inc., is not a separate taxable
entity for federal or state income tax purposes. The operations of the Business
to be Acquired From CRSS Services, Inc., are included in the CRSS Inc.
consolidated federal income tax return and various state returns. No portion of
Services' or CRSS Inc.'s income tax expense has been allocated to the Business
to be Acquired From CRSS Services, Inc. All income taxes payable and deferred
income tax accounts related to the Business to be Acquired From CRSS Services,
Inc., were retained by Services and CRSS Inc.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Earnings per share information has been omitted since the Business to be
Acquired From CRSS Services, Inc., has no publicly traded equity securities.

filed against the engineering and construction professions, alleging primarily
professional errors, omissions, and/or delays. CRSS Inc. has agreed to indemnify
Jacobs against legal claims arising from any acts, errors, or omissions prior to
August 1, 1994. As such, the Business to be Acquired From CRSS Services, Inc.
combined financial statements do not include any provisions for uninsured

of the opinion that its contractual relationships with these agencies are in

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Introductory Paragraphs:

Effective July 31, 1994, Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. (the "Company")
purchased from CRSS Inc. ("CRSS") the engineering and construction management
service businesses of CRSS (the "Business to be Acquired"). The cash purchase
price was equal to the net book value of the Business to be Acquired on the
closing date, plus $14.0 million. On the closing date, the Company paid CRSS
$33.5 million, an amount equal to the estimated net book value of the Business
to be Acquired on that date, plus $14.0 million. The net book value on the
closing date of the Business to be Acquired is subject to an audit which will
determine the final purchase price and any difference between that amount and
the amount paid on the closing date will be settled between the parties. A draft
balance sheet of the Business to be Acquired as of the closing date indicates
that the net book value of its assets were $24.7 million at that date,which
would indicate a cash purchase price of $38.7 million.

In the transaction, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets 
of CRS Sirrine Engineers, Inc. ("CRS Sirrine"), subject to certain assumed 
liabilities, all of the issued and outstanding equity securities of CRSS 
Constructors, Inc. and CRSS International, Inc. and the assets, subject to 
certain assumed liabilities, or all of the issued and outstanding equity 
securities, of certain insignificant subsidiaries of CRSS. Excluded from the 
businesses acquired were the assets and liabilities of four power plant projects
of CRS Sirrine. These projects were either substantially complete or in the 
later stages of completion. Additionally, CRSS agreed to share in the future 
profit margin improvement or deterioration on certain projects defined in the 
purchase agreement.

The accompanying unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial
statements present, in columnar form, the condensed historical financial
statements of the Company and the Business to be Acquired, pro forma adjustments
and the pro forma results. The columns titled "Jacobs Engineering (as reported)"
were prepared from audited and unaudited financial statements filed with the
Commission. The columns titled "Businesses Acquired (historical)" were prepared
from the unaudited books and records of the Business to be Acquired, and
excludes corporate allocations of general and administrative expenses which
historically were charged to the Business to be Acquired by CRSS. The most
recent fiscal year of CRSS prior to the transaction ended June 30, 1994.
Accordingly, the historical financial information of the businesses acquired has
been adjusted to conform to the Company's fiscal year end of September 30, 1993.
The historical financial information of the businesses acquired has also been
adjusted to exclude the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the
four power projects not acquired by the Company.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(a) This adjustment reflects the pro forma effect on cash at June 30, 1994
giving effect to the $8.4 million of cash used by the Company to acquire
the businesses.

(b) This adjustment reflects the pro forma goodwill amount at June 30, 1994.
The goodwill amount was assumed to be $14.0 million (the premium paid over
the net book value of the acquired businesses) and does not include other
costs of the acquisition, nor any adjustments that may occur as a result of
the allocation of the purchase price which will be completed in accordance
with APB Opinion No. 16, as amended.

(c) In connection with the acquisition, the Company amended one of its existing
short-term credit facilities to increase the borrowing capacity thereunder.
The Company then borrowed $25.0 million under the amended facility to
complete the purchase of the acquired businesses. The Company expects to
enter into a definitive, three-year revolving credit agreement to replace
that portion of the amended facility used to finance the acquisition. This
pro forma adjustment reflects the effect of that financing on the June 30,
1994 balance sheet.

(d) This adjustment eliminates the equity of the businesses acquired as of the 
date of acquisition.

(e) These adjustments reflect the pro forma amortization of goodwill (which
is assumed to be amortized over a 30-year period).

(f) These adjustments reflect the pro forma effects on net interest expense as 
a result of the estimated $38.7 million cash purchase price.

(g) These adjustments reflect the pro forma effects on consolidated income tax
expense due to the results of operations of the Business to be Acquired,
the pro forma amortization of goodwill and the pro forma interest expense
associated with the acquisition indebtedness.
