AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of June 11, 1994 (this
"Agreement"), by and between Shawmut National Corporation, a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), and Northeast Federal Corp., a Delaware corporation
("Target").

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent and Target have
determined that it is in the best interests of their respective companies and
their shareholders to consummate the business combination transaction provided
for herein in which a subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub") will, subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein, merge (the "Merger") with and into
Target; and

WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations,
warranties and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to
be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the
"DGCL"), at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2 hereof), Merger Sub
shall merge with and into Target. Target shall be the surviving corporation
(hereinafter sometimes called the "Surviving Corporation") in the Merger, and
shall continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware
as a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent. Upon consummation of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall terminate.

1.2 Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective as set
forth in the certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") which shall be
filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Secretary") on
the Closing Date (as defined in Section 9.1 hereof). The term "Effective Time"
shall be the date and 

<PAGE>

time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Certificate of
Merger.

1.3 Effects of the Merger. At and after the Effective Time,
the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Sections 259 and 261 of the
DGCL.

1.4 Conversion of Target Common Stock; Target Preferred Stock. 
(a) At the Effective Time, subject to Section 2.2(e) hereof, each share of the
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Target (the "Target Common Stock")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares of Target Common Stock held (x) in Target's treasury or (y) directly or
indirectly by Parent or Target or any of their respective Subsidiaries (as
defined below) (except for Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares, as such terms
are defined in Section 1.4(b) hereof)) shall, by virtue of this Agreement and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into the
number of shares (the "Exchange Ratio") of common stock, par value $.01 per
share, of Parent ("Parent Common Stock") (together with the number of Parent
Rights (as defined in Section 4.2 hereof) associated therewith) determined as
follows:

(i) if the Parent Common Stock Average Price (as defined in
Section 8.1(g) hereof) is greater than or equal to
$26.235, the Exchange Ratio will be .415;

(ii) if the Parent Common Stock Average Price is less than
$26.235 but equal to or greater than $21.465, the
Exchange Ratio will be (i) $10.875 divided by (ii) the
Parent Common Stock Average Price; or

(iii) if the Parent Common Stock Average Price is less than
$21.465, the Exchange Ratio will be .507.

All of the shares of Target Common Stock converted into Parent
Common Stock pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate
(each a "Certificate") previously representing any such shares of Target Common
Stock shall thereafter represent the right to receive (i) a certificate
representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and (ii) cash in
lieu of fractional shares into which the shares of Target Common Stock
represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to this Section
1.4(a) and Section 2.2(e) hereof. Certificates previously representing shares
of Target Common

<PAGE>

Stock shall be exchanged for certificates representing whole shares of Parent
Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares issued, in consideration
therefor upon the surrender of such Certificates in accordance with Section
2.2 hereof, without any interest thereon. If prior to the Effective Time
Parent should split or combine its common stock, or pay a dividend or other
distribution in such common stock, then the Exchange Ratio shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such split, combination, dividend or
distribution.

(b) At the Effective Time, all shares of Target Common Stock
that are owned by Target as treasury stock and all shares of Target Common
Stock that are owned directly or indirectly by Parent or Target or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (other than shares of Target Common Stock held directly
or indirectly in trust accounts, managed accounts and the like or otherwise
held in a fiduciary capacity that are beneficially owned by third parties (any
such shares, and shares of Parent Common Stock which are similarly held,
whether held directly or indirectly by Parent or Target or any of their
respective subsidiaries, as the case may be, being referred to herein as "Trust
Account Shares") and other than any shares of Target Common Stock held by
Parent or Target or any of their respective Subsidiaries in respect of a debt
previously contracted (any such shares of Target Common Stock, and shares of
Parent Common Stock which are similarly held, whether held directly or
indirectly by Parent or Target or any of their respective subsidiaries, being
referred to herein as "DPC Shares")) shall be cancelled and shall cease to
exist and no stock of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor. All shares of Parent Common Stock that are owned by Target
or any of its Subsidiaries (other than Trust Account Shares and DPC Shares)
shall become treasury stock of Parent.

(c) At and after the Effective Time each share of the $8.50
Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B, of Target (the "Target Series B Preferred
Stock"), outstanding shall remain outstanding.

1.5 Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock. Each of the 100
shares of the common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Merger Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall by virtue of this
Agreement and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into and exchangeable for one share common stock, par value $1.00, of
the Surviving Corporation, which shall thereafter constitute all of the issued
and outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation.

<PAGE>

1.6 Options and Warrants. At the Effective Time, each option
and warrant granted by Target to purchase shares of Target Common Stock which
is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior thereto shall be converted
automatically into an option or warrant, as the case may be, to purchase shares
of Parent Common Stock in an amount and at an exercise price determined as
provided below (and, in the case of options, otherwise subject to the terms of
the 1983 Stock Option Plan of Target, The 1986 Stock Option Plan of Target, the
Target 1993 Stock Option Plan, or the Target 1993 Stock Option Plan for Three
Year Term Outside Directors, as the case may be (each a "Target Stock Option
Plan"; collectively the "Target Stock Option Plans") or, in the case of
warrants, otherwise subject to the terms of the Stock Warrants, each dated
April 22, 1992, of Target (the "Target Warrants")):

(a) The number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be subject
to the new option or warrant shall be equal to the product of the
number of shares of Target Common Stock subject to the original option
or warrant and the Exchange Ratio, provided that any fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock resulting from such multiplication shall be
rounded to the nearest whole share; and

(b) The exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock under
the new option or warrant shall be equal to the exercise price per
share of Target Common Stock under the original option or warrant
divided by the Exchange Ratio, provided that such exercise price shall
be rounded to the nearest cent.

The adjustment provided herein with respect to any options which are "incentive
stock options" (as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code")) shall be and is intended to be effected in a manner
which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. The duration and other
terms of the new option or warrant shall be the same as the original option or
warrant, except that all references to Target shall be deemed to be references
to Parent.

1.7 Certificate of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of Target, as in effect at the Effective Time,
shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation.

1.8 By-Laws. At the Effective Time, the By-Laws of Merger Sub,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the By-Laws of
the Surviving

<PAGE>

Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with applicable law.

1.9 Directors and Officers. The directors and officers of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and
officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with
the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified,
provided that so long as the Target Series B Preferred Stock is outstanding by
the terms thereof, and DEPCO or any Nominee (each as defined in Section 3.27)
is entitled to elect directors of Target pursuant to the terms of the Target
Series B Preferred Stock, the directors elected by the holders of the Target
Series B Preferred Stock shall be directors of the Surviving Corporation.

1.10 Tax Consequences. It is intended that the Merger shall
constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code,
and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan of reorganization" for the
purposes of Section 368 of the Code.

ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF SHARES

2.1 Parent to Make Shares Available. As of the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust
company selected by Parent (which may be a Subsidiary of Parent) (the "Exchange
Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, for exchange in
accordance with this Article II, certificates representing the shares of Parent
Common Stock and the cash in lieu of fractional shares (such cash and
certificates for shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund") to be issued pursuant to Section 1.4 and paid pursuant to
Section 2.2(a) in exchange for outstanding shares of Target Common Stock.

2.2 Exchange of Shares. (a) As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate or Certificates a form letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon actual receipt of the Certificates by the Exchange Agent)
and 

<PAGE>

instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock and
cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, into which the shares of Target
Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Certificates shall
have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. Upon proper surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation, together with
such properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of
such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a
certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder of Target Common Stock shall have become entitled pursuant to
the provisions of Article I hereof and (y) a check representing the amount of
cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, which such holder has the right to
receive in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on the cash in lieu of
fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to
holders of Certificates. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, no certificate representing Parent Common Stock or cash in lieu of a
fractional share interest shall be delivered to a person who is an Affiliate
(as defined in Section 6.5) of Target unless such Affiliate has theretofore
executed and delivered to Parent the agreement referred to in Section 6.5.

(b) No dividends or other distributions payable after the
Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof shall duly surrender
such Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall
be entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions, without any
interest thereon, which became payable with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock represented by such Certificate after the Effective Time but on or
before the time of such surrender. No holder of an unsurrendered Certificate
shall be entitled, until the surrender of such Certificate, to vote the shares
of Parent Common Stock into which his or her Target Common Stock shall have
been converted.

(c) If any certificate representing shares of Parent Common
Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the
issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
(or accompanied by an appropriate

<PAGE>

instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the
person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any
transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate
representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other
reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
tax has been paid or is not payable.

(d) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on
the stock transfer books of Target of the shares of Target Common Stock which
were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for
certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock as provided in this
Article II.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no dividend or
distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with
respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not
entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of
Target. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay
to each former stockholder of Target who otherwise would be entitled to receive
a fractional share of Parent Common Stock an amount in cash determined by
multiplying (i) the average of the closing-sale prices of Parent Common Stock
on the New York Stock Exchange as reported by The Wall Street Journal for the
five trading days immediately preceding the date of the Effective Time by (ii)
the fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.4 hereof.

(f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by
the stockholders of Target for six months after the Effective Time shall be
paid to Parent. Any stockholders of Target who have not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their
shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of fractional shares and unpaid
dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect
of each share of Target Common Stock such stockholder holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. 
Notwithstanding

<PAGE>

the foregoing, none of Parent, Target, the Exchange Agent or any other person
shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Target Common Stock for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar laws.

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock and cash in
lieu of fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on Parent
Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF TARGET

Target hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub
as follows:

3.1 Corporate Organization. (a) Target is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
Delaware. Target has the corporate power and authority to own or lease all of
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed or qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined
below) on Target. As used in this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse
Effect" means, with respect to Parent, Target or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, a material adverse effect on the business, properties, assets,
liabilities, prospects, results of operations or financial condition of such
party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or the ability of any party to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the terms hereof, it being
understood that a Material Adverse Effect will not include a change with
respect to, or effect on, such entity resulting from a change in law, rule,
regulation, generally accepted or regulatory accounting

<PAGE>

principles, or a change with respect to, or effect on, such entity resulting
from any other matter affecting financial institutions or their holding
companies generally. As used in this Agreement, the word "Subsidiary" when
used with respect to any party means any corporation, partnership or other
organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, which is consolidated
with such party for financial reporting purposes or of which the party holds
25% or more of the shares. Target is duly registered as a savings and loan
holding company under the Home Owners' Loan Act, as amended ("HOLA"). The
copies of the Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of Target which have
previously been delivered to Parent are true, complete and correct copies of
such documents as in effect as of the date of this Agreement.

(b) Northeast Savings, F.A. ("Target Bank") is a federal
savings and loan association or savings bank duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the United States. The deposit accounts
of Target Bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the
"FDIC") through the Savings Association Insurance Fund (the "SAIF") to the
fullest extent permitted by law, and all premiums and assessments required in
connection therewith have been paid by Target Bank. Target Bank is the only
direct Subsidiary of Target, and is the only Subsidiary of Target that is a
"Significant Subsidiary" as such term is defined in Regulation S-X promulgated
by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Target Bank has the
corporate power and authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted and is duly licensed
or qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or the location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on Target. The copies of the Federal Stock Charter and
By-laws of Target Bank which have previously been delivered to Parent are true,
complete and correct copies of such documents as in effect as of the date of
this Agreement.

(c) The minute books of Target and Target Bank accurately
reflect in all material respects all corporate actions held or taken since
January 1, 1989 of their respective stockholders and Boards of Directors
(including committees of their respective Boards of Directors).

3.2 Capitalization. (a) The authorized capital stock of
Target consists of 25,000,000 shares of Target Common Stock and 15,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par

are (x) 13,519,193 shares of Target Common Stock issued and outstanding and
no shares of Target Common Stock held in Target's treasury and 402,576 shares
of Target Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding, (y) no shares of
Target Common Stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock
options or warrants or otherwise except for (i) 1,497,292 shares of Target
Common Stock reserved for issuance pursuant to the Target Stock Option Plans
and (ii) 800,000 shares of Target Common Stock reserved for issuance pursuant
to the Target Warrants and (z), except for the 402,576 shares of Target
Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding and shares of such stock
which may be issued in payment for dividends on the Target Series B Preferred
Stock, no shares of Target Preferred Stock are issued or outstanding or
reserved for issuance. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Target
Common Stock and Target Series B Preferred Stock have been authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership
thereof. Except as referred to above or reflected in Section 3.2(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule which is being delivered to Parent concurrently herewith
(the "Target Disclosure Schedule"), Target does not have and is not bound by
any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or
agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares
of Target Common Stock or Target Preferred Stock or any other equity security
of Target or any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise
receive any shares of Target Common Stock or any other equity security of
Target. The names of the optionees, the date of each option to purchase Target
Common Stock granted, the number of shares subject to each such option, the
expiration date of each such option, and the price at which each such option
may be exercised under the Target Stock Option Plans are set forth in Section
3.2(a) of the Target Disclosure Schedule. Except as set forth in
Section 3.2(a) of the Target Disclosure Schedule, since March 31, 1994, Target
has not issued any shares of its capital stock or any securities convertible
into or exercisable for any shares of its capital stock, other than pursuant to
the exercise of employee or director stock options granted prior to such date
and except for Series B Preferred Stock issued in payment of dividends on
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock. Section 3.2(a) of the Target
Disclosure Schedule sets forth the number of shares of Target Common Stock
issued and outstanding as of the date of this Agreement. Target has reserved
an adequate number of shares to cover exercise of options under the

<PAGE>

currently outstanding options granted pursuant to the Target Stock Option Plans.

(b) Section 3.2(b) of the Target Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a true and correct list of all of the Target Subsidiaries as of the date of
this Agreement. Except as set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the Target Disclosure
Schedule, Target owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the Target Subsidiaries, free
and clear of all liens, charges, encumbrances and security interests whatso-
ever, and all of such shares are duly authorized and validly issued and are
fully paid, nonassessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal
liability attaching to the ownership thereof. Each Target Subsidiary is duly
organized and validly existing as a corporation or partnership under the laws
of its jurisdiction of organization. No Target Subsidiary has or is bound by
any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or
agreements of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares
of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary or any
securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any shares
of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary. Assuming
compliance by Parent with Section 1.6 hereof and except pursuant to the DEPCO
Agreement (as defined in Section 3.27), at the Effective Time, there will not
be any outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or
agreements of any character by which Target or any of its Subsidiaries will be
bound calling for the purchase or issuance of any shares of the capital stock
of Target or any of its Subsidiaries.

3.3 Authority; No Violation. (a) Target has full corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
validly approved by the Board of Directors of Target. The Board of Directors
of Target has directed that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby be submitted to Target's stockholders for approval at a meeting of such
stockholders and, except for the adoption of this Agreement by the requisite
vote of Target's stockholders, no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Target are necessary to approve this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly and validly
executed and delivered by Target and constitutes a valid and binding obligation
of Target.

<PAGE>

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.3(b) of the Target
Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement by

or thereby, nor compliance by Target with any of the terms or provisions hereof
or thereof, will (i) violate any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation
or By-Laws of Target or the certificate of incorporation, by-laws or similar
governing documents of Target Bank or (ii) assuming that the consents and
approvals referred to in Section 3.4 hereof are duly obtained, (x) violate any

Target or Target Bank is a party, or by which they or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound or affected, except (in the case of clause
(y) above) for such violations, conflicts, breaches or defaults which, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not have or be reasonably likely to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Target.

Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

3.5 Loan Portfolio; Reports. (a) Except as set forth in
Section 3.5(a) of the Target Disclosure Schedule, as of March 31, 1994, neither
Target nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any written or oral (i) loan
agreement, note or borrowing arrangement (including, without limitation,
leases, credit enhancements, commitments, guarantees and interest-bearing
assets) (collectively, "Loans"), other than Loans the unpaid principal balance
of which does not exceed $100,000, under the terms of which the obligor was, as
of March 31, 1994, over 90 days delinquent in payment of principal or interest
or in default under any other provision, or (ii) Loan to any director,
executive officer or ten percent stockholder of Target or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of Target, any person, corporation or
enterprise controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of the
foregoing. Section 3.5(a) of the Target Schedule sets forth (i) all of the
Loans of Target or any of its Subsidiaries the unpaid principal amount in
excess of (A) $100,000 that as of the date of this Agreement are internally
classified as "Substandard," "Doubtful," "Loss," or "Classified," (B) $100,000
that as of the date of this Agreement are internally classified as
"Criticized," "Other Loans Especially Mentioned" or "Special Mention",
(C) $750,000 that as of the date of this Agreement are internally classified as
"Credit Risk Assets," "Concerned Loans," "Watch List" or words of similar
import, in each case together with the principal amount of and accrued and
unpaid interest on each such Loan and the identity of the borrower thereunder,
and (ii) by category of Loan (i.e., commercial, consumer, etc.), all of the
other Loans of Target and its Subsidiaries that as of the date of this
Agreement are classified as such, together with the aggregate principal amount
of and accrued and unpaid interest on such Loans by category. Target shall
promptly inform Parent of any Loan that becomes classified in the manner
described in the previous sentence, or any Loan the classification of which is
changed, at any time after the date of this Agreement. Target and its
Subsidiaries have internally classified, in the manner described above, all
Loans that any auditor or government examiner has criticized or classified, and
the internal classification of such Loans is at

<PAGE>

least as strict as the criticism or classification thereof by an auditor or
government examiner.

registrations and statements, together with any amendments required to be made

and except as otherwise disclosed in Section 3.5(b) of the Target Disclosure
Schedule, no Regulatory Agency has initiated any proceeding or, to the best
knowledge of Target, investigation into the business or operations of Target or
any of its Subsidiaries since January 1, 1989. Except as otherwise disclosed
in Section 3.5(b) of the Target Disclosure Schedule, there is no material
unresolved violation, criticism, or exception by any Regulatory Agency with
respect to any report or statement relating to any examinations of Target or
any of its Subsidiaries.

Brothers Inc. ("Lehman Brothers") in accordance with the terms of a letter
agreement between Lehman Brothers and Target, a true, complete and correct copy
of which has been previously delivered by Target to Parent.

3.8 Absence of Certain Changes or Events. (a) Except as may
be set forth in Section 3.8(a) of the Target Disclosure Schedule or as
disclosed in Target's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March
31, 1994, true, complete and correct copies of which have previously been

Disclosure Schedule or as disclosed in Target's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q

Subsidiaries have carried on their respective businesses in the ordinary and
usual course consistent with prudent banking practices.

or perquisites payable to any executive officer, employee, or director from the
amount thereof in effect as of December 31, 1993, granted any severance or

3.9 Legal Proceedings. (a) Except as set forth in
Section 3.9(a) of the Target Disclosure Schedule, neither Target nor any of its
Subsidiaries is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the best of
Target's knowledge, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other
proceedings, claims, actions or governmental or regulatory investigations of
any nature against Target or any of its Subsidiaries as to which there is a
reasonable probability of an adverse determination and (i) which, if adversely

Effect on Target or the Surviving Corporation or (ii) challenging the validity
or propriety of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Except as otherwise disclosed in Section 3.9(b) of the
Target Disclosure Schedule, there is no injunction, order, judgment, decree, or

all pending litigation involving any

<PAGE>

claim against the Target Bank or any of its Subsidiaries, whether directly or by
counterclaim, involving a "lender liability" cause of action.

3.10 Taxes and Tax Returns. (a) Except as may be reflected in
Section 3.10 of the Target Disclosure Schedule or, in the aggregate, otherwise
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Target, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, each of Target and its Subsidiaries has duly filed all Federal,
state, and to the best of its knowledge, county, local and foreign Tax returns
(including, without limitation, information returns and returns of estimated
tax) required to be filed by it on or prior to the date hereof (all such
returns being accurate and complete) and has duly paid or made adequate
provision for the payment of all Taxes (as defined below) that have been
incurred by it or are due or claimed to be due from it by Federal, state,
county, local or foreign taxing authorities on or prior to the date of this
Agreement (including, without limitation, if and to the extent applicable,
those due in respect of its properties, income, business, capital stock,
deposits, franchises, licenses, sales and payrolls) other than Taxes that are
being contested in good faith (and which are set forth in Section 3.10 of the
Target Disclosure Schedule). The income tax returns of Target and its
Subsidiaries have been examined by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") for
all years through and including 1979, and the deficiencies (if any) asserted as
a result of such examination either, in the aggregate, were not material, or
have been satisfied. Except as may be reflected in Section 3.10 of the Target
Disclosure Schedule there are no material disputes pending, or claims asserted
for, Taxes or assessments upon Target or any of its Subsidiaries, nor does
Target or any of its Subsidiaries have outstanding any currently effective
waivers extending the statutory period of limitation applicable to any Federal,
state, county, local or foreign income tax return for any period. In addition,
(i) proper and accurate amounts have been withheld by Target and its
Subsidiaries from their employees, customers, depositors, shareholders and
others from whom they are required to withhold Tax in compliance with all
applicable Federal, state, county, local and foreign laws, except where the
failures to do so would not, in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect
on Target, Parent or the Surviving Corporation and (ii) there are no Tax liens
upon any property or assets of the Target or its Subsidiaries except liens for
current Taxes not yet due. Except as, in the aggregate, would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on Target, Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or as
disclosed in Section 3.10 of the Target Disclosure Schedule, to the best of its
knowledge, (i) no property of Target or

<PAGE>

any of its Subsidiaries is property that Target or any of its Subsidiaries is
or will be required to treat as being owned by another person pursuant to the
provisions of Section 168(f)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as
amended (as in effect prior to its amendment by the Tax Reform Act of 1986)
or is "tax-exempt use property" within the meaning of Section 168(h) of the
Code; (ii) neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries has been required to
include in income any adjustment pursuant to Section 481 of the Code by
reason a voluntary change in accounting method initiated by Target or any of
its Subsidiaries, and the Internal Revenue Service has not initiated or
proposed any such adjustment or change in accounting method; and (iii)
neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into a transaction
which is being accounted for as an installment obligation under Section 453
of the Code.

(b) As used in this Agreement, the term "Tax" or "Taxes" means
all Federal, state, county, local, and foreign income, excise, gross receipts,
ad valorem, profits, gains, transfer gains, property, sales, transfer, use,
payroll, employment, severance, withholding, backup withholding, intangibles,
franchise, and other taxes, governmental charges, levies or like assessments
together with all penalties and additions to Tax and interest thereon.

(c) Target Bank, at the close of its most recent taxable year,
qualified, and on the Closing Date will qualify either as a "domestic building
and loan association" within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(19) of the Code or
as a "mutual savings bank" within the meaning of Section 591(b) of the Code
that meets the requirements of Section 7701(a)(19)(C) of the Code.

3.11 Employees. (a) The Target Reports (as defined in Section
3.12 hereof) accurately describe all bonus, deferred compensation, pension,
retirement, profit-sharing, thrift, savings, employee stock ownership, stock
bonus, stock purchase, restricted stock and stock option plans, all employment
or severance contracts, other material employee benefit plans and any
applicable "change of control" or similar provisions in any plan, contract or
arrangement which cover employees or former employees of Target or its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the "Compensation and Benefit Plans") required to
be described in such Target Reports. The Compensation and Benefit Plans and
all other benefit plans, contracts or arrangements covering directors,
employees or former employees of Target or its Subsidiaries (the "Employees"),
including, but not limited to, "employee benefit plans" within the meaning of
Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended

<PAGE>

("ERISA"), are listed in Section 3.11 of the Target Disclosure Schedule. True
and complete copies of all Compensation and Benefit Plans and such other
benefit plans, contracts or arrangements, including, but not limited to, any
trust instruments and/or insurance contracts, if any, forming a part of any
such plans and agreements, and all amendments thereto, including but not
limited to (i) the actuarial report for such plan (if applicable) for each of
the last two years, and (ii) the most recent determination letter from the IRS
(if applicable) for such plan, have heretofore been delivered to Parent.

(b) All employee benefit plans, other than "multiemployer
plans" within the meaning of Sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, covering
Employees (the "Plans"), to the extent subject to ERISA, are in substantial
compliance with ERISA. Each Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA ("Pension Plan") and which is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986, as amended (the "Code"), has received a favorable determination letter
from the IRS, and Target is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in
revocation of any such favorable determination letter. The 1985 Target
Employee Stock Ownership Plan satisfies the requirements for an employee stock
ownership plan under Section 4975(e)(7) of the Code. There is no material
pending or threatened litigation relating to the Plans. Neither Target nor any
of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any Plan that,
assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof,
could subject Target or any of its Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by
either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which
would be material.

(c) No liability under Subtitle C or D of Title IV of ERISA has
been or is expected to be incurred by Target or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to any ongoing, frozen or terminated "single-employer plan", within the
meaning of Section 4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by
any of them, or the single-employer plan of any entity which is considered one
employer with Target or any of its Subsidiaries under Section 4001 of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate"). Target and its Subsidiaries
have not incurred and do not expect to incur any withdrawal liability with
respect to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA
(regardless of whether based on contributions of an ERISA Affiliate). No
notice of a "reportable event", within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for
which the 30-day reporting requirement has not been waived, has been required

<PAGE>

to be filed for any Pension Plan or by any ERISA Affiliate within the 12-month
period ending on the date hereof.

(d) All contributions required to be made under the terms of
any Plan have been timely made. Neither any Pension Plan nor any single-
employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate has an "accumulated funding deficiency"
(whether or not waived) within the meaning of Section 412 of the Code or
Section 302 of ERISA. Neither Target nor its Subsidiaries has provided, or is
required to provide, security to any Pension Plan or to any single-employer
plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code.

(e) Under each Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, as
of the last day of the most recent plan year ended prior to the date hereof,
the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit liabilities", within
the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as determined on the basis of the
actuarial assumptions contained in the Plan's most recent actuarial valuation),
did not exceed the then current value of the assets of such Plan, and there has
been no material change in the financial condition of such Plan since the last
day of the most recent Plan Year. The withdrawal liability of Target and its
Subsidiaries under each Benefit Plan which is a multiemployer plan to which
Target, its Subsidiaries or an ERISA Affiliate has contributed during the
preceding 12 months, determined as if a "complete withdrawal", within the
meaning of Section 4203 of ERISA, had occurred as of the date hereof, does not
exceed $100,000.

(f) Neither Target nor its Subsidiaries has any obligations for
retiree health and life benefits under any Plan, except as set forth in Section
3.11 of the Target Disclosure Schedule. Except as set forth in Section 3.11 of
the Target Disclosure Schedule, there are no restrictions on the rights of
Target or its Subsidiaries to amend or terminate any such Plan without
incurring any liability thereunder.

(g) Target and its Subsidiaries have no material unfunded
liabilities with respect to any Pension Plan which covers foreign Employees.

(h) Neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party
to, or is bound by, any collective bargaining agreement, contract, or other
agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization, nor is
Target or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of any material proceeding
asserting that Target or any such Subsidiary has

<PAGE>

committed an unfair labor practice or seeking to compel Target or such
Subsidiary to bargain with any labor organization as to wages or conditions of
employment, nor is there any strike involving Target or any of its
Subsidiaries pending or, to the best of Target's knowledge, threatened, nor
is Target aware of any activity involving its or any of its Subsidiaries'
employees seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or engaging in any
other organizational activity.

3.12 SEC Reports. Target has made or will make available to
Parent an accurate and complete copy of each (a) registration statement,
prospectus, report, schedule, proxy statement, information statement or other
stockholder communication used, circulated or filed after January 1, 1990 by
Target, and no such registration statement, prospectus, report, schedule, proxy
statement, information statement or communication, each in the form (including
exhibits and amendments thereto) filed with the SEC (or if not so filed, in the
form first used or circulated) (collectively, the "Target Reports"), contained,
as of its date, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading. Target has timely filed, and will timely file, all Target Reports
and other documents required to be filed by it under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") and the Exchange Act, and, as of their
respective dates, all Target Reports complied in all material respects with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto.

3.13 Target Information The information relating to or
provided by Target and its Subsidiaries to be contained or incorporated by
reference in the Proxy Statement and the registration statement on Form S-4
(the "S-4") in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, or
in any other document filed with any other regulatory agency in connection
herewith, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading. 
The Proxy Statement (except for such portions thereof that relate only to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries) will comply in all material respects with
the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

3.14 Compliance with Applicable Law. Except as disclosed in
Section 3.14 of the Target Disclosure Schedule, Target and each of its
Subsidiaries hold, and have at all

<PAGE>

times held, all material licenses, franchises, permits and authorizations
necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective businesses under and
pursuant to all, and have complied with and are not in default in any respect
under any, applicable laws, statutes, orders, rules, regulations, policies
and/or guidelines of any Governmental Entity relating to Target or any of its
Subsidiaries, except where the failure to hold such license, franchise, permit
or authorization or such noncompliance or default would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Target or the Surviving
Corporation, and neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has
received notice of, any violations of any of the above.

3.15 Certain Contracts. (a) Except as set forth in
Section 3.15(a) of the Target Disclosure Schedule, neither Target nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any contract, arrangement,
commitment or understanding (whether written or oral) (i) with respect to the
employment of any directors, officers, employees or consultants, (ii) which,
upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
(either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional acts or events) result
in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise) becoming due from
Parent, Target, Target Bank, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any officer or employee thereof, (iii) which is a
material contract (as defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)

(iv) which is a consulting agreement (including data processing, software
programming and licensing contracts) not terminable on 60 days or less notice

such agreement, (v) which materially restricts the conduct of any line of
business by Target or Target Bank, or (vi) (including any stock option plan,
stock appreciation rights plan, restricted stock plan or stock purchase plan)
any of the benefits of which will be increased, or the vesting of the benefits
of which will be accelerated, by the occurrence of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or the value of any of the benefits of which
will be calculated on the basis of any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Target has previously delivered to Parent true and correct copies
of all employment, consulting and deferred compensation agreements which are in
writing and to which Target or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. Each
contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in
this

<PAGE>

Section 3.15(a), whether or not set forth in Section 3.15(a) of the Target
Disclosure Schedule, is referred to herein as a "Target Contract," and neither
Target nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice of, any

Disclosure Schedule, (i) each Target Contract is valid and binding and in full
force and effect, (ii) Target and each of its Subsidiaries has in all material
respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it to date under
each Target Contract, except where such noncompliance, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Target, and (iii) no
event or condition exists which constitutes or, after notice or lapse of time
or both, would constitute, a material default on the part of Target or any of
its Subsidiaries under any such Target Contract, except where such default,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on
Target.

3.16 Agreements with Regulatory Agencies. Except as disclosed
in the Target Reports or as set forth in Section 3.16 of the Target Disclosure 
Schedule, neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any cease-

the conduct of its business or that in any manner relates to its capital
adequacy, its credit policies, its management or its business, nor has Target
or any of its Subsidiaries been advised by any regulatory Agency or other
Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing or requesting any Regulatory
Agreement.

Material Adverse Effect on Target, Target and each of its Subsidiaries owns or

all material patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trade names, servicemarks and

material respects performed all the obligations required to be performed by
them and are not in default in any material respect under any contract,
agreement, arrangement or commitment relating to any of the foregoing, except

are fully reflected or reserved against on the consolidated balance sheet of
Target included in its Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 1994 and
(c) for liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

6.1 Regulatory Matters. (a) Target shall promptly prepare and
file with the SEC the Proxy Statement and Parent shall promptly prepare and
file with the SEC the S-4, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a
prospectus. Each of Parent and Target shall use all reasonable efforts to have
the S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable
after such filing, and Target shall thereafter mail the Proxy Statement to its
stockholders. Parent shall also use all reasonable efforts to obtain all
necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals required to
carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Target shall
furnish all information concerning Target and the holders of Target Common
Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.

<PAGE>

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other and use
their reasonable best efforts promptly to prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings, and
to obtain as promptly as practicable all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities which are
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including without limitation the Merger) (it being understood that
any amendments to the S-4 or a resolicitation of proxies as a consequence of an
acquisition agreement by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries shall not violate
this covenant). Target and Parent shall have the right to review in advance,
and to the extent practicable each will consult the other on, in each case
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the
information relating to Target or Parent, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, which appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to provide either party
with a right to review any information provided to any Governmental Entity on a
confidential basis in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto shall act reasonably
and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree that they will
consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and each party will keep the other apprised of the status of matters
relating to completion of the transactions contemplated herein.

(c) Parent and Target shall, upon request, furnish each other
with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary
or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other
statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, Target
or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(d) Parent and Target shall promptly advise each other upon
receiving any communication from any Governmental Entity whose consent or
approval is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement

<PAGE>

which causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that
any Requisite Regulatory Approval will not be obtained the receipt of any such
approval will be materially delayed.

6.2 Access to Information. (a) Upon reasonable notice and
subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, Target
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers,
employees, accountants, counsel and other representatives of Parent, access,
during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time, to
all its properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and, during such
period, Target shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, make available to
Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other
document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of Federal securities laws or Federal or state banking, savings
and loan or savings association laws (other than reports or documents which
Target is not permitted to disclose under applicable law) and (ii) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request. Neither Target nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or
disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights of Target's customers,
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or
control of such information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment, decree, fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the
date of this Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute
disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the
preceding sentence apply. Parent will hold all such information in confidence
to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
confidentiality agreement between Parent and Target (the "Confidentiality
Agreement").

(b) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws
relating to the exchange of information, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, afford to the officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
other representatives of Target, access, during normal business hours during
the period prior to the Effective Time, to such information regarding Parent
and its Subsidiaries as shall be reasonably necessary for Target to fulfill its
obligations pursuant to this Agreement to prepare the Proxy Statement or which
may be reasonably necessary for Target to confirm that the representations and
warranties of Parent contained herein are true and correct and that the
covenants of Parent contained herein have been performed in all

<PAGE>

material respects. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required
to provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure
would violate or prejudice the rights of Parent's customers, jeopardize the
attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or control of such
information or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

(c) All information furnished by Parent to Target or its
representatives pursuant hereto shall be treated as the sole property of Parent
and, if the Merger shall not occur, Target and its representatives shall return
to Parent all of such written information and all documents, notes, summaries
or other materials containing, reflecting or referring to, or derived from,
such information. Target shall, and shall use its best efforts to cause its
representatives to, keep confidential all such information, and shall not
directly or indirectly use such information for any competitive or other
commercial purpose. The obligation to keep such information confidential shall
continue for five years from the date the proposed Merger is abandoned and
shall not apply to (i) any information which (x) was legally in Target's
possession prior to the disclosure thereof by Parent; (y) was then generally
known to the public; or (z) was disclosed to Target by a third party not bound
by an obligation of confidentiality or (ii) disclosures made as required by
law. It is further agreed that, if in the absence of a protective order or the
receipt of a waiver hereunder Target is nonetheless, in the written opinion of
its outside counsel, compelled to disclose information concerning Parent to any
tribunal or governmental body or agency or else stand liable for contempt or
suffer other censure or penalty, Target may disclose such information to such
tribunal or governmental body or agency without liability hereunder.

(d) No investigation by either of the parties or their
respective representatives shall affect the representations and warranties of
the other set forth herein.

(e) Within ten business days of the date of this Agreement,
Target shall deliver to Parent amended Section 3.17 of the Target Disclosure
Statement setting forth an investment securities report which includes pay down

<PAGE>

factors, paydown speeds, durations, and weighted average life, in each case as
of March 31, 1994.

6.3 Stockholders Meeting. Target shall take all steps
necessary to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
stockholders to be held as soon as is reasonably practicable after the date on
which the S-4 becomes effective for the purpose of voting upon the approval of
this Agreement. Target will, through its Board of Directors, except to the
extent legally required for the discharge of the fiduciary duties of such board
as advised in writing by such Board's outside counsel, recommend to its
stockholders approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and such other matters as may be submitted to its stockholders in
connection with this Agreement. Target and Parent shall coordinate and
cooperate with respect to the foregoing matters.

6.4 Legal Conditions to Merger. Each of Parent and Target
shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best efforts
(a) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable
to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed on such
party or its Subsidiaries with respect to the Merger and, subject to the
conditions set forth in Article VII hereof, to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (b) to obtain (and to cooperate with the
other party to obtain) any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity and any other third party which is
required to be obtained by Target or Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

6.5 Affiliates. Target shall use its best efforts to cause
each director, executive officer and other person who is an "affiliate" (for
purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act) of Target (each an "Affiliate")
to deliver to Parent, as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
and prior to the date of the stockholders meeting called by Target to approve
this Agreement, a written agreement, in substantially the form of Exhibit 6.5
hereto.

6.6 Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its best efforts
to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
approved for listing on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE"), subject
to official notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

<PAGE>

6.7 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance. (a) 
In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without
limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation in which
any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director or officer or
employee of Target or any of its Subsidiaries (the "Indemnified Parties") is,
or is threatened to be, made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to any action or omission by such
person in his or her capacity as a director, officer or employee of Target, any
of the Target Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors, whether in
any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the parties
hereto agree to cooperate and use their best efforts to defend against and
respond thereto. It is understood and agreed that after the Effective Time,
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent provided
in Target's Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and permitted by Delaware
law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses (including, to the extent so provided and
permitted, reasonable attorney's fees and expenses in advance of the final
disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation upon receipt of any
undertaking required by applicable law or Target's Certificate of Incorporation
or Bylaws), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with
any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation,
and in the event of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after the
Effective Time), an Indemnified Party may retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to him or her after consultation with Parent; provided, however,
that (1) Parent shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and upon
such assumption Parent shall not be liable to any Indemnified Party for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by
any Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
Parent elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties
reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties that there are issues which raise
conflicts of interest between Parent and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them after
consultation with Parent, and Parent shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses
of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2) Parent shall be obligated
pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties, (3) Parent shall not be liable for any

<PAGE>

settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld) and (4) Parent shall have no obligation hereunder
to any Indemnified Party when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and
nonappealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited under applicable law. Any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim Indemnification under this Section 6.7, upon learning of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify Parent
thereof, provided that the failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations
of Parent under this Section 6.7 except to the extent such failure to notify
materially prejudices Parent. Parent's obligations under this Section 6.7
continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any claim (a "Claim") asserted or made within such period shall
continue until the final disposition of such Claim.

(b) Parent shall use its best efforts to cause the persons
serving as officers and directors of Target immediately prior to the Effective
Time to be covered for a period of four (4) years from the Effective Time by
the directors' and officers' liability insurance policy maintained by Target
(provided that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same
coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions, including limits,
deductibles and prior acts coverage, which are not less advantageous than such
policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
which were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as such;
provided, however, that, in the event that the annual amount Parent would be
required to expend would be more than 200% of the current annual amount
expended by Target (the "Insurance Amount") to maintain insurance coverage for
such persons under Target's current policies, Parent may self insure; and
further provided that if Parent is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance
called for by this Section 6.7(b), Parent shall use its best efforts to obtain
as much comparable insurance as available for the Insurance Amount. Nothing in
this Section 6.7(b) shall be deemed to modify any existing contractual
obligations under any agreements of Target or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its

<PAGE>

properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent
necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent assume the obligations set forth in this section.

(d) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or
her heirs and representatives.

6.8 Subsequent Financial Statements. As soon as reasonably
available, but in no event more than 45 days after the end of each fiscal
quarter ending after the date of this Agreement, Parent will deliver to Target
and Target will deliver to Parent their respective Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q, as filed with the SEC under the Exchange Act.

6.9 Additional Agreements. In case at any time after the
Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement, or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises
of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each
party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such
necessary action as may be reasonably requested by, and at the sole expense of,
Parent.

6.10 Advice of Changes. Parent and Target shall promptly
advise the other party of any change or event having a Material Adverse Effect
on it or which it believes would or would be reasonably likely to cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties or
covenants contained herein. From time to time prior to the Effective Time,
each party will promptly supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules delivered
in connection with the execution of this Agreement to reflect any matter which,
if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to be set forth or described in such Disclosure Schedules or which is
necessary to correct any information in such Disclosure Schedules which has
been rendered inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such
Disclosure Schedules shall have any effect for the purpose of determining
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2(a) or 7.3(a) hereof, as
the case may be, or the compliance by Target or Parent, as the case may be,
with the respective covenants set forth in Sections 5.1 and 5.2 hereof.

6.11 Current Information. During the period from the date of
this Agreement to the Effective Time, Target

<PAGE>

will cause one or more of its designated representatives to confer on a regular
and frequent basis (not less than monthly) with representatives of Parent and
to report (i) the general status of the ongoing operations of Target and its
Subsidiaries and (ii) the status of, and the action proposed to be taken with
respect to, those Loans held by Target or any Target Subsidiary which,
individually or in combination with one or more other Loans to the same
borrower thereunder, have an unpaid principal amount of $100,000 or more and
are non-performing assets. Target will promptly notify Parent of any material
change in the normal course of business or in the operation of the properties
of Target or any of its Subsidiaries and of any governmental complaints,
investigations or hearings (or communications indicating that the same may be
contemplated), or the institution or the threat of significant litigation
involving Target or any of its Subsidiaries, and will keep Parent fully
informed of such events. 

6.12 Termination of Regulatory Agreements. Target shall, and
shall cause Target Bank to, use its reasonable best efforts in cooperation with
Parent to confirm that all Regulatory Agreements to which Target or Target Bank
is or becomes subject to will be terminated and of no further force and effect
at or prior to the Effective Time.

6.13 Tax Returns. Target shall prepare and file, as approved
and directed by Parent, any Tax returns (including, without limitation, New
York Real Property Transfer and Transfer Gains Tax pre-clearance forms) with
respect to the Merger as Parent shall reasonably request.

6.14 Employee Benefit Plans; Existing Agreements. (a) Except
as otherwise provided herein, the employees of Target and its Subsidiaries (the
"Target Employees") shall be entitled to participate in Parent's employee
benefit plans in which similarly situated employees of Parent participate, to
the same extent as comparable employees of Parent. As soon as administratively
practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall permit the Target Employees
to participate in Parent's group hospitalization, medical, life and disability
insurance plans, defined benefit pension plan, thrift plan, severance plan and
similar plans, on the same terms and conditions as applicable to comparable
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the waiver of pre-existing
condition prohibitions), giving effect to years of service with Target and its
Subsidiaries (to the extent Target gave effect) as if such service were with
Parent, for purposes of eligibility and vesting, but not for benefit accrual
purposes (except as regards to

<PAGE>

vacation, severance and short-term disability accruals or for purposes of
determining employer contributions for retiree medical benefits).
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.14 to the contrary, participation
by Target Employees in employee benefit plans and programs of Parent with
respect to which eligibility for employees of Parent to participate is at the
discretion of Parent shall be at the sole discretion of Parent.

(b) Following the Effective Time, Parent shall honor and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor in accordance with their terms
all individual employment, severance and other compensation agreements existing
prior to the execution of this Agreement, which are between Target and any
director, officer or employee thereof and which have been disclosed in the
Target Disclosure Schedule. 

(c) To the extent not duplicative of any agreement or
arrangement described in paragraph (b) above, Parent agrees to make the
payments and provide the benefits set forth on Exhibit 6.14(c)(1) to the
employees of Target or Target Bank (the names of which shall be set forth on
Section 3.11 of the Target Disclosure Schedule). Parent further agrees to
honor and cause the Surviving Corporation to honor the retirement plan, in
substantially the form attached as Exhibit 6.14(c)(2) hereto, previously
adopted for the members of the board of directors of Target.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.14 to the
contrary, Parent shall have sole discretion with respect to the determination
as to whether to terminate, merge or continue any employee benefit plans and
programs of Target; provided, however, that Parent shall continue to maintain
Target plans (other than stock-based or incentive plans) until Target Employees
are permitted to participate in Parent's plans.

that are necessary to the consummation of this Agreement (other than immaterial
consents, the failure to obtain which would not have a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent (on a combined basis giving effect to the Merger)); provided,
however, that no approval, consent or waiver referred to in this Section 7.1(c)
shall be deemed to have been received if it shall include any condition or
requirement that, in the opinion of Parent, would so materially adversely
affect the economic or business benefits of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement to Parent as to render inadvisable the consummation of the
Merger; provided further, that no condition or requirement which does no more
than subject Parent or Target to legal requirements generally applicable to a
bank holding company under the BHC Act or savings and loan holding company
under HOLA as a matter of law shall be deemed to affect materially and
adversely the economic or business benefits of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (all such approvals and the expiration of all such waiting

the Code and that accordingly:

(i) No gain or loss will be recognized by Parent, Merger Sub
or Target as a result of the Merger; and

(ii) No gain or loss will be recognized by the stockholders
of Target who or which exchange their Target Common Stock solely for
Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger (except with respect to cash

succession by the Surviving Corporation pursuant to the Merger to any
obligation, right or interest of Target or any Subsidiary of Target under any
loan or credit agreement, note, mortgage, indenture, lease, license or other
agreement or instrument shall have been obtained, except where the failure to
obtain such consent, approval or waiver would not materially adversely affect
the economic or business benefits of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to Parent as to render inadvisable the consummation of the Merger.

(d) No Pending Governmental Actions. No proceeding initiated
by any Governmental Entity seeking an Injunction shall be pending.

(e) DEPCO Directors. (i) DEPCO or any "Nominee" as defined in
the DEPCO Agreement (A) shall own all of the issued and outstanding shares of

<PAGE>

(b) by either Parent or Target upon written notice to the other
party (i) ninety (90) days after the date on which any request or application
for a Requisite Regulatory Approval shall have been denied or withdrawn at the
request or recommendation of the Governmental Entity which must grant such
Requisite Regulatory Approval, unless within the 90-day period following such
denial or withdrawal a petition for rehearing or an amended application has
been filed with the applicable Governmental Entity, provided, however, that no
party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(b)(i) if such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal shall be
due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform
or observe the covenants and agreements of such party set forth herein or (ii)
if any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction shall have issued a final
nonappealable order enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(c) by either Parent or Target if the Merger shall not have
been consummated on or before June 30, 1995, unless the failure of the Closing

such party set forth herein;

(d) by either Parent or Target (provided that if the
terminating party is Target, Target shall not be in material breach of any of
its obligations under Section 5.1(e) or 6.3) if any approval of the
stockholders of Target required for the consummation of the Merger shall not
have been obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a
duly held meeting of stockholders or at any adjournment or postponement
thereof;

(e) by either Parent or Target (provided that the terminating
party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or other agreement contained herein) if there shall have been a material breach
of any of the representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement on the
part of the other party, which breach is not cured within forty-five (45) days
following written notice to the party committing such breach, or which breach,
by its nature, cannot be cured prior to the Closing;

(f) by either Parent or Target (provided that the terminating
party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant

Average Price on the Determination Date shall be less than $21.465; subject,
however, to subsection (g)(ii). 

(ii) If Target elects to exercise its termination right

its shareholders to engage in an Acquisition Transaction, or such third

SHAWMUT NATIONAL CORPORATION TO ACQUIRE NORTHEAST FEDERAL
CORP. FOR $172.1 MILLION

HARTFORD, Conn. and BOSTON, Mass., June 13, 1994 -- Shawmut National
Corporation (NYSE: SNC) today announced a definitive agreement to
purchase the $3.6 billion asset Northeast Federal Corp. (NYSE: NSB),
parent of Northeast Savings F.A., for $172.1 million, or $10.875 per
fully diluted share.

Today's acquisition announcement is separate from the cash transaction
announced February 10, 1994 in which Shawmut agreed to purchase 10
Northeast branches located in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. That
earlier 10-branch transaction closed on Saturday, June 11.

As a result of the transaction announced today, Shawmut will acquire 17
offices in New York, eight offices in Massachusetts, and eight offices
in Connecticut.

This latest transaction is structured as a tax-free merger, with
Northeast Federal shareholders to receive .456 shares of Shamut
National stock for each Northeast Federal share. The exchange ratio of
Shawmut shares will be adjusted to preserve a value of $10.875

per Northeast Federal share, up to a maximum exchange ratio of .507 and a
minimum exchange ratio of .415 to reflect the average closing price of
Shawmut stock for the 15 trading days ending on the trading day
immediately prior to the day on which the last regulatory approval has
been obtained and all statutory waiting periods have expired. The
transaction is expected to be accounted for using purchase accounting.

Shawmut expects to close this latest transaction in the fourth quarter
of this year.

"The acquisition of Northeast Federal gives Shawmut its first branches
outside of New England," said Joel B. Alvord, chairman and chief
executive officer of Shawmut National Corporation. "By establishing an
attractive presence in New York, where more than half of these branches
are located, this acquisition advances Shawmut's strategy of
diversifying our business profile beyond New England. In the greater
Albany market, Shawmut will have the number one or two market share in
five of the eight towns served by Northeast. The acquisition is
expected to be accretive to Shawmut's 1995 earnings, making the deal
attractive to both Shawmut and Northeast shareholders."

"We are pleased to join forces with a premier New England financial 
institution," said Kirk W. Walters, chairman, president, and chief executive 
officer of Northeast Federal Corp. "Our board of directors believes this
transaction provides an excellent return to our stockholders. Our
customers will benefit from the added convenience of Shawmut's
substantial retail network and broad product line."

The transaction does not include four California branches Northeast
agreed to sell to Home Savings of America in Irwindale, California. 
Nor does the transaction include the sale of a single Cape Cod branch
Northeast agreed to sell to Sandwich Cooperative several months ago.

The agreement is subject to the approval of Northeast shareholders and
to the approval of regulatory agencies.

With assets of $30 billion, Shawmut National Corporation is a superregional 
bank holding company with a franchise of over 300 branches and nearly 500 
ATMs in four New England states: Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,
and Rhode Island. It is a leading provider of financial services to 
consumers and small- to medium-sized businesses. It also
