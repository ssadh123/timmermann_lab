Item 5. Other Items

Reference is made to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Consolidated Operations -
Paradigm Power, Inc. in the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year
ended September 30, 1993 of New Jersey Resources Corporation (the Company),
concerning an agreement between a subsidiary of Paradigm Power, Inc. and an
affiliate of Destec Energy, Inc. (Harriman Energy) to jointly develop a proposed
57-megawatt, natural gas-fired cogeneration project in Harriman, New York (the
Northway Project).

Harriman Energy had agreed to sell electricity to Orange & Rockland
Utilities, Inc. (Orange & Rockland) pursuant to a 25-year power purchase
agreement entered into in May 1991, as supplemented. On June 15, 1994, Harriman
Energy and Orange & Rockland, agreed to terminate the power purchase agreement
effective on or about June 21, 1994.

Paradigm Power's share of the net proceeds from this transaction is
estimated at approximately $4.2 million, to be received over three years, plus
interest. Accordingly, the Company's results for the three months ended June 30,
1994 will include after-tax income of approximately $2.5 million, or $.15 per
share, related to this transaction.
