Item 5. Other Information

The Company reported earnings of $.10 per average common share on
revenues of $626,310,000 for the three months ended June 30, 1994. In the same
1993 period, earnings per average common share were $.38 on revenues of
$604,871,000. The average number of common shares outstanding in the two
periods were 114,457,000 and 111,970,000, respectively.

Earnings for the six months ended June 30, 1994, were $.60 per average
common share on revenues of $1,498,454,000 compared to $.86 per average common
share on revenues of $1,365,321,000 for the comparable 1993 period. The average
number of common shares outstanding in the two periods were 113,496,000 and
111,875,000, respectively.

As expected, earnings for the three and six month periods ended June
30, 1994 were significantly lower than the same periods in 1993 due to certain
factors. These include the recognition of previously deferred storm costs, a
lower allowed rate of return on common equity for the gas business as provided
by the PSC, recognition of certain operating and maintenance expenses earlier
in 1994 than in 1993, and a refinement in the Company's procedures used to
estimate gas revenues not yet billed. The earlier recognition of these
operating and maintenance expenses and the refinement in accounting procedures
relating to gas revenues will have a positive impact on second half earnings.
While the Company can give no assurances, it is expecting that its 1994 annual
earnings will be comparable to its 1993 annual earnings.

September 9, 1994.
