BARD UPDATES STATUS OF PRODUCT SUBMISSION AUDITS

MURRAY HILL, NJ - May 6, 1994 - C. R. Bard, Inc. (NYSE-BCR)
said today that the process of auditing new product submissions
of its USCI division has begun, and that the company is unable
to estimate how long that process will take.

In January, Bard announced that the Food and Drug
Administration's (FDA) Applications Integrity Policy had been
applied to current applications from Bard's USCI division, and
that based upon audits to be conducted by the Company, the FDA
would assess the validity of data and information in USCI's
pending premarket applications. The auditor has been selected
and work began early in April. The Company is unable to
estimate how long the audit process will take or how long the
suspension of FDA review of USCI's pending premarket
applications will last.

William H. Longfield, Bard's president and chief operating
officer, said, "Notwithstanding the continued suspension of
USCI's new product approvals, the first quarter sales strength
experienced by our other businesses is continuing this quarter. 
As we stated at our annual meeting in April, Wall Street
analysts' earnings estimates of $1.80 - $1.90 per share for
1994 still appear reasonable to us."

C. R. Bard, Inc., headquartered in Murray Hill, NJ, is a
leading multinational developer, manufacturer and marketer of
health care products.
