Item 5. Other Events

Reference is made to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements - Regulatory Issues incorporated by reference in New
Jersey Resources Corporation's (the "Company") September 30, 1993
Annual Report on Form 10-K concerning a) New Jersey Natural Gas
Company's ("NJNG") base rate petition with the New Jersey Board
of Regulatory Commissioners (the "BRC") seeking additional annual
base revenues of approximately $26.9 million and b) an
incentive - ratemaking plan petition filed with the BRC. 

On January 5, 1994 the BRC approved a stipulated agreement which
authorizes a $7.5 million base rate increase. In connection with
this agreement, NJNG withdrew its incentive - ratemaking
petition. The agreement is effective immediately.

The $7.5 million base rate increase includes an 11.5% allowed
return on common equity and a rate base of $492 million. NJNG's
filing had requested a 12.5% return on equity and a rate base,
including projected additions to utility plant through September
1994, of $541 million.
