For Immediate Release

SPRINT, DEUTSCHE TELEKOM, FRANCE TELECOM
JOIN FORCES TO FORM A GLOBAL STRATEGIC ALLIANCE
-- Sprint, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom to 
Create a Global Partnership --
-- Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom to Invest More Than $4 
Billion in Sprint By Acquiring a 20-Percent Stake in Two Steps -- 

KANSAS CITY, Mo., June 14, 1994 -- Sprint, Deutsche Telekom 
and France Telecom today announced plans, based on a Memorandum of 
Understanding, to form a global partnership. This partnership 
between Europe's two leading telecommunications companies and the 
provider of the United States' most technologically advanced 
telecommunications network will offer seamless, global 
telecommunications services to business, consumer and carrier 
markets worldwide. 

Subject to relevant regulatory environments, these services 
will include: 

o Global international data, voice and video business 
services for multinational and large business customers, 
as well as for the burgeoning number of small companies 
with international communications needs. 
o International services for consumers, initially based on 
card services for travelers. 
o "Carriers' carrier" services, providing international 
transport services for other carriers.

Over time, the services will expand to address the changing 
dynamics of global, regional and national markets. The 
partnership plans to develop national networks to provide long 
distance services in other countries as required by customers.

As part of the agreement, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom 
will invest, in two steps, a total of approximately $4.2 billion 
in Sprint over two years, become shareholders of the company and 
hold a 20-percent equity investment in the company. "This 
substantial investment will enable Sprint to further leverage its 
technological and innovative superiority in the U.S.," said 
William T. Esrey, chairman and chief executive officer of Sprint. 
"We are delighted to have Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom as 
investors in our company." 

The services of the global partnership will be offered 
throughout the world by regional operating groups, and in the 
United States, France and Germany by the home-country partner. 
The partnership will be directed by a Global Partnership Board 
which will determine strategic direction and oversee the 
operations of three operating entities. Two of these will be 
regional operating groups, one focused on Western and Eastern 
Europe and the other on the rest of the world. The partnership 
will also have a Global Backbone Network operating group, which 
will establish a transmission network interconnecting various 
regional hubs and support the provision of the global 
partnership's services. 

The intention of the three partners is to combine planning 
for global network facilities to the extent allowed by regulation. 
Existing correspondent bilateral relationships will remain in 
place.

The three partners will have equal votes on the Global 
Partnership Board. The Global Backbone Network operating group 
and the operating group serving the "rest of the world" will each 
be owned 50 percent by Sprint and 50 percent by Deutsche Telekom 
and France Telecom. The operating group serving Western and 
Eastern Europe will be one-third owned by Sprint and two-thirds 
owned by Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom. Deutsche Telekom 
and France Telecom's interest in the regional operating groups and 
the Global Backbone Network operating group will be managed by 
their recently announced joint venture, referred to as Atlas. 

The partnership anticipates merging most of the international 
assets of the partners within the agreed scope of the 
partnership's services, to pursue telecommunications opportunities 
worldwide. It is also anticipated that the majority of the assets 
of Sprint International will be contributed to the partnership.

Under terms of the agreement, France Telecom and Deutsche 
Telekom collectively will acquire a 20-percent ownership stake in 
Sprint. It is anticipated that Deutsche Telekom and France 
Telecom together will purchase from Sprint approximately 42.9 
million shares of a new class of Sprint stock at a price of 
$47.225 per share. France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom will 
purchase an additional 42.9 million shares of a new class of 
Sprint stock at a price of $51 per share two years after the date 
of the initial acquisition. 

As part of the transaction, France Telecom and Deutsche 
Telekom will be entitled to representation on the 15-member Sprint 
board. The representation will be based on their actual 
percentage ownership interest, with a minimum of two directors as 
long as the two companies own at least 10 percent of the 
outstanding common stock of Sprint, subject to New York Stock 
Exchange approval.

A Memorandum of Understanding has been signed by William 
Esrey, chairman and chief executive officer of Sprint; Helmut 
Ricke, chairman of the management board of Deutsche Telekom; and 
Marcel Roulet, chairman of France Telecom. Both the formation of 
the global partnership and the acquisition of stock by Deutsche 
Telekom and France Telecom are subject to conditions, including 
the negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, approval 
by the board of directors of Sprint and its shareholders, approval 
by the governing bodies of Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom, 
and government and regulatory approvals. 

The partnership may seek to add partners from Asia and the 
Pacific to increase its ability to serve customers in those 
regions, as well as national partners to strengthen service 
offerings in specific countries. The partners believe there are 
opportunities to work together in other advanced markets in the 
U.S. and elsewhere. 

"The international telecommunications industry is 
experiencing dramatic positive change," said Esrey. "Our 
partnership with Europe's two largest telecommunications companies 
will enable us to provide leading communications services to a 
wide range of customers. 

Esrey said that business, consumers and other 
telecommunications providers are demanding service improvements 
that can best be provided by a global carrier. "Quite frankly, 
the needs of the marketplace today are considerably ahead of the 
global industry's ability to deliver. This partnership will 
create the single-source provider with global account 
responsibility that the marketplace is looking for," he added. 

The countries represented by the partnership are home to 
almost half of the world's multinational companies, giving the 
partnership a strong base from which to extend these services 
worldwide, he noted.

In announcing the agreement in Bonn, Helmut Ricke said, "In a 
nutshell, Sprint, as a telecommunications enterprise with 
extraordinary technological know-how and with the potential of a 
fully digitized network, is the ideal partner for implementing our 
strategic goals." 

In Paris, Marcel Roulet said Sprint's significant base of 
multinational business customers and strong brand recognition in 
the U.S. were key factors leading to the partnership agreement. 
"The partnership will be a global leader, combining the 
considerable financial, technological and marketing strengths of 
our three companies," Roulet said. "The creation of the global 
partnership, as well as Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom's 
joint investment in Sprint, will considerably strengthen the 
French-German partnership. This represents a significant step 
toward a global extension of this partnership." 

The partners expect to sign a definitive agreement around 
year's end and have executed an exclusivity agreement.
