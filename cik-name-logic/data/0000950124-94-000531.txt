Item 5. Other Events

On March 17, 1994, Yellow Corporation (the company) announced that
due primarily to the impact of the severe winter weather in January and
February, it expects to report a net loss in the first quarter of 1994 greater
than the net loss of $.06 per share recorded in 1993's first quarter.

Severe winter weather and the earthquake in Southern California
caused significant business disruptions and higher operating expenses for both
its largest motor carrier subsidiary, Yellow Freight System, Inc. and for
Preston Trucking Company, Inc. Preston Trucking, whose operations are
concentrated in the Northeast and Upper Midwest, was especially hard hit by the
weather.

Revenue and net income in both the first quarter of 1994 and 1993
were negatively impacted by a required change in the method of recognizing
revenue, implemented in 1992. The change significantly reduces revenue and net
income in the first quarter of each year while increasing both in the fourth
quarter. This accounts for a substantial portion of the decline in earnings
between the fourth quarter of 1993 and the first quarter of 1994 but will have
negligible impact on full year earnings.

Tonnage levels continue to show favorable year-over-year
comparisons. In addition, the pricing environment remains stable, with broad
customer acceptance of the need for the rate increases implemented early in the
first quarter of 1994. Final first quarter results will be available on April
21, 1994.
