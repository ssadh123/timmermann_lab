CNA FINANCIAL CORPORATION TO ACQUIRE
THE CONTINENTAL CORPORATION FOR $1.1 BILLION

CHICAGO, December 6, 1994 -- CNA Financial Corporation (CNA) and The

Continental Corporation (Continental) today have signed an agreement under

which CNA will acquire Continental through a cash merger for $1.1 billion, or

$20 a share. The acquisition will create the seventh largest U.S. insurance

group.

Dennis H. Chookaszian, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the

CNA Insurance Companies, said that the acquisition presents a unique

opportunity to build a world-class insurance organization. 

Continental's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John P. Mascotte

said that the merger will achieve an impressive collaboration of the talents,

strengths and resources of both companies.

Both boards have approved the transaction. The acquisition may be

funded with long-term debt or may include a combination of long-term debt and

equity.

In conjunction with CNA's acquisition of Continental, CNA will invest

an additional $275 million which takes the place of the funds that Insurance

Partners, L.P., had committed under a previous agreement with Continental.

Chookaszian said that the acquisition of Continental will expand

CNA's product portfolio for customers and agents. "The opportunity to acquire

high-quality assets and gain additional market presence, while building on

our solid financial strength is very exciting," he said.

"Numerous economies of scale and market efficiencies make the

agreement an excellent business decision," said Chookaszian. "We see

opportunities to apply both companies' experience in improving efficiencies,

and this should reduce costs. In addition, the insurance expertise of CNA and

Continental can be further leveraged through the agents and brokers of both

organizations."

CNA's solid capital position, high-quality, conservative investment

portfolio and positive operating trends all contribute to CNA's ability to

make a success of the acquisition. CNA's strong debt-to-capital ratio of 17

percent, plus the economic benefits of the acquisition, will more than

support the financing.

CNA and Continental will jointly seek regulatory approvals as quickly

as possible. Until the acquisition is completed, Continental will continue to

operate independently. Mascotte will continue as chairman and chief executive

officer for the interim period. In addition, a transition team composed of

key people from both organizations will be formed to ensure that CNA and

Continental are smoothly combined.

CNA Financial Corporation is the parent company of the CNA Insurance

Companies, the 12th largest U.S. insurance organization and the sixth largest

U.S. property-casualty insurance group as measured by 1993 premium volume.

Loews Corporation owns 84 percent of the common stock of CNA Financial

Corporation. CNA had 1993 revenues of $11 billion and assets of $41.9 billion

as of December 31, 1993. The principal CNA Insurance Companies are

Continental Casualty Company and Continental Assurance Company.
