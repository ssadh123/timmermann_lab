Item 5. Other Events

On November 17, 1994, Southdown, Inc. announced that it will
exit the environmental services business. The Company plans to sell its
three remaining hazardous waste processing facilities and to cease all
burning of hazardous waste in its cement kilns by the end of 1995.

As a result of this decision, Southdown's results for the year
ended December 31, 1994 will include an after-tax charge estimated at
between $20 million and $25 million, or $1.12-$1.40 per share. The charge
will include the difference between the book value of the environmental
services assets and the estimated proceeds from asset sales, as well as the
costs to exit the business and estimated losses to be incurred prior to the
sale of assets. The charge, as well as the previous results from the
Environmental Services segment, will be shown in the Company's financial
reports as discontinued operations. 

SIGNATURES

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the Registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by
