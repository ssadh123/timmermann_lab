INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Concho
Bancshares, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 and the
related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders'
equity and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of
Concho Bancshares, Inc. and subsidiary as of December 31, 1993 and 1992,
and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years
then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Years Ended December 31, 1993 and 1992

NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Significant accounting policies adopted by the Company are
summarized below.

Consolidation - The consolidated financial statements include
Concho Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiary, Southwest Bank of San
Angelo, after elimination of significant intercompany accounts. 
A consolidated federal income tax return is filed with Concho
Bancshares, Inc.'s subsidiary, Southwest Bank of San Angelo. 
Concho Bancshares, Inc. owns 99.69% of the outstanding common stock
of Southwest Bank of San Angelo.

Cash flows - For purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash
equivalents include cash on hand and amounts due from banks. Cash
flows from loans, demand deposits, NOW accounts, savings accounts,
federal funds purchased and sold, and certificates of deposit, are
reported net.

Investment securities - Investments in debt securities are stated
at cost, adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of
discounts computed on the straight-line method over the period from
date of purchase to date of maturity. Investments in mutual funds
are stated at the lower of aggregate cost or market as of the
balance sheet date. The investment in stock of the Federal Home
Loan Bank of Dallas is stated at cost.

Interest income on loans - Interest on commercial, real estate and
student loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal
amounts outstanding. Interest on installment loans is recognized
as earned based on the rule of seventy-eights method.

Building and equipment - Building and equipment are stated at cost
less accumulated depreciation computed by the straight-line and
accelerated cost recovery system methods. Accumulated depreciation
as of December 31, 1993 and 1992 is $ 2,213,196 and $ 2,075,690,
respectively. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as
incurred while improvements are capitalized and depreciated over
the useful life of such improvements.

Allowance for loan losses - The allowance for loan losses is
available for losses incurred on loans and is increased by
provisions charged to operating expenses and reduced by charge-
offs, net of recoveries. The allowance is based on management's
evaluation of the adequacy of the reserve. This evaluation
encompasses consideration of past loss experience and other
factors, including changes in the composition and volume of the
portfolio, the relationship of the allowance to the portfolio, and
current economic conditions.

<PAGE>
Amortization - Certain costs associated with the Company's
investment services have been capitalized and are being amortized
by the straight-line method over a period of 60 months. Total
amortization expense for 1993 and 1992 was $ 4,000 each year.

Per Share Data - Earnings per share are based on the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding in 1993 and 1992 of
193,408 and 202,387, respectively.

NOTE 2: INVESTMENT SECURITIES

At December 31, 1993 and 1992 the subsidiary held mutual fund
investments with a cost basis of $ 715,122 and $ 964,803,
respectively. The portfolios of these mutual funds consisted of
obligations of the United States government and agencies. As of
December 31, 1993 and 1992, the aggregate cost of mutual fund
investments exceeded their aggregate market value by $ 91,111 and
$ 122,927, respectively.

Investments in debt securities shown in the balance sheet are
reflected net of accumulated accretion and amortization.

At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the amortized cost, estimate market
values, and the gross unrealized gains and losses of investments
in debt securities were as follows:

Obligations of the United States government with par values of
$ 3,000,000, were pledged to secure various deposits as of
December 31, 1993 and 1992.

The Company has opted not to early apply Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards #115 in regard to accounting for its
investment in debt securities. The Company considers all of its
debt securities as "available for sale" as of December 31, 1993. 
Had the Company applied the provisions of SFAS #115 as of December
31, 1993, investments in debt securities and stockholders' equity
would be increased by $ 449,231.

NOTE 3: PENSION AND PROFIT SHARING PLANS

The subsidiary has a non-contributory profit-sharing plan available
to all regular employees who have completed six months of service. 
Contributions to this plan are at the discretion of the
subsidiary's board of directors. The subsidiary also sponsors a
pension plan, whereby it matches 100% of employee contributions up
to 4% of their compensation and 50% of contributions on the next
2% of compensation. Total expense, relating to the pension plan
for the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992 was $ 41,279, and
$ 42,154, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 1993 and
1992 the subsidiary's board of directors elected to contribute
$ 25,000 to the profit sharing plan.

</TABLE>

During the year ended December 31, 1988, the Subsidiary changed its
method of accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated
with lending activities to comply with the requirements of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 91. Under the new
accounting method, certain lending related costs are capitalized
into the loan balance and amortized against interest income over
the term of the loan. Total capitalized loan cost and related
amortization are as follows:

The subsidiary routinely sells its student loans to the Panhandle
Plains Higher Education Agency prior to the loans reaching repayment
stage. For 1993 and 1992, the subsidiary sold approximately
$ 2,777,041 and $ 2,351,013, respectively, of these loans under this
program.

NOTE 6: FEDERAL INCOME TAXES

Deferred income taxes arise from timing differences resulting from
income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax
purposes in different periods. The principal sources of timing
differences are different depreciation methods for tax and
financial purposes, and differences in tax and financial accounting
for deferred compensation arrangements, bad debt losses and bond
discount accretion. No deferred federal income taxes were recorded
as of December 31, 1992.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes". The cumulative effect of the change in accounting
principle totalled $231,213 and has been included in determining
net income for the year ended December 31, 1993. $ 41,795 of this
amount arose from unrealized loss on investments in mutual funds
and has been credited to stockholders' equity. The remaining $
189,418 was recorded as a deferred tax liability upon adoption of
SFAS #109. 

The components of income tax expense are:
<PAGE>

A reconciliation of income tax expense at the statutory rate to income tax
at the company's effective rate is as follows:

</TABLE>

A consolidated tax return is filed with the Company's subsidiary,
Southwest Bank of San Angelo. The above tax computations are based
on the incomes and tax attributes of the consolidated entity. The
net taxes of the consolidated entity are attributed to the Bank,
since it was the only member of the affiliated group which
generated a net income.

NOTE 7: FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK

The subsidiary is a party to financial instruments with
off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the
financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments
include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. Those
instruments involve elements of credit risk in excess of the amount
recognized in the balance sheet. The contract amounts of those
instruments reflect the extent of involvement the subsidiary has
in particular classes of financial instruments.

The subsidiary's exposure to credit loss in the event of
nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit is represented
by the contractual amount of those instruments. The subsidiary
uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional
obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
Contract Amount 
1993 1992 
<S> <C> <C> 
Financial instruments whose contract
amounts represent credit risk:
Commitments to extend credit $ 5,469,874$ 4,740,485
Letters of Credit 619,685 726,980

$ 6,089,559$ 5,467,465
</TABLE>

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer
as long as there is no violation of any condition established in
the contract. Commitments may expire without being drawn upon;
therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent future cash requirements. The subsidiary evaluates each
customer's creditworthiness on a case by case basis. The amount
of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by the Subsidiary upon
extension of credit is based upon management's credit evaluation.

Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank
to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. The
credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially
the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to
customers.

NOTE 8: DEFERRED COMPENSATION

The subsidiary maintains a deferred compensation plan for its
directors funded by the purchase of life insurance policies on each
participant. Other pertinent financial information relating to the
subsidiary's deferred compensation plans is as follows:
<TABLE>
<CAPTION>

</TABLE>

The deferred compensation plan of a former director was
discontinued during 1992. The subsidiary recognized a gain of $
67,514 from the discontinuance of this director's plan.

NOTE 9: RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

As of December 31, 1993 and 1992, certain officers and directors
and companies in which they have a beneficial ownership were
indebted to the subsidiary in the aggregate amount of $ 629,590 and
$ 789,332, respectively.

NOTE 13: FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107, "Disclosures
about Fair Value of Financial Instruments", requires all entities
to disclose the estimated fair value of its financial instrument
assets and liabilities. For the Company, as for most financial
institutions, approximately 95% of its assets and 99% of its
liabilities are considered financial instruments as defined in
Statement No. 107. Many of the Company's financial instruments,
however, lack an available trading market as characterized by a
willing buyer and willing seller engaging in an exchange
transaction. It is also the Company's general practice and intent
to hold its financial instruments to maturity and to not engage in
trading or sales activities. Therefore, significant estimations
and present value calculations were used by the Company for the
purpose of this disclosure.
<PAGE>
Estimated fair values have been determined by the Company using the
best available data, as generally provided in the Company's
Regulatory Reports, and an estimation methodology suitable for each
category of financial instruments. For those loans and deposits
with floating interest rates, it is presumed that estimated fair
values generally approximate the recorded book balances. The
estimation methodologies used, the estimated fair values, and
recorded book balances at December 31, 1993 and 1992 were as
follows:

*Financial instruments actively traded in a secondary market have
been valued using quoted available market prices.

</TABLE>
*Financial instruments with stated maturities have been valued
using a present value discounted cash flow with a discount rate
approximating current market for similar assets and liabilities. 
Financial instrument assets with variable rates and financial
instrument liabilities with no stated maturities have an estimated
fair value equal to both the amount payable on demand and the
recorded book balance.

</TABLE>
Changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies may have a
material effect on these estimated fair values.

The Company's remaining assets and liabilities which are not
considered financial instruments have not been valued differently
than has been customary with historical cost accounting. No
disclosure of the relationship value of the Company's deposits is
required by Statement No. 107 nor has the Company estimated its
value. There is no material difference between the notional amount
and the estimated fair value of off-balance-sheet unfunded loan
commitments which total $ 5,469,874 and $ 4,740,485 at December 31,
1993 and 1992, respectively, and are generally priced at market at
the time of funding. Letters of credit discussed in Note 7 have
an estimated fair value based on fees currently charged for similar
agreements. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, fees related to the
unexpired term of the letters of credit are not significant.
<PAGE>
Management is concerned that reasonable comparability between
financial institutions may not be likely due to the wide range of
permitted valuation techniques and numerous estimates which must
be made given the absence of active secondary markets for many of
the financial instruments. This lack of uniform valuation
methodologies also introduces a greater degree of subjectivity to
these estimated fair values.

NOTE 14: SUBSEQUENT EVENT

Pursuant to Stock Exchange Agreement and Plan of Reorganization
dated as of December 7, 1993 by and between the First Financial
Bankshares, Inc., Concho Bancshares, Inc. and Southwest Bank of San
Angelo, First Financial Bankshares, Inc. has offered to acquire
from the Concho Bancshares, Inc. shareholders all of the
outstanding shares of Concho Bancshares, Inc. for shares of First
Financial Bankshares, Inc. at an exchange rate specified in the
exchange agreement.

Consummation of the Exchange Offer is subject to certain
conditions, including without limitation, the valid tender by
Concho Bancshares, Inc. shareholders of at least ninety percent
(90%) of Concho Bancshares, Inc. common stock. As of March 10,
1994, the expiration date for the exchange offer, the 90% threshold
had been met and the parties are proceeding with the transaction
which is to be accounted for as a pooling of interest.

NOTE 15: CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT 

All of the Subsidiary's loans, commitments, and commercial and
standby letters of credit have been granted to customers in the
Subsidiary's market area. Generally such customers are depositors
of the Subsidiary. The concentrations of credit by type of loan
are set forth in Note 4. The distribution of commitments to extend
credit approximates the distribution of loans outstanding. 
Commercial and standby letters of credit were granted primarily to
commercial borrowers. The Subsidiary, as a matter of policy, does
not extend credit to any single borrower or group of related
borrowers in excess of $ 775,000.
