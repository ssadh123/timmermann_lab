ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

BANC ONE TO TAKE $235 MILLION IN AFTER-TAX CHARGES
IN 4TH QUARTER TO CUT INTEREST-RATE SENSITIVITY
AND REFLECT ACCELERATED CONSOLIDATION

INCREASES SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION TO 18 MILLION SHARES

COLUMBUS, OH, November 21, 1994 -- BANC ONE CORPORATION (NYSE: ONE)
announced today that it will take one time charges of up to $235 million after 
tax, or $0.58 per share, against fourth quarter earnings to cover the cost of 
virtually eliminating its sensitivity to rising short-term interest rates and of
accelerating its ongoing program to reduce costs and increase efficiency in both
its banking and non-banking operations.

BANC ONE also announced an increase in its share repurchase authorization 
from 10 million to 18 million shares.

The planned fourth quarter charge has two components. Approximately $170 
million after tax is attributable to a loss on the sale of approximately $5.7 
billion in fixed-rate securities with an average maturity of 3 years. This 
transaction had been hedged earlier in the quarter so that recent declines in
bond prices did not affect the sale. Reinvesting the proceeds of the sale in
short-term assets has virtually eliminated sensitivity to increases in
short-term interest rates. As a result, an increase in short-term interest 
rates of up to 200 basis points would likely have less than a one percent impact
on forecasted 1995 earnings.

Additional charges of up to $65 million after tax are attributable to the 
anticipated costs of planned actions to accelerate BANC ONE's ongoing program to
consolidate certain banking operations which should reduce future non-interest 
expenses.

"We are determined to take the necessary steps in 1994 to put the issue of 
interest rate sensitivity behind us and enhance operating efficiency," said 
Chairman John B. McCoy. "Although these discretionary actions will end our 
25-year record of annual earning increases, nonetheless our 1994 results 
will place us among a select group of financial institutions earning over 
$1 billion."

BANC ONE CORPORATION had assets of $88.2 billion and common equity of $7.5
billion as of September 30, 1994. BANC ONE now operates 75 banks with 1,425 
offices in Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan,
Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, West Virginia and Wisconsin. BANC ONE also 
operates several additional corporations that engage in data processing, venture
capital, investment and merchant banking, trust, brokerage, investment 
management, equipment leasing, mortgage banking, consumer finance and insurance.
