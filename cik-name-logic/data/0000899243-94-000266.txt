FERRELLGAS PARTNERS, L.P.

THIS AGREEMENT OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OF FERRELLGAS PARTNERS, L.P., dated
as of July 5, 1994, is entered into by and among Ferrellgas, Inc., a Delaware
corporation, as the General Partner, and Danley K. Sheldon, as the
Organizational Limited Partner, together with any other Persons who become
Partners in the Partnership or parties hereto as provided herein. In
consideration of the covenants, conditions and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

ORGANIZATIONAL MATTERS

1.1 FORMATION. (a) The General Partner and the Organizational Limited Partner
have previously formed the Partnership as a limited partnership pursuant to the
provisions of the Delaware Act. Except as expressly provided to the contrary in
this Agreement, the rights and obligations of the Partners and the
administration, dissolution and termination of the Partnership shall be governed
by the Delaware Act. All Partnership Interests shall constitute personal
property of the owner thereof for all purposes.

(b) In connection with the formation of the Partnership, Ferrellgas has been
admitted as a general partner of the Partnership, and the Organizational Limited
Partner has been admitted as a limited partner of the Partnership. As of the
Closing Date, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by Section
4.2 and after giving effect to the admission of the Initial Limited Partners as
contemplated by Section 12.1 (but in no event prior to such time), the interest
in the Partnership of the Organizational Limited Partner shall be terminated and
the Organizational Limited Partner shall withdraw as a limited partner of the
Partnership.

1.2 NAME. The name of the Partnership shall be "Ferrellgas Partners, L.P." The
Partnership's business may be conducted under any other name or names deemed
necessary or appropriate by the General Partner, including, without limitation,
the name of the General Partner. The words "Limited Partnership," "L.P.," "Ltd."
or similar words or letters shall be included in the Partnership's name where
necessary for the purposes of complying with the laws of any jurisdiction that
so requires. The General Partner in its sole discretion may change the name of
the Partnership at any time and from time to time and shall notify the Limited
Partners of such change in the next regular communication to the Limited
Partners.

1.3 REGISTERED OFFICE; PRINCIPAL OFFICE. Unless and until changed by the
General Partner, the registered office of the Partnership in the State of
Delaware shall be located at The Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street,
New Castle County, Wilmington, Delaware 19801, and the registered agent for
service of process on the Partnership in the State of Delaware at such
registered office shall be The Corporation Trust Company. The principal office
of the Partnership shall be located at, and the address of the General Partner
shall be, One Liberty Plaza, Liberty, Missouri 64068, or such other place as the
General Partner may from time to time designate by notice to the Limited
Partners. The Partnership may maintain offices at such other place or places
within or outside the State of Delaware as the General Partner deems necessary
or appropriate.

1.4 POWER OF ATTORNEY. (a) Each Limited Partner and each Assignee hereby
constitutes and appoints each of the General Partner and, if a Liquidator shall
have been selected pursuant to Section 14.3, the Liquidator severally (and any
successor to either thereof by merger, transfer, assignment, election or
otherwise) and each of their authorized officers and attorneys-in-fact, with
full power of substitution, as his true and lawful agent and attorney-in-fact,
with full power and authority in his name, place and stead, to:

<PAGE>

(i) execute, swear to, acknowledge, deliver, file and record in the
appropriate public offices (A) all certificates, documents and other
instruments (including, without limitation, this Agreement and the Certificate
of Limited Partnership and all amendments or restatements thereof) that the
General Partner or the Liquidator deems necessary or appropriate to form,
qualify or continue the existence or qualification of the Partnership as a
limited partnership (or a partnership in which the limited partners have
limited liability) in the State of Delaware and in all other jurisdictions in
which the Partnership may conduct business or own property; (B) all
certificates, documents and other instruments that the General Partner or the
Liquidator deems necessary or appropriate to reflect, in accordance with its
terms, any amendment, change, modification or restatement of this Agreement;
(C) all certificates, documents and other instruments (including, without
limitation, conveyances and a certificate of cancellation) that the General
Partner or the Liquidator deems necessary or appropriate to reflect the
dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement; (D) all certificates, documents and other instruments relating to
the admission, withdrawal, removal or substitution of any Partner pursuant to,
or other events described in, Article XI, XII, XIII or XIV or the Capital
Contribution of any Partner; (E) all certificates, documents and other
instruments relating to the determination of the rights, preferences and
privileges of any class or series of Units or other Partnership Securities
issued pursuant to Section 4.2; and (F) all certificates, documents and other
instruments (including, without limitation, agreements and a certificate of
merger) relating to a merger or consolidation of the Partnership pursuant to
Article XVI; and

(ii) execute, swear to, acknowledge, deliver, file and record all ballots,
consents, approvals, waivers, certificates, documents and other instruments
necessary or appropriate, in the sole discretion of the General Partner or the
Liquidator, to make, evidence, give, confirm or ratify any vote, consent,
approval, agreement or other action that is made or given by the Partners
hereunder or is consistent with the terms of this Agreement or is necessary or
appropriate, in the sole discretion of the General Partner or the Liquidator,
to effectuate the terms or intent of this Agreement; provided, that when
required by Section 15.3 or any other provision of this Agreement that
establishes a percentage of the Limited Partners or of the Limited Partners of
any class or series required to take any action, the General Partner or the
Liquidator may exercise the power of attorney made in this Section 1.4(a)(ii)
only after the necessary vote, consent or approval of the Limited Partners or
of the Limited Partners of such class or series, as applicable.

Nothing contained in this Section 1.4(a) shall be construed as authorizing the
General Partner to amend this Agreement except in accordance with Article XV or
as may be otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement.

(b) The foregoing power of attorney is hereby declared to be irrevocable and a
power coupled with an interest, and it shall survive and not be affected by the
subsequent death, incompetency, disability, incapacity, dissolution, bankruptcy
or termination of any Limited Partner or Assignee and the transfer of all or any
portion of such Limited Partner's or Assignee's Partnership Interest and shall
extend to such Limited Partner's or Assignee's heirs, successors, assigns and
personal representatives. Each such Limited Partner or Assignee hereby agrees to
be bound by any representation made by the General Partner or the Liquidator
acting in good faith pursuant to such power of attorney; and each such Limited
Partner or Assignee hereby waives any and all defenses that may be available to
contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the General Partner or the Liquidator
taken in good faith under such power of attorney. Each Limited Partner or
Assignee shall execute and deliver to the General Partner or the Liquidator,
within 15 days after receipt of the General Partner's or the Liquidator's
request therefor, such further designation, powers of attorney and other
instruments as the General Partner or the Liquidator deems necessary to
effectuate this Agreement and the purposes of the Partnership.

1.5 TERM. The Partnership commenced upon the filing of the Certificate of
Limited Partnership in accordance with the Delaware Act and shall continue in
existence until the close of Partnership business on July 31, 2084, or until the
earlier dissolution of the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of
Article XIV.

1.6 POSSIBLE RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event of (a) the enactment (or
imminent enactment) of any legislation, (b) the publication of any temporary or
final regulation by the Treasury Department, (c) any ruling by the Internal
Revenue Service or (d) any judicial decision, that, in any such case, in the
Opinion of Counsel, would result in the taxation of the Partnership as an
association taxable as a corporation or would otherwise result in the
Partnership's being taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes, then,
the General Partner may impose such restrictions on the transfer of Units or

The following definitions shall be for all purposes, unless otherwise clearly
indicated to the contrary, applied to the terms used in this Agreement.

"ACQUISITION" means any transaction in which the Partnership or the
Operating Partnership acquires (through an asset acquisition, merger, stock
acquisition or other form of investment) control over all or a portion of the
assets, properties or business of another Person for the purpose of increasing
the operating capacity of the Partnership and the Operating Partnership, taken
as a whole, from the operating capacity of the Partnership and the Operating
Partnership, taken as a whole, existing immediately prior to such transaction.

"ADDITIONAL LIMITED PARTNER" means a Person admitted to the Partnership as
a Limited Partner pursuant to Section 12.4 and who is shown as such on the
books and records of the Partnership.

"ADJUSTED CAPITAL ACCOUNT" means the Capital Account maintained for each
Partner as of the end of each fiscal year of the Partnership, (a) increased by
any amounts that such Partner is obligated to restore under the standards set
by Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(c) (or is deemed obligated to
restore under Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(g) and 1.704-2(i)(5)) and
(b) decreased by (i) the amount of all losses and deductions that, as of the
end of such fiscal year, are reasonably expected to be allocated to such
Partner in subsequent years under Sections 704(e)(2) and 706(d) of the Code
and Treasury Regulation Section 1.751-1(b)(2)(ii), and (ii) the amount of all
distributions that, as of the end of such fiscal year, are reasonably expected
to be made to such Partner in subsequent years in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement or otherwise to the extent they exceed offsetting increases to
such Partner's Capital Account that are reasonably expected to occur during
(or prior to) the year in which such distributions are reasonably expected to
be made (other than increases as a result of a minimum gain chargeback
pursuant to Section 5.1(d)(i) or 5.1(d)(ii)). The foregoing definition of
Adjusted Capital Account is intended to comply with the provisions of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall be interpreted consistently
therewith. The "Adjusted Capital Account" in respect of a Common Unit, a
Subordinated Unit or any other specified interest in the Partnership shall be
the amount which such Adjusted Capital Account would be if such Common Unit,
Subordinated Unit or other interest in the Partnership were the only interest
in the Partnership held by a Limited Partner.

"ADJUSTED PROPERTY" means any property the Carrying Value of which has been
adjusted pursuant to Section 4.5(d)(i) or 4.5(d)(ii). Once an Adjusted
Property is deemed distributed by, and

10
<PAGE>

recontributed to, the Partnership for federal income tax purposes upon a
termination thereof pursuant to Section 708 of the Code, such property shall
thereafter constitute a Contributed Property until the Carrying Value of such
property is subsequently adjusted pursuant to Section 4.5(d)(i) or 4.5(d)(ii).

"AFFILIATE" means, with respect to any Person, any other Person that
directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control

ownership of voting securities, by contract or otherwise.

"AGREED ALLOCATION" means any allocation, other than a Required Allocation,
of an item of income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to the provisions of
Section 5.1, including, without limitation, a Curative Allocation (if
appropriate to the context in which the term "Agreed Allocation" is used).

"AGREED VALUE" of any Contributed Property means the fair market value of
such property or other consideration at the time of contribution as determined
by the General Partner using such reasonable method of valuation as it may
adopt; provided, however, that the Agreed Value of any property deemed
contributed to the Partnership for federal income tax purposes upon
termination and reconstitution thereof pursuant to Section 708 of the Code
shall be determined in accordance with Section 4.5(c)(i). Subject to Section
4.5(c)(i), the General Partner shall, in its sole discretion, use such method
as it deems reasonable and appropriate to allocate the aggregate Agreed Value
of Contributed Properties contributed to the Partnership in a single or
integrated transaction among each separate property on a basis proportional to
the fair market value of each Contributed Property.

Partners, L.P., as it may be amended, supplemented or restated from time to
time.

(i) all cash receipts of the Partnership during such Quarter from all
sources (including, without limitation, distributions of cash received
from the Operating Partnership and cash proceeds from Interim Capital

Transactions), plus, in the case of the Quarter ending October 31, 1994,
the cash balance of the Partnership as of the close of business on the
Closing Date; and

11
<PAGE>

(ii) any reduction with respect to such Quarter in a cash reserve
previously established pursuant to clause (b)(ii) below (either by
reversal or utilization) from the level of such reserve at the end of the
prior Quarter;

(b) less the sum of:

taxes, if any, debt service (including, without limitation, the payment

Partnership or the Operating Partnership (including, without limitation,
reserves for future capital expenditures) or (B) to provide funds for
distributions with respect to Units and any general partner interests in
the Partnership in respect of any one or more of the next four Quarters
or (C) because the distribution of such amounts would be prohibited by
applicable law or by any loan agreement, security agreement, mortgage,
debt instrument or other agreement or obligation to which the Partnership
or the Operating Partnership is a party or by which any of them is bound
or its assets are subject;

provided, however, that for purposes of determining Available Cash for the
Quarter ending October 31, 1994, such Quarter shall be deemed to commence on
the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, "Available Cash" with respect
to any Quarter shall not include any cash receipts or reductions in reserves
or take into account any disbursements made or reserves established in each
case after the Liquidation Date. Taxes paid by the Partnership on behalf of,
or amounts withheld with respect to, all or less than all of the Partners
shall not be considered cash disbursements of the Partnership that reduce
Available Cash, but the payment or withholding thereof shall be deemed to be a
distribution of Available Cash to such Partners. Alternatively, in the
discretion of the General Partner, such taxes (if pertaining to all Partners)
may be considered to be cash disbursements of the Partnership which reduce
Available Cash, but the payment or withholding thereof shall not be deemed to
be a distribution of Available Cash to such Partners.

or Adjusted Property, as of the date of any determination, the difference
between the Carrying Value of such Contributed Property or Adjusted Property

its Contributed Property and Adjusted Property will be reflected by the

Value of Contributed Property that a Partner contributes to the Partnership

all as determined on a consolidated basis and after taking into account the

thereof between the portion made for Acquisitions or Capital Additions and
Improvements and the portion made for other purposes shall be conclusive.
Taxes paid by the Partnership on behalf of, or amounts withheld with respect
to, all or less than all of the Partners shall not be considered cash
operating expenditures of the Partnership that reduce Cash from Operations,

1(b)(2)(iv)(m), the computation of all items of income, gain, loss and
deduction shall be made without regard to any election under Section 754 of
the Code which may be made by the Partnership and, as to those items described
in Section 705(a)(1)(B) or 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code, without regard to the
fact that such items are not includable in gross income or are neither
currently deductible nor capitalized for federal income tax purposes.

(iv) Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition of
any Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the
Partnership's Carrying Value with respect to such property as of such date.

(v) In accordance with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code, any
deductions for depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to any
Contributed Property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of such
property on the date it was acquired by the Partnership were equal to the
Agreed Value of such property. Upon an adjustment pursuant to Section 4.5(d)
to the Carrying Value of any Partnership property subject to depreciation,
cost recovery or amortization, any further deductions for such depreciation,
cost recovery or amortization attributable to such property shall be
determined (A) as if the adjusted basis of such property were equal to the
Carrying Value of such property immediately following such adjustment and (B)
using a rate of depreciation, cost recovery or amortization derived from the
same method and useful life (or, if applicable, the remaining useful life) as
is applied for federal income tax purposes; provided, however, that, if the
asset has a zero adjusted basis for federal income tax purposes, depreciation,
cost recovery or amortization deductions shall be determined using any
reasonable method that the General Partner may adopt.

(vi) If the Partnership's adjusted basis in a depreciable or cost recovery
property is reduced for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section
48(q)(1) or 48(q)(3) of the Code, the amount of such reduction shall, solely
for purposes hereof, be deemed to be an additional depreciation or cost
recovery deduction in the year such property is placed in service and shall be
allocated among the Partners pursuant to Section 5.1. Any restoration of such
basis pursuant to Section 48(q)(2) of the Code shall, to the extent possible,
be allocated in the same manner to the Partners to whom such deemed deduction
was allocated.

(c) (i) Except as otherwise provided in Section 4.5(c)(ii), a transferee of a
Partnership Interest shall succeed to a pro rata portion of the Capital Account
of the transferor relating to the Partnership Interest so transferred; provided,
however, that, if the transfer causes a termination of the Partnership under
Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code, the Partnership's properties shall be deemed
to have been distributed in liquidation of the Partnership to the Partners
(including any transferee of a Partnership Interest that is a party to the
transfer causing such termination) pursuant to Sections 14.3 and 14.4 and
recontributed by such Partners in reconstitution of the Partnership. Any such
deemed distribution shall be treated as an actual distribution for purposes of
this Section 4.5. In such event, the Carrying Values of the Partnership
properties shall be adjusted immediately prior to such deemed distribution
pursuant to Section 4.5(d)(ii) and such Carrying Values shall then constitute
the Agreed Values of such properties upon such deemed contribution to the
reconstituted Partnership. The Capital Accounts of such reconstituted
Partnership shall be maintained in accordance with the principles of this
Section 4.5.

(ii) Immediately prior to the conversion of a Subordinated Unit into a
Common Unit pursuant to Sections 5.7(b) or (c) or the sale, exchange or other
disposition of a Subordinated Unit by a holder thereof, the Capital Account
maintained for such Person with respect to its Subordinated Units will (A)
first, be allocated to the Subordinated Units to be converted or
transferred,as the case may be, in an amount equal to the product of (x) the
number of such Subordinated Units to be converted or transferred,as the case
may be, and (y) the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit, and (B) second,
any remaining balance in such Capital Account will be retained by the
transferor, regardless of whether it has retained any Subordinated Units.
Following any such allocation, the transferor's Capital Account, if any,
maintained with respect to the retained Subordinated Units, if any, will have
a balance equal to the amount allocated under clause (B) hereinabove, and the
transferee's Capital Account established with respect to the transferred
Subordinated Units will have a balance equal to the amount allocated under
clause (A) hereinabove.

(d) (i) Consistent with the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), on an issuance of additional Units for cash or
Contributed Property or the conversion of the General Partner's Partnership
Interest to Common Units pursuant to Section 13.3(b), the Capital Account

28
<PAGE>

of all Partners and the Carrying Value of each Partnership property
immediately prior to such issuance shall be adjusted upward or downward to
reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such
Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been
recognized on an actual sale of each such property immediately prior to such
issuance and had been allocated to the Partners at such time pursuant to
Sections 5.1(a) and 5.1(b). In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized
Loss, the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all Partnership
assets (including, without limitation, cash or cash equivalents) immediately
prior to the issuance of additional Units shall be determined by the General
Partner using such reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt; provided,
however, the General Partner, in arriving at such valuation, must take fully
into account the fair market value of the Partnership Interests of all
Partners at such time. The General Partner shall allocate such aggregate value
among the assets of the Partnership (in such manner as it determines in its
sole discretion to be reasonable) to arrive at a fair market value for
individual properties.

(ii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f),
immediately prior to any actual or deemed distribution to a Partner of any
Partnership property (other than a distribution of cash that is not in
redemption or retirement of a Partnership Interest), the Capital Accounts of
all Partners and the Carrying Value of all Partnership property shall be
adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss
attributable to such Partnership property, as if such Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss had been recognized in a sale of such property immediately
prior to such distribution for an amount equal to its fair market value, and
had been allocated to the Partners, at such time, pursuant to Section 5.1. Any
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such property shall be
allocated in the same manner as Net Termination Gain or Net Termination Loss
pursuant to Section 5.1(c); provided, however, that, in making any such
allocation, Net Termination Gain or Net Termination Loss actually realized
shall be allocated first. In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized
Loss the aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all Partnership assets
(including, without limitation, cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior to
a distribution shall (A) in the case of a deemed distribution occurring as a
result of a termination of the Partnership pursuant to Section 708 of the
Code, be determined and allocated in the same manner as that provided in
Section 4.5(d)(i) or (B) in the case of a liquidating distribution pursuant to
Section 14.3 or 14.4, be determined and allocated by the Liquidator using such
reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt.

4.6 INTEREST. No interest shall be paid by the Partnership on Capital
Contributions or on balances in Partners' Capital Accounts.

4.7 NO WITHDRAWAL. No Partner shall be entitled to withdraw any part of its
Capital Contributions or its Capital Account or to receive any distribution from
the Partnership, except as provided in Section 4.1, and Articles V, VII, XIII
and XIV.

4.8 LOANS FROM PARTNERS. Loans by a Partner to the Partnership shall not
constitute Capital Contributions. If any Partner shall advance funds to the
Partnership in excess of the amounts required hereunder to be contributed by it
to the capital of the Partnership, the making of such excess advances shall not
result in any increase in the amount of the Capital Account of such Partner. The
amount of any such excess advances shall be a debt obligation of the Partnership
to such Partner and shall be payable or collectible only out of the Partnership
assets in accordance with the terms and conditions upon which such advances are
made.

4.9 NO FRACTIONAL UNITS. No fractional Units shall be issued by the
Partnership.

4.10 SPLITS AND COMBINATIONS. (a) Subject to Section 4.10(d), the General
Partner may make a pro rata distribution of Units or other Partnership
Securities to all Record Holders or may effect a subdivision or combination of
Units or other Partnership Securities; provided, however, that after any such
distribution, subdivision or combination, each Partner shall have the same
Percentage Interest in the Partnership as before such distribution, subdivision
or combination.

29
<PAGE>

(b) Whenever such a distribution, subdivision or combination of Units or other
Partnership Securities is declared, the General Partner shall select a Record
Date as of which the distribution, subdivision or combination shall be effective
and shall send notice of the distribution, subdivision or combination at least
20 days prior to such Record Date to each Record Holder as of the date not less
than 10 days prior to the date of such notice. The General Partner also may
cause a firm of independent public accountants selected by it to calculate the
number of Units to be held by each Record Holder after giving effect to such
distribution, subdivision or combination. The General Partner shall be entitled
to rely on any certificate provided by such firm as conclusive evidence of the
accuracy of such calculation.

(c) Promptly following any such distribution, subdivision or combination, the
General Partner may cause Certificates to be issued to the Record Holders of
Units as of the applicable Record Date representing the new number of Units held
by such Record Holders, or the General Partner may adopt such other procedures
as it may deem appropriate to reflect such distribution, subdivision or
combination; provided, however, if any such distribution, subdivision or
combination results in a smaller total number of Units Outstanding, the General
Partner shall require, as a condition to the delivery to a Record Holder of such
new Certificate, the surrender of any Certificate held by such Record Holder
immediately prior to such Record Date.

(d) The Partnership shall not issue fractional Units upon any distribution,
subdivision or combination of Units. If a distribution, subdivision or
combination of Units would result in the issuance of fractional Units but for
the provisions of Section 4.9 and this Section 4.10(d), each fractional Unit
shall be rounded to the nearest whole Unit (and a 0.5 Unit shall be rounded to
the next higher Unit).

ARTICLE V
ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

5.1 ALLOCATIONS FOR CAPITAL ACCOUNT PURPOSES. For purposes of maintaining the
Capital Accounts and in determining the rights of the Partners among themselves,
the Partnership's items of income, gain, loss and deduction (computed in
accordance with Section 4.5(b)) shall be allocated among the Partners in each
taxable year (or portion thereof) as provided hereinbelow.

(a) Net Income. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
Section 5.1(d), Net Income for each taxable period and all items of income,
gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing Net Income for such
taxable period shall be allocated as follows:

(i) First, 100% to the General Partner until the aggregate Net Income
allocated to the General Partner pursuant to this Section 5.1(a)(i) for the
current taxable year and all previous taxable years is equal to the
aggregate Net Losses allocated to the General Partner pursuant to Section
5.1(b)(iii) for all previous taxable years;

(ii) Second, 100% to the General Partner and the Limited Partners, in
accordance with their respective Percentage Interests, until the aggregate
Net Income allocated to such Partners pursuant to this Section 5.1(a)(ii)
for the current taxable year and all previous taxable years is equal to the
aggregate Net Losses allocated to such Partners pursuant to Section
5.1(b)(ii) for all previous taxable years; and

(iii) Third, the balance, if any, 100% to the General Partner and the
Limited Partners in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.

(b) Net Losses. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in
Section 5.1(d), Net Losses for each taxable period and all items of income,
gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing Net Losses for such
taxable period shall be allocated as follows:

(i) First, 100% to the General Partner and the Limited Partners, in
accordance with their respective Percentage Interests, until the aggregate
Net Losses allocated pursuant to this

30
<PAGE>

Section 5.1(b)(i) for the current taxable year and all previous taxable
years is equal to the aggregate Net Income allocated to such Partners
pursuant to Section 5.1(a)(iii) for all previous taxable years;

(ii) Second, 100% to the General Partner and the Limited Partners in
accordance with their respective Percentage Interests; provided, that Net
Losses shall not be allocated pursuant to this Section 5.1(b)(ii) to the
extent that such allocation would cause any Limited Partner to have a
deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account at the end of such taxable
year (or increase any existing deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital
Account); and

(iii) Third, the balance, if any, 100% to the General Partner.

(c) Net Termination Gains and Losses. After giving effect to the special
allocations set forth in Section 5.1(d), all items of income gain, loss and
deduction taken into account in computing Net Termination Gain or Net
Termination Loss for such taxable period shall be allocated in the same manner
as such Net Termination Gain or Net Termination Loss is allocated hereunder.
All allocations under this Section 5.1(c) shall be made after Capital Account
balances have been adjusted by all other allocations provided under this
Section 5.1 and after all distributions of Available Cash provided under
Section 5.4 have been made with respect to the taxable period ending on the
date of the Partnership's liquidation pursuant to Section 14.3.

(i) If a Net Termination Gain is recognized (or deemed recognized
pursuant to Section 4.5(d)) from Termination Capital Transactions, such Net
Termination Gain shall be allocated among the General Partner, the Limited
Partners and the Special Limited Partners in the following manner (and the
Adjusted Capital Accounts of the Partners shall be increased by the amount
so allocated in each of the following subclauses, in the order listed,
before an allocation is made pursuant to the next succeeding subclause):

(A) First, to each Partner having a deficit balance in its Adjusted
Capital Account, in the proportion that such deficit balance bears to the
total deficit balances in the Adjusted Capital Accounts of all Partners,
until each such Partner has been allocated Net Termination Gain equal to
any such deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account;

(B) Second, 99% to all Limited Partners holding Common Units, in
accordance with their relative Percentage Interests, and 1% to the
General Partner until the Adjusted Capital Account in respect of each
Common Unit then Outstanding is equal to the sum of (1) its Unrecovered
Initial Unit Price plus (2) the Minimum Quarterly Distribution for the
Quarter during which such Net Termination Gain is recognized, reduced by
any distribution pursuant to Sections 5.4(a)(i) or (b)(i) with respect to
such Common Unit for such Quarter (the amount determined pursuant to this
clause (2) is hereinafter defined as the "UNPAID MQD") plus (3) any then
existing Cumulative Common Unit Arrearage with respect to a Common Unit
sold by the Underwriters on the Closing Date;

(C) Third, if such Termination Capital Transaction occurs (or is
deemed to occur) prior to the expiration of the Subordination Period, 99%
to the Limited Partners holding Subordinated Units, in the proportion
that the total number of Subordinated Units held by each such Limited
Partner bears to the total number of Subordinated Units then Outstanding,
and 1% to the General Partner, in the amount which will increase the
Adjusted Capital Account of each such Limited Partner maintained with
respect to such Subordinated Units to that amount which equals the sum of
(1) the Unrecovered Subordinated Unit Capital attributable to such
Subordinated Units, determined for the taxable year (or portion thereof)
to which this allocation of gain relates plus (2) the Minimum Quarterly
Distribution for the Quarter during which such Net Termination Gain is
recognized, reduced by any distribution pursuant to Section 5.4(a)(iii)
with respect to such Subordinated Unit for such Quarter;

31
<PAGE>

(D) Fourth, 99% to all Limited Partners, in accordance with their
relative Percentage Interests, and 1% to the General Partner until the
Adjusted Capital Account in respect of each Common Unit then Outstanding
is equal to the sum of (1) its Unrecovered Initial Unit Price, plus (2)
the Unpaid MQD, if any, for such Common Unit with respect to the Quarter
during which such Net Termination Gain is recognized, plus (3) any then
existing Cumulative Common Unit Arrearage with respect to a Common Unit
sold by the Underwriters on the Closing Date, plus (4) the excess of (aa)
the First Target Distribution less the Minimum Quarterly Distribution for
each Quarter of the Partnership's existence over (bb) the amount of any
distributions of Cash from Operations that was distributed pursuant to
Sections 5.4(a)(iv) or 5.4 (b)(ii) (the sum of (1) plus (2) plus (3) plus
(4) is hereinafter defined as the "FIRST LIQUIDATION TARGET AMOUNT");

(E) Fifth, 85.8673% to all Limited Partners, in accordance with their
relative Percentage Interests, and 13.1327% to the Special Limited
Partners, pro rata, and 1% to the General Partner until the Adjusted
Capital Account in respect of each Common Unit then Outstanding is equal
to the sum of (1) the First Liquidation Target Amount, plus (2) the
excess of (aa) the Second Target Distribution less the First Target
Distribution for each Quarter of the Partnership's existence over (bb)
the amount of any distributions of Cash from Operations that was
distributed pursuant to Section 5.4(a)(v) or 5.4(b)(iii) (the sum of (1)
plus (2) is hereinafter defined as the "SECOND LIQUIDATION TARGET
AMOUNT");

(F) Sixth, 75.7653% to all Limited Partners, in accordance with their
relative Percentage Interests, and 23.2347% to the Special Limited
Partners, pro rata, and 1% to the General Partner until the Adjusted
Capital Account in respect of each Common Unit then Outstanding is equal
to the sum of (1) the Second Liquidation Target Amount, plus (2) the
excess of (aa) the Third Target Distribution less the Second Target
Distribution for each Quarter of the Partnership's existence over (bb)
the amount of any distributions of Cash from Operations that was
distributed pursuant to Section 5.4(a)(vi) or 5.4(b)(iv); and

(G) Finally, any remaining amount 50.5102% to all Limited Partners, in
accordance with their relative Percentage Interests, and 48.4898% to the
Special Limited Partners, pro rata, and 1% to the General Partner.

(ii) If a Net Termination Loss is recognized (or deemed recognized
pursuant to Section 4.5(d)) from Termination Capital Transactions, such Net
Termination Loss shall be allocated to the Partners in the following
manner:

(A) First, if such Termination Capital Transaction occurs (or is
deemed to occur) prior to the conversion of the last outstanding
Subordinated Unit, 99% to the Partners holding Subordinated Units, in
proportion that the total number of Subordinated Units held by each such
Limited Partner bears to the total number of Subordinated Units then
Outstanding, and 1% to the General Partner, until the Adjusted Capital
Account in respect of each Subordinated Unit then Outstanding has been
reduced to zero;

(B) Second, 99% to all Limited Partners holding Common Units, in
accordance with their relative Percentage Interests, and 1% to the
General Partner, until the Adjusted Capital Account in respect of each
Common Unit then Outstanding has been reduced to zero; and

(C) Third, the balance, if any, 100% to the General Partner.

(d) Special Allocations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 5.1, the following special allocations shall be made for such taxable
period:

(i) Partnership Minimum Gain Chargeback. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Section 5.1, if there is a net decrease in Partnership
Minimum Gain during any Partnership

32
<PAGE>

taxable period, each Partner shall be allocated items of Partnership income
and gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in the
manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(f)(6),
1.704-2(g)(2) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(i), or any successor provision. For
purposes of this Section 5.1(d), each Partner's Adjusted Capital Account
balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income or gain required
hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of any other
allocations pursuant to this Section 5.1(d) with respect to such taxable
period (other than an allocation pursuant to Sections 5.1(d)(vi) and
5.1(d)(vii)). This Section 5.1(d)(i) is intended to comply with the
Partnership Minimum Gain chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulation
Section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

(ii) Chargeback of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain. Notwithstanding
the other provisions of this Section 5.1 (other than Section 5.1(d)(i)),
except as provided in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4), if there
is a net decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain during any
Partnership taxable period, any Partner with a share of Partner Nonrecourse
Debt Minimum Gain at the beginning of such taxable period shall be
allocated items of Partnership income and gain for such period (and, if
necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and amounts provided in
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(ii), or any
successor provisions. For purposes of this Section 5.1(d), each Partner's
Adjusted Capital Account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of
income or gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the
application of any other allocations pursuant to this Section 5.1(d), other
than Section 5.1(d)(i) and other than an allocation pursuant to Sections
5.1(d)(vi) and 5.1(d)(vii), with respect to such taxable period. This
Section 5.1(d)(ii) is intended to comply with the chargeback of items of
income and gain requirement in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i)(4)
and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

(iii) Priority Allocations. If the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value
of any property distributed (except cash or property distributed pursuant
to Section 14.3 or 14.4) to any Limited Partner with respect to a taxable
year is greater (on a per Unit basis) than the amount of cash or the Net
Agreed Value of property distributed to the other Limited Partners (on a
per Unit basis), then (1) each Limited Partner receiving such greater cash
or property distribution shall be allocated gross income in an amount equal
to the product of (aa) the amount by which the distribution (on a per Unit
basis) to such Limited Partner exceeds the distribution (on a per Unit
basis) to the Limited Partners receiving the smallest distribution and (bb)
the number of Units owned by the Limited Partner receiving the greater
distribution; and (2) the General Partner shall be allocated gross income
in an aggregate amount equal to 1/99 of the sum of the amounts allocated in
clause (1) above. All or a portion of the remaining items of Partnership
gross income or gain for the taxable period, if any, shall be allocated
100% to the Special Limited Partners, pro rata, until the aggregate amount
of such items allocated to the Special Limited Partners, pro rata, under
this paragraph (iii) for the current taxable period and all previous
taxable periods is equal to the cumulative amount of cash distributed to
the Special Limited Partners, pro rata, from the Closing Date through the
end of such taxable period.

(iv) Qualified Income Offset. In the event any Partner unexpectedly
receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions described in
Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-
1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), items of Partnership income
and gain shall be specifically allocated to such Partner in an amount and
manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury
Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the deficit
balance, if any, in its Adjusted Capital Account created by such
adjustments, allocations or distributions as quickly as possible unless
such deficit balance is otherwise eliminated pursuant to Section 5.1(d)(i)
or (ii).

(v) Gross Income Allocations. In the event any Partner has a deficit
balance in its Adjusted Capital Account at the end of any Partnership
taxable period, such Partner shall be specially allocated items of
Partnership gross income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly

33
<PAGE>

as possible; provided, that an allocation pursuant to this Section
5.1(d)(v) shall be made only if and to the extent that such Partner would
have a deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account after all other
allocations provided for in this Section 5.1 have been tentatively made as
if this Section 5.1(d)(v) were not in this Agreement.

(vi) Nonrecourse Deductions. Nonrecourse Deductions for any taxable
period shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with their
respective Percentage Interests. If the General Partner determines in its
good faith discretion that the Partnership's Nonrecourse Deductions must be
allocated in a different ratio to satisfy the safe harbor requirements of
the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the
General Partner is authorized, upon notice to the Limited Partners, to
revise the prescribed ratio to the numerically closest ratio that does
satisfy such requirements.

(vii) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions. Partner Nonrecourse Deductions for
any taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the Partner that bears the
Economic Risk of Loss with respect to the Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which
such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in accordance with
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(i). If more than one Partner bears the
Economic Risk of Loss with respect to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt, such
Partner Nonrecourse Deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated
between or among such Partners in accordance with the ratios in which they
share such Economic Risk of Loss.

(viii) Nonrecourse Liabilities. For purposes of Treasury Regulation
Section 1.752-3(a)(3), the Partners agree that Nonrecourse Liabilities of
the Partnership in excess of the sum of (A) the amount of Partnership
Minimum Gain and (B) the total amount of Nonrecourse Built-in Gain shall be
allocated among the Partners in accordance with their respective Percentage
Interests.

(ix) Code Section 754 Adjustments. To the extent an adjustment to the
adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Section 734(b) or
743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into account in determining Capital
Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be
treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the
asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of
gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner
consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to
be adjusted pursuant to such Section of the Treasury regulations.

(x) Economic Uniformity. At the election of the General Partner with
respect to any taxable period ending upon, or after, the termination of the
Subordination Period, all or a portion of the remaining items of
Partnership gross income or gain for such taxable period, if any, shall be
allocated 100% to each Partner holding Subordinated Units in the proportion
of the number of Subordinated Units held by such Partner to the total
number of Subordinated Units then Outstanding, until each such Partner has
been allocated an amount of gross income or gain which increases the
Capital Account maintained with respect to such Subordinated Units to an
amount equal to the product of (A) the number of Subordinated Units held by
such Partner and (B) the Per Unit Capital Amount for a Common Unit. The
purpose of this allocation is to establish uniformity between the Capital
Accounts underlying Subordinated Units and the Capital Accounts underlying
Common Units held by Persons other than the General Partner and its
Affiliates immediately prior to the conversion of such Subordinated Units
into Common Units. This allocation method for establishing such economic
uniformity will only be available to the General Partner if the method for
allocating the Capital Account maintained with respect to the Subordinated
Units between the transferred and retained Subordinated Units pursuant to
Section 4.5(c)(ii) does not otherwise provide such economic uniformity to
the Subordinated Units.

(xi) Curative Allocation.

34
<PAGE>

(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5.1, other
than the Required Allocations, the Required Allocations shall be taken
into account in making the Agreed Allocations so that, to the extent
possible, the net amount of items of income, gain, loss and deduction
allocated to each Partner pursuant to the Required Allocations and the
Agreed Allocations, together, shall be equal to the net amount of such
items that would have been allocated to each such Partner under the
Agreed Allocations had the Required Allocations and the related Curative
Allocation not otherwise been provided in this Section 5.1.
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, Required Allocations relating to
(1) Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into account except to the
extent that there has been a decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain and (2)
Partner Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into account except to
the extent that there has been a decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt
Minimum Gain. Allocations pursuant to this Section 5.1(d)(xi)(A) shall
only be made with respect to Required Allocations to the extent the
General Partner reasonably determines that such allocations will
otherwise be inconsistent with the economic agreement among the Partners.
Further, allocations pursuant to this Section 5.1(d)(xi)(A) shall be
deferred with respect to allocations pursuant to clauses (1) and (2)
hereof to the extent the General Partner reasonably determines that such
allocations are likely to be offset by subsequent Required Allocations.

(B) The General Partner shall have reasonable discretion, with respect
to each taxable period, to (1) apply the provisions of Section
5.1(d)(xi)(A) in whatever order is most likely to minimize the economic
distortions that might otherwise result from the Required Allocations,
and (2) divide all allocations pursuant to Section 5.1(d)(xi)(A) among
the Partners in a manner that is likely to minimize such economic
distortions.

(xii) Retirement of Assumed Indebtedness. All losses or deductions
attributable to premiums, consent fees, or other expenditures incurred by
the Partnership to retire indebtedness assumed from the General Partner
pursuant to the Contribution Agreement shall be allocated to the General
Partner.

(xiii) First Year Allocation. Net Income or Net Loss of the Partnership
for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the last day of
the taxable year of the Partnership that includes the Closing Date shall be
allocated 100% to the General Partner. For the immediately succeeding
taxable year of the Partnership, items of income or gain (if the allocation
in the prior year was an allocation of Net Income) or items of loss and
deduction (if the allocation in the prior year was an allocation of Net
Loss) shall be allocated 100% to the Limited Partners, in accordance with
their Percentage Interests, in an amount equal to 99% of the Net Income or
Net Loss allocated to the General Partner in the prior taxable year.

5.2 ALLOCATIONS FOR TAX PURPOSES. (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, for
federal income tax purposes, each item of income, gain, loss and deduction shall
be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of
"book" income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to Section 5.1.

(b) In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a
Contributed Property or Adjusted Property, items of income, gain, loss,
depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions shall be allocated for
federal income tax purposes among the Partners as follows:

(i) (A) In the case of a Contributed Property, such items attributable
thereto shall be allocated among the Partners in the manner provided under
Section 704(c) of the Code that takes into account the variation between the
Agreed Value of such property and its adjusted basis at the time of
contribution; and (B) except as otherwise provided in Section 5.2(b)(iii), any
item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable to a Contributed Property
shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its correlative
item of "book" gain or loss is allocated pursuant to Section 5.1.

35
<PAGE>

(ii) (A) In the case of an Adjusted Property, such items shall (1) first, be
allocated among the Partners in a manner consistent with the principles of
Section 704(c) of the Code to take into account the Unrealized Gain or
Unrealized Loss attributable to such property and the allocations thereof
pursuant to Section 4.5(d)(i) or (ii), and (2) second, in the event such
property was originally a Contributed Property, be allocated among the
Partners in a manner consistent with Section 5.2(b)(i)(A); and (B) except as
otherwise provided in Section 5.2(b)(iii), any item of Residual Gain or
Residual Loss attributable to an Adjusted Property shall be allocated among
the Partners in the same manner as its correlative item of "book" gain or loss
is allocated pursuant to Section 5.1.

(iii) The General Partner shall apply the principles of Temporary
Regulation Section 1.704-3T to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities.

(c) For the proper administration of the Partnership and for the preservation
of uniformity of the Units (or any class or classes thereof), the General
Partner shall have sole discretion to (i) adopt such conventions as it deems
appropriate in determining the amount of depreciation, amortization and cost
recovery deductions; (ii) make special allocations for federal income tax
purposes of income (including, without limitation, gross income) or deductions;
and (iii) amend the provisions of this Agreement as appropriate (x) to reflect
the proposal or promulgation of Treasury regulations under Section 704(b) or
Section 704(c) of the Code or (y) otherwise to preserve or achieve uniformity of
the Units (or any class or classes thereof). The General Partner may adopt such
conventions, make such allocations and make such amendments to this Agreement as
provided in this Section 5.2(c) only if such conventions, allocations or
amendments would not have a material adverse effect on the Partners, the holders
of any class or classes of Units issued and Outstanding or the Partnership, and
if such allocations are consistent with the principles of Section 704 of the
Code.

(d) The General Partner in its sole discretion may determine to depreciate or
amortize the portion of an adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Code
attributable to unrealized appreciation in any Adjusted Property (to the extent
of the unamortized Book-Tax Disparity) using a predetermined rate derived from
the depreciation or amortization method and useful life applied to the
Partnership's common basis of such property, despite the inconsistency of such
approach with Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.168-2(n), Treasury
Regulation Section 1.167(c)-1(a)(6) or the legislative history of Section 197 of
the Code. If the General Partner determines that such reporting position cannot
reasonably be taken, the General Partner may adopt depreciation and amortization
conventions under which all purchasers acquiring Units in the same month would
receive depreciation and amortization deductions, based upon the same applicable
rate as if they had purchased a direct interest in the Partnership's property.
If the General Partner chooses not to utilize such aggregate method, the General
Partner may use any other reasonable depreciation and amortization conventions
to preserve the uniformity of the intrinsic tax characteristics of any Units
that would not have a material adverse effect on the Limited Partners or the
Record Holders of any class or classes of Units.

(e) Any gain allocated to the Partners upon the sale or other taxable
disposition of any Partnership asset shall, to the extent possible, after taking
into account other required allocations of gain pursuant to this Section 5.2, be
characterized as Recapture Income in the same proportions and to the same extent
as such Partners (or their predecessors in interest) have been allocated any
deductions directly or indirectly giving rise to the treatment of such gains as
Recapture Income.

(f) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the
Partnership for federal income tax purposes and allocated to the Partners in
accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined without regard to any
election under Section 754 of the Code which may be made by the Partnership;
provided, however, that such allocations, once made, shall be adjusted as
necessary or appropriate to take into account those adjustments permitted or
required by Sections 734 and 743 of the Code.

36
<PAGE>

(g) Each item of Partnership income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to
a transferred Partnership Interest of the General Partner or to transferred
Units shall, for federal income tax purposes, be determined on an annual basis
and prorated on a monthly basis and shall be allocated to the Partners as of the
opening of the New York Stock Exchange on the first Business Day of each month;
provided, however, that (i) if the Underwriter's Overallotment Option is not
exercised, such items for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on
the last day of the month in which the Closing Date occurs shall be allocated to
Partners as of the opening of the New York Stock Exchange on the first Business
Day of the next succeeding month or (ii) if the Underwriters' Overallotment
Option is exercised, such items for the period beginning on the Closing Date and
ending on the last day of the month in which the Second Time of Delivery (as
defined in the Underwriting Agreement) occurs shall be allocated to the Partners
as of the opening of the New York Stock Exchange on the first Business Day of
the next succeeding month; and provided, further, that gain or loss on a sale or
other disposition of any assets of the Partnership other than in the ordinary
course of business shall be allocated to the Partners as of the opening of the
New York Stock Exchange on the first Business Day of the month in which such
gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax purposes. The General Partner
may revise, alter or otherwise modify such methods of allocation as it
determines necessary, to the extent permitted or required by Section 706 of the
Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder.

(h) Allocations that would otherwise be made to a Limited Partner under the
provisions of this Article V shall instead be made to the beneficial owner of
Units held by a nominee in any case in which the nominee has furnished the
identity of such owner to the Partnership in accordance with Section 6031(c) of
the Code or any other method acceptable to the General Partner in its sole
discretion.

5.3 REQUIREMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION OF DISTRIBUTIONS. (a) Within 45 days
following the end of (i) the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on
October 31, 1994 and (ii) each Quarter commencing with the Quarter beginning on
November 1, 1994, an amount equal to 100% of Available Cash with respect to such
period or Quarter shall be distributed in accordance with this Article V by the
Partnership to the Partners, as of the Record Date selected by the General
Partner in its reasonable discretion. All amounts of Available Cash distributed
by the Partnership on any date from any source shall be deemed to be Cash from
Operations until the sum of all amounts of Available Cash theretofore
distributed by the Partnership to Partners pursuant to Section 5.4 equals the
aggregate amount of all Cash from Operations generated by the Partnership since
the Closing Date through the close of the immediately preceding Quarter. Any
remaining amounts of Available Cash distributed by the Partnership on such date
shall, except as otherwise provided in Section 5.5, be deemed to be Cash from
Interim Capital Transactions.

(b) Notwithstanding the definitions of Available Cash and Cash from Operations
contained herein, disbursements (including, without limitation, contributions to
the Operating Partnership or disbursements on behalf of the Operating
Partnership) made or cash reserves established, increased or reduced after the
end of any Quarter but on or before the date on which the Partnership makes its
distribution of Available Cash in respect of such Quarter pursuant to Section
5.3(a) shall be deemed to have been made, established, increased or reduced for
purposes of determining Available Cash and Cash from Operations, within such
Quarter if the General Partner so determines. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event of the dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership, all proceeds of
such liquidation shall be applied and distributed in accordance with, and
subject to the terms and conditions of, Sections 14.3 and 14.4.

5.4 DISTRIBUTIONS OF CASH FROM OPERATIONS. (a) During Subordination Period.
Available Cash with respect to any Quarter within the Subordination Period that
is deemed to be Cash from Operations pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.3
or 5.5 shall be distributed as follows, except as otherwise required by Section
4.3(b) in respect of additional Partnership Securities issued pursuant thereto:

(i) First, 99% to the Limited Partners holding Common Units, in accordance
with their relative Percentage Interests, and 1% to the General Partner until
there has been distributed in respect of each Common Unit then Outstanding an
amount equal to the Minimum Quarterly Distribution;

37
<PAGE>

(ii) Second, 99% to the Limited Partners holding Common Units, in

relative Percentage Interests, 13.1327% to the Special Limited Partners, pro
rata, and 1% to the General Partner until there has been distributed in

Second Target Distribution over the First Target Distribution;

(vi) Sixth, 75.7653% to all Limited Partners, in accordance with their
relative Percentage Interests, 23.2347% to the Special Limited Partners, pro
rata, and 1% to the General Partner until there has been distributed in

(vii) Thereafter, 50.5102% to all Limited Partners, in accordance with
their relative Percentage Interests, 48.4898% to the Special Limited Partners,
pro rata, and 1% to the General Partner;

provided, however, if the Minimum Quarterly Distribution, the First Target
Distribution, the Second Target Distribution and the Third Target Distribution
have been reduced to zero pursuant to the second sentence of Section 5.6, the
distributions of Available Cash that is deemed to be Cash from Operations with
respect to any Quarter will be made in accordance with Section 5.4(a)(vii).

(b) After Subordination Period. Available Cash with respect to any Quarter
after the Subordination Period that is deemed to be Cash from Operations
pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.3 or 5.5 shall be distributed as
follows, except as otherwise required by Section 4.2(b) in respect of additional
Partnership Securities issued pursuant thereto:

(i) First, 99% to all Limited Partners, in accordance with their relative
Percentage Interests, and 1% to the General Partner until there has been
distributed in respect of each Unit then Outstanding an amount equal to the

relative Percentage Interests, 13.1327% to the Special Limited Partners, pro
rata, and 1% to the General Partner until there has been distributed in

<PAGE>

there has been distributed in respect of each Unit then Outstanding an amount

Distribution; and

(v) Thereafter, 50.5102% to all Limited Partners, in accordance with their
relative Percentage Interests, 48.4898% to the Special Limited Partners, pro
rata, and 1% to the General Partner;

provided, however, if the Minimum Quarterly Distribution, the First Target
Distribution, the Second Target Distribution and the Third Target Distribution
have been reduced to zero pursuant to the second sentence of Section 5.6, the
distributions of Available Cash that is deemed to be Cash from Operations with
respect to any Quarter will be made in accordance with Section 5.4(b)(v).

5.5 DISTRIBUTIONS OF CASH FROM INTERIM CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS. Available Cash
that constitutes Cash from Interim Capital Transactions shall be distributed,
unless the provisions of Section 5.3 require otherwise, 99% to all Limited
Partners, in accordance with their relative Percentage Interests, and 1% to the
General Partner until a hypothetical holder of a Common Unit acquired on the
Closing Date has received with respect to such Common Unit, during the period
since the Closing Date through such date, distributions of Available Cash that
are deemed to be Cash from Interim Capital Transactions in an aggregate amount
equal to the Initial Unit Price. Thereafter, all Available Cash shall be
distributed as if it were Cash from Operations and shall be distributed in
accordance with Section 5.4.

5.6 ADJUSTMENT OF MINIMUM QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTION AND TARGET DISTRIBUTION
LEVELS. (a) The Minimum Quarterly Distribution, First Target Distribution,
Second Target Distribution and Third Target Distribution shall be
proportionately adjusted in the event of any distribution, combination or
subdivision (whether effected by a distribution payable in Units or otherwise)
of Units or other Partnership Securities in accordance with Section 4.10. In the
event of a distribution of Available Cash that is deemed to be Cash from Interim
Capital Transactions, the Minimum Quarterly Distribution, First Target
Distribution, Second Target Distribution and Third Target Distribution shall be
adjusted proportionately downward to equal the product obtained by multiplying
the otherwise applicable Minimum Quarterly Distribution, First Target
Distribution, Second Target Distribution and Third Target Distribution, as the
case may be, by a fraction of which the numerator is the Unrecovered Initial
Unit Price of the Common Units immediately after giving effect to such
distribution and of which the denominator is the Unrecovered Initial Unit Price
of the Common Units immediately prior to giving effect to such distribution.

(b) The Minimum Quarterly Distribution, First Target Distribution, Second
Target Distribution and Third Target Distribution shall also be subject to
adjustment pursuant to Section 9.6.

5.7 SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE SUBORDINATED UNITS.

(a) Except with respect to the right to vote on or approve matters requiring
the vote or approval of a percentage of the holders of Outstanding Common Units
and the right to participate in allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction
and distributions of cash made with respect to Common Units pursuant to this
Article V, the holder of a Subordinated Unit shall have all of the rights and
obligations of a Limited Partner holding Common Units hereunder; provided,
however, that immediately upon the end of the Subordination Period or upon the
conversion of Subordinated Units as provided in subparagraph (b) below, the
holder of a Subordinated Unit shall possess all of the rights and obligations of
a Limited Partner holding Common Units hereunder, including, without limitation,
the right to vote as a Common Unitholder, the right to participate in
allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction and distributions of cash made
with respect to Common Units pursuant to this Article V (but such Subordinated
Units shall remain subject to the provisions of Sections 4.5(c)(ii) and
5.1(d)(x)).

(b) A total of 5,531,240 Subordinated Units will convert into Common Units
(subject to paragraph (c) immediately below) on the first day of any Quarter
commencing on or after August 1, 1997, provided that each of the following two
tests have been satisfied:

39
<PAGE>

(i) the Partnership has, with respect to each of the two consecutive four-
Quarter periods immediately preceding such date, made distributions of
Available Cash constituting Cash from Operations on the Common Units and the
Subordinated Units in an amount equal to or greater than the Minimum Quarterly
Distribution on each Common Unit and Subordinated Unit Outstanding for such
periods; provided, however, that in determining the amount of Available Cash
constituting Cash from Operations distributed in any four-Quarter period the
following amounts shall not be included: (A) any positive balance in Cash from
Operations at the beginning of such four-Quarter period, (B) any net increase
in working capital borrowings in such four-Quarter period and (C) any net
decrease in reserves in such four-Quarter period; and

(ii) the amount of Available Cash constituting Cash from Operations
generated by the Partnership in each of the two consecutive four-Quarter
periods immediately preceding such date, equaled or exceeded 125% of the
Minimum Quarterly Distribution on all Common Units and all Subordinated Units
for such periods; provided, however, that in determining the amount of
Available Cash constituting Cash from Operations generated by the Partnership
in any four-Quarter period (A) the following amounts shall not be included:
(1) any positive balance in Cash from Operations at the beginning of such
four-Quarter period, (2) any net increase in working capital borrowings in
such four-Quarter period and (3) any net decrease in reserves in such four-
Quarter period, and (B) any net increase in reserves in such four-Quarter
period to provide funds for distributions with respect to Units and any
general partner interests in the Partnership shall be included.

(c) After the end of the Subordination Period or upon the occurrence of the
events described in subparagraph (b) of this Section 5.7, once the General
Partner determines, based on advice of counsel, that a Subordinated Unit has, as
a substantive matter, like intrinsic economic and federal income tax
characteristics, in all material respects, to the intrinsic economic and federal
income tax characteristics of a Common Unit then Outstanding, then the
Subordinated Unit shall be converted to a Common Unit (on a one-for-one basis)
and from that time forward (which time shall, except as provided in subparagraph
(b) above, in no event commence before the first day following the end of the
Subordination Period) shall constitute a Common Unit for all purposes under this
Agreement. In connection with the condition set forth above, it is understood
that the General Partner may take whatever reasonable steps are required to
provide economic uniformity to the Subordinated Units in preparation for a
conversion into Common Units, including the application of Sections 4.5(c) and
5.1(d)(x); provided, however, that no such steps may be taken that would have a
material adverse effect on the Limited Partners holding Common Units or the
Record Holders of any class of Units.

5.8 SPECIAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE SPECIAL LIMITED PARTNERS.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Special Limited Partners (a) shall (i) possess the rights and obligations
provided in this Agreement with respect to a Limited Partner pursuant to
Articles VI and VII and (ii) have a Capital Account as a Partner pursuant to
Section 4.5 and all other provisions related thereto and (b) shall not (i) be
entitled to vote on any matters requiring the approval or vote of the holders of
Outstanding Units, (ii) be entitled to any distributions other than to Partners
pursuant to Sections 5.4(a)(v), (vi) and (vii), 5.4(b)(iii), (iv) and (v), 14.3
and 14.4 or (iii) be allocated items of income, gain, loss or deduction other
than as specified in this Article V.

affairs of the Partnership. In addition to the powers now or hereafter granted a
general partner of a limited

40

partnership under applicable law or which are granted to the General Partner
under any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner, subject to
Section 6.3, shall have full power and authority to do all things and on such

that may be required by Section 6.3); (iv) the use of the assets of the
Partnership (including, without limitation, cash on hand) for any purpose
consistent with the terms of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the

limitation, the Operating Partnership, the General Partner and Affiliates of the
General Partner) and the repayment of obligations of the Partnership and the
Operating Partnership and the making of capital contributions to the Operating

that limit the liability of the Partnership under contractual arrangements to
all or particular assets of the Partnership, with the other party to the
contract to have no recourse against the General Partner or its assets other
than its interest in the Partnership, even if same results in the terms of the
transaction being less favorable to the Partnership than would otherwise be the
case); (vi) the distribution of Partnership cash; (vii) the selection and
dismissal of employees and agents (including, without limitation, employees
having titles such as "president," "vice president," "secretary" and
"treasurer") and agents, outside attorneys, accountants, consultants and

employment or hiring; (viii) the maintenance of such insurance for the benefit
of the Partnership, the Operating Partnership and the Partners (including,
without limitation, the assets of the Operating Partnership and the Partnership)
as it deems necessary or appropriate; (ix) the formation of, or acquisition of
an interest in, and the contribution of property and the making of loans to, any
further limited or general partnerships, joint ventures, corporations or other
relationships (including, without limitation, the acquisition of interests in,
and the contributions of property to, the Operating Partnership from time to
time); (x) the control of any matters affecting the rights and obligations of
the Partnership, including, without limitation, the bringing and defending of
actions at law or in equity and otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation
and the incurring of legal expense and the settlement of claims and litigation;
(xi) the indemnification of any Person against liabilities and contingencies to
the extent permitted by law; (xii) the entering into of listing agreements with

delisting of some or all of the Units from, or requesting that trading be
suspended on, any such exchange (subject to any prior approval that may be
required under Section 1.6); (xiii) the purchase, sale or other acquisition or
disposition of Units; and (xiv) the undertaking of any action in connection with
the Partnership's participation in the Operating Partnership as the limited
partner (including, without limitation, contributions or loans of funds by the
Partnership to the Operating Partnership).

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Operating
Partnership Agreement, the Delaware Act or any applicable law, rule or
regulation, each of the Partners and Assignees and each other Person who may
acquire an interest in Units hereby (i) approves, ratifies and confirms the
execution, delivery and performance by the parties thereto of the Operating
Partnership Agreement, the Underwriting Agreement, the Contribution Agreement,
the agreements and other documents filed as exhibits to the Registration
Statement, and the other agreements described in or filed as a part of the
Registration Statement, and the engaging by any Affiliate of the General Partner
in business and activities (other than Restricted Activities) that are in direct
competition with the business and activities of the Partnership and the
Operating Partnership; (ii) agrees that the General Partner (on its own or
through any officer of the Partnership) is authorized to execute, deliver and
perform the agreements

41
<PAGE>

referred to in clause (i) of this sentence and the other agreements, acts,
transactions and matters described in or contemplated by the Registration
Statement on behalf of the Partnership without any further act, approval or vote
of the Partners or the Assignees or the other Persons who may acquire an
interest in Units; and (iii) agrees that the execution, delivery or performance
by the General Partner, the Partnership, the Operating Partnership or any
Affiliate of any of them, of this Agreement or any agreement authorized or
permitted under this Agreement (including, without limitation, the exercise by
the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner of the rights
accorded pursuant to Article XVII), or the engaging by any Affiliate of the
General Partner in any business and activities (other than Restricted
Activities) that are in direct competition with the business and activities of
the Partnership and the Operating Partnership, shall not constitute a breach by
the General Partner of any duty that the General Partner may owe the Partnership
or the Limited Partners or the Assignees or any other Persons under this
Agreement (or any other agreements) or of any duty stated or implied by law or
equity. The term "Affiliate" when used in this Section 6.1(b) with respect to
the General Partner shall not include the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the
Partnership.

6.2 CERTIFICATE OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP. The General Partner has caused the
Certificate of Limited Partnership to be filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware as required by the Delaware Act and shall use all
reasonable efforts to cause to be filed such other certificates or documents as
may be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion to be reasonable
and necessary or appropriate for the formation, continuation, qualification and
operation of a limited partnership (or a partnership in which the limited
partners have limited liability) in the State of Delaware or any other state in
which the Partnership may elect to do business or own property. To the extent
that such action is determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion to
be reasonable and necessary or appropriate, the General Partner shall file
amendments to and restatements of the Certificate of Limited Partnership and do
all things to maintain the Partnership as a limited partnership (or a
partnership in which the limited partners have limited liability) under the laws
of the State of Delaware or of any other state in which the Partnership may
elect to do business or own property. Subject to the terms of Section 7.5(a),
the General Partner shall not be required, before or after filing, to deliver or
mail a copy of the Certificate of Limited Partnership, any qualification
document or any amendment thereto to any Limited Partner or Assignee.

6.3 RESTRICTIONS ON GENERAL PARTNER'S AUTHORITY. (a) The General Partner may
not, without written approval of the specific act by all of the Outstanding
Units or by other written instrument executed and delivered by all of the
Outstanding Units subsequent to the date of this Agreement, take any action in
contravention of this Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) any act that
would make it impossible to carry on the ordinary business of the Partnership,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement; (ii) possess Partnership
property, or assign any rights in specific Partnership property, for other than
a Partnership purpose; (iii) admit a Person as a Partner, except as otherwise
provided in this Agreement; (iv) amend this Agreement in any manner, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement; or (v) transfer its interest as general
partner of the Partnership, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

(b) Except as provided in Articles XIV and XVI, the General Partner may not
sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the
Partnership's assets in a single transaction or a series of related transactions
or approve on behalf of the Partnership the sale, exchange or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the assets of the Operating Partnership, without
the approval of at least a majority of the Outstanding Units (other than Units
owned by the General Partner and its Affiliates) during the Subordination Period
and thereafter without the approval of at least a majority of the Outstanding
Units; provided, however, that this provision shall not preclude or limit the
General Partner's ability to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security
interest in all or substantially all of the Partnership's assets and shall not
apply to any forced sale of any or all of the Partnership's assets pursuant to
the foreclosure of, or other realization upon, any such encumbrance. Without the
approval of at least two-thirds of the Outstanding Units, the General Partner
shall not, on behalf of the Partnership, (i) consent to any amendment to the
Operating Partnership Agreement or, except as expressly permitted by Section
6.9(d), take any action permitted to be taken by a partner of the

42
<PAGE>

Operating Partnership, in either case, that would have a material adverse effect
on the Partnership as a partner of the Operating Partnership or (ii) except as
permitted under Sections 11.2, 13.1 and 13.2 elect or cause the Partnership to
elect a successor general partner of the Operating Partnership.

(c) Unless approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-
thirds of each class of Outstanding Units, including two-thirds of the Common
Units (excluding for purposes of such determination Common Units owned by the
General Partner and its Affiliates), the General Partner shall not take any
action or refuse to take any reasonable action the effect of which, if taken or
not taken, as the case may be, would be to cause the Partnership or the
Operating Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation
or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes; provided
that this Section 6.3(c) shall not be construed to apply to amendments to this
Agreement (which are governed by Article XV) or mergers or consolidations of the
Partnership with any Person (which are governed by Article XVI).

(d) At all times while serving as the general partner of the Partnership, the
General Partner shall not (except as provided below) make any dividend or
distribution on, or repurchase any shares of, its stock or take any other action
within its control unless it shall first receive an Opinion of Counsel that the
effect of such dividend, distribution, repurchase or other action would not
reduce its net worth below an amount such that the Partnership will be treated
as an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes;
provided, however, to the extent the General Partner receives distributions of
cash from the Partnership, the Operating Partnership or any other partnership of
which the Partnership is, directly or indirectly, a partner, the General Partner
shall not use such cash to make any dividend or distribution on, or repurchase
any shares of, its stock or take any other action within its control if the
effect of such dividend, distribution, repurchase or other action would be to
reduce its net worth below an amount necessary to receive an Opinion of Counsel
that the Partnership will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax
purposes.

6.4 REIMBURSEMENT OF THE GENERAL PARTNER. (a) Except as provided in this
Section 6.4 and elsewhere in this Agreement or in the Operating Partnership
Agreement, the General Partner shall not be compensated for its services as
general partner of the Partnership or the Operating Partnership.

(b) The General Partner shall be reimbursed on a monthly basis, or such other
basis as the General Partner may determine in its sole discretion, for (i) all
direct and indirect expenses it incurs or payments it makes on behalf of the
Partnership (including, without limitation, salary, bonus, incentive
compensation and other amounts paid to any Person to perform services for the
Partnership or for the General Partner in the discharge of its duties to the
Partnership), and (ii) all other necessary or appropriate expenses allocable to
the Partnership or otherwise reasonably incurred by the General Partner in
connection with operating the Partnership's business (including, without
limitation, expenses allocated to the General Partner by its Affiliates). The
General Partner shall determine the fees and expenses that are allocable to the
Partnership in any reasonable manner determined by the General Partner in its
sole discretion. Reimbursements pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall be in
addition to any reimbursement to the General Partner as a result of
indemnification pursuant to Section 6.7.

(c) Subject to Section 4.3(c), the General Partner in its sole discretion and
without the approval of the Limited Partners (who shall have no right to vote in
respect thereof) may propose and adopt on behalf of the Partnership, employee
benefit and incentive plans (including, without limitation, plans involving the
issuance of Units), or issue Partnership Securities pursuant to any employee
benefit or incentive plan maintained or sponsored by the General Partner or one
of its Affiliates, in each case for the benefit of employees of the General
Partner, the Partnership, the Operating Partnership or any Affiliate of any of
them in respect of services performed, directly or indirectly, for the benefit
of the Partnership or the Operating Partnership. The Partnership agrees to issue
and sell to the General Partner any Units or other Partnership Securities that
the General Partner is obligated to provide to any employees pursuant to any
such benefit or incentive plans. Expenses incurred by the General Partner in
connection with any such plans (including the net cost to the General Partner of
Units purchased by the General Partner from the Partnership to fulfill options
or awards under such plans) shall be

43
<PAGE>

reimbursed in accordance with Section 6.4(b). Any and all obligations of the
General Partner under any employee benefit or incentive plans adopted by the
General Partner as permitted by this Section 6.4(c) shall constitute obligations
of the General Partner hereunder and shall be assumed by any successor General
Partner approved pursuant to Section 13.1 or 13.2 or the transferee of or
successor to all of the General Partner's Partnership Interest as a general
partner in the Partnership pursuant to Section 11.2.

6.5 OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES. (a) After the Closing Date, the General Partner, for
so long as it is the general partner of the Partnership, (i) agrees that its
sole business will be to act as a general partner of the Partnership, the
Operating Partnership and any other partnership of which the Partnership or the
Operating Partnership is, directly or indirectly, a partner and to undertake
activities that are ancillary or related thereto (including being a limited
partner in the Partnership), (ii) shall not enter into or conduct any business
or incur any debts or liabilities except in connection with or incidental to (A)
its performance of the activities required or authorized by this Agreement or
the Operating Partnership Agreement or described in or contemplated by the
Registration Statement and (B) the acquisition, ownership or disposition of
Partnership Interests in the Partnership or partnership interests in the
Operating Partnership or any other partnership of which the Partnership or the
Operating Partnership is, directly or indirectly, a partner, except that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, employees of the General Partner may perform
services for Ferrell and its Affiliates, and (iii) shall not and shall cause its
Affiliates not to engage in any Restricted Activity.

(b) Except as described in Section 6.5(a), no Indemnitee shall be expressly or
implicitly restricted or proscribed pursuant to this Agreement, the Operating
Partnership Agreement or the partnership relationship established hereby or
thereby from engaging in other activities for profit, whether in the businesses
engaged in by the Partnership or the Operating Partnership or anticipated to be
engaged in by the Partnership, the Operating Partnership or otherwise,
including, without limitation, in the case of any Affiliates of the General
Partner those businesses and activities (other than Restricted Activities) in
direct competition with the business and activities of the Partnership or the
Operating Partnership or otherwise described in or contemplated by the
Registration Statement. Without limitation of and subject to the foregoing each
Indemnitee (other than the General Partner) shall have the right to engage in
businesses of every type and description and to engage in and possess an
interest in other business ventures of any and every type or description,
independently or with others, including, without limitation, in the case of any
Affiliates of the General Partner business interests and activities (other than
Restricted Activities) in direct competition with the business and activities of
the Partnership or the Operating Partnership, and none of the same shall
constitute a breach of this Agreement or any duty to the Partnership, the
Operating Partnership or any Partner or Assignee. Neither the Partnership, the
Operating Partnership, any Limited Partner nor any other Person shall have any
rights by virtue of this Agreement, the Operating Partnership Agreement or the
partnership relationship established hereby or thereby in any business ventures
of any Indemnitee (subject, in the case of the General Partner, to compliance
with Section 6.5(c)) and such Indemnitees shall have no obligation to offer any
interest in any such business ventures to the Partnership, the Operating
Partnership, any Limited Partner or any other Person. The General Partner and
any other Persons affiliated with the General Partner may acquire Units or other
Partnership Securities in addition to those acquired by any of such Persons on
the Closing Date, and, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, shall be
entitled to exercise all rights of an Assignee or Limited Partner, as
applicable, relating to such Units or Partnership Securities, as the case may
be.

(c) Subject to the terms of Sections 6.5(a) and (b) but otherwise
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the competitive
activities of any Indemnitees (other than the General Partner) are hereby
approved by the Partnership and all Partners and (ii) it shall be deemed not to
be a breach of the General Partner's fiduciary duty or any other obligation of
any type whatsoever of the General Partner for the General Partner to permit an
Affiliate of the General Partner to engage, or for any such Affiliate to engage,
in business interests and activities (other than Restricted Activities) in
preference to or to the exclusion of the Partnership.

44
<PAGE>

(d) The term "Affiliates" when used in this Section 6.5 with respect to the
General Partner shall not include the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the
Partnership.

6.6 LOANS TO AND FROM THE GENERAL PARTNER; CONTRACTS WITH AFFILIATES. (a) The
General Partner or any Affiliate thereof may lend to the Partnership or the
Operating Partnership, and the Partnership and the Operating Partnership may
borrow, funds needed or desired by the Partnership and the Operating Partnership
for such periods of time as the General Partner may determine and (ii) the
General Partner or any Affiliate thereof may borrow from the Partnership or the
Operating Partnership, and the Partnership and the Operating Partnership may
lend to the General Partner or such Affiliate, excess funds of the Partnership
and the Operating Partnership for such periods of time and in such amounts as
the General Partner may determine; provided, however, that in either such case
the lending party may not charge the borrowing party interest at a rate greater
than the rate that would be charged the borrowing party (without reference to
the lending party's financial abilities or guarantees), by unrelated lenders on
comparable loans. The borrowing party shall reimburse the lending party for any
costs (other than any additional interest costs) incurred by the lending party
in connection with the borrowing of such funds. For purposes of this Section
6.6(a) and Section 6.6(b), the term "Partnership" shall include any Affiliate of
the Partnership that is controlled by the Partnership and the term "Operating
Partnership" shall include any Affiliate of the Operating Partnership that is
controlled by the Operating Partnership.

(b) The Partnership may lend or contribute to the Operating Partnership, and
the Operating Partnership may borrow, funds on terms and conditions established
in the sole discretion of the General Partner; provided, however, that the
Partnership may not charge the Operating Partnership interest at a rate greater
than the rate that would be charged to the Operating Partnership (without
reference to the General Partner's financial abilities or guarantees), by
unrelated lenders on comparable loans. The foregoing authority shall be
exercised by the General Partner in its sole discretion and shall not create any
right or benefit in favor of the Operating Partnership or any other Person.

(c) The General Partner may itself, or may enter into an agreement with any of
its Affiliates to, render services to the Partnership or to the General Partner
in the discharge of its duties as general partner of the Partnership. Any
services rendered to the Partnership by the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates shall be on terms that are fair and reasonable to the Partnership;
provided, however, that the requirements of this Section 6.6(c) shall be deemed
satisfied as to (i) any transaction approved by Special Approval, (ii) any
transaction, the terms of which are no less favorable to the Partnership than
those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or
(iii) any transaction that, taking into account the totality of the
relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that
may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Partnership), is equitable
to the Partnership. The provisions of Section 6.4 shall apply to the rendering
of services described in this Section 6.6(c).

(d) The Partnership may transfer assets to joint ventures, other partnerships,
corporations, limited liability companies or other business entities in which it
is or thereby becomes a participant upon such terms and subject to such
conditions as are consistent with this Agreement and applicable law.

(e) Neither the General Partner nor any of its Affiliates shall sell, transfer
or convey any property to, or purchase any property from, the Partnership,
directly or indirectly, except pursuant to transactions that are fair and
reasonable to the Partnership; provided, however, that the requirements of this
Section 6.6(e) shall be deemed to be satisfied as to (i) the transactions
effected pursuant to Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3, the Contribution Agreement and
any other transactions described in or contemplated by the Registration
Statement, (ii) any transaction approved by Special Approval, (iii) any
transaction, the terms of which are no less favorable to the Partnership than
those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties, or
(iv) any transaction that, taking into account the totality of the relationships
between the parties involved (including other transactions that may be
particularly favorable or advantageous to the Partnership), is equitable to the
Partnership.

45
<PAGE>

(f) The General Partner and its Affiliates will have no obligation to permit
the Partnership or the Operating Partnership to use any facilities or assets of
the General Partner and its Affiliates, except as may be provided in contracts
entered into from time to time specifically dealing with such use, nor shall
there be any obligation on the part of the General Partner or its Affiliates to
enter into such contracts.

(g) Without limitation of Sections 6.6(a) through 6.6(f), and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the existence of the conflicts of
interest described in the Registration Statement are hereby approved by all
Partners.

6.7 INDEMNIFICATION. (a) To the fullest extent permitted by law but subject to
the limitations expressly provided in this Agreement, the General Partner, any
Departing Partner and any Person who is or was an officer or director of the
General Partner or any Departing Partner and all other Indemnitees shall be
indemnified and held harmless by the Partnership from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several, expenses (including,
without limitation, legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, penalties,
interest, settlements and other amounts arising from any and all claims,
demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative, in which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is threatened to
be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of its status as (i) the General
Partner, a Departing Partner or any of their Affiliates, (ii) an officer,
director, employee, partner, agent or trustee of the Partnership, the General
Partner, any Departing Partner or any of their Affiliates or (iii) a Person
serving at the request of the Partnership in another entity in a similar
capacity, provided, that in each case the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in
a manner which such Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to,
the best interests of the Partnership and, with respect to any criminal
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe its conduct was unlawful;
provided, further, no indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall be
available to the General Partner with respect to its obligations incurred
pursuant to the Underwriting Agreement or the Contribution Agreement (other than
obligations incurred by the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership or the
Operating Partnership). The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by
judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon a plea of nolo contendere, or
its equivalent, shall not create a presumption that the Indemnitee acted in a
manner contrary to that specified above. Any indemnification pursuant to this
Section 6.7 shall be made only out of the assets of the Partnership, it being
agreed that the General Partner shall not be personally liable for such
indemnification and shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or
property to the Partnership to enable it to effectuate such indemnification.

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including, without
limitation, legal fees and expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is
indemnified pursuant to Section 6.7(a) in defending any claim, demand, action,
suit or proceeding shall, from time to time, be advanced by the Partnership
prior to the final disposition of such claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding
upon receipt by the Partnership of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall be determined that the Indemnitee is
not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Section 6.7.

(c) The indemnification provided by this Section 6.7 shall be in addition to
any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any agreement,
pursuant to any vote of the holders of Outstanding Units, as a matter of law or
otherwise, both as to actions in the Indemnitee's capacity as (i) the General
Partner, a Departing Partner or an Affiliate thereof, (ii) an officer, director,
employee, partner, agent or trustee of the Partnership, the General Partner, any
Departing Partner or an Affiliate thereof or (iii) a Person serving at the
request of the Partnership in another entity in a similar capacity, and as to
actions in any other capacity (including, without limitation, any capacity under
the Underwriting Agreement), and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has
ceased to serve in such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
successors, assigns and administrators of the Indemnitee.

(d) The Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse the General
Partner or its Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of the General
Partner and such other Persons as the General Partner shall determine, against
any liability that may be asserted against or expense that may be incurred by
such Person in connection with the Partnership's activities, regardless of
whether the

46
<PAGE>

Partnership would have the power to indemnify such Person against such liability
under the provisions of this Agreement.

(e) For purposes of this Section 6.7, the Partnership shall be deemed to have
requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan
whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also imposes
duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants or
beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with respect
to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall constitute "fines"
within the meaning of Section 6.7(a); and action taken or omitted by it with
respect to an employee benefit plan in the performance of its duties for a
purpose reasonably believed by it to be in the interest of the participants and
beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose which is in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the Partnership.

(f) In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partners to personal
liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement.

(g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part
under this Section 6.7 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction
with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was
otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

(h) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees,
their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall not be deemed to
create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.

(i) No amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 6.7 or any provision
hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of any past,
present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Partnership, nor the
obligation of the Partnership to indemnify any such Indemnitee under and in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.7 as in effect immediately
prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising
from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such
amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or
be asserted.

6.8 LIABILITY OF INDEMNITEES. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, no Indemnitee shall be liable for monetary damages to
the Partnership, the Limited Partners, the Assignees or any other Persons who
have acquired interests in the Units, for losses sustained or liabilities
incurred as a result of any act or omission if such Indemnitee acted in good
faith.

(b) Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in
Section 6.1(a), the General Partner may exercise any of the powers granted to it
by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it hereunder either
directly or by or through its agents, and the General Partner shall not be
responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent
appointed by the General Partner in good faith.

(c) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 6.8 or any provision
hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the limitations
on the liability to the Partnership and the Limited Partners of the General
Partner, its directors, officers and employees under this Section 6.8 as in
effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect
to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part,
prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims
may arise or be asserted.

6.9 RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. (a) Unless otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement or the Operating Partnership Agreement, whenever a
potential conflict of interest exists or arises between the General Partner or
any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Partnership, the Operating
Partnership, any Partner or any Assignee, on the other, any resolution or course
of action in respect of such conflict of interest shall be permitted and deemed
approved by all Partners, and shall not

47
<PAGE>

constitute a breach of this Agreement, of the Operating Partnership Agreement,
of any agreement contemplated herein or therein, or of any duty stated or
implied by law or equity, if the resolution or course of action is, or by
operation of this Agreement is deemed to be, fair and reasonable to the
Partnership. The General Partner shall be authorized but not required in
connection with its resolution of such conflict of interest to seek Special
Approval of a resolution of such conflict or course of action. Any conflict of
interest and any resolution of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively
deemed fair and reasonable to the Partnership if such conflict of interest or
resolution is (i) approved by Special Approval, (ii) on terms no less favorable
to the Partnership than those generally being provided to or available from
unrelated third parties or (iii) fair to the Partnership, taking into account
the totality of the relationships between the parties involved (including other
transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the
Partnership). The General Partner may also adopt a resolution or course of
action that has not received Special Approval. The General Partner (including
the Audit Committee in connection with Special Approval) shall be authorized in
connection with its determination of what is "fair and reasonable" to the
Partnership and in connection with its resolution of any conflict of interest to
consider (A) the relative interests of any party to such conflict, agreement,
transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interest;
(B) any customary or accepted industry practices and any customary or historical
dealings with a particular Person; (C) any applicable generally accepted
accounting practices or principles; and (D) such additional factors as the
General Partner (including such Audit Committee) determines in its sole
discretion to be relevant, reasonable or appropriate under the circumstances.
Nothing contained in this Agreement, however, is intended to nor shall it be
construed to require the General Partner (including such Audit Committee) to
consider the interests of any Person other than the Partnership. In the absence
of bad faith by the General Partner, the resolution, action or terms so made,
taken or provided by the General Partner with respect to such matter shall not
constitute a breach of this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein
or a breach of any standard of care or duty imposed herein or therein or under
the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or regulation.

(b) Whenever this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby
provides that the General Partner or any of its Affiliates is permitted or
required to make a decision (i) in its "sole discretion" or "discretion," that
it deems "necessary or appropriate" or under a grant of similar authority or
latitude, the General Partner or such Affiliate shall be entitled to consider
only such interests and factors as it desires and shall have no duty or
obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting,
the Partnership, the Operating Partnership, any Limited Partner or any Assignee,
(ii) it may make such decision in its sole discretion (regardless of whether
there is a reference to "sole discretion" or "discretion") unless another
express standard is provided for, or (iii) in "good faith" or under another
express standard, the General Partner or such Affiliate shall act under such
express standard and shall not be subject to any other or different standards
imposed by this Agreement, the Operating Partnership Agreement, any other
agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule
or regulation. In addition, any actions taken by the General Partner or such
Affiliate consistent with the standards of "reasonable discretion" set forth in
the definitions of Available Cash or Cash from Operations shall not constitute a
breach of any duty of the General Partner to the Partnership or the Limited
Partners. The General Partner shall have no duty, express or implied, to sell or
otherwise dispose of any asset of the Operating Partnership or of the
Partnership, other than in the ordinary course of business. No borrowing by the
Partnership or the Operating Partnership or the approval thereof by the General
Partner shall be deemed to constitute a breach of any duty of the General
Partner to the Partnership or the Limited Partners by reason of the fact that
the purpose or effect of such borrowing is directly or indirectly to (A) enable
Incentive Distributions or (B) hasten the expiration of the Subordination Period
or the conversion of any Subordinated Units into Common Units.

(c) Whenever a particular transaction, arrangement or resolution of a conflict
of interest is required under this Agreement to be "fair and reasonable" to any
Person, the fair and reasonable nature of such transaction, arrangement or
resolution shall be considered in the context of all similar or related
transactions.

48
<PAGE>

(d) The Limited Partners hereby authorize the General Partner, on behalf of
the Partnership as a partner of the Operating Partnership, to approve of actions
by the general partner of the Operating Partnership similar to those actions
permitted to be taken by the General Partner pursuant to this Section 6.9.

6.10 OTHER MATTERS CONCERNING THE GENERAL PARTNER. (a) The General Partner may
rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any
resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,
request, consent, order, bond, debenture, or other paper or document believed by
it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or
parties.

(b) The General Partner may consult with legal counsel, accountants,
appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers and other consultants and
advisers selected by it, and any act taken or omitted to be taken in reliance
upon the opinion (including, without limitation, an Opinion of Counsel) of such
Persons as to matters that such General Partner reasonably believes to be within
such Person's professional or expert competence shall be conclusively presumed
to have been done or omitted in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.

(c) The General Partner shall have the right, in respect of any of its powers
or obligations hereunder, to act through any of its duly authorized officers, a
duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-fact or the duly authorized officers of
the Partnership. Each such attorney shall, to the extent provided by the General
Partner in the power of attorney, have full power and authority to do and
perform each and every act and duty that is permitted or required to be done by
the General Partner hereunder.

(d) Any standard of care and duty imposed by this Agreement or under the
Delaware Act or any applicable law, rule or regulation shall be modified, waived
or limited as required to permit the General Partner to act under this Agreement
or any other agreement contemplated by this Agreement and to make any decision
pursuant to the authority prescribed in this Agreement so long as such action is
reasonably believed by the General Partner to be in, or not inconsistent with,
the best interests of the Partnership.

6.11 TITLE TO PARTNERSHIP ASSETS. Title to Partnership assets, whether real,
personal or mixed and whether tangible or intangible, shall be deemed to be
owned by the Partnership as an entity, and no Partner or Assignee, individually
or collectively, shall have any ownership interest in such Partnership assets or
any portion thereof. Title to any or all of the Partnership assets may be held
in the name of the Partnership, the General Partner, one or more of its
Affiliates or one or more nominees, as the General Partner may determine. The
General Partner hereby declares and warrants that any Partnership assets for
which record title is held in the name of the General Partner or one or more of
its Affiliates or one or more nominees shall be held by the General Partner or
such Affiliate or nominee for the use and benefit of the Partnership in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; provided, however, that the
General Partner shall use its reasonable efforts to cause record title to such
assets (other than those assets in respect of which the General Partner
determines that the expense and difficulty of conveyancing makes transfer of
record title to the Partnership impracticable) to be vested in the Partnership
as soon as reasonably practicable; provided that, prior to the withdrawal or
removal of the General Partner or as soon thereafter as practicable, the General
Partner shall use reasonable efforts to effect the transfer of record title to
the Partnership and, prior to any such transfer, will provide for the use of
such assets in a manner satisfactory to the Partnership. All Partnership assets
shall be recorded as the property of the Partnership in its books and records,
irrespective of the name in which record title to such Partnership assets is
held. The General Partner covenants and agrees that at the Closing Date, the
Partnership and the Operating Partnership shall have all licenses, permits,
certificates, franchises, or other governmental authorizations or permits
necessary for the ownership of their properties or for the conduct of their
businesses, except for such licenses, permits, certificates, franchises, or
other governmental authorizations or permits, failure to have obtained which
will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on
the Partnership or the Operating Partnership.

6.12 PURCHASE OR SALE OF UNITS. The General Partner may cause the Partnership
to purchase or otherwise acquire Units; provided that, except as permitted
pursuant to Section 11.6, the General Partner may not cause the Partnership to
purchase Subordinated Units during the Subordination Period. As long as Units
are held by the Partnership or the Operating Partnership, such Units shall not
be considered Outstanding for any purpose, except as otherwise provided herein.
The General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner may also purchase or
otherwise acquire and sell or otherwise dispose of Units for its own account,
subject to the provisions of Articles XI and XII.

6.13 REGISTRATION RIGHTS OF FERRELLGAS AND ITS AFFILIATES. (a) If (i)
Ferrellgas or any Affiliate of Ferrellgas (including, without limitation, for
purposes of this Section 6.13, any Person that is an Affiliate of Ferrellgas at
the date hereof notwithstanding that it may later cease to be an Affiliate of
Ferrellgas) holds Units or other Partnership Securities that it desires to sell
and (ii) Rule 144 of the Securities Act (or any successor rule or regulation to
Rule 144) or another exemption from registration is not available to enable such
holder of Units (the "HOLDER") to dispose of the number of Units or other
securities it desires to sell at the time it desires to do so without
registration under the Securities Act, then upon the request of Ferrellgas or
any of its Affiliates, the Partnership shall file with the Commission as
promptly as practicable after receiving such request, and use all reasonable
efforts to cause to become effective and remain effective for a period of not
more than six months following its effective date, a registration statement
under the Securities Act registering the offering and sale of the number of
Units or other securities specified by the Holder; provided, however, that the
Partnership shall not be required to effect more than three registrations
pursuant to this Section 6.13(a); and provided further, that if the General
Partner or, if at the time a request pursuant to this Section 6.13 is submitted
to the Partnership, Ferrellgas or its Affiliate requesting registration is an
Affiliate of the General Partner, the Audit Committee in connection with Special
Approval determines in its good faith judgment that a postponement of the
requested registration for up to six months would be in the best interests of
the Partnership and its Partners due to a pending transaction, investigation or
other event, the filing of such registration statement or the effectiveness
thereof may be deferred for up to six months, but not thereafter. In connection
with any registration pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the
Partnership shall promptly prepare and file (x) such documents as may be
necessary to register or qualify the securities subject to such registration
under the securities laws of such states as the Holder shall reasonably request;
provided, however, that no such qualification shall be required in any
jurisdiction where, as a result thereof, the Partnership would become subject to
general service of process or to taxation or qualification to do business as a
foreign corporation or partnership doing business in such jurisdiction, and (y)
such documents as may be necessary to apply for listing or to list the
securities subject to such registration on such National Securities Exchange as
the Holder shall reasonably request, and do any and all other acts and things
that may reasonably be necessary or advisable to enable the Holder to consummate
a public sale of such Units in such states. Except as set forth in Section
6.13(c), all costs and expenses of any such registration and offering (other
than the underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be paid by the
Partnership, without reimbursement by the Holder.

(b) If the Partnership shall at any time propose to file a registration
statement under the Securities Act for an offering of equity securities of the
Partnership for cash (other than an offering relating solely to an employee
benefit plan), the Partnership shall use all reasonable efforts to include such
number or amount of securities held by the Holder in such registration statement
as the Holder shall request. If the proposed offering pursuant to this Section
6.13(b) shall be an underwritten offering, then, in the event that the managing
underwriter of such offering advises the Partnership and the Holder in writing
that in its opinion the inclusion of all or some of the Holder's securities
would adversely and materially affect the success of the offering, the
Partnership shall include in such offering only that number or amount, if any,
of securities held by the Holder which, in the opinion of the managing
underwriter, will not so adversely and materially affect the offering. Except as
set forth in Section 6.13(c), all costs and expenses of any such registration
and offering (other than the underwriting discounts and commissions) shall be
paid by the Partnership, without reimbursement by the Holder.

50
<PAGE>

(c) If underwriters are engaged in connection with any registration referred
to in this Section 6.13, the Partnership shall provide indemnification,
representations, covenants, opinions and other assurance to the underwriters in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to such underwriters. Further, in
addition to and not in limitation of the Partnership's obligation under Section
6.7, the Partnership shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, indemnify
and hold harmless the Holder, its officers, directors and each Person who
controls the Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) and any agent
thereof (collectively, "INDEMNIFIED PERSONS") against any losses, claims,
demands, actions, causes of action, assessments, damages, liabilities (joint or
several), costs and expenses (including, without limitation, interest, penalties
and reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements), resulting to, imposed upon,
or incurred by the Indemnified Persons, directly or indirectly, under the
Securities Act or otherwise (hereinafter referred to in this Section 6.13(c) as
a "CLAIM" and in the plural as "CLAIMS"), based upon, arising out of, or
resulting from any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material
fact contained in any registration statement under which any Units were
registered under the Securities Act or any state securities or Blue Sky laws, in
any preliminary prospectus (if used prior to the effective date of such
registration statement), or in any summary or final prospectus or in any
amendment or supplement thereto (if used during the period the Partnership is
required to keep the registration statement current), or arising out of, based
upon or resulting from the omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
made therein not misleading; provided, however, that the Partnership shall not
be liable to any Indemnified Person to the extent that any such claim arises out
of, is based upon or results from an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement,
such preliminary, summary or final prospectus or such amendment or supplement,
in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Partnership by or on behalf of such Indemnified Person specifically for use in
the preparation thereof.

(d) The provisions of Sections 6.13(a) and 6.13(b) shall continue to be
applicable with respect to Ferrellgas (and any of Ferrellgas' Affiliates) after
it ceases to be a Partner of the Partnership, during a period of two years
subsequent to the effective date of such cessation and for so long thereafter as
is required for the Holder to sell all of the Units or other securities of the
Partnership with respect to which it has requested during such two year period
that a registration statement be filed; provided, however, that the Partnership
shall not be required to file successive registration statements covering the
same securities for which registration was demanded during such two-year period.
The provisions of Section 6.13(c) shall continue in effect thereafter.

(e) Any request to register Partnership Securities pursuant to this Section
6.13 shall (i) specify the Partnership Securities intended to be offered and
sold by the Person making the request, (ii) express such Person's present intent
to offer such shares for distribution, (iii) describe the nature or method of
the proposed offer and sale of Partnership Securities, and (iv) contain the
undertaking of such Person to provide all such information and materials and
take all action as may be required in order to permit the Partnership to comply
with all applicable requirements in connection with the registration of such
Partnership Securities.

6.14 RELIANCE BY THIRD PARTIES. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, any Person dealing with the Partnership shall be entitled to
assume that the General Partner and any officer of the Partnership authorized by
the General Partner to act on behalf and in the name of the Partnership has full
power and authority to encumber, sell or otherwise use in any manner any and all
assets of the Partnership and to enter into any contracts on behalf of the
Partnership, and such Person shall be entitled to deal with the General Partner
or any such officer as if it were the Partnership's sole party in interest, both
legally and beneficially. Each Limited Partner hereby waives any and all
defenses or other remedies that may be available against such Person to contest,
negate or disaffirm any action of the General Partner or any such officer in
connection with any such dealing. In no event shall any Person dealing with the
General Partner or any such officer or its representatives be obligated to
ascertain that the terms of this Agreement have been complied with or to inquire
into the necessity or expedience of any act or action of the General Partner or
any such officer. Each and every certificate, document or other instrument
executed on behalf of the Partnership by the General Partner or any such

51
<PAGE>

officer shall be conclusive evidence in favor of any and every Person relying
thereon or claiming thereunder that (a) at the time of the execution and
delivery of such certificate, document or instrument, this Agreement was in full
force and effect, (b) the Person executing and delivering such certificate,
document or instrument was duly authorized and empowered to do so for and on
behalf of the Partnership and (c) such certificate, document or instrument was
duly executed and delivered in accordance with the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and is binding upon the Partnership.

ARTICLE VII
RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF LIMITED PARTNERS

7.1 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. The Limited Partners, the Organizational Limited
Partner and the Assignees shall have no liability under this Agreement except as
expressly provided in this Agreement or the Delaware Act.

7.2 MANAGEMENT OF BUSINESS. No Limited Partner or Assignee (other than the
General Partner, any of its Affiliates or any officer, director, employee,
partner, agent or trustee of the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, in
its capacity as such, if such Person shall also be a Limited Partner or
Assignee) shall participate in the operation, management or control (within the
meaning of the Delaware Act) of the Partnership's business, transact any
business in the Partnership's name or have the power to sign documents for or
otherwise bind the Partnership. The transaction of any such business by the
General Partner, any of its Affiliates or any officer, director, employee,
partner, agent or trustee of the General Partner or any of its Affiliates, in
its capacity as such, shall not affect, impair or eliminate the limitations on
the liability of the Limited Partners or Assignees under this Agreement.

7.3 OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES. Subject to the provisions of Section 6.5, which shall
continue to be applicable to the Persons referred to therein, regardless of
whether such Persons shall also be Limited Partners or Assignees, any Limited
Partner or Assignee shall be entitled to and may have business interests and
engage in business activities in addition to those relating to the Partnership,
including, without limitation, business interests and activities in direct
competition with the Partnership or the Operating Partnership. Neither the
Partnership nor any of the other Partners or Assignees shall have any rights by
virtue of this Agreement in any business ventures of any Limited Partner or
Assignee.

7.4 RETURN OF CAPITAL. No Limited Partner or Assignee shall be entitled to the
withdrawal or return of its Capital Contribution, except to the extent, if any,
that distributions made pursuant to this Agreement or upon termination of the
Partnership may be considered as such by law and then only to the extent
provided for in this Agreement. Except to the extent provided by Article V or as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no Limited Partner or Assignee
shall have priority over any other Limited Partner or Assignee either as to the
return of Capital Contributions or as to profits, losses or distributions. Any
such return shall be a compromise to which all Partners and Assignees agree
within the meaning of (S) 17-502(b) of the Delaware Act.

7.5 RIGHTS OF LIMITED PARTNERS RELATING TO THE PARTNERSHIP. (a) In addition to
other rights provided by this Agreement or by applicable law, and except as
limited by Section 7.5(b), each Limited Partner shall have the right, for a

partner in the Partnership, upon reasonable demand and at such Limited Partner's
own expense:

(i) to obtain true and full information regarding the status of the
business and financial condition of the Partnership;

(ii) promptly after becoming available, to obtain a copy of the

Partnership as is just and reasonable.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the General Partner
may keep confidential from the Limited Partners and Assignees, for such period
of time as the General Partner deems reasonable, any information that the
General Partner reasonably believes to be in the nature of trade secrets or
other information the disclosure of which the General Partner in good faith
believes is not in the best interests of the Partnership or the Operating
Partnership or could damage the Partnership or the Operating Partnership or that
the Partnership or the Operating Partnership are required by law or by
agreements with third parties to keep confidential (other than agreements with
Affiliates the primary purpose of which is to circumvent the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.5).

ARTICLE VIII
BOOKS, RECORDS, ACCOUNTING AND REPORTS

8.1 RECORDS AND ACCOUNTING. The General Partner shall keep or cause to be kept
at the principal office of the Partnership appropriate books and records with
respect to the Partnership's business, including, without limitation, all books
and records necessary to provide to the Limited Partners any information, lists
and copies of documents required to be provided pursuant to Section 7.5(a). Any
books and records maintained by or on behalf of the Partnership in the regular
course of its business, including, without limitation, the record of the Record
Holders and Assignees of Units or other Partnership Securities, books of account
and records of Partnership proceedings, may be kept on, or be in the form of,
computer disks, hard drives, punch cards, magnetic tape, photographs,
micrographics or any other information storage device, provided, that the books
and records so maintained are convertible into clearly legible written form
within a reasonable period of time. The books of the Partnership shall be
maintained, for both tax and financial reporting purposes, on an accrual basis
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

8.2 FISCAL YEAR. The fiscal year of the Partnership shall be August 1 to July
31.

8.3 REPORTS. (a) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than 120 days
after the close of each fiscal year of the Partnership, the General Partner
shall cause to be mailed to each Record Holder of a Unit as of a date selected
by the General Partner in its sole discretion, an annual report containing
financial statements of the Partnership for such fiscal year of the Partnership,
presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, including
a balance sheet and statements of operations, Partners' equity and cash flows,
such statements to be audited by a firm of independent public accountants
selected by the General Partner.

(b) As soon as practicable, but in no event later than 90 days after the close
of each Quarter except the last Quarter of each year, the General Partner shall
cause to be mailed to each Record Holder of a Unit, as of a date selected by the
General Partner in its sole discretion, a report containing unaudited financial
statements of the Partnership and such other information as may be required by
applicable law, regulation or rule of any National Securities Exchange on which
the Units are listed for trading, or as the General Partner determines to be
necessary or appropriate.

53

ARTICLE IX
TAX MATTERS

9.1 PREPARATION OF TAX RETURNS. The General Partner shall arrange for the
preparation and timely filing of all returns of Partnership income, gains,
deductions, losses and other items required of the Partnership for federal and
state income tax purposes and shall use all reasonable efforts to furnish,
within 90 days of the close of each calendar year, the tax information
reasonably required by holders of Outstanding Units for federal and state income
tax reporting purposes. The classification, realization and recognition of
income, gain, losses and deductions and other items shall be on the accrual
method of accounting for federal income tax purposes. The taxable year of the
Partnership shall be August 1 to July 31.

9.2 TAX ELECTIONS. Except as otherwise provided herein, the General Partner
shall, in its sole discretion, determine whether to make any available election
pursuant to the Code; provided, however, that the General Partner shall make the
election under Section 754 of the Code in accordance with applicable regulations
thereunder. The General Partner shall have the right to seek to revoke any such
election (including, without limitation, the election under Section 754 of the
Code) upon the General Partner's determination in its sole discretion that such
revocation is in the best interests of the Limited Partners and Assignees. For
purposes of computing the adjustments under Section 743(b) of the Code, the
General Partner shall be authorized (but not required) to adopt a convention
whereby the price paid by a transferee of Units will be deemed to be the lowest
quoted closing price of the Units on any National Securities Exchange on which
such Units are traded during the calendar month in which such transfer is deemed
to occur pursuant to Section 5.2(g) without regard to the actual price paid by
such transferee.

9.3 TAX CONTROVERSIES. Subject to the provisions hereof, the General Partner
is designated the Tax Matters Partner (as defined in Section 6231 of the Code),
and is authorized and required to represent the Partnership (at the
Partnership's expense) in connection with all examinations of the Partnership's
affairs by tax authorities, including, without limitation, resulting
administrative and judicial proceedings, and to expend Partnership funds for
professional services and costs associated therewith. Each Partner and Assignee
agrees to cooperate with the General Partner and to do or refrain from doing any
or all things reasonably required by the General Partner to conduct such
proceedings.

9.4 ORGANIZATIONAL EXPENSES. The Partnership shall elect to deduct expenses,
if any, incurred by it in organizing the Partnership ratably over a 60-month
period as provided in Section 709 of the Code.

9.5 WITHHOLDING. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
General Partner is authorized to take any action that it determines in its sole
discretion to be necessary or appropriate to cause the Partnership and the
Operating Partnership to comply with any withholding requirements established
under the Code or any other federal, state or local law including, without
limitation, pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445 and 1446 of the Code. To the
extent that the Partnership is required to withhold and pay over to any taxing
authority any amount resulting from the allocation or distribution of income to
any Partner or Assignee (including, without limitation, by reason of Section
1446 of the Code), the amount withheld shall be treated as a distribution of
cash pursuant to Section 5.3 in the amount of such withholding from such
Partner.

9.6 ENTITY-LEVEL Taxation. If legislation is enacted or the interpretation of
existing language is modified which causes the Partnership or the Operating
Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or
otherwise subjects the Partnership or the Operating Partnership to entity-level
taxation for federal income tax purposes, the Minimum Quarterly Distribution,
First Target Distribution, Second Target Distribution or Third Target
Distribution, as the case may be, shall be equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (a) the amount thereof by (b) 1 minus the sum of (i) the highest
marginal federal corporate (or other entity, as applicable) income tax rate of
the Partnership for the taxable year of the Partnership in which such Quarter
occurs (expressed as a percentage) plus (ii) the effective overall state and
local income tax rate (expressed as a percentage) applicable to the

54
<PAGE>

Partnership for the calendar year next preceding the calendar year in which such
Quarter occurs (after taking into account the benefit of any deduction allowable
for federal income tax purposes with respect to the payment of state and local
income taxes), but only to the extent of the increase in such rates resulting
from such legislation or interpretation. Such effective overall state and local
income tax rate shall be determined for the taxable year next preceding the
first taxable year during which the Partnership or the Operating Partnership is
taxable for federal income tax purposes as an association taxable as a
corporation or is otherwise subject to entity-level taxation by determining such
rate as if the Partnership or the Operating Partnership had been subject to such
state and local taxes during such preceding taxable year.

9.7 ENTITY-LEVEL ARREARAGE COLLECTIONS. If the Partnership is required by
applicable law to pay any federal, state or local income tax on behalf of, or
withhold such amount with respect to, any Partner or Assignee or any former
Partner or Assignee (a) the General Partner shall cause the Partnership to pay
such tax on behalf of such Partner or Assignee or former Partner or Assignee
from the funds of the Partnership; (b) any amount so paid on behalf of, or
withheld with respect to, any Partner or Assignee shall constitute a
distribution out of Available Cash to such Partner or Assignee pursuant to
Section 5.3; provided, however, in the discretion of the General Partner, such
taxes (if pertaining to all Partners) may be considered to be cash disbursements
of the Partnership which reduce Available Cash, but the payment or withholding
thereof shall not be deemed to be a distribution of Available Cash to such
Partners; and (c) to the extent any such Partner or Assignee (but not a former
Partner or Assignee) is not then entitled to such distribution under this
Agreement, the General Partner shall be authorized, without the approval of any
Partner or Assignee, to amend this Agreement insofar as is necessary to maintain
the uniformity of intrinsic tax characteristics as to all Units and to make
subsequent adjustments to distributions in a manner which, in the reasonable
judgment of the General Partner, will make as little alteration as practicable
in the priority and amount of distributions otherwise applicable under this
Agreement, and will not otherwise alter the distributions to which Partners and
Assignees are entitled under this Agreement. If the Partnership is permitted
(but not required) by applicable law to pay any such tax on behalf of, or
withhold such amount with respect to, any Partner or Assignee or former Partner
or Assignee, the General Partner shall be authorized (but not required) to cause
the Partnership to pay such tax from the funds of the Partnership and to take
any action consistent with this Section 9.7. The General Partner shall be
authorized (but not required) to take all necessary or appropriate actions to
collect all or any portion of a deficiency in the payment of any such tax that
relates to prior periods and that is attributable to Persons who were Limited
Partners or Assignees when such deficiencies arose, from such Persons.

9.8 OPINIONS OF COUNSEL. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, if the Partnership or the Operating Partnership is treated as an
association taxable as a corporation at any time or is otherwise taxable for
federal income tax purposes as an entity at any time and, pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement, an Opinion of Counsel would otherwise be required
to the effect that an action will not cause the Partnership or the Operating
Partnership to become so treated as an association taxable as a corporation or
otherwise taxable as an entity for federal income tax purposes, such requirement
for an Opinion of Counsel shall be deemed automatically waived.

ARTICLE X
CERTIFICATES

10.1 CERTIFICATES. Upon the Partnership's issuance of Common Units or
Subordinated Units to any Person, the Partnership shall issue one or more
Certificates in the name of such Person evidencing the number of such Units
being so issued. Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Partnership by
the General Partner. No Common Unit Certificate shall be valid for any purpose
until it has been countersigned by the Transfer Agent. The Partners holding
Certificates evidencing Subordinated Units may exchange such Certificates for
Certificates evidencing Common Units on or after the date on which such
Subordinated Units are converted into Common Units pursuant to the terms of
Section 5.7(c).

55
<PAGE>

10.2 REGISTRATION, REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER AND EXCHANGE. (a) The General
Partner shall cause to be kept on behalf of the Partnership a register in which,
subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe and subject to the
provisions of Section 10.2(b), the General Partner will provide for the
registration and transfer of Units. The Transfer Agent is hereby appointed
registrar and transfer agent for the purpose of registering Units and transfers
of such Units as herein provided. The Partnership shall not recognize transfers
of Certificates representing Units unless same are effected in the manner
described in this Section 10.2. Upon surrender for registration of transfer of
any Units evidenced by a Certificate, and subject to the provisions of Section
10.2(b), the General Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall execute, and the
Transfer Agent shall countersign and deliver, in the name of the holder or the
designated transferee or transferees, as required pursuant to the holder's
instructions, one or more new Certificates evidencing the same aggregate number
of Units as was evidenced by the Certificate so surrendered.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 11.5, the Partnership shall not
recognize any transfer of Units until the Certificates evidencing such Units are
surrendered for registration of transfer and such Certificates are accompanied
by a Transfer Application duly executed by the transferee (or the transferee's
attorney-in-fact duly authorized in writing). No charge shall be imposed by the
Partnership for such transfer, provided, that as a condition to the issuance of
any new Certificate under this Section 10.2, the General Partner may require the
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that
may be imposed with respect thereto.

10.3 MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST OR STOLEN CERTIFICATES. (a) If any mutilated
Certificate is surrendered to the Transfer Agent, the General Partner on behalf
of the Partnership shall execute, and upon its request the Transfer Agent shall
countersign and deliver in exchange therefor, a new Certificate evidencing the
same number of Units as the Certificate so surrendered.

(b) The General Partner on behalf of the Partnership shall execute, and upon
its request the Transfer Agent shall countersign and deliver a new Certificate
in place of any Certificate previously issued if the Record Holder of the
Certificate:

(i) makes proof by affidavit, in form and substance satisfactory to the
General Partner, that a previously issued Certificate has been lost, destroyed
or stolen;

(ii) requests the issuance of a new Certificate before the Partnership has
notice that the Certificate has been acquired by a purchaser for value in good
faith and without notice of an adverse claim;

(iii) if requested by the General Partner, delivers to the Partnership a
bond, in form and substance satisfactory to the General Partner, with surety
or sureties and with fixed or open penalty as the General Partner may
reasonably direct, in its sole discretion, to indemnify the Partnership, the
General Partner and the Transfer Agent against any claim that may be made on
account of the alleged loss, destruction or theft of the Certificate; and

(iv) satisfies any other reasonable requirements imposed by the General
Partner.

If a Limited Partner or Assignee fails to notify the Partnership within a
reasonable time after he has notice of the loss, destruction or theft of a
Certificate, and a transfer of the Units represented by the Certificate is
registered before the Partnership, the General Partner or the Transfer Agent
receives such notification, the Limited Partner or Assignee shall be precluded
from making any claim against the Partnership, the General Partner or the
Transfer Agent for such transfer or for a new Certificate.

(c) As a condition to the issuance of any new Certificate under this Section
10.3, the General Partner may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and
any other expenses (including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of the
Transfer Agent) reasonably connected therewith.

56
<PAGE>

10.4 RECORD HOLDER. In accordance with Section 10.2(b), the Partnership shall
be entitled to recognize the Record Holder as the Limited Partner or Assignee
with respect to any Units and, accordingly, shall not be bound to recognize any
equitable or other claim to or interest in such Units on the part of any other
Person, whether or not the Partnership shall have actual or other notice
thereof, except as otherwise provided by law or any applicable rule, regulation,
guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on which the Units
are listed for trading. Without limiting the foregoing, when a Person (such as a
broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing corporation or an agent of any
of the foregoing) is acting as nominee, agent or in some other representative
capacity for another Person in acquiring and/or holding Units, as between the
Partnership on the one hand, and such other Persons, on the other, such
representative Person (a) shall be the Limited Partner or Assignee (as the case
may be) of record and beneficially, (b) must execute and deliver a Transfer
Application and (c) shall be bound by this Agreement and shall have the rights
and obligations of a Limited Partner or Assignee (as the case may be) hereunder
and as provided for herein.

ARTICLE XI
TRANSFER OF INTERESTS

11.1 TRANSFER. (a) The term "TRANSFER," when used in this Article XI with
respect to a Partnership Interest, shall be deemed to refer to a transaction by
which the General Partner assigns its Partnership Interest as a general partner
in the Partnership to another Person, by which the holder of a Unit assigns such
Unit to another Person who is or becomes an Assignee or by which a Special
Limited Partner holding an IDR assigns such IDR to another Person, and includes
a sale, assignment, gift, pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation, mortgage, exchange
or any other disposition by law or otherwise.

(b) No Partnership Interest shall be transferred, in whole or in part, except
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Article XI. Any
transfer or purported transfer of a Partnership Interest not made in accordance
with this Article XI shall be null and void.

(c) Nothing contained in this Article XI shall be construed to prevent a
disposition by the parent entity of the General Partner of any or all of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of the General Partner.

(d) Nothing contained in this Article XI, or elsewhere in this Partnership
Agreement, shall preclude the settlement of any transactions involving Common
Units entered into through the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange.

11.2 TRANSFER OF A GENERAL PARTNER'S PARTNERSHIP INTEREST. Except for a
transfer by the General Partner of all, but not less than all, of its
Partnership Interest as a general partner in the Partnership to (a) an Affiliate
of the General Partner or (b) another Person in connection with the merger or
consolidation of the General Partner with or into another Person or the transfer
by the General Partner of all or substantially all of its assets to another
Person, the transfer by the General Partner of all or any part of its
Partnership Interest as a general partner in the Partnership to a Person prior
to July 31, 2004 shall be subject to the prior approval of at least a majority
of the Outstanding Units (excluding for purposes of such determination Units
owned by the General Partner and its Affiliates). Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, no transfer by the General Partner of all or any part of
its Partnership Interest as a general partner in the Partnership to another
Person shall be permitted unless (i) the transferee agrees to assume the rights
and duties of the General Partner under this Agreement and the Operating
Partnership Agreement and to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement and
the Operating Partnership Agreement, (ii) the Partnership receives an Opinion of
Counsel that such transfer would not result in the loss of limited liability of
any Limited Partner or of any limited partner of the Operating Partnership or
cause the Partnership or any of the Operating Partnership to be treated as an
association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity for
federal income tax purposes and (iii) such transferee also agrees to purchase
all (or the appropriate portion thereof, if applicable) of the partnership
interest of the General Partner as the general partner of the Operating

57
<PAGE>

Partnership. In the case of a transfer pursuant to and in compliance with this
Section 11.2, the transferee or successor (as the case may be) shall, subject to
compliance with the terms of Section 12.3, be admitted to the Partnership as a
General Partner immediately prior to the transfer of the Partnership Interest,
and the business of the Partnership shall continue without dissolution.

11.3 TRANSFER OF UNITS. (a) Units may be transferred only in the manner
described in Section 10.2. The transfer of any Units and the admission of any
new Partner shall not constitute an amendment to this Agreement.

(b) Until admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner pursuant to Article XII,
the Record Holder of a Unit shall be an Assignee in respect of such Unit.
Limited Partners may include custodians, nominees, or any other individual or
entity in its own or any representative capacity.

(c) Each distribution in respect of Units shall be paid by the Partnership,
directly or through the Transfer Agent or through any other Person or agent,
only to the Record Holders thereof as of the Record Date set for the
distribution. Such payment shall constitute full payment and satisfaction of the
Partnership's liability in respect of such payment, regardless of any claim of
any Person who may have an interest in such payment by reason of an assignment
or otherwise.

(d) A transferee who has completed and delivered a Transfer Application shall
be deemed to have (i) requested admission as a Substituted Limited Partner, (ii)
agreed to comply with and be bound by and to have executed this Agreement, (iii)
represented and warranted that such transferee has the right, power and
authority and, if an individual, the capacity to enter into this Agreement, (iv)
granted the powers of attorney set forth in this Agreement and (v) given the
consents and approvals and made the waivers contained in this Agreement.

11.4 RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFERS. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this
Article XI, no transfer of any Unit or interest therein of any Limited Partner,
Special Limited Partner or Assignee shall be made if such transfer would (a)
violate the then applicable federal or state securities laws or rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, any state securities
commission or any other governmental authorities with jurisdiction over such
transfer, (b) result in the taxation of the Partnership or the Operating
Partnership as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise subject the
Partnership or the Operating Partnership to entity-level taxation for federal
income tax purposes or (c) affect the Partnership's or the Operating
Partnership's existence or qualification as a limited partnership under the
Delaware Act.

11.5 CITIZENSHIP CERTIFICATES; NON-CITIZEN ASSIGNEES. (a) If the Partnership
or the Operating Partnership is or becomes subject to any federal, state or
local law or regulation that, in the reasonable determination of the General
Partner, creates a substantial risk of cancellation or forfeiture of any
property in which the Partnership or the Operating Partnership has an interest
based on the nationality, citizenship or other related status of a Limited
Partner or Assignee, the General Partner may request any Limited Partner or
Assignee to furnish to the General Partner, within 30 days after receipt of such
request, an executed Citizenship Certification or such other information
concerning his nationality, citizenship or other related status (or, if the
Limited Partner or Assignee is a nominee holding for the account of another
Person, the nationality, citizenship or other related status of such Person) as
the General Partner may request. If a Limited Partner or Assignee fails to
furnish to the General Partner within the aforementioned 30-day period such
Citizenship Certification or other requested information or if upon receipt of
such Citizenship Certification or other requested information the General
Partner determines, with the advice of counsel, that a Limited Partner or
Assignee is not an Eligible Citizen, the Units owned by such Limited Partner or
Assignee shall be subject to redemption in accordance with the provisions of
Section 11.6. In addition, the General Partner may require that the status of
any such Limited Partner or Assignee be changed to that of a Non-citizen
Assignee, and, thereupon, the General Partner shall be substituted for such Non-
citizen Assignee as the Limited Partner in respect of his Units.

58
<PAGE>

(b) The General Partner shall, in exercising voting rights in respect of Units
held by it on behalf of Non-citizen Assignees, distribute the votes in the same
ratios as the votes of Limited Partners in respect of Units other than those of
Non-citizen Assignees are cast, either for, against or abstaining as to the
matter.

(c) Upon dissolution of the Partnership, a Non-citizen Assignee shall have no
right to receive a distribution in kind pursuant to Section 14.4 but shall be
entitled to the cash equivalent thereof, and the General Partner shall provide
cash in exchange for an assignment of the Non-citizen Assignee's share of the
distribution in kind. Such payment and assignment shall be treated for
Partnership purposes as a purchase by the General Partner from the Non-citizen
Assignee of his Partnership Interest (representing his right to receive his
share of such distribution in kind).

(d) At any time after he can and does certify that he has become an Eligible
Citizen, a Non-citizen Assignee may, upon application to the General Partner,
request admission as a Substituted Limited Partner with respect to any Units of
such Non-citizen Assignee not redeemed pursuant to Section 11.6, and upon his
admission pursuant to Section 12.2 the General Partner shall cease to be deemed
to be the Limited Partner in respect of the Non-citizen Assignee's Units.

11.6 REDEMPTION OF INTERESTS. (a) If at any time a Limited Partner or Assignee
fails to furnish a Citizenship Certification or other information requested
within the 30-day period specified in Section 11.5(a), or if upon receipt of
such Citizenship Certification or other information the General Partner
determines, with the advice of counsel, that a Limited Partner or Assignee is
not an Eligible Citizen, the Partnership may, unless the Limited Partner or
Assignee establishes to the satisfaction of the General Partner that such
Limited Partner or Assignee is an Eligible Citizen or has transferred his Units
to a Person who furnishes a Citizenship Certification to the General Partner
prior to the date fixed for redemption as provided below, redeem the Partnership
Interest of such Limited Partner or Assignee as follows:

(i) The General Partner shall, not later than the 30th day before the date
fixed for redemption, give notice of redemption to the Limited Partner or
Assignee, at his last address designated on the records of the Partnership or
the Transfer Agent, by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid. The
notice shall be deemed to have been given when so mailed. The notice shall
specify the Redeemable Units, the date fixed for redemption, the place of
payment, that payment of the redemption price will be made upon surrender of
the Certificate evidencing the Redeemable Units and that on and after the date
fixed for redemption no further allocations or distributions to which the
Limited Partner or Assignee would otherwise be entitled in respect of the
Redeemable Units will accrue or be made.

(ii) The aggregate redemption price for Redeemable Units shall be an amount
equal to the Current Market Price (the date of determination of which shall be
the date fixed for redemption) of Units of the class to be so redeemed
multiplied by the number of Units of each such class included among the
Redeemable Units. The redemption price shall be paid, in the sole discretion
of the General Partner, in cash or by delivery of a promissory note of the
Partnership in the principal amount of the redemption price, bearing interest
at the rate of 10% annually and payable in three equal annual installments of
principal together with accrued interest, commencing one year after the
redemption date.

(iii) Upon surrender by or on behalf of the Limited Partner or Assignee, at
the place specified in the notice of redemption, of the Certificate evidencing
the Redeemable Units, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by an assignment
duly executed in blank, the Limited Partner or Assignee or his duly authorized
representative shall be entitled to receive the payment therefor.

(iv) After the redemption date, Redeemable Units shall no longer constitute
issued and Outstanding Units.

<PAGE>

(b) The provisions of this Section 11.6 shall also be applicable to Units held
by a Limited Partner or Assignee as nominee of a Person determined to be other
than an Eligible Citizen.

(c) Nothing in this Section 11.6 shall prevent the recipient of a notice of
redemption from transferring his Units before the redemption date if such
transfer is otherwise permitted under this Agreement. Upon receipt of notice of
such a transfer, the General Partner shall withdraw the notice of redemption,
provided, the transferee of such Units certifies in the Transfer Application
that he is an Eligible Citizen. If the transferee fails to make such
certification, such redemption shall be effected from the transferee on the
original redemption date.

11.7 TRANSFER OF IDRS. A Special Limited Partner holding IDRs may transfer any
or all of the IDRs held by such Special Limited Partner. The General Partner
shall have the authority (but shall not be required) to adopt such reasonable
restrictions on the transfer of IDRs, consistent with the restrictions on
transfer of Units provided for in this Agreement, and requirements for
registering the transfer of IDRs as the General Partner, in its sole discretion,
shall determine are necessary or appropriate including, without limitation, if
the General Partner shall so determine, in its sole discretion, the right of the
Partnership to redeem IDRs upon terms and conditions similar to those applicable
to Units.

ARTICLE XII
ADMISSION OF PARTNERS

12.1 ADMISSION OF INITIAL LIMITED PARTNERS. Upon the issuance by the
Partnership of Common Units, Subordinated Units and IDRs to the General Partner
as described in Section 4.2, the General Partner shall be deemed to have been
admitted to the Partnership as a Limited Partner in respect of the Common Units
and Subordinated Units issued to it and as a Special Limited Partner in respect
of the IDRs issued to it. Upon the issuance by the Partnership of Common Units
to the Underwriters as described in Section 4.2 in connection with the Initial
Offering and the execution by each Underwriter of a Transfer Application, the
General Partner shall admit the Underwriters to the Partnership as Initial
Limited Partners in respect of the Common Units purchased by them.

12.2 ADMISSION OF SUBSTITUTED LIMITED PARTNERS. By transfer of a Unit in
accordance with Article XI, the transferor shall be deemed to have given the
transferee the right to seek admission as a Substituted Limited Partner subject
to the conditions of, and in the manner permitted under, this Agreement. A
transferor of a Certificate shall, however, only have the authority to convey to
a purchaser or other transferee who does not execute and deliver a Transfer
Application (a) the right to negotiate such Certificate to a purchaser or other
transferee and (b) the right to transfer the right to request admission as a
Substituted Limited Partner to such purchaser or other transferee in respect of
the transferred Units. Each transferee of a Unit (including, without limitation,
any nominee holder or an agent acquiring such Unit for the account of another
Person) who executes and delivers a Transfer Application shall, by virtue of
such execution and delivery, be an Assignee and be deemed to have applied to
become a Substituted Limited Partner with respect to the Units so transferred to
such Person. Such Assignee shall become a Substituted Limited Partner (x) at
such time as the General Partner consents thereto, which consent may be given or
withheld in the General Partner's sole discretion, and (y) when any such
admission is shown on the books and records of the Partnership. If such consent
is withheld, such transferee shall be an Assignee. An Assignee shall have an
interest in the Partnership equivalent to that of a Limited Partner with respect
to allocations and distributions, including, without limitation, liquidating
distributions, of the Partnership. With respect to voting rights attributable to
Units that are held by Assignees, the General Partner shall be deemed to be the
Limited Partner with respect thereto and shall, in exercising the voting rights
in respect of such Units on any matter, vote such Units at the written direction
of the Assignee who is the Record Holder of such Units. If no such written
direction is received, such Units will not be voted. An Assignee shall have no
other rights of a Limited Partner.

12.3 ADMISSION OF SUCCESSOR GENERAL PARTNER. A successor General Partner
approved pursuant to Section 13.1 or 13.2 or the transferee of or successor to
all of the General Partner's Partnership

60
<PAGE>

Interest as a general partner in the Partnership pursuant to Section 11.2 who is
proposed to be admitted as a successor General Partner shall be admitted to the
Partnership as the General Partner, effective immediately prior to the
withdrawal or removal of the General Partner pursuant to Section 13.1 or 13.2 or
the transfer of the General Partner's Partnership Interest as a general partner
in the Partnership pursuant to Section 11.2; provided, however, that no such
successor shall be admitted to the Partnership until compliance with the terms
of Section 11.2 has occurred and such successor has executed and delivered such
other documents or instruments as may be required to effect such admission. Any
such successor shall, subject to the terms hereof, carry on the business of the
Partnership and Operating Partnership without dissolution.

12.4 ADMISSION OF ADDITIONAL LIMITED PARTNERS. (a) A Person (other than the
General Partner, an Initial Limited Partner or a Substituted Limited Partner)
who makes a Capital Contribution to the Partnership in accordance with this
Agreement shall be admitted to the Partnership as an Additional Limited Partner
only upon furnishing to the General Partner (i) evidence of acceptance in form
satisfactory to the General Partner of all of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the power of attorney granted in
Section 1.4, and (ii) such other documents or instruments as may be required in
the discretion of the General Partner to effect such Person's admission as an
Additional Limited Partner.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 12.4, no Person
shall be admitted as an Additional Limited Partner without the consent of the
General Partner, which consent may be given or withheld in the General Partner's
sole discretion. The admission of any Person as an Additional Limited Partner
shall become effective on the date upon which the name of such Person is
recorded as such in the books and records of the Partnership, following the
consent of the General Partner to such admission.

12.5 AMENDMENT OF AGREEMENT AND CERTIFICATE OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP. To effect
the admission to the Partnership of any Partner, the General Partner shall take
all steps necessary and appropriate under the Delaware Act to amend the records
of the Partnership to reflect such admission and, if necessary, to prepare as
soon as practical an amendment of this Agreement and, if required by law, to
prepare and file an amendment to the Certificate of Limited Partnership and may
for this purpose, among others, exercise the power of attorney granted pursuant
to Section 1.4.

ARTICLE XIII
WITHDRAWAL OR REMOVAL OF PARTNERS

13.1 WITHDRAWAL OF THE GENERAL PARTNER. (a) The General Partner shall be
deemed to have withdrawn from the Partnership upon the occurrence of any one of
the following events (each such event herein referred to as an "EVENT OF
WITHDRAWAL");

(i) the General Partner voluntarily withdraws from the Partnership by
giving written notice to the other Partners (and it shall be deemed that the
General Partner has withdrawn pursuant to this Section 13.1(a)(i) if the
General Partner voluntarily withdraws as general partner of the Operating
Partnership);

(ii) the General Partner transfers all of its rights as General Partner
pursuant to Section 11.2;

(iii) the General Partner is removed pursuant to Section 13.2;

(iv) the General Partner (A) makes a general assignment for the benefit of
creditors; (B) files a voluntary bankruptcy petition; (C) files a petition or
answer seeking for itself a reorganization, arrangement, composition,
readjustment, liquidation, dissolution or similar relief under any law; (D)
files an answer or other pleading admitting or failing to contest the material
allegations of a petition filed against the General Partner in a proceeding of
the type described in clauses (A)-(C) of this

61
<PAGE>

Section 13.1(a)(iv); or (E) seeks, consents to or acquiesces in the
appointment of a trustee, receiver or liquidator of the General Partner or of
all or any substantial part of its properties;

(v) a final and non-appealable judgment is entered by a court with
appropriate jurisdiction ruling that the General Partner is bankrupt or
insolvent, or a final and non-appealable order for relief is entered by a
court with appropriate jurisdiction against the General Partner, in each case
under any federal or state bankruptcy or insolvency laws as now or hereafter
in effect; or

(vi) a certificate of dissolution or its equivalent is filed for the
General Partner, or 90 days expire after the date of notice to the General
Partner of revocation of its charter without a reinstatement of its charter,
under the laws of its state of incorporation.

If an Event of Withdrawal specified in Section 13.1(a)(iv), (v) or (vi) occurs,
the withdrawing General Partner shall give notice to the Limited Partners within
30 days after such occurrence. The Partners hereby agree that only the Events of
Withdrawal described in this Section 13.1 shall result in the withdrawal of the
General Partner from the Partnership.

(b) Withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership upon the occurrence
of an Event of Withdrawal shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement under
the following circumstances: (i) at any time during the period beginning on the
Closing Date and ending at 12:00 midnight, Central Standard Time, on July 31,
2004, the General Partner voluntarily withdraws by giving at least 90 days'
advance notice of its intention to withdraw to the Limited Partners, provided,
that prior to the effective date of such withdrawal the withdrawal is approved
by Limited Partners holding at least two-thirds of the Outstanding Units
(excluding for purposes of such determination Units owned by the General Partner
and its Affiliates) and the General Partner delivers to the Partnership an
Opinion of Counsel ("WITHDRAWAL OPINION OF COUNSEL") that such withdrawal
(following the selection of the successor General Partner) would not result in
the loss of the limited liability of any Limited Partner or of the limited
partner of the Operating Partnership or cause the Partnership or the Operating
Partnership to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or
otherwise to be taxed as an entity for federal income tax purposes; (ii) at any
time after 12:00 midnight, Central Standard Time, on July 31, 2004, the General
Partner voluntarily withdraws by giving at least 90 days' advance notice to the
Limited Partners, such withdrawal to take effect on the date specified in such
notice; (iii) at any time that the General Partner ceases to be a General
Partner pursuant to Section 13.1(a)(ii) or is removed pursuant to Section 13.2;
or (iv) notwithstanding clause (i) of this sentence, at any time that the
General Partner voluntarily withdraws by giving at least 90 days' advance notice
of its intention to withdraw to the Limited Partners, such withdrawal to take
effect on the date specified in the notice, if at the time such notice is given
one Person and its Affiliates (other than the General Partner and its
Affiliates) own beneficially or of record or control at least 50% of the
Outstanding Units. The withdrawal of the General Partner from the Partnership
upon the occurrence of an Event of Withdrawal shall also constitute the
withdrawal of the General Partner as general partner of the Operating
Partnership. If the General Partner gives a notice of withdrawal pursuant to
Section 13.1(a)(i), holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Units
(excluding for purposes of such determination Units owned by the General Partner
and its Affiliates) may, prior to the effective date of such withdrawal, elect a
successor General Partner. If, prior to the effective date of the General
Partner's withdrawal, a successor is selected by the Limited Partners as
provided herein, the Partnership, as the limited partner of the Operating
Partnership, shall cause such Person to become the successor general partner of
the Operating Partnership, as provided in the Operating Partnership Agreement.
If, prior to the effective date of the General Partner's withdrawal, a successor
is not selected by the Limited Partners as provided herein or the Partnership
does not receive a Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel, the Partnership shall be
dissolved in accordance with Section 14.1. Any successor General Partner elected
in accordance with the terms of this Section 13.1 shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 12.3.

13.2 REMOVAL OF THE GENERAL PARTNER. The General Partner may be removed if
such removal is approved by Limited Partners holding at least two-thirds of the
Outstanding Units. Any such action by such Limited Partners for removal of the
General Partner must also provide for the election of a

62
<PAGE>

successor General Partner by Limited Partners holding at least a majority of the
Outstanding Units. Such removal shall be effective immediately following the
admission of a successor General Partner pursuant to Article XII. The removal of
the General Partner shall also automatically constitute the removal of the
General Partner as general partner of the Operating Partnership, as provided in
the Operating Partnership Agreement. If a Person is elected as a successor
General Partner in accordance with the terms of this Section 13.2, the
Partnership, as the limited partner of the Operating Partnership, shall cause
such Person to become the successor general partner of the Operating
Partnership, as provided in the Operating Partnership Agreement. The right of
the Limited Partners holding Outstanding Units to remove the General Partner
shall not exist or be exercised unless the Partnership has received an opinion
opining as to the matters covered by a Withdrawal Opinion of Counsel. Any
successor General Partner elected in accordance with the terms of this Section
13.2 shall be subject to the provisions of Section 12.3.

13.3 INTEREST OF DEPARTING PARTNER AND SUCCESSOR GENERAL PARTNER. (a) In the
event of (i) withdrawal of the General Partner under circumstances where such
withdrawal does not violate this Agreement or (ii) removal of the General
Partner by the Limited Partners under circumstances where Cause does not exist,
if a successor General Partner is elected in accordance with the terms of
Section 13.1 or 13.2, the Departing Partner shall have the option exercisable
prior to the effective date of the departure of such Departing Partner to
require its successor to purchase its Partnership Interest as a general partner
in the Partnership and its partnership interest as the general partner in the
Operating Partnership (collectively, the "COMBINED INTEREST") in exchange for an
amount in cash equal to the fair market value of such Combined Interest, such
amount to be determined and payable as of the effective date of its departure.
If the General Partner is removed by the Limited Partners under circumstances
where Cause exists or if the General Partner withdraws under circumstances where
such withdrawal violates this Agreement or the Operating Partnership Agreement,
and if a successor General Partner is elected in accordance with the terms of
Section 13.1 or 13.2, such successor shall have the option, exercisable prior to
the effective date of the departure of such Departing Partner, to purchase the
Combined Interest of the Departing Partner for such fair market value of such
Combined Interest. In either event, the Departing Partner shall be entitled to
receive all reimbursements due such Departing Partner pursuant to Section 6.4,
including, without limitation, any employee-related liabilities (including,
without limitation, severance liabilities), incurred in connection with the
termination of any employees employed by the General Partner for the benefit of
the Partnership or the Operating Partnership. Subject to Section 13.3(b), the
Departing Partner shall, as of the effective date of its departure, cease to
share in any allocations or distributions with respect to its Partnership
Interest as a general partner in the Partnership and Partnership income, gain,
loss, deduction and credit will be prorated and allocated as set forth in
Section 5.2(g).

For purposes of this Section 13.3(a), the fair market value of the Departing
Partner's Combined Interest shall be determined by agreement between the
Departing Partner and its successor or, failing agreement within 30 days after
the effective date of such Departing Partner's departure, by an independent
investment banking firm or other independent expert selected by the Departing
Partner and its successor, which, in turn, may rely on other experts and the
determination of which shall be conclusive as to such matter. If such parties
cannot agree upon one independent investment banking firm or other independent
expert within 45 days after the effective date of such departure, then the
Departing Partner shall designate an independent investment banking firm or
other independent expert, the Departing Partner's successor shall designate an
independent investment banking firm or other independent expert, and such firms
or experts shall mutually select a third independent investment banking firm or
independent expert, which shall determine the fair market value of the Combined
Interest. In making its determination, such independent investment banking firm
or other independent expert shall consider the then current trading price of
Units on any National Securities Exchange on which Units are then listed, the
value of the Partnership's assets, the rights and obligations of the General
Partner and other factors it may deem relevant.

(b) If the Combined Interest is not purchased in the manner set forth in
Section 13.3(a), the Departing Partner shall become a Limited Partner and the
Combined Interest shall be converted into

63
<PAGE>

Common Units pursuant to a valuation made by an investment banking firm or other
independent expert selected pursuant to Section 13.3(a), without reduction in
such Partnership Interest (but subject to proportionate dilution by reason of
the admission of its successor). Any successor General Partner shall indemnify
the Departing Partner as to all debts and liabilities of the Partnership arising
on or after the date on which the Departing Partner becomes a Limited Partner.
For purposes of this Agreement, conversion of the General Partner's Combined
Interest to Common Units will be characterized as if the General Partner
contributed its Combined Interest to the Partnership in exchange for the newly
issued Common Units.

(c) If a successor General Partner is elected in accordance with the terms of
Section 13.1 or 13.2 and the option described in Section 13.3(a) is not
exercised by the party entitled to do so, the successor General Partner shall,
at the effective date of its admission to the Partnership, contribute to the
capital of the Partnership cash in an amount such that its Capital Account,
after giving effect to such contribution and any adjustments made to the Capital
Accounts of all Partners pursuant to Section 4.4(d)(i), shall be equal to that
percentage of the Capital Accounts of all Partners that is equal to its
Percentage Interest as the General Partner. In such event, such successor
General Partner shall, subject to the following sentence, be entitled to such
Percentage Interest of all Partnership allocations and distributions and any
other allocations and distributions to which the Departing Partner was entitled.
In addition, such successor General Partner shall cause this Agreement to be
amended to reflect that, from and after the date of such successor General
Partner's admission, the successor General Partner's interest in all Partnership
distributions and allocations shall be 1%, and that of the holders of
Outstanding Units shall be 99%.

13.4 WITHDRAWAL OF LIMITED PARTNERS. No Limited Partner shall have any right
to withdraw from the Partnership; provided, however, that when a transferee of a
Limited Partner's Units becomes a Record Holder, such transferring Limited
Partner shall cease to be a Limited Partner with respect to the Units so
transferred.

ARTICLE XIV
DISSOLUTION AND LIQUIDATION

14.1 DISSOLUTION. The Partnership shall not be dissolved by the admission of
Substituted Limited Partners or Additional Limited Partners or by the admission
of a successor General Partner in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
Upon the removal or withdrawal of the General Partner, if a successor General
Partner is elected pursuant to Section 13.1 or 13.2, the Partnership shall not
be dissolved and such successor General Partner shall continue the business of
the Partnership. The Partnership shall dissolve, and (subject to Section 14.2)
its affairs should be wound up, upon:

(a) the expiration of its term as provided in Section 1.5;

(b) an Event of Withdrawal of the General Partner as provided in Section
13.1(a) (other than Section 13.1(a)(ii)), unless a successor is elected and an
Opinion of Counsel is received as provided in Section 13.1(b) or 13.2 and such
successor is admitted to the Partnership pursuant to Section 12.3;

(c) an election to dissolve the Partnership by the General Partner that (i)
during the Subordination Period, is approved by at least a majority of the
Outstanding Units other than Units held by the General Partner or its
Affiliates or (ii) after the expiration of the Subordination Period, is
approved by at least a majority of the Outstanding Units (and all Limited
Partners hereby expressly consent that in either case such approval may be
effected upon written consent of said applicable percentage of the Outstanding
Units);

(d) entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Partnership pursuant
to the provisions of the Delaware Act; or

64
<PAGE>

(e) the sale of all or substantially all of the assets and properties of the
Partnership and the Operating Partnership taken as a whole.

14.2 CONTINUATION OF THE BUSINESS OF THE PARTNERSHIP AFTER DISSOLUTION. Upon
(a) dissolution of the Partnership following an Event of Withdrawal caused by
the withdrawal or removal of the General Partner as provided in Section
13.1(a)(i) or (iii) and the failure of the Partners to select a successor to
such Departing Partner pursuant to Section 13.1 or 13.2, then within 90 days
thereafter or (b) dissolution of the Partnership upon an event constituting an
Event of Withdrawal as defined in Section 13.1(a)(iv), (v) or (vi), then within
180 days thereafter, a majority of the Outstanding Units may elect to
reconstitute the Partnership and continue its business on the same terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement by forming a new limited partnership on
terms identical to those set forth in this Agreement and having as the successor
general partner a Person approved by a majority of the Outstanding Units. Upon
any such election by a majority of the Outstanding Units, all Partners shall be
bound thereby and shall be deemed to have approved thereof. Unless such an
election is made within the applicable time period as set forth above, the
Partnership shall conduct only activities necessary to wind up its affairs. If
such an election is so made, then:

(i) the reconstituted Partnership shall continue until the end of the term
set forth in Section 1.5 unless earlier dissolved in accordance with this
Article XIV;

(ii) if the successor General Partner is not the former General Partner,
then the interest of the former General Partner shall be treated thenceforth
as the interest of a Limited Partner and converted into Common Units in the
manner provided in Section 13.3(b); and

(iii) all necessary steps shall be taken to cancel this Agreement and the
Certificate of Limited Partnership and to enter into and, as necessary, to
file a new partnership agreement and certificate of limited partnership, and
the successor general partner may for this purpose exercise the powers of
attorney granted the General Partner pursuant to Section 1.4; provided, that
the right of a majority of Outstanding Units to approve a successor General
Partner and to reconstitute and to continue the business of the Partnership
shall not exist and may not be exercised unless the Partnership has received
an Opinion of Counsel that (x) the exercise of the right would not result in
the loss of limited liability of any Limited Partner and (y) neither the
Partnership, the reconstituted limited partnership nor the Operating
Partnership would be treated as an association taxable as a corporation or
otherwise be taxable as an entity for federal income tax purposes upon the
exercise of such right to continue.

14.3 LIQUIDATION. Upon dissolution of the Partnership, unless the Partnership
is continued under an election to reconstitute and continue the Partnership
pursuant to Section 14.2, the General Partner, or in the event the General
Partner has been dissolved or removed, become bankrupt as set forth in Section
13.1 or withdrawn from the Partnership, a liquidator or liquidating committee
approved by a majority of the Outstanding Units, shall be the Liquidator. The
Liquidator (if other than the General Partner) shall be entitled to receive such
compensation for its services as may be approved by a majority of the
Outstanding Units. The Liquidator shall agree not to resign at any time without
15 days' prior notice and (if other than the General Partner) may be removed at
any time, with or without cause, by notice of removal approved by a majority of
the Outstanding Units. Upon dissolution, removal or resignation of the
Liquidator, a successor and substitute Liquidator (who shall have and succeed to
all rights, powers and duties of the original Liquidator) shall within 30 days
thereafter be approved by a majority of the Outstanding Units. The right to
approve a successor or substitute Liquidator in the manner provided herein shall
be deemed to refer also to any such successor or substitute Liquidator approved
in the manner herein provided. Except as expressly provided in this Article XIV,
the Liquidator approved in the manner provided herein shall have and may
exercise, without further authorization or consent of any of the parties hereto,
all of the powers conferred upon the General Partner under the terms of this
Agreement (but subject to all of the applicable limitations, contractual and
otherwise, upon the exercise of such powers, other than the limitation on sale
set forth in Section 6.3(b)) to the extent necessary or desirable in the good
faith judgment of the Liquidator to carry out the duties and functions

65
<PAGE>

of the Liquidator hereunder for and during such period of time as shall be
reasonably required in the good faith judgment of the Liquidator to complete the
winding up and liquidation of the Partnership as provided for herein. The
Liquidator shall liquidate the assets of the Partnership, and apply and
distribute the proceeds of such liquidation in the following order of priority,
unless otherwise required by mandatory provisions of applicable law:

(a) the payment to creditors of the Partnership, including, without
limitation, Partners who are creditors, in the order of priority provided by
law; and the creation of a reserve of cash or other assets of the Partnership
for contingent liabilities in an amount, if any, determined by the Liquidator
to be appropriate for such purposes; and

(b) to all Partners in accordance with, and to the extent of, the positive
balances in their respective Capital Accounts, as determined after taking into
account all Capital Account adjustments (other than those made by reason of
this clause) for the taxable year of the Partnership during which the
liquidation of the Partnership occurs (with the date of such occurrence being
determined pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g)); and
such distribution shall be made by the end of such taxable year (or, if later,
within 90 days after said date of such occurrence).

14.4 DISTRIBUTIONS IN KIND. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
14.3, which require the liquidation of the assets of the Partnership, but
subject to the order of priorities set forth therein, if prior to or upon
dissolution of the Partnership the Liquidator determines that an immediate sale
of part or all of the Partnership's assets would be impractical or would cause
undue loss to the Partners, the Liquidator may, in its absolute discretion,
defer for a reasonable time the liquidation of any assets except those necessary
to satisfy liabilities of the Partnership (including, without limitation, those
to Partners as creditors) and or distribute to the Partners or to specific
classes of Partners, in lieu of cash, as tenants in common and in accordance
with the provisions of Section 14.3, undivided interests in such Partnership
assets as the Liquidator deems not suitable for liquidation. Any such
distributions in kind shall be made only if, in the good faith judgment of the
Liquidator, such distributions in kind are in the best interest of the Limited
Partners, and shall be subject to such conditions relating to the disposition
and management of such properties as the Liquidator deems reasonable and
equitable and to any agreements governing the operation of such properties at
such time. The Liquidator shall determine the fair market value of any property
distributed in kind using such reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt.

(b) In accordance with Section 704(c)(1)(B) of the Code, in the case of any
deemed distribution occurring as a result of a termination of the Partnership
pursuant to Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code, to the maximum extent possible
consistent with the priorities of Section 14.3, the General Partner shall have
sole discretion to treat the deemed distribution of Partnership assets to
Partners as occurring in a manner that will not cause a shift of the Book-Tax
Disparity attributable to a Partnership asset existing immediately prior to
the deemed distribution to another asset upon the deemed contribution of
assets to the reconstituted Partnership, including, without limitation,
deeming the distribution of any Partnership assets to be made either to the
Partner who contributed such assets or to the transferee of such Partner.

14.5 CANCELLATION OF CERTIFICATE OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP. Upon the completion
of the distribution of Partnership cash and property as provided in Sections
14.3 and 14.4 in connection with the liquidation of the Partnership, the
Partnership shall be terminated and the Certificate of Limited Partnership and
all qualifications of the Partnership as a foreign limited partnership in
jurisdictions other than the State of Delaware shall be cancelled and such other
actions as may be necessary to terminate the Partnership shall be taken.

14.6 REASONABLE TIME FOR WINDING UP. A reasonable time shall be allowed for
the orderly winding up of business and affairs of the Partnership and the
liquidation of its assets pursuant to Section 14.3

66
<PAGE>

in order to minimize any losses otherwise attendant upon such winding up, and
the provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect between the Partners
during the period of liquidation.

14.7 RETURN OF CAPITAL. The General Partner shall not be personally liable
for, and shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property
to the Partnership to enable it to effectuate, the return of the Capital
Contributions of the Limited Partners, or any portion thereof, it being
expressly understood that any such return shall be made solely from Partnership
assets.

14.8 CAPITAL ACCOUNT RESTORATION. No Limited Partner shall have any obligation
to restore any negative balance in its Capital Account upon liquidation of the
Partnership. The General Partner shall be obligated to restore any negative
balance in its Capital Account upon liquidation of its interest in the
Partnership by the end of the taxable year of the Partnership during which such
liquidation occurs, or, if later, within 90 days after the date of such
liquidation.

14.9 WAIVER OF PARTITION. Each Partner hereby waives any right to partition of
the Partnership property.

ARTICLE XV
AMENDMENT OF PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT;
MEETINGS; RECORD DATE

15.1 AMENDMENT TO BE ADOPTED SOLELY BY GENERAL PARTNER. Each Limited Partner
agrees that the General Partner (pursuant to its powers of attorney from the
Limited Partners, Special Limited Partners and Assignees), without the approval
of any Limited Partner or Assignee, may amend any provision of this Agreement,
and execute, swear to, acknowledge, deliver, file and record whatever documents
may be required in connection therewith, to reflect:

(a) a change in the name of the Partnership, the location of the principal
place of business of the Partnership, the registered agent of the Partnership
or the registered office of the Partnership;

(b) admission, substitution, withdrawal or removal of Partners in
accordance with this Agreement;

(c) a change that, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, is
necessary or appropriate to qualify or continue the qualification of the
Partnership as a limited partnership or a partnership in which the limited
partners have limited liability under the laws of any state or that is
necessary or advisable in the opinion of the General Partner to ensure that
the Partnership and the Operating Partnership will not be treated as an
association taxable as a corporation or otherwise taxed as an entity for
federal income tax purposes;

(d) a change (i) that, in the sole discretion of the General Partner, does
not adversely affect the Limited Partners in any material respect, (ii) that
is necessary or desirable to satisfy any requirements, conditions or
guidelines contained in any opinion, directive, order, ruling or regulation of
any federal or state agency or judicial authority or contained in any federal

15.2 AMENDMENT PROCEDURES. Except as provided in Sections 15.1 and 15.3, all
amendments to this Agreement shall be made in accordance with the following
requirements. Amendments to this Agreement may be proposed only by or with the
consent of the General Partner. A proposed amendment shall be effective upon its
approval by the holders of at least two-thirds of the Outstanding Units during
the Subordination Period and thereafter upon its approval by the holders of at
least a majority of the Outstanding Units, unless, in either case, a greater or
different percentage is required under this Agreement. Each proposed amendment
that requires the approval of the holders of a specified percentage of
Outstanding Units shall be set forth in a writing that contains the text of the
proposed amendment. If such an amendment is proposed, the General Partner shall
seek the written approval of the requisite percentage of Outstanding Units or
call a meeting of the Limited Partners to consider and vote on such proposed
amendment. The General Partner shall notify all Record Holders upon final
adoption of any such proposed amendments.

15.3 AMENDMENT REQUIREMENTS. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections
15.1 and 15.2, no provision of this Agreement that establishes a percentage of
Outstanding Units required to take any action shall be amended, altered,
changed, repealed or rescinded in any respect that would have the effect of
reducing such voting requirement unless such amendment is approved by the
written consent or the affirmative vote of holders of Outstanding Units whose
aggregate Outstanding Units constitute not less than the voting requirement
sought to be reduced.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 15.1 and 15.2, no amendment

Person the right to dissolve the Partnership.

(c) Except as otherwise provided, and without limitation of the General
Partner's authority to adopt amendments to this Agreement as contemplated in
Section 15.1, any amendment that would have a material adverse effect on the
rights or preferences of any class of Outstanding Units in relation to other
classes of Units must be approved by the holders of not less than a majority
of the Outstanding Units of the class affected (excluding for purposes of such
determination Units owned by the General Partner and its Affiliates).

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, except for
amendments pursuant to Section 6.3 or 15.1 and except as otherwise provided by
Section 16.3(b), no amendments shall become effective without the approval of
the holders of at least 95% of the Outstanding Units unless the Partnership
obtains an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that (a) such amendment will not
cause the Partnership or the Operating Partnership to be treated as an
association taxable as a corporation or otherwise taxable as an entity for
federal income tax purposes and (b) such amendment will not affect the limited
liability of any Limited Partner or any limited partner of the Operating
Partnership under applicable law.

(e) This Section 15.3 shall only be amended with the approval of the
holders of not less than 95% of the Outstanding Units.

15.4 MEETINGS. All acts of Limited Partners to be taken pursuant to this
Agreement shall be taken in the manner provided in this Article XV. Meetings of
the Limited Partners may be called by the General Partner or by Limited Partners
owning 20% or more of the Outstanding Units of the class or classes for which a
meeting is proposed. Limited Partners shall call a meeting by delivering to the
General Partner one or more requests in writing stating that the signing Limited
Partners wish to call a meeting and indicating the general or specific purposes
for which the meeting is to be called. Within 60 days after receipt of such a
call from Limited Partners or within such greater time as may be reasonably
necessary for the Partnership to comply with any statutes, rules, regulations,
listing agreements or similar requirements governing the holding of a meeting or
the solicitation of proxies for use at such a meeting, the General Partner shall
send a notice of the meeting to the Limited Partners either directly or
indirectly through the Transfer Agent. A meeting shall be held at a time and
place determined by the General Partner on a date not more than 60 days after
the mailing of notice of the meeting. Limited Partners shall not vote on matters
that would cause the Limited Partners to be deemed to be taking part in the
management and control of the business and affairs of the Partnership so as to
jeopardize the Limited Partners' limited liability under the Delaware Act or the
law of any other state in which the Partnership is qualified to do business.

15.5 NOTICE OF A MEETING. Notice of a meeting called pursuant to Section 15.4
shall be given to the Record Holders in writing by mail or other means of
written communication in accordance with Section 18.1. The notice shall be
deemed to have been given at the time when deposited in the mail or sent by
other means of written communication.

15.6 RECORD DATE. For purposes of determining the Limited Partners entitled to
notice of or to vote at a meeting of the Limited Partners or to give approvals
without a meeting as provided in Section 15.11, the General Partner may set a
Record Date, which shall not be less than 10 nor more than 60 days before (a)
the date of the meeting (unless such requirement conflicts with any rule,
regulation, guideline or requirement of any National Securities Exchange on
which the Units are listed for trading, in which case the rule, regulation,
guideline or requirement of such exchange shall govern) or (b) in the event that
approvals are sought without a meeting, the date by which Limited Partners are
requested in writing by the General Partner to give such approvals.

15.7 ADJOURNMENT. When a meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice
need not be given of the adjourned meeting and a new Record Date need not be
fixed, if the time and place thereof are

69
<PAGE>

announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken, unless such
adjournment shall be for more than 45 days. At the adjourned meeting, the
Partnership may transact any business which might have been transacted at the
original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 45 days or if a new Record
Date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall
be given in accordance with this Article XV.

15.8 WAIVER OF NOTICE; APPROVAL OF MEETING; APPROVAL OF MINUTES. The
transactions of any meeting of Limited Partners, however called and noticed, and
whenever held, shall be as valid as if had at a meeting duly held after regular
call and notice, if a quorum is present either in person or by proxy, and if,
either before or after the meeting, Limited Partners representing such quorum
who were present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote, sign a written
waiver of notice or an approval of the holding of the meeting or an approval of
the minutes thereof. All waivers and approvals shall be filed with the
Partnership records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting. Attendance of
a Limited Partner at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of the
meeting, except when the Limited Partner does not approve, at the beginning of
the meeting, of the transaction of any business because the meeting is not
lawfully called or convened; and except that attendance at a meeting is not a
waiver of any right to disapprove the consideration of matters required to be
included in the notice of the meeting, but not so included, if the disapproval
is expressly made at the meeting.

15.9 QUORUM. The holders of two-thirds of the Outstanding Units of the class
or classes for which a meeting has been called represented in person or by proxy
shall constitute a quorum at a meeting of Limited Partners of such class or
classes unless any such action by the Limited Partners requires approval by
holders of a majority in interest of such Units, in which case the quorum shall
be a majority (excluding, in either case, if such are to be excluded from the
vote, Outstanding Units owned by the General Partner and its Affiliates). At any
meeting of the Limited Partners duly called and held in accordance with this
Agreement at which a quorum is present, the act of Limited Partners holding
Outstanding Units that in the aggregate represent a majority of the Outstanding
Units entitled to vote and be present in person or by proxy at such meeting
shall be deemed to constitute the act of all Limited Partners, unless a greater
or different percentage is required with respect to such action under the
provisions of this Agreement, in which case the act of the Limited Partners
holding Outstanding Units that in the aggregate represent at least such greater
or different percentage shall be required. The Limited Partners present at a
duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to
transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough
Limited Partners to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than
adjournment) is approved by the required percentage of Outstanding Units
specified in this Agreement. In the absence of a quorum, any meeting of Limited
Partners may be adjourned from time to time by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the Outstanding Units represented either in person or by proxy, but
no other business may be transacted, except as provided in Section 15.7.

15.10 CONDUCT OF MEETING. The General Partner shall have full power and
authority concerning the manner of conducting any meeting of the Limited
Partners or solicitation of approvals in writing, including, without limitation,
the determination of Persons entitled to vote, the existence of a quorum, the
satisfaction of the requirements of Section 15.4, the conduct of voting, the
validity and effect of any proxies and the determination of any controversies,
votes or challenges arising in connection with or during the meeting or voting.
The General Partner shall designate a Person to serve as chairman of any meeting
and shall further designate a Person to take the minutes of any meeting. All
minutes shall be kept with the records of the Partnership maintained by the
General Partner. The General Partner may make such other regulations consistent
with applicable law and this Agreement as it may deem advisable concerning the
conduct of any meeting of the Limited Partners or solicitation of approvals in
writing, including, without limitation, regulations in regard to the appointment
of proxies, the appointment and duties of inspectors of votes and approvals, the
submission and examination of proxies and other evidence of the right to vote,
and the revocation of approvals in writing.

15.11 ACTION WITHOUT A MEETING. Any action that may be taken at a meeting of
the Limited Partners may be taken without a meeting if an approval in writing
setting forth the action so taken is signed by

70
<PAGE>

Limited Partners owning not less than the minimum percentage of the Outstanding
Units that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at
which all the Limited Partners were present and voted. Prompt notice of the
taking of action without a meeting shall be given to the Limited Partners who
have not approved in writing. The General Partner may specify that any written
ballot submitted to Limited Partners for the purpose of taking any action
without a meeting shall be returned to the Partnership within the time period,
which shall be not less than 20 days, specified by the General Partner. If a
ballot returned to the Partnership does not vote all of the Units held by the
Limited Partner, the Partnership shall be deemed to have failed to receive a
ballot for the Units that were not voted. If approval of the taking of any
action by the Limited Partners is solicited by any Person other than by or on
behalf of the General Partner, the written approvals shall have no force and
effect unless and until (a) they are deposited with the Partnership in care of
the General Partner, (b) approvals sufficient to take the action proposed are
dated as of a date not more than 90 days prior to the date sufficient approvals
are deposited with the Partnership and (c) an Opinion of Counsel is delivered to
the General Partner to the effect that the exercise of such right and the action
proposed to be taken with respect to any particular matter (i) will not cause
the Limited Partners to be deemed to be taking part in the management and
control of the business and affairs of the Partnership so as to jeopardize the
Limited Partners' limited liability, (ii) will not jeopardize the status of the
Partnership as a partnership under applicable tax laws and regulations and (iii)
is otherwise permissible under the state statutes then governing the rights,
duties and liabilities of the Partnership and the Partners.

15.12 VOTING AND OTHER RIGHTS. (a) Only those Record Holders of Units on the
Record Date set pursuant to Section 15.6 (and also subject to the limitations
contained in the definition of "Outstanding") shall be entitled to notice of,
and to vote at, a meeting of Limited Partners or to act with respect to matters
as to which the holders of the Outstanding Units have the right to vote or to
act. All references in this Agreement to votes of, or other acts that may be
taken by, the Outstanding Units shall be deemed to be references to the votes or
acts of the Record Holders of such Outstanding Units.

(b) With respect to Units that are held for a Person's account by another
Person (such as a broker, dealer, bank, trust company or clearing corporation,
or an agent of any of the foregoing), in whose name such Units are registered,
such broker, dealer or other agent shall, in exercising the voting rights in
respect of such Units on any matter, and unless the arrangement between such
Persons provides otherwise, vote such Units in favor of, and at the direction
of, the Person who is the beneficial owner, and the Partnership shall be
entitled to assume it is so acting without further inquiry. The provisions of
this Section 15.12(b) (as well as all other provisions of this Agreement) are
subject to the provisions of Section 10.4.

written agreement of merger or consolidation ("MERGER AGREEMENT") in accordance
with this Article XVI.

be exchanged or converted solely for, or into, cash, property or general or
limited partnership interests, rights, securities or obligations of the
Surviving Business Entity, the cash, property or general or limited
partnership interests, rights, securities or obligations of any limited
partnership, corporation, trust or other entity (other than the Surviving
Business Entity) which the holders of such general or limited partnership
interests, securities or rights are to receive in exchange for, or upon
conversion of, their general or limited partnership interests, securities or
rights, and (ii) in the case of securities represented by certificates, upon
the surrender of such certificates, which cash, property or general or limited

shall be included in or enclosed with the notice of a meeting or the written
consent.

(b) The Merger Agreement shall be approved upon receiving the affirmative
vote or consent of the holders of at least a majority of the Outstanding Units
(excluding for purposes of such determination Units owned by the General
Parter and its Affiliates) during the Subordination Period and at least a
majority of the Outstanding Units thereafter unless the Merger Agreement
contains any provision which, if contained in an amendment to this Agreement,
the provisions of this Agreement or the Delaware Act would require the vote or
consent of a greater percentage of the Outstanding Units or of any class of
Limited Partners, in which case such greater percentage vote or consent shall
be required for approval of the Merger Agreement; provided that, in the case
of a merger or consolidation in which the surviving entity is a corporation or
other entity intended to be treated as an association taxable as a corporation
or otherwise taxable as an entity for federal income tax purposes, if in the
opinion of the General Partner it is necessary to effect, in contemplation of
such merger or consolidation, an amendment that would otherwise require a vote
pursuant to Section 15.3(d), no such vote pursuant to Section 15.3(d) shall be
required unless such amendment by its terms will be applicable to the

and the Limited Partners of a Merger Agreement, a certificate of merger shall be

those constituent business entities shall not revert and is not in any way
impaired because of the merger or consolidation;

entities shall attach to the Surviving Business Entity, and may be enforced
against it to the same extent as if the debts, liabilities and duties had been
incurred or contracted by it.

be deemed to result in a transfer or assignment of assets or liabilities from
one entity to another having occurred.

ARTICLE XVII
RIGHT TO ACQUIRE UNITS

17.1 RIGHT TO ACQUIRE UNITS. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, if at any time not more than 20% of the total Units of any class then
Outstanding are held by Persons other than the General Partner and its
Affiliates, the General Partner shall then have the right, which right it may
assign and transfer to the Partnership or any Affiliate of the General Partner,
exercisable in its sole discretion, to purchase all, but not less than all, of
the Units of such class then Outstanding held by Persons other than the General
Partner and its Affiliates, at the greater of (x) the Current Market Price as of
the date three days prior to the date that the notice described in Section
17.1(b) is mailed, and (y) the highest cash price paid by the General Partner or
any of its Affiliates for any such Unit purchased during the 90-day period
preceding the date that the notice described in Section 17.1(b) is mailed. As
used in this Agreement, (i) "CURRENT MARKET PRICE" as of any date of any class
of Units listed or admitted to trading on any National Securities Exchange means
the average of the daily Closing Prices (as hereinafter defined) per Unit of
such class for the 20 consecutive Trading Days (as hereinafter defined)
immediately prior to such date; (ii) "CLOSING PRICE" for any day means the last
sale price on such day, regular way, or in case no such sale takes place on such
day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices on such day, regular way,
in either case as reported in the principal consolidated transaction reporting
system with respect to securities listed on the principal National Securities
Exchange on which the Units of such class are listed or admitted to trading or
if the Units of such class are not listed or admitted to trading on any National
Securities Exchange, the last quoted price on such day or, if not so quoted, the
average of the high bid and low asked prices on such day in the over the counter
market, as reported by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
Automated

73
<PAGE>

Quotation System or such other system then in use, or if on any such day the
Units of such class are not quoted by any such organization, the average of the
closing bid and asked prices on such day as furnished by a professional market
maker making a market in the Units of such class selected by the Board of
Directors of the General Partner, or if on any such day no market maker is
making a market in the Units of such class, the fair value of such Units on such
day as determined reasonably and in good faith by the Board of Directors of the
General Partner; and (iii) "TRADING DAY" means a day on which the principal
National Securities Exchange on which the Units of any class are listed or
admitted to trading is open for the transaction of business or, if Units of a
class are not listed or admitted to trading on any National Securities Exchange,
a day on which banking institutions in New York City generally are open.

(b) If the General Partner, any Affiliate of the General Partner or the
Partnership elects to exercise the right to purchase Units granted pursuant to
Section 17.1(a), the General Partner shall deliver to the Transfer Agent
notice of such election to purchase (the "NOTICE OF ELECTION TO PURCHASE") and
shall cause the Transfer Agent to mail a copy of such Notice of Election to
Purchase to the Record Holders of Units (as of a Record Date selected by the
General Partner) at least 10, but not more than 60, days prior to the Purchase
Date. Such Notice of Election to Purchase shall also be published for a period
of at least three consecutive days in at least two daily newspapers of general
circulation printed in the English language and published in the Borough of
Manhattan, New York. The Notice of Election to Purchase shall specify the
Purchase Date and the price (determined in accordance with Section 17.1(a) at
which Units will be purchased and state that the General Partner, its
Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case may be, elects to purchase such
Units, upon surrender of Certificates representing such Units in exchange for
payment, at such office or offices of the Transfer Agent as the Transfer Agent
may specify, or as may be required by any National Securities Exchange on
which the Units are listed or admitted to trading. Any such Notice of Election
to Purchase mailed to a Record Holder of Units at his address as reflected in
the records of the Transfer Agent shall be conclusively presumed to have been
given whether or not the owner receives such notice. On or prior to the
Purchase Date, the General Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the
case may be, shall deposit with the Transfer Agent cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate purchase price of all of the Units to be
purchased in accordance with this Section 17.1. If the Notice of Election to
Purchase shall have been duly given as aforesaid at least 10 days prior to the
Purchase Date, and if on or prior to the Purchase Date the deposit described
in the preceding sentence has been made for the benefit of the holders of
Units subject to purchase as provided herein, then from and after the Purchase
Date, notwithstanding that any Certificate shall not have been surrendered for
purchase, all rights of the holders of such Units (including, without
limitation, any rights pursuant to Articles IV, V and XIV) shall thereupon
cease, except the right to receive the purchase price (determined in
accordance with Section 17.1(a)) for Units therefor, without interest, upon
surrender to the Transfer Agent of the Certificates representing such Units,
and such Units shall thereupon be deemed to be transferred to the General
Partner, its Affiliate or the Partnership, as the case may be, on the record
books of the Transfer Agent and the Partnership, and the General Partner or
any Affiliate of the General Partner, or the Partnership, as the case may be,
shall be deemed to be the owner of all such Units from and after the Purchase
Date and shall have all rights as the owner of such Units (including, without
limitation, all rights as owner of such Units pursuant to Articles IV, V and
XIV).

(c) At any time from and after the Purchase Date, a holder of an
Outstanding Unit subject to purchase as provided in this Section 17.1 may
surrender his Certificate, as the case may be, evidencing such Unit to the
Transfer Agent in exchange for payment of the amount described in Section
17.1(a), therefor, without interest thereon.

addressed to a Record Holder at the address of such Record Holder appearing on
the books and records of the Transfer Agent or the Partnership is returned by
the United States Post Office marked to indicate that the United States Postal
Service is unable to deliver it, such notice, payment or report and any
subsequent notices, payments and reports shall be deemed to have been duly given
or made without further mailing (until such time as such Record Holder or
another Person notifies the Transfer Agent or the Partnership of a change in his
address) if they are available for the Partner or Assignee at the principal
office of the Partnership for a period of one year from the date of the giving
or making of such notice, payment or report to the other Partners and Assignees.
Any notice to the Partnership shall be deemed given if received by the General

18.9 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of
which together shall constitute an agreement binding on all the parties hereto,
notwithstanding that all such parties are not signatories to the original or the

1.4 POWER OF ATTORNEY. (a) The Limited Partner hereby constitutes
and appoints each of the General Partner and, if a Liquidator shall have been
selected pursuant to Section 13.3, the Liquidator severally (and any successor

all other jurisdictions in which the Partnership may conduct business or
own property; (B) all

the Liquidator deems necessary or appropriate to reflect, in accordance
with its terms, any amendment, change, modification or restatement of this
Agreement; (C) all certificates, documents and other instruments

cancellation) that the General Partner or the Liquidator deems necessary or
appropriate to reflect the dissolution and liquidation of the Partnership

and other instruments relating to the admission, withdrawal, removal or
substitution of any Partner pursuant to, or other events described in,
Article X, XI, XII or XIII or the Capital Contribution of any Partner; (E)

instruments necessary or appropriate, in the sole discretion of the General
Partner or the Liquidator, to make, evidence, give, confirm or ratify any
vote, consent, approval, agreement or other action that is made or given by
the Partners hereunder or is consistent with the terms of this Agreement or
is necessary or appropriate, in the sole discretion of the General Partner
or the Liquidator, to effectuate the terms or intent of this Agreement;
provided, that when the consent or approval of the Limited Partner is
required by any provision of this Agreement, the General Partner or the
Liquidator may exercise the power of attorney made in this Section
1.4(a)(ii) only after the necessary consent or approval of the Limited
Partner is obtained.

Nothing contained in this Section 1.4(a) shall be construed as authorizing the
General Partner to amend this Agreement except in accordance with Article XIV or
as may be otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement.

(b) The foregoing power of attorney is hereby declared to be irrevocable
and a power coupled with an interest, and it shall survive and not be affected
by the subsequent death, incompetency, disability, incapacity, dissolution,
bankruptcy or termination of the Limited Partner and the transfer of all or any
portion of the Limited Partner's Partnership Interest and shall extend to the
Limited Partner's heirs, successors, assigns and personal representatives. The
Limited Partner hereby agrees to be bound by any representation made by the
General Partner or the Liquidator acting in good faith pursuant to such power of
attorney; and the Limited Partner hereby waives any and all defenses that may be
available to contest, negate or disaffirm the action of the General Partner or
the Liquidator taken in good faith under such power of attorney. The Limited
Partner shall execute and deliver to the General Partner or the Liquidator,
within 15 days after receipt of the General Partner's or the Liquidator's
request therefor, such further designation, powers of attorney and other
instruments as the General Partner or the Liquidator deems necessary to
effectuate this Agreement and the purposes of the Partnership.

1.5 TERM. The Partnership commenced upon the filing of the Certificate of
Limited Partnership in accordance with the Delaware Act and shall continue in
existence until the close of Partnership business on July 31, 2084, or until the
earlier termination of the Partnership in accordance with the provisions of
Article XIII.

1.6 POSSIBLE RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event of (a) the enactment (or
imminent enactment) of any legislation, (b) the publication of any temporary or
final regulation by the Treasury Department, (c) any ruling by the Internal
Revenue Service or (d) any judicial decision, that, in any such case, in the
Opinion of Counsel, would

8
<PAGE>

result in the taxation of the Partnership as an association taxable as a
corporation or would otherwise result in the Partnership being taxed as an
entity for federal income tax purposes, then, the General Partner may impose

Partnership Interest pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) all items of
Partnership income and gain (including, without limitation, income and gain
exempt from tax) computed in accordance with Section 4.5(b) and allocated with
respect to such Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 5.1, and decreased by
(x) the amount of cash or the Net Agreed Value of all actual and deemed
distributions of cash or property made with respect to such Partnership Interest
pursuant to this Agreement and (y) all items of Partnership deduction and loss
computed in accordance with Section 4.5(b) and allocated with respect to such
Partnership Interest pursuant to Section 5.1.

(b) For purposes of computing the amount of any item of income, gain, loss
or deduction to be reflected in the Partners' Capital Accounts, the
determination, recognition and classification of any such item shall be the same
as its determination, recognition and classification for federal income tax
purposes (including, without limitation, any method of depreciation, cost
recovery or amortization used for that purpose), provided, that:

(i) Solely for purposes of this Section 4.5, the Partnership shall be
treated as owning directly its proportionate share (as determined by the
General Partner) of all property owned by any OLP Subsidiary that is
classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.

(ii) All fees and other expenses incurred by the Partnership to
promote the sale of (or to sell) a Partnership Interest that can neither be
deducted nor amortized under Section 709 of the Code, if any, shall, for
purposes of Capital Account maintenance, be treated as an item of deduction
at the time such fees and other expenses are incurred and shall be
allocated among the Partners pursuant to Section 5.1.

(iii) Except as otherwise provided in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), the computation of all items of income, gain, loss
and deduction shall be made without regard to any election under Section
754 of the Code which may be made by the Partnership and, as to those items
described in Section 705(a)(1)(B) or 705(a)(2)(B) of the Code, without
regard to the fact that such items are not includable in gross income or
are neither currently deductible nor capitalized for federal income tax
purposes.

(iv) Any income, gain or loss attributable to the taxable disposition
of any Partnership property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of
such property as of such date of disposition were equal in amount to the
Partnership's Carrying Value with respect to such property as of such date.

(v) In accordance with the requirements of Section 704(b) of the Code,
any deductions for depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable
to any Contributed Property shall be determined as if the adjusted basis of
such property on the date it was acquired by the Partnership were equal to
the Agreed Value of such property. Upon an adjustment pursuant to Section
4.5(d) to the Carrying Value of any Partnership property subject to
depreciation, cost recovery or amortization, any further deductions for
such depreciation, cost recovery or amortization attributable to such
property shall be determined (A) as if the adjusted basis of such property
were equal to the Carrying Value of such property immediately following
such adjustment and (B) using a rate of depreciation, cost recovery or
amortization derived from the same method and useful life (or, if
applicable, the remaining useful life) as is applied for federal income tax
purposes; provided, however, that, if the asset has a zero adjusted basis
for

19
<PAGE>

federal income tax purposes, depreciation, cost recovery or amortization
deductions shall be determined using any reasonable method that the General
Partner may adopt.

(vi) If the Partnership's adjusted basis in a depreciable or cost
recovery property is reduced for federal income tax purposes pursuant to
Section 48(q)(1) or 48(q)(3) of the Code, the amount of such reduction
shall, solely for purposes hereof, be deemed to be an additional
depreciation or cost recovery deduction in the year such property is placed
in service and shall be allocated among the Partners pursuant to Section
5.1. Any restoration of such basis pursuant to Section 48(q)(2) of the
Code shall, to the extent possible, be allocated in the same manner to the
Partners to whom such deemed deduction was allocated.

(c) A transferee of a Partnership Interest shall succeed to a pro rata
portion of the Capital Account of the transferor relating to the Partnership
Interest so transferred; provided, however, that, if the transfer causes a
termination of the Partnership under Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code, the
Partnership's properties shall be deemed to have been distributed in liquidation
of the Partnership to the Partners (including any transferee of a Partnership
Interest that is a party to the transfer causing such termination) pursuant to
Sections 13.3 and 13.4 and recontributed by such Partners in reconstitution of
the Partnership. Any such deemed distribution shall be treated as an actual
distribution for purposes of this Section 4.5. In such event, the Carrying
Values of the Partnership properties shall be adjusted immediately prior to such
deemed distribution pursuant to Section 4.5(d)(ii) and such Carrying Values
shall then constitute the Agreed Values of such properties upon such deemed
contribution to the reconstituted Partnership. The Capital Accounts of such
reconstituted Partnership shall be maintained in accordance with the principles
of this Section 4.5.

(d) (i) Consistent with the provisions of Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(f), on an issuance of additional Partnership Interests
for cash or Contributed Property, the Capital Account of all Partners and
the Carrying Value of each Partnership property immediately prior to such
issuance shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized
Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as if
such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized on an actual
sale of each such property immediately prior to such issuance and had been
allocated to the Partners at such time pursuant to Sections 5.1(a) and
5.1(b). In determining such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss, the
aggregate cash amount and fair market value of all Partnership assets
(including, without limitation, cash or cash equivalents) immediately prior
to the issuance of additional Partnership Interests shall be determined by
the General Partner using such reasonable method of valuation as it may
adopt; provided, however, that the General Partner, in arriving at such
valuation, must take fully into account the fair market value of the
Partnership Interests of all Partners at such time. The General Partner
shall allocate such aggregate value among the assets of the Partnership (in
such manner as it determines in its sole discretion to be reasonable) to
arrive at a fair market value for individual properties.

(ii) In accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-
1(b)(2)(iv)(f), immediately prior to any actual or deemed distribution to a
Partner of any Partnership property (other than a distribution of cash that
is not in redemption or retirement of a Partnership Interest), the Capital
Accounts of all Partners and the Carrying Value of such Partnership
property shall be adjusted upward or downward to reflect any Unrealized
Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such Partnership property, as if
such Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss had been recognized in a sale of
such property immediately prior to such distribution for an amount equal to
its fair market value, and had been allocated to the Partners, at such
time, pursuant to Section 5.1. Any Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss
attributable to such property shall be allocated in the same manner as Net
Termination Gain or Net Termination Loss pursuant to Section 5.1(c);
provided, however, that, in making any such allocation, Net Termination
Gain or Net Termination

20
<PAGE>

Loss actually realized shall be allocated first. In determining such
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss the aggregate cash amount and fair
market value of all Partnership assets (including, without limitation, cash
or cash equivalents) immediately prior to a distribution shall (A) in the
case of a deemed distribution occurring as a result of a termination of the
Partnership pursuant to Section 708 of the Code, be determined and
allocated in the same manner as that provided in Section 4.5(d)(i) or (B)
in the case of a liquidating distribution pursuant to Section 14.3 or 14.4,
be determined and allocated by the Liquidator using such reasonable method
of valuation as it may adopt.

4.6 INTEREST. No interest shall be paid by the Partnership on Capital
Contributions or on balances in Partners' Capital Accounts.

4.7 NO WITHDRAWAL. No Partner shall be entitled to withdraw any part of
its Capital Contributions or its Capital Account or to receive any distribution
from the Partnership, except as provided in Articles V, VII, XII and XIII.

4.8 LOANS FROM PARTNERS. Loans by a Partner to the Partnership shall not
constitute Capital Contributions. If any Partner shall advance funds to the
Partnership in excess of the amounts required hereunder to be contributed by it
to the capital of the Partnership, the making of such excess advances shall not
result in any increase in the amount of the Capital Account of such Partner.
The amount of any such excess advances shall be a debt obligation of the
Partnership to such Partner and shall be payable or collectible only out of the
Partnership assets in accordance with the terms and conditions upon which such
advances are made.

ARTICLE V
ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

5.1 ALLOCATIONS FOR CAPITAL ACCOUNT PURPOSES. For purposes of maintaining
the Capital Accounts and in determining the rights of the Partners among
themselves, the Partnership's items of income, gain, loss and deduction
(computed in accordance with Section 4.5(b)) shall be allocated among the
Partners in each taxable year (or portion thereof) as provided hereinbelow.

(a) Net Income. After giving effect to the special allocations set
forth in Section 5.1(d), Net Income for each taxable period and all items
of income, gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing Net
Income for such taxable period shall be allocated as follows:

(i) First, 100% to the General Partner until the aggregate Net
Income allocated to the General Partner pursuant to this Section
5.1(a)(i) for the current taxable year and all previous taxable years
is equal to the aggregate Net Losses allocated to the General Partner
pursuant to Section 5.1(b)(ii) for all previous taxable years; and

(ii) Second, the balance, if any, 100% to the General Partner and
the Limited Partner in accordance with their respective Percentage
Interests.

(b) Net Losses. After giving effect to the special allocations set
forth in Section 5.1(d), Net Losses for each taxable period and all items
of income, gain, loss and deduction taken into account in computing Net
Losses for such taxable period shall be allocated as follows:

(i) First, 100% to the General Partner and the Limited Partner in
accordance with their respective Percentage Interests; provided, that
Net Losses shall not be

21
<PAGE>

allocated pursuant to this Section 5.1(b)(i) to the extent that such
allocation would cause any Limited Partner to have a deficit balance
in its Adjusted Capital Account at the end of such taxable year (or
increase any existing deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital
Account); and

(ii) Second, the balance, if any, 100% to the General Partner.

(c) Net Termination Gains and Losses. After giving effect to the
special allocations set forth in Section 5.1(d), all items of income, gain,
loss and deduction taken into account in computing Net Termination Gain or
Net Termination Loss for such taxable period shall be allocated in the same
manner as such Net Termination Gain or Net Termination Loss is allocated
hereunder. All allocations under this Section 5.1(c) shall be made after
Capital Account balances have been adjusted by all other allocations
provided under this Section 5.1 and after all distributions of Available
Cash provided under Section 5.3 have been made with respect to the taxable
period ending on the date of the Partnership's liquidation pursuant to
Section 13.3.

(i) If a Net Termination Gain is recognized (or deemed recognized
pursuant to Section 4.5(d)) from Termination Capital Transactions,
such Net Termination Gain shall be allocated between the General
Partner and the Limited Partner in the following manner (and the
Adjusted Capital Accounts of the Partners shall be increased by the
amount so allocated in each of the following subclauses, in the order
listed, before an allocation is made pursuant to the next succeeding
subclause):

(A) First, to each Partner having a deficit balance in its
Adjusted Capital Account, in the proportion that such deficit
balance bears to the total deficit balances in the Adjusted
Capital Accounts of all Partners, until each such Partner has
been allocated Net Termination Gain equal to any such deficit
balance in its Adjusted Capital Account; and

(B) Second, 100% to the General Partner and the Limited
Partner in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests.

(ii) If a Net Termination Loss is recognized (or deemed
recognized pursuant to Section 4.5(d)) from Termination Capital
Transactions, such Net Termination Loss shall be allocated to the
Partners in the following manner:

(A) First, 100% to the General Partner and the Limited
Partner in proportion to, and to the extent of, the positive
balances in their respective Adjusted Capital Accounts; and

(B) Second, the balance, if any, 100% to the General
Partner.

(d) Specials Allocations. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section 5.1, the following special allocations shall be made for such
taxable period:

(i) Partnership Minimum Gain Chargeback. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Section 5.1, if there is a net decrease in
Partnership Minimum Gain during any Partnership taxable period, each
Partner shall be allocated items of Partnership income and gain for
such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in the manner and
amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-2(f)(6), 1.704-
2(g)(2) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(i), or any successor provision. For
purposes of this Section 5.1(d), each Partner's Adjusted Capital
Account balance shall be determined, and the

22
<PAGE>

allocation of income or gain required hereunder shall be effected,
prior to the application of any other allocations pursuant to this
Section 5.1(d) with respect to such taxable period (other than an
allocation pursuant to Sections 5.1(d)(v) and (vi)). This Section
5.1(d)(i) is intended to comply with the Partnership Minimum Gain
chargeback requirement in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-2(f) and
shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

(ii) Chargeback of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain.
Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 5.1 (other than
Section 5.1(d)(i)), except as provided in Treasury Regulation Section
1.704-2(i)(4), if there is a net decrease in Partner Nonrecourse Debt
Minimum Gain during any Partnership taxable period, any Partner with a
share of Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain at the beginning of
such taxable period shall be allocated items of Partnership income and
gain for such period (and, if necessary, subsequent periods) in the
manner and amounts provided in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-
2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2)(ii), or any successor provisions. For
purposes of this Section 5.1(d), each Partner's Adjusted Capital
Account balance shall be determined, and the allocation of income or
gain required hereunder shall be effected, prior to the application of
any other allocations pursuant to this Section 5.1(d), other than
Section 5.1(d)(i) and other than an allocation pursuant to Sections
5.1(d)(v) and (vi), with respect to such taxable period. This Section
5.1(d)(ii) is intended to comply with the chargeback of items of
income and gain requirement in Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-
2(i)(4) and shall be interpreted consistently therewith.

(iii) Qualified Income Offset. In the event any Partner
unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations or distributions
described in Treasury Regulation Sections 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4),
1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5), or 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6), items of
Partnership income and gain shall be specifically allocated to such
Partner in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent
required by the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 704(b)
of the Code, the deficit balance, if any, in its Adjusted Capital
Account created by such adjustments, allocations or distributions as
quickly as possible, unless such deficit balance is otherwise
eliminated pursuant to Section 5.1(d)(i) or (ii).

(iv) Gross Income Allocations. In the event any Partner has a
deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital Account at the end of any
Partnership taxable period such Partner shall be specially allocated
items of Partnership gross income and gain in the amount of such
excess as quickly as possible; provided, that an allocation pursuant
to this Section 5.1(d)(iv) shall be made only if and to the extent
that such Partner would have a deficit balance in its Adjusted Capital
Account after all other allocations provided in this Section 5.1 have
been tentatively made as if this Section 5.1(d)(iv) were not in this
Agreement.

(v) Nonrecourse Deductions. Nonrecourse Deductions for any
taxable period shall be allocated to the Partners in accordance with
their respective Percentage Interests. If the General Partner
determines in its good faith discretion that the Partnership's
Nonrecourse Deductions must be allocated in a different ratio to
satisfy the safe harbor requirements of the Treasury Regulations
promulgated under Section 704(b) of the Code, the General Partner is
authorized, upon notice to the Limited Partner, to revise the
prescribed ratio to the numerically closest ratio that does satisfy
such requirements.

23
<PAGE>

(vi) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions. Partner Nonrecourse
Deductions for any taxable period shall be allocated 100% to the
Partner that bears the Economic Risk of Loss with respect to the
Partner Nonrecourse Debt to which such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions
are attributable in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-
2(i). If more than one Partner bears the Economic Risk of Loss with
respect to a Partner Nonrecourse Debt, such Partner Nonrecourse
Deductions attributable thereto shall be allocated between or among
such Partners in accordance with the ratios in which they share such
Economic Risk of Loss.

(vii) Nonrecourse Liabilities. For purposes of Treasury
Regulation Section 1.752-3(a)(3), the Partners agree that Nonrecourse
Liabilities of the Partnership in excess of the sum of (A) the amount
of Partnership Minimum Gain and (B) the total amount of Nonrecourse
Built-in Gain shall be allocated among the Partners in accordance with
their respective Percentage Interests.

(viii) Code Section 754 Adjustments. To the extent an
adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant
to Section 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m), to be taken into
account in determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment
to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the
adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the
adjustment decreases such basis), and such item of gain or loss shall
be specially allocated to the Partners in a manner consistent with the
manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted
pursuant to such Section of the Treasury Regulations.

(ix) Curative Allocation.

(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5.1,
other than the Required Allocations, the Required Allocations
shall be taken into account in making the Agreed Allocations so
that, to the extent possible, the net amount of items of income,
gain, loss and deduction allocated to each Partner pursuant to
the Required Allocations and the Agreed Allocations, together,
shall be equal to the net amount of such items that would have
been allocated to each such Partner under the Agreed Allocations
had the Required Allocations and the related Curative Allocation
not otherwise been provided in this Section 5.1. Notwithstanding
the preceding sentence, Required Allocations relating to (1)
Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken into account except to
the extent that there has been a decrease in Partnership Minimum
Gain and (2) Partner Nonrecourse Deductions shall not be taken
into account except to the extent that there has been a decrease
in Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain. Allocations pursuant
to this Section 5.1(d)(ix)(A) shall only be made with respect to
Required Allocations to the extent the General Partner reasonably
determines that such allocations will otherwise be inconsistent
with the economic agreement among the Partners. Further,
allocations pursuant to this Section 5.1(d)(ix)(A) shall be
deferred with respect to allocations pursuant to clauses (1) and
(2) hereof to the extent the General Partner reasonably
determines that such allocations are likely to be offset by
subsequent Required Allocations.

(B) The General Partner shall have reasonable discretion,
with respect to each taxable period, to (1) apply the provisions
of Section 5.1(d)(ix)(A) in whatever order is most likely to
minimize the economic distortions that might otherwise result
from the Required Allocations, and (2)

24
<PAGE>

divide all allocations pursuant to Section 5.1(d)(ix)(A) among
the Partners in a manner that is likely to minimize such economic
distortions.

5.2 ALLOCATIONS FOR TAX PURPOSES. (a) Except as otherwise provided
herein, for federal income tax purposes, each item of income, gain, loss and
deduction shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its
correlative item of "book" income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant
to Section 5.1.

(b) In an attempt to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities attributable to a
Contributed Property or Adjusted Property, items of income, gain, loss,
depreciation, amortization and cost recovery deductions shall be allocated for
federal income tax purposes among the Partners as follows:

(i) (A) In the case of a Contributed Property, such items attributable
thereto shall be allocated among the Partners in the manner provided under
Section 704(c) of the Code that takes into account the variation between
the Agreed Value of such property and its adjusted basis at the time of
contribution; and (B) except as otherwise provided in Section 5.2(b)(iii),
any item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable to a Contributed
Property shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its
correlative item of "book" gain or loss is allocated pursuant to Section
5.1.

(ii) (A) In the case of an Adjusted Property, such items shall (1)
first, be allocated among the Partners in a manner consistent with the
principles of Section 704(c) of the Code to take into account the
Unrealized Gain or Unrealized Loss attributable to such property and the
allocations thereof pursuant to Section 4.5(d)(i) or (ii), and (2) second,
in the event such property was originally a Contributed Property, be
allocated among the Partners in a manner consistent with Section
5.2(b)(i)(A); and (B) except as otherwise provided in Section 5.2(b)(iii),
any item of Residual Gain or Residual Loss attributable to an Adjusted
Property shall be allocated among the Partners in the same manner as its
correlative item of "book" gain or loss is allocated pursuant to Section
5.1.

(iii) The General Partner shall apply the principles of Temporary
Regulation Section 1.704-3T to eliminate Book-Tax Disparities.

(c) For the proper administration of the Partnership and for the
preservation of uniformity of Units of the MLP (or any class or classes
thereof), the General Partner shall have sole discretion to (i) adopt such
conventions as it deems appropriate in determining the amount of depreciation,
amortization and cost recovery deductions; (ii) make special allocations for
federal income tax purposes of income (including, without limitation, gross
income) or deductions; and (iii) amend the provisions of this Agreement as
appropriate (x) to reflect the proposal or promulgation of Treasury Regulations
under Section 704(b) or Section 704(c) of the Code or (y) otherwise to preserve
or achieve uniformity of Units of the MLP (or any class or classes thereof).
The General Partner may adopt such conventions, make such allocations and make
such amendments to this Agreement as provided in this Section 5.2(c) only if
such conventions, allocations or amendments would not have a material adverse
effect on the Partners, the holders of any class or classes of Units of the MLP
issued and outstanding or the Partnership, and if such allocations are
consistent with the principles of Section 704 of the Code.

(d) The General Partner in its sole discretion may determine to depreciate
or amortize the portion of an adjustment under Section 743(b) of the Code
attributable to unrealized appreciation in any Adjusted Property (to the extent
of the unamortized Book-Tax Disparity) using a predetermined rate derived from
the depreciation or amortization method and useful life applied to the
Partnership's common basis of such property, despite the inconsistency of such
approach with Proposed Treasury Regulation Section 1.168-2(n), Treasury
Regulation Section 1.167(c)-1(a)(6) or the legislative history of Section 197

25
<PAGE>

of the Code. If the General Partner determines that such reporting position
cannot reasonably be taken, the General Partner may adopt depreciation and
amortization conventions under which all purchasers acquiring Units of the MLP
in the same month would receive depreciation and amortization deductions, based
upon the same applicable rate as if they had purchased a direct interest in the
Partnership's property. If the General Partner chooses not to utilize such
aggregate method, the General Partner may use any other reasonable depreciation
and amortization conventions to preserve the uniformity of the intrinsic tax
characteristics of any class or classes of Units of the MLP that would not have
a material adverse effect on the Limited Partner or the holders of any class or
classes of Units of the MLP.

(e) Any gain allocated to the Partners upon the sale or other taxable
disposition of any Partnership asset shall, to the extent possible, after taking
into account other required allocations of gain pursuant to this Section 5.2, be
characterized as Recapture Income in the same proportions and to the same extent
as such Partners (or their predecessors in interest) have been allocated any
deductions directly or indirectly giving rise to the treatment of such gains as
Recapture Income.

(f) All items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit recognized by the
Partnership for federal income tax purposes and allocated to the Partners in
accordance with the provisions hereof shall be determined without regard to any
election under Section 754 of the Code which may be made by the Partnership;
provided, however, that such allocations, once made, shall be adjusted as
necessary or appropriate to take into account those adjustments permitted or
required by Sections 734 and 743 of the Code.

(g) The General Partner may adopt such methods of allocation of income,
gain, loss or deduction between a transferor and a transferee of a Partnership
Interest as it determines necessary, to the extent permitted or required by
Section 706 of the Code and the regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder.

5.3 REQUIREMENT OF DISTRIBUTIONS. (a) Within 45 days following the end
of (i) the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on October 31, 1994
and (ii) each Quarter commencing with the Quarter beginning on November 1, 1994,
an amount equal to 100% of Available Cash with respect to such period or Quarter
shall be distributed in accordance with this Article V by the Partnership to the
Partners in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests. The
immediately preceding sentence shall not require any distribution of cash if and
to the extent such distribution would be prohibited by applicable law or by any
loan agreement, security agreement, mortgage, debt instrument or other agreement
or obligation to which the Partnership is a party or by which it is bound or its
assets are subject.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of the dissolution and
liquidation of the Partnership, all proceeds of such liquidation shall be
applied and distributed in accordance with, and subject to the terms and
conditions of, Sections 13.3 and 13.4

ARTICLE VI
MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION OF BUSINESS

6.1 MANAGEMENT. (a) The General Partner shall conduct, direct and manage
all activities of the Partnership. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, all management powers over the business and affairs of the
Partnership shall be exclusively vested in the General Partner, and the Limited
Partner shall have no right of control or management power over the business and
affairs of the Partnership. In addition to the powers now or hereafter granted
a general partner of a limited partnership under applicable law or which are
granted to the General Partner under any other provision of this Agreement, the
General Partner, subject to Section 6.3, shall have full power and authority to

26
<PAGE>

do all things and on such terms as it, in its sole discretion, may deem
necessary or appropriate to conduct the business of the Partnership, to exercise
all powers set forth in Section 3.2 and to effectuate the purposes set forth in
Section 3.1, including, without limitation, (i) the making of any expenditures,
the lending or borrowing of money, the assumption or guarantee of, or other
contracting for, indebtedness and other liabilities, the issuance of evidences
of indebtedness and the incurring of any other obligations; (ii) the making of
tax, regulatory and other filings, or rendering of periodic or other reports to
governmental or other agencies having jurisdiction over the business or assets
of the Partnership; (iii) the acquisition, disposition, mortgage, pledge,
encumbrance, hypothecation or exchange of any or all of the assets of the
Partnership or the merger or other combination of the Partnership with or into
another Person (the matters described in this clause (iii) being subject,
however, to any prior approval that may be required by Section 6.3); (iv) the
use of the assets of the Partnership (including, without limitation, cash on
hand) for any purpose consistent with the terms of this Agreement, including,
without limitation, the financing of the conduct of the operations of the
Partnership, the lending of funds to other Persons (including, without
limitation, an OLP Subsidiary), the repayment of obligations of the Partnership
and the making of capital contributions to an OLP Subsidiary; (v) the
negotiation, execution and performance of any contracts, conveyances or other
instruments (including, without limitation, instruments that limit the liability
of the Partnership under contractual arrangements to all or particular assets of
the Partnership, with the other party to the contract to have no recourse
against the General Partner or its assets other than its interest in the
Partnership, even if same results in the terms of the transaction being less
favorable to the Partnership than would otherwise be the case); (vi) the
distribution of Partnership cash; (vii) the selection and dismissal of employees
and agents (including, without limitation, employees having titles such as
"president," "vice president," "secretary" and "treasurer") and agents, outside
attorneys, accountants, consultants and contractors and the determination of
their compensation and other terms of employment or hiring; (viii) the
maintenance of such insurance for the benefit of the Partnership and the
Partners (including, without limitation, the assets of the Partnership) as it
deems necessary or appropriate; (ix) the formation of, or acquisition of an
interest in, and the contribution of property and the making of loans to, any
further limited or general partnerships, joint ventures, corporations, limited
liability companies or other relationships; (x) the control of any matters
affecting the rights and obligations of the Partnership, including, without
limitation, the bringing and defending of actions at law or in equity and
otherwise engaging in the conduct of litigation and the incurring of legal
expense and the settlement of claims and litigation; and (xi) the
indemnification of any Person against liabilities and contingencies to the
extent permitted by law.

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the MLP
Agreement, the Delaware Act or any applicable law, rule or regulation, each of
the Partners hereby (i) approves, ratifies and confirms the execution, delivery
and performance by the parties thereto of the MLP Agreement, the Underwriting
Agreements, the Contribution Agreement, the agreements and other documents filed
as exhibits to the Registration Statements, and the other agreements described
in or filed as a part of the Registration Statements, and the engaging by any
Affiliate of the General Partner in business and activities (other than
Restricted Activities) that are in direct competition with the business and
activities of the MLP, the Partnership, any OLP Subsidiary and any MLP
Subsidiary; (ii) agrees that the General Partner (on its own or through any
officer of the Partnership) is authorized to execute, deliver and perform the
agreements referred to in clause (i) of this sentence and the other agreements,
acts, transactions and matters described in the Registration Statements on
behalf of the Partnership without any further act, approval or vote of the
Partners; and (iii) agrees that the execution, delivery or performance by the
General Partner, the MLP, the Partnership or any Affiliate of any of them of
this Agreement or any agreement authorized or permitted under this Agreement, or
the engaging by any Affiliate of the General Partner in any business and
activities (other than Restricted Activities) that are in direct competition
with the business and activities of the MLP, the Partnership, any OLP Subsidiary
and any MLP Subsidiary, shall not constitute a breach by the General Partner of
any duty that the General Partner may owe the Partnership or the Limited
Partners or any other Persons under this Agreement (or any other agreements) or
of any duty stated or implied by law or equity. The term

27
<PAGE>

"Affiliate" when used in this Section 6.1(b) with respect to the General Partner
shall not include the Partnership, the MLP, any OLP Subidiary or any MLP
Subsidiary.

6.2 CERTIFICATE OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP. The General Partner has caused
the Certificate of Limited Partnership of Ferrellgas, L.P. to be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as required by the Delaware Act and
shall use all reasonable efforts to cause to be filed such other certificates or
documents as may be determined by the General Partner in its sole discretion to
be reasonable and necessary or appropriate for the formation, continuation,
qualification and operation of a limited partnership (or a partnership in which
the Limited Partner has limited liability) in the State of Delaware or any other
state in which the Partnership may elect to do business or own property. To the
extent that such action is determined by the General Partner in its sole
discretion to be reasonable and necessary or appropriate, the General Partner
shall file amendments to and restatements of the Certificate of Limited
Partnership and do all things to maintain the Partnership as a limited
partnership (or a partnership in which the Limited Partner has limited
liability) under the laws of the State of Delaware or of any other state in
which the Partnership may elect to do business or own property. Subject to the
terms of Section 7.4(a), the General Partner shall not be required, before or
after filing, to deliver or mail a copy of the Certificate of Limited
Partnership, any qualification document or any amendment thereto to the Limited
Partner.

6.3 RESTRICTIONS ON GENERAL PARTNER'S AUTHORITY. (a) The General Partner
may not, without written approval of the specific act by the Limited Partner or
by other written instrument executed and delivered by the Limited Partner
subsequent to the date of this Agreement, take any action in contravention of
this Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) any act that would make it
impossible to carry on the ordinary business of the Partnership, except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement; (ii) possess Partnership property, or
assign any rights in specific Partnership property, for other than a Partnership
purpose; (iii) admit a Person as a Partner, except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement; (iv) amend this Agreement in any manner, except as otherwise provided
in this Agreement; or (v) transfer its interest as general partner of the
Partnership, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

(b) Except as provided in Articles XIII and XV, the General Partner may not
sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the
Partnership's assets in a single transaction or a series of related transactions
without the approval of the Limited Partner; provided, however, that this
provision shall not preclude or limit the General Partner's ability to mortgage,
pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in all or substantially all of
the Partnership's assets and shall not apply to any forced sale of any or all of
the Partnership's assets pursuant to the foreclosure of, or other realization
upon, any such encumbrance.

(c) Unless approved by the Limited Partner, the General Partner shall not
take any action or refuse to take any reasonable action the effect of which, if
taken or not taken, as the case may be, would be to cause the Partnership to be
treated as an association taxable as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as
an entity for federal income tax purposes; provided that this Section 6.3(c)
shall not be construed to apply to amendments to this Agreement (which are
governed by Article XIV) or mergers or consolidations of the Partnership with
any Person (which are governed by Article XV).

(d) At all times while serving as the general partner of the Partnership,
the General Partner shall not (except as provided below) make any dividend or
distribution on, or repurchase any shares of, its stock or take any other action
within its control unless it shall first receive an Opinion of Counsel that the
effect of such dividend, distribution, repurchase or other action would not
reduce its net worth below an amount such that the Partnership will be treated
as an association taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes;
provided, however, to the extent the General Partner receives distributions of
cash from the Partnership or any other partnership of which the Partnership is,
directly or indirectly,

28
<PAGE>

a partner, the General Partner shall not use such cash to make any dividend or
distribution on, or repurchase any shares of, its stock or take any other action
within its control if the effect of such dividend, distribution, repurchase or
other action would be to reduce its net worth below an amount necessary to
receive an Opinion of Counsel that the Partnership will be treated as a
partnership for federal income tax purposes.

6.4 REIMBURSEMENT OF THE GENERAL PARTNER. (a) Except as provided in this
Section 6.4 and elsewhere in this Agreement, the General Partner shall not be
compensated for its services as general partner of the Partnership.

(b) The General Partner shall be reimbursed on a monthly basis, or such
other basis as the General Partner may determine in its sole discretion, for (i)
all direct and indirect expenses it incurs or payments it makes on behalf of the
Partnership (including, without limitation, salary, bonus, incentive
compensation and other amounts paid to any Person to perform services for the
Partnership or for the General Partner in the discharge of its duties to the
Partnership) and (ii) all other necessary or appropriate expenses allocable to
the Partnership or otherwise reasonably incurred by the General Partner in
connection with operating the Partnership's business (including, without
limitation, expenses allocated to the General Partner by its Affiliates). The
General Partner shall determine the fees and expenses that are allocable to the
Partnership in any reasonable manner determined by the General Partner in its
sole discretion. Reimbursements pursuant to this Section 6.4 shall be in
addition to any reimbursement to the General Partner as a result of
indemnification pursuant to Section 6.7.

6.5 OUTSIDE ACTIVITIES. (a) After the Closing Date, the General Partner,
for so long as it is the general partner of the Partnership, (i) agrees that its
sole business will be to act as the general partner of the Partnership, the MLP,
any OLP Subsidiary and any MLP Subsidiary and to undertake activities that are
ancillary or related thereto (including being a limited partner in the MLP),
(ii) shall not enter into or conduct any business or incur any debts or
liabilities except in connection with or incidental to (A) its performance of
the activities required or authorized by this Agreement or the MLP Agreement or
described in or contemplated by the Registration Statements and (B) the
acquisition, ownership or disposition of partnership interests in the
Partnership, the MLP, any OLP Subsidiary and any MLP Subsidiary, except that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, employees of the General Partner may perform
services for Ferrell and its Affiliates and (iii) shall not and shall cause its
Affiliates not to engage in any Restricted Activities.

(b) Except as described or provided for in the MLP Agreement, the
Registration Statements or Section 6.5(a), no Indemnitee shall be expressly or
implicitly restricted or proscribed pursuant to the MLP Agreement or this
Agreement or the partnership relationship established hereby or thereby from
engaging in other activities for profit, whether in the businesses engaged in by
the Partnership, an OLP Subsidiary, the MLP or an MLP Subsidiary or anticipated
to be engaged in by the Partnership, an OLP Subsidiary, the MLP, an MLP
Subsidiary or otherwise, including, without limitation, in the case of any
Affiliates of the General Partner those businesses and activities (other than
Restricted Activities) in direct competition with the business and activities of
the Partnership, the MLP, an OLP Subsidiary or an MLP Subsidiary or otherwise
described in or contemplated by the Registration Statements. Without limitation
of and subject to the foregoing each Indemnitee (other than the General Partner)
shall have the right to engage in businesses of every type and description and
to engage in and possess an interest in other business ventures of any and every
type or description, independently or with others, including, without
limitation, in the case of any Affiliates of the General Partner, business
interests and activities (other than Restricted Activities) in direct
competition with the business and activities of the Partnership, the MLP, an OLP
Subsidiary or an MLP Subsidiary, and none of the same shall constitute a breach
of this Agreement or any duty to the Partnership, the MLP or any Partners.
Neither the Partnership, the MLP, any Limited Partner nor any other Person shall
have any rights by virtue of this Agreement or the MLP Agreement or the
partnership relationship established hereby or thereby in any business ventures
of any

29
<PAGE>

Indemnitee (subject, in the case of the General Partner, to compliance with
Section 6.5(c)) and such Indemnitees shall have no obligation to offer any
interest in any such business ventures to the Partnership, the MLP, any Limited
Partner or any other Person.

(c) Subject to the terms of Sections 6.5(a) and (b) but otherwise
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) the competitive
activities of any Indemnitees (other than the General Partner) are hereby
approved by the Partnership and all Partners and (ii) it shall be deemed not to
be a breach of the General Partner's fiduciary duty or any other obligation of
any type whatsoever of the General Partner for the General Partner to permit an
Affiliate of the General Partner to engage, or for any such Affiliate to engage,
in business interests or activities (other than Restricted Activities) in
preference to or to the exclusion of the Partnership.

(d) The term "Affiliates" when used in this Section 6.5 with respect to the
General Partner shall not include the Partnership, the MLP, an OLP Subsidiary or
an MLP Subsidiary.

6.6 LOANS TO AND FROM THE GENERAL PARTNER; CONTRACTS WITH AFFILIATES. (a)
(i) The General Partner, the Limited Partner, an OLP Subsidiary or any of their
Affiliates may lend to the Partnership, and the Partnership may borrow, funds
needed or desired by the Partnership for such periods of time as the General
Partner may determine and (ii) the General Partner, the Limited Partner, an OLP
Subsidiary or any Affiliate thereof may borrow from the Partnership, and the
Partnership may lend to such Persons, excess funds of the Partnership for such
periods of time and in such amounts as the General Partner may determine;
provided, however, that in either such case the lending party may not charge the
borrowing party interest at a rate greater than the rate that would be charged
the borrowing party (without reference to the lending party's financial
abilities or guarantees) by unrelated lenders on comparable loans. The
borrowing party shall reimburse the lending party for any costs (other than any
additional interest costs) incurred by the lending party in connection with the
borrowing of such funds. For purposes of this Section 6.6(a) and Section
6.6(b), the term "Partnership" shall include any Affiliate of the Partnership
that is controlled by the Partnership.

(b) The General Partner may itself, or may enter into an agreement with any
of its Affiliates to, render services to the Partnership or to the General
Partner in the discharge of its duties as general partner of the Partnership.
Any service rendered to the Partnership by the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates shall be on terms that are fair and reasonable to the Partnership;
provided, however, that the requirements of this Section 6.6(b) shall be deemed
satisfied as to (i) any transaction approved by Special Approval, (ii) any
transaction the terms of which are no less favorable to the Partnership than
those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or
(iii) any transaction that, taking into account the totality of the
relationships between the parties involved (including other transactions that
may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the Partnership), is equitable
to the Partnership. The provisions of Section 6.4 shall apply to the rendering
of services described in this Section 6.6(b).

(c) The Partnership may transfer assets to joint ventures, other
partnerships, corporations, limited liability companies or other business
entities in which it is or thereby becomes a participant upon such terms and
subject to such conditions as are consistent with this Agreement and applicable
law.

(d) Neither the General Partner nor any of its Affiliates shall sell,
transfer or convey any property to, or purchase any property from, the
Partnership, directly or indirectly, except pursuant to transactions that are
fair and reasonable to the Partnership; provided, however, that the requirements
of this Section 6.6(d) shall be deemed to be satisfied as to (i) the
transactions effected pursuant to Sections 4.2, the Contribution Agreement and
any other transactions described in or contemplated by the Registration
Statements, (ii) any transaction approved by Special Approval, (iii) any
transaction the terms of which are no less favorable to the Partnership than
those generally being provided to or

30
<PAGE>

available from unrelated third parties or (iv) any transaction that, taking into
account the totality of the relationships between the parties involved
(including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous
to the Partnership), is equitable to the Partnership.

(e) The General Partner and its Affiliates will have no obligation to
permit the Partnership, an OLP Subsidiary or the MLP to use any facilities or
assets of the General Partner and its Affiliates, except as may be provided in
contracts entered into from time to time specifically dealing with such use, nor
shall there be any obligation on the part of the General Partner or its
Affiliates to enter into such contracts.

(f) Without limitation of Sections 6.6(a) through 6.6(e), and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the existence of the
conflicts of interest described in the Registration Statements are hereby
approved by all Partners.

6.7 INDEMNIFICATION. (a) To the fullest extent permitted by law but
subject to the limitations expressly provided in this Agreement, the General
Partner, any Departing Partner, any Person who is or was an officer or director
of the Partnership, the General Partner or any Departing Partner and all other
Indemnitees shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Partnership from and
against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, joint or several,
expenses (including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses), judgments,
fines, penalties, interest, settlements and other amounts arising from any and
all claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, in which any Indemnitee may be involved, or is
threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of its status as
(i) the General Partner, a Departing Partner or any of their Affiliates, (ii) an
officer, director, employee, partner, agent or trustee of the Partnership, the
General Partner, any Departing Partner or any of their Affiliates or (iii) a
Person serving at the request of the Partnership in another entity in a similar
capacity, provided, that in each case the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in
a manner which such Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to,
the best interests of the Partnership and, with respect to any criminal
proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe its conduct was unlawful;
provided, further, no indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall be
available to the General Partner with respect to its obligations incurred
pursuant to the Contribution Agreement (other than obligations incurred by the
General Partner on behalf of the Partnership or the MLP). The termination of
any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or
upon a plea of nolo contendere, or its equivalent, shall not create a
presumption that the Indemnitee acted in a manner contrary to that specified
above. Any indemnification pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall be made only out
of the assets of the Partnership, it being agreed that the General Partner shall
not be personally liable for such indemnification and shall have no obligation
to contribute or loan any monies or property to the Partnership to enable it to
effectuate such indemnification.

(b) To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including, without
limitation, legal fees and expenses) incurred by an Indemnitee who is
indemnified pursuant to Section 6.7(a) in defending any claim, demand, action,
suit or proceeding shall, from time to time, be advanced by the Partnership
prior to the final disposition of such claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding
upon receipt by the Partnership of an undertaking by or on behalf of the
Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall be determined that the Indemnitee is
not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Section 6.7.

(c) The indemnification provided by this Section 6.7 shall be in addition
to any other rights to which an Indemnitee may be entitled under any agreement,
pursuant to any vote of the Partners, as a matter of law or otherwise, both as
to actions in the Indemnitee's capacity as (i) the General Partner, a Departing
Partner or an Affiliate thereof, (ii) an officer, director, employee, partner,
agent or trustee of the Partnership, the General Partner, any Departing Partner
or an Affiliate thereof or (iii) a Person serving at the request of the
Partnership in another entity in a similar capacity, and as to actions in any
other capacity (including, without limitation, any capacity under the
Underwriting Agreements), and shall

31
<PAGE>

continue as to an Indemnitee who has ceased to serve in such capacity and shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns and administrators of the
Indemnitee.

(d) The Partnership may purchase and maintain (or reimburse the General
Partner or its Affiliates for the cost of) insurance, on behalf of the General
Partner and such other Persons as the General Partner shall determine, against
any liability that may be asserted against or expense that may be incurred by
such Person in connection with the Partnership's activities, regardless of
whether the Partnership would have the power to indemnify such Person against
such liability under the provisions of this Agreement.

(e) For purposes of this Section 6.7, the Partnership shall be deemed to
have requested an Indemnitee to serve as fiduciary of an employee benefit plan
whenever the performance by it of its duties to the Partnership also imposes
duties on, or otherwise involves services by, it to the plan or participants or
beneficiaries of the plan; excise taxes assessed on an Indemnitee with respect
to an employee benefit plan pursuant to applicable law shall constitute "fines"
within the meaning of Section 6.7(a); and action taken or omitted by it with
respect to an employee benefit plan in the performance of its duties for a
purpose reasonably believed by it to be in the interest of the participants and
beneficiaries of the plan shall be deemed to be for a purpose which is in, or
not opposed to, the best interests of the Partnership.

(f) In no event may an Indemnitee subject the Limited Partner to personal
liability by reason of the indemnification provisions set forth in this
Agreement.

(g) An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part
under this Section 6.7 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction
with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was
otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

(h) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are for the benefit of the
Indemnitees, their heirs, successors, assigns and administrators and shall not
be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons.

(i) No amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 6.7 or any
provision hereof shall in any manner terminate, reduce or impair the right of
any past, present or future Indemnitee to be indemnified by the Partnership, nor
the obligation of the Partnership to indemnify any such Indemnitee under and in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.7 as in effect immediately
prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to claims arising
from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior to such
amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may arise or
be asserted.

6.8 LIABILITY OF INDEMNITEES. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, no Indemnitee shall be liable for monetary
damages to the Partnership, the Limited Partner, or any other Persons who have
acquired interests in the Partnership, for losses sustained or liabilities
incurred as a result of any act or omission if such Indemnitee acted in good
faith.

(b) Subject to its obligations and duties as General Partner set forth in
Section 6.1(a), the General Partner may exercise any of the powers granted to it
by this Agreement and perform any of the duties imposed upon it hereunder either
directly or by or through its agents, and the General Partner shall not be
responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the part of any such agent
appointed by the General Partner in good faith.

(c) Any amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 6.8 or any
provision hereof shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the
limitations on the liability to the Partnership and

32
<PAGE>

the Limited Partner of the General Partner, its directors, officers and
employees and any other Indemnitees under this Section 6.8 as in effect
immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with respect to
claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or in part, prior
to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when such claims may
arise or be asserted.

6.9 RESOLUTION OF CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. (a) Unless otherwise expressly
provided in this Agreement or the MLP Agreement, whenever a potential conflict
of interest exists or arises between the General Partner or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Partnership, the MLP or the Limited
Partner, on the other hand, any resolution or course of action in respect of
such conflict of interest shall be permitted and deemed approved by the Limited
Partner, and shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement, of the MLP
Agreement or of any agreement contemplated herein or therein, or of any duty
stated or implied by law or equity, if the resolution or course of action is, or
by operation of this Agreement is deemed to be, fair and reasonable to the
Partnership. The General Partner shall be authorized but not required in
connection with its resolution of such conflict of interest to seek Special
Approval of a resolution of such conflict or course of action. Any conflict of
interest and any resolution of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively
deemed fair and reasonable to the Partnership if such conflict of interest or
resolution is (i) approved by Special Approval, (ii) on terms no less favorable
to the Partnership than those generally being provided to or available from
unrelated third parties or (iii) fair to the Partnership, taking into account
the totality of the relationships between the parties involved (including other
transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to the
Partnership). The General Partner may also adopt a resolution or course of
action that has not received Special Approval. The General Partner (including
the Audit Committee in connection with Special Approval) shall be authorized in
connection with its determination of what is "fair and reasonable" to the
Partnership and in connection with its resolution of any conflict of interest to
consider (A) the relative interests of any party to such conflict, agreement,
transaction or situation and the benefits and burdens relating to such interest;
(B) any customary or accepted industry practices and any customary or historical
dealings with a particular Person; (C) any applicable generally accepted
accounting or engineering practices or principles; and (D) such additional
factors as the General Partner (including such Audit Committee) determines in
its sole discretion to be relevant, reasonable or appropriate under the
circumstances. Nothing contained in this Agreement, however, is intended to nor
shall it be construed to require the General Partner (including such Audit
Committee) to consider the interests of any Person other than the Partnership.
In the absence of bad faith by the General Partner, the resolution, action or
terms so made, taken or provided by the General Partner with respect to such
matter shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement, the MLP Agreement or any
other agreement contemplated herein or a breach of any standard of care or duty
imposed herein or therein or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule or
regulation.

(b) Whenever this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby
provides that the General Partner or any of its Affiliates is permitted or
required to make a decision (i) in its "sole discretion" or "discretion," that
it deems "necessary or appropriate" or under a grant of similar authority or
latitude, the General Partner or such Affiliate shall be entitled to consider
only such interests and factors as it desires and shall have no duty or
obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting,
the Partnership, the MLP, an OLP Subsidiary, the Limited Partner or any limited
partner in the MLP, (ii) it may make such decision in its sole discretion
(regardless of whether there is a reference to "sole discretion" or
"discretion") unless another express standard is provided for, or (iii) in "good
faith" or under another express standard, the General Partner or such Affiliate
shall act under such express standard and shall not be subject to any other or
different standards imposed by this Agreement, the MLP Agreement, any other
agreement contemplated hereby or under the Delaware Act or any other law, rule
or regulation. In addition, any actions taken by the General Partner or such
Affiliate consistent with the standards of "reasonable discretion" set forth in
the definition of Available Cash shall not constitute a breach of any duty of
the General Partner to the Partnership or the Limited Partner. The General
Partner shall have no duty, express or implied, to sell or otherwise dispose of
any

33
<PAGE>

asset of the Partnership or of an OLP Subsidiary, other than in the ordinary
course of business. No borrowing by the Partnership or the approval thereof by
the General Partner shall be deemed to constitute a breach of any duty of the
General Partner to the Partnership or the Limited Partner by reason of the fact
that the purpose or effect of such borrowing is directly or indirectly to (A)
enable the holders of IDRs to receive distributions under the MLP Agreement or
increase the amount of any such distributions, (B) hasten the termination of the
"Subordination Period" under the MLP Agreement or (C) reduce the "Cumulative
Common Unit Arrearage" under the MLP Agreement in order to hasten the conversion
of the "Subordinated Units" in the MLP into Common Units.

(c) Whenever a particular transaction, arrangement or resolution of a
conflict of interest is required under this Agreement to be "fair and
reasonable" to any Person, the fair and reasonable nature of such transaction,
arrangement or resolution shall be considered in the context of all similar or
related transactions.

6.10 OTHER MATTERS CONCERNING THE GENERAL PARTNER. (a) The General
Partner may rely and shall be protected in acting or refraining from acting upon
any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,
request, consent, order, bond, debenture, or other paper or document believed by
it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party or
parties.

(b) The General Partner may consult with legal counsel, accountants,
appraisers, management consultants, investment bankers and other consultants and
advisers selected by it, and any act taken or omitted to be taken in reliance
upon the opinion (including, without limitation, an Opinion of Counsel) of such
Persons as to matters that such General Partner reasonably believes to be within
such Person's professional or expert competence shall be conclusively presumed
to have been done or omitted in good faith and in accordance with such opinion.

(c) The General Partner shall have the right, in respect of any of its
powers or obligations hereunder, to act through any of its duly authorized
officers and a duly appointed attorney or attorneys-in-fact. Each such attorney
shall, to the extent provided by the General Partner in the power of attorney,
have full power and authority to do and perform each and every act and duty that
is permitted or required to be done by the General Partner hereunder.

(d) Any standard of care and duty imposed by this Agreement or under the
Delaware Act or any applicable law, rule or regulation shall be modified, waived
or limited as required to permit the General Partner to act under this Agreement
or any other agreement contemplated by this Agreement and to make any decision
pursuant to the authority prescribed in this Agreement so long as such action is
not reasonably believed by the General Partner to be in, or not inconsistent
with, the best interests of the Partnership.

6.11 TITLE TO PARTNERSHIP ASSETS. Title to Partnership assets, whether
real, personal or mixed and whether tangible or intangible, shall be deemed to
be owned by the Partnership as an entity, and no Partner, individually or
collectively, shall have any ownership interest in such Partnership assets or
any portion thereof. Title to any or all of the Partnership assets may be held
in the name of the Partnership, the General Partner, one or more of its
Affiliates or one or more nominees, as the General Partner may determine. The
General Partner hereby declares and warrants that any Partnership assets for
which record title is held in the name of the General Partner or one or more of
its Affiliates or one or more nominees shall be held by the General Partner or
such Affiliate or nominee for the use and benefit of the Partnership in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement; provided, however, that the
General Partner shall use its reasonable efforts to cause record title to such
assets (other than those assets in respect of which the General Partner
determines that the expense and difficulty of conveyancing makes transfer of
record title to the Partnership impracticable) to be vested in the Partnership
as soon as reasonably practicable; provided that, prior to the withdrawal or
removal of the

34
<PAGE>

General Partner or as soon thereafter as practicable, the General Partner shall
use reasonable efforts to effect the transfer of record title to the Partnership
and, prior to any such transfer, will provide for the use of such assets in a
manner satisfactory to the Partnership. All Partnership assets shall be
recorded as the property of the Partnership in its books and records,
irrespective of the name in which record title to such Partnership assets is
held.

6.12 RELIANCE BY THIRD PARTIES. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, any Person dealing with the Partnership shall be entitled to
assume that the General Partner has full power and authority to encumber, sell
or otherwise use in any manner any and all assets of the Partnership and to
enter into any contracts on behalf of the Partnership, and such Person shall be
entitled to deal with the General Partner as if it were the Partnership's sole
party in interest, both legally and beneficially. The Limited Partner hereby
waives any and all defenses or other remedies that may be available against such
Person to contest, negate or disaffirm any action of the General Partner in
connection with any such dealing. In no event shall any Person dealing with the
General Partner or its representatives be obligated to ascertain that the terms
of this Agreement have been complied with or to inquire into the necessity or
expedience of any act or action of the General Partner or its representatives.
Each and every certificate, document or other instrument executed on behalf of
the Partnership by the General Partner or its representatives shall be
conclusive evidence in favor of any and every Person relying thereon or claiming
thereunder that (a) at the time of the execution and delivery of such
certificate, document or instrument, this Agreement was in full force and
effect, (b) the Person executing and delivering such certificate, document or
instrument was duly authorized and empowered to do so for and on behalf of the
Partnership and (c) such certificate, document or instrument was duly executed
and delivered in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Agreement and
is binding upon the Partnership.

shall not participate in the operation, management or control (within the
meaning of the Delaware Act) of the Partnership's business, transact any
business in the Partnership's name or have the power to sign documents for or
otherwise bind the Partnership. The transaction of any such business by the
Partnership, the General Partner, any of its Affiliates or any officer,
director, employee, partner, agent or trustee of the General Partner or any of
its Affiliates, in its capacity as such, shall not affect, impair or eliminate
the limitations on the liability of the Limited Partner under this Agreement.

7.3 RETURN OF CAPITAL. The Limited Partner shall not be entitled to the
withdrawal or return of its Capital Contribution, except to the extent, if any,
that distributions made pursuant to this Agreement or upon termination of the
Partnership may be considered as such by law and then only to the extent
provided for in this Agreement.

7.4 RIGHTS OF THE LIMITED PARTNER RELATING TO THE PARTNERSHIP. (a) In
addition to other rights provided by this Agreement or by applicable law, and
except as limited by Section 7.4(b), the Limited Partner shall have the right,

partner in the Partnership, upon reasonable demand and at the Limited Partner's
own expense:

(i) to obtain true and full information regarding the status of the
business and financial condition of the Partnership;

35
<PAGE>

(ii) promptly after becoming available, to obtain a copy of the

regulations thereunder. The General Partner shall have the right to seek to

Opinion of Counsel would otherwise be required to the effect that an action will
not cause the Partnership to become so treated as an association taxable as a

such requirement for an Opinion of Counsel shall be deemed automatically waived.

ending at 12:00 Midnight, Central Standard Time, on July 31, 2004 the
General Partner voluntarily withdraws by giving at least 90 days' advance
notice of its intention to withdraw to the Limited Partner, provided, that
prior to the effective date of such withdrawal the Limited Partner approves
such withdrawal and the General Partner delivers to the Partnership an
Opinion of Counsel ("WITHDRAWAL OPINION OF COUNSEL") that such withdrawal

General Partner of the Partnership and such successor shall, upon admission

required to be converted into Common Units pursuant to Section 13.3(b) of the
MLP Agreement) be purchased by the successor to the Departing Partner for cash
in the manner specified in the MLP Agreement. Such purchase (or conversion into
Common Units, as applicable) shall be a condition to the admission to the

upon:

(a) the expiration of its term as provided in Section 1.5;

(b) an Event of Withdrawal of the General Partner as provided in

Upon (a) dissolution of the Partnership following an Event of Withdrawal caused
by the withdrawal or removal of the General Partner as provided in Section
12.1(a)(i) or (iii) and following a failure of the Limited Partner to appoint a
successor General Partner as provided in Section 12.1 or 12.2, then within 90
days thereafter or (b) dissolution of the Partnership upon an event constituting
an Event of Withdrawal as defined in Section 12.1(a)(v), (vi) or (vii), then
within 180 days thereafter, the Limited Partner may elect to reconstitute the
Partnership and continue its business on the same terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement by forming a new limited partnership on terms identical to
those set forth in this Agreement and having as a general partner a Person
approved by the Limited Partner. In addition, upon dissolution of the
Partnership pursuant to Section 13.1(f), if the MLP is reconstituted pursuant to
Section 14.2 of the MLP Agreement, the reconstituted MLP may, within 180 days
after such event of dissolution, as the Limited Partner, elect to reconstitute
the Partnership in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence. Upon any
such election by the Limited Partner, all Partners shall be bound thereby and
shall be deemed to have approved same. Unless such an election is made within
the applicable time period as set forth above, the Partnership shall conduct
only activities necessary to wind up its affairs. If such an election is so
made, then:

(i) the reconstituted Partnership shall continue until the end of the
term set forth in Section 1.5 unless earlier dissolved in accordance with
this Article XIII;

(ii) if the successor General Partner is not the former General
Partner, then the interest of the former General Partner shall be purchased
by the successor General Partner or converted into Common Units of the MLP
as provided in the MLP Agreement; and

(iii) all necessary steps shall be taken to cancel this Agreement and
the Certificate of Limited Partnership and to enter into and, as necessary,
to file a new partnership agreement and certificate of limited partnership,
and the successor General Partner may for this purpose exercise the powers
of attorney granted the General Partner pursuant to Section 1.4; provided,
that the right to approve a successor General Partner and to reconstitute
and to continue the business of the Partnership shall not exist and may not
be exercised unless the Partnership has received an Opinion of Counsel that
(x) the exercise of the right would not result in the loss of limited
liability of the Limited Partner and (y) neither the Partnership nor the
reconstituted limited partnership would be treated as an association
taxable as a corporation or otherwise be taxable as an entity for federal
income tax purposes upon the exercise of such right to continue.

13.3 LIQUIDATION. Upon dissolution of the Partnership, unless the
Partnership is continued under an election to reconstitute and continue the
Partnership pursuant to Section 13.2, the General Partner, or in the event the
General Partner has been dissolved or removed, become bankrupt as set forth in
Section 12.1 or withdrawn from the Partnership, a liquidator or liquidating
committee approved by the Limited Partner, shall be the Liquidator. The
Liquidator (if other than the General Partner) shall be entitled to receive such
compensation for its services as may be approved by the Limited Partner. The
Liquidator shall agree not to resign at any time without 15 days' prior notice
and (if other than the General Partner) may be removed at any time, with or
without cause, by notice of removal approved by the Limited Partner. Upon
dissolution, removal or resignation of the Liquidator, a successor and
substitute Liquidator (who shall have and succeed to all rights, powers and
duties of the original Liquidator) shall within 30 days thereafter be approved
by the Limited Partner. The right to approve a successor or substitute
Liquidator in the manner provided herein shall be deemed to refer also to any

42
<PAGE>

such successor or substitute Liquidator approved in the manner herein provided.
Except as expressly provided in this Article XIII, the Liquidator approved in
the manner provided herein shall have and may exercise, without further
authorization or consent of any of the parties hereto, all of the powers
conferred upon the General Partner under the terms of this Agreement (but
subject to all of the applicable limitations, contractual and otherwise, upon
the exercise of such powers, other than the limitation on sale set forth in
Section 6.3(b)) to the extent necessary or desirable in the good faith judgment
of the Liquidator to carry out the duties and functions of the Liquidator
hereunder for and during such period of time as shall be reasonably required in
the good faith judgment of the Liquidator to complete the winding-up and
liquidation of the Partnership as provided for herein. The Liquidator shall
liquidate the assets of the Partnership, and apply and distribute the proceeds
of such liquidation in the following order of priority, unless otherwise
required by mandatory provisions of applicable law:

(a) the payment to creditors of the Partnership, including, without
limitation, Partners who are creditors, in the order of priority provided
by law; and the creation of a reserve of cash or other assets of the
Partnership for contingent liabilities in an amount, if any, determined by
the Liquidator to be appropriate for such purposes; and

(b) to all Partners in accordance with the positive balances in their
respective Capital Accounts, as determined after taking into account all
Capital Account adjustments (other than those made by reason of this
clause) for the taxable year of the Partnership during which the
liquidation of the Partnership occurs (with the date of such occurrence
being determined pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.704-
1(b)(2)(ii)(g)); and such distribution shall be made by the end of such
taxable year (or, if later, within 90 days after said date of such
occurrence).

13.4 DISTRIBUTIONS IN KIND. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
13.3, which require the liquidation of the assets of the Partnership, but
subject to the order of priorities set forth therein, if prior to or upon
dissolution of the Partnership the Liquidator determines that an immediate sale
of part or all of the Partnership's assets would be impractical or would cause
undue loss to the Partners, the Liquidator may, in its absolute discretion,
defer for a reasonable time the liquidation of any assets except those necessary
to satisfy liabilities of the Partnership (including, without limitation, those
to Partners as creditors) and/or distribute to the Partners or to specific
classes of Partners, in lieu of cash, as tenants in common and in accordance
with the provisions of Section 13.3, undivided interests in such Partnership
assets as the Liquidator deems not suitable for liquidation. Any such
distributions in kind shall be made only if, in the good faith judgment of the
Liquidator, such distributions in kind are in the best interest of the Limited
Partner, and shall be subject to such conditions relating to the disposition and
management of such properties as the Liquidator deems reasonable and equitable
and to any agreements governing the operation of such properties at such time.
The Liquidator shall determine the fair market value of any property distributed
in kind using such reasonable method of valuation as it may adopt.

(b) In accordance with Section 704(c)(1)(B) of the Code, in the case of any
deemed distribution occurring as a result of a termination of the Partnership
pursuant to Section 708(b)(1)(B) of the Code, to the maximum extent possible
consistent with the priorities of Section 13.3, the General Partner shall have
sole discretion to treat the deemed distribution of Partnership assets to
Partners as occurring in a manner that will not cause a shift of the Book-Tax
Disparity attributable to a Partnership asset existing immediately prior to the
deemed distribution to another asset upon the deemed contribution of assets to
the reconstituted Partnership, including, without limitation, deeming the
distribution of any Partnership assets to be made either to the Partner who
contributed such assets or to the transferee of such Partner.

13.5 CANCELLATION OF CERTIFICATE OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP. Upon the
completion of the distribution of Partnership cash and property as provided in
Sections 13.3 and 13.4 in connection with the

43
<PAGE>

liquidation of the Partnership, the Partnership shall be terminated and the
Certificate of Limited Partnership and all qualifications of the Partnership as
a foreign limited partnership in jurisdictions other than the State of Delaware
shall be cancelled and such other actions as may be necessary to terminate the
Partnership shall be taken.

13.6 REASONABLE TIME FOR WINDING UP. A reasonable time shall be allowed
for the orderly winding up of business and affairs of the Partnership and the
liquidation of its assets pursuant to Section 13.3 in order to minimize any
losses otherwise attendant upon such winding up, and the provisions of this
Agreement shall remain in effect between the Partners during the period of
liquidation.

13.7 RETURN OF CAPITAL. The General Partner shall not be personally liable
for, and shall have no obligation to contribute or loan any monies or property
to the Partnership to enable it to effectuate, the return of the Capital
Contributions of the Limited Partner, or any portion thereof, it being expressly
understood that any such return shall be made solely from Partnership assets.

13.8 CAPITAL ACCOUNT RESTORATION. No Limited Partner shall have any
obligation to restore any negative balance in its Capital Account upon
liquidation of the Partnership. The General Partner shall be obligated to
restore any negative balance in its Capital Account upon liquidation of its
interest in the Partnership by the end of the taxable year of the Partnership
during which such liquidation occurs, or, if later, within 90 days after the
date of such liquidation.

13.9 WAIVER OF PARTITION. Each Partner hereby waives any right to
partition of the Partnership property.

Effective Amount of Facility B Takeout Loans exceeds the Facility B Maximum
Amount, then the Borrower shall immediately, and without notice or demand,
prepay the outstanding principal amount of the Facility B Takeout Loans in an
aggregate amount equal to such excess, in the inverse order of maturity.

(c) If on any date, (x) the sum of (i) aggregate Net Proceeds from
MLP New Unit Sales from the Closing Date through such date plus (ii) aggregate
Net Proceeds of Asset Sales during the period from the Closing Date through the
date that is 270 days prior to such date, exceeds (y) the aggregate Cash Costs
of Permitted Acquisitions during the period from the Closing Date through such
date plus aggregate Growth-Related Capital Expenditures of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries during such period (any such excess being referred to herein as a
"Downsize

38
<PAGE>

Amount"), then (A) if such date is on or prior to the Revolving Termination Date
and after giving effect to any mandatory Cash Collateralization or prepayment of
outstanding Facility B Revolving Loans under subsection 2.07(b) above, the
Borrower shall immediately, and without notice or demand, prepay the Obligations
in an aggregate amount equal to the Downsize Amount as follows: first, Facility
B Term Loans, second, Swingline Loans, third, Facility A Revolving Loans, and
fourth, L/C Obligations; and (B) if such date is after the Revolving Termination
Date, the Borrower shall immediately, and without notice or demand, prepay
payments due under the Facility B Takeout Loan in an aggregate amount equal to
the Downsize Amount, in the inverse order of maturity.

(d) In the event that prior to the Revolving Termination Date any
portion of the Downsize Amount remains after the Facility B Maximum Amount has
been reduced to zero, the Facility A Commitment shall be automatically reduced
by an aggregate amount equal to such remaining portion of the Downsize Amount.

(e) The Borrower shall immediately, and without notice or demand,
prepay the Obligations in full, including, without limitation, the aggregate
principal amount of all outstanding Loans, all accrued and unpaid interest
thereon and all amounts payable under Section 4.04 hereof, and all of the
Commitments shall be automatically reduced to zero, in each case on the 30th day
after any Change in Control shall have occurred and be continuing.

(f) If and to the extent that the Facility A Commitment and the
Facility B Revolving Commitment are not equal to zero on the Revolving
Termination Date, each such amount shall be automatically reduced to zero on the
Revolving Termination Date.

2.08 Repayment.

(a) Facility A Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans. The Borrower
shall repay to the Banks in full on the Revolving Termination Date the aggregate
principal amount of Facility A Revolving Loans outstanding on such date together
with all accrued and unpaid interest thereon. The Borrower shall repay to BofA
in full on the Revolving Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of
Swingline Loans outstanding on such date, together with all accrued and unpaid
interest thereon.

(b) Facility B Term Loans and Facility B Revolving Loans. Subject to
the provisions of subsection 2.08(c), the Borrower shall repay in full on the
Revolving Termination Date the aggregate principal amount of Facility B Term
Loans and Facility B Revolving Loans outstanding on such date together with all
accrued and unpaid interest thereon.

39
<PAGE>

(c) Facility B Takeout Loans. At the Borrower's option, to be
exercised by the giving of an appropriate Notice of Borrowing to the Agent in
the manner set forth herein and subject to the conditions set forth in
subsection 2.01(b)(iii), the Borrower may request the Banks to make Facility B
Takeout Loans to the Borrower on the Revolving Termination Date in repayment of
up to all of the aggregate principal amount of Facility B Term Loans and
Facility B Revolving Loans outstanding on such date. If and to the extent that
the Borrower shall have borrowed the Facility B Takeout Loan on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, the Borrower shall repay the
aggregate principal amount of the Facility B Takeout Loan in twelve (12) equal
quarterly installments commencing on September 30, 1997, and continuing on the
last day of every third calendar month thereafter through June 30, 2000;
provided, that all outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid interest on the
Facility B Takeout Loans shall be repaid in full on or prior to June 30, 2000.

2.09 Interest. (a) Each Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding
principal amount thereof from the applicable Borrowing Date at a rate per annum
equal to the Eurodollar Rate (other than with respect to Swingline Loans) or the
Base Rate, as the case may be (and subject to the Borrower's right to convert to
other Types of Loans under Section 2.04), plus the Applicable Margin.

(b) Interest on each Loan shall be paid in arrears on each applicable
Interest Payment Date. Interest in all cases shall also be paid on the date of
any prepayment of Loans under subsection 2.07(e) and interest on Eurodollar Rate
Loans shall also be paid on the date of prepayment of Loans in all other
circumstances under Section 2.06 or 2.07, in each case for the portion of the
Loans so prepaid and upon payment (including prepayment) in full thereof and,
during the existence of any Event of Default, interest shall be paid on demand
of the Agent at the request or with the consent of the Majority Banks.

(c) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this Section, while any Event of
Default exists or after acceleration, the Borrower shall pay interest (after as
well as before entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) on the
principal amount of all outstanding Obligations, at a rate per annum which is
determined by adding 2% per annum to the Applicable Margin then in effect for
such Loans and, in the case of Obligations not subject to an Applicable Margin,
including, without limitation, all letter of credit and commitment fees provided
herein, at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin
plus 2%; provided, however, that, on and after the expiration of any Interest
Period applicable to any Eurodollar Rate Loan outstanding on the date of
occurrence of such Event of Default or acceleration, the principal amount of
such Loan shall, during the continuation of such Event of Default or after
acceleration, bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the
Applicable Margin plus 2%.

40
<PAGE>

(d) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, the obligations
of the Borrower to any Bank hereunder shall be subject to the limitation that
payments of interest shall not be required for any period for which interest is
computed hereunder, to the extent (but only to the extent) that contracting for
or receiving such payment by such Bank would be contrary to the provisions of
any law applicable to such Bank limiting the highest rate of interest that may
be lawfully contracted for, charged or received by such Bank, and in such event
the Borrower shall pay such Bank interest at the highest rate permitted by
applicable law.

2.10 Fees. In addition to certain fees described in Section 3.08:

(a) Arrangement, Agency Fees. The Borrower shall pay an arrangement
fee to the Arranger for the Arranger's own account, and shall pay an agency fee
to the Agent for the Agent's own account, as required by the letter agreement
("Fee Letter") between the Borrower and the Arranger and Agent dated May 11,
1994.

(b) Commitment Fees. The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the
account of each Bank a commitment fee with respect to such Bank's Facility A
Commitment equal to the Commitment Fee Rate per annum times the daily average
amount by which such Bank's Facility A Commitment exceeded the sum of the
aggregate Effective Amount of its Facility A Revolving Loans plus its Pro Rata
Share of the Effective Amount of L/C Obligations (other than with respect to
Commercial Letters of Credit). The Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the
account of each Bank a commitment fee with respect to such Bank's Facility B
Commitment, equal to the Commitment Fee rate per annum times the daily average
amount by which such Bank's Facility B Revolving Commitment exceeded the
aggregate Effective Amount of its Facility B Revolving Loans. Such commitment
fees shall accrue from the date of this Agreement to the Revolving Termination
Date and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the first Business Day
of each fiscal quarter following the quarter for which payment is to be made,
commencing on August 1, 1994 through the Revolving Termination Date, with the
final payment to be made on the Revolving Termination Date; provided that, in
connection with the full termination of Commitments under Section 2.05 or
Section 2.07, the accrued commitment fees calculated for the period ending on
such date shall also be paid on the date of such termination. The commitment
fees provided in this subsection shall accrue at all times after the above-
mentioned commencement date, including at any time during which one or more
conditions in Article V are not met.

2.11 Computation of Fees and Interest. (a) All computations of interest
for Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is determined by BofA's "reference rate"
shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and
actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest

41
<PAGE>

shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which
results in more interest being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day
year). Interest and fees shall accrue during each period during which interest
or such fees are computed from the first day thereof to the last day thereof.

(b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Agent shall be
conclusive and binding on the Borrower and the Banks in the absence of manifest
error.

2.12 Payments by the Borrower. (a) All payments to be made by the
Borrower shall be made without set-off, recoupment or counterclaim. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower shall be made
to the Agent for the account of the Banks at the Agent's Payment Office, and
shall be made in dollars and in immediately available funds, no later than 10:00
a.m. (San Francisco time) on the date specified herein. The Agent will promptly
distribute to each Bank its Pro Rata Share (or other applicable share as
expressly provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received. Any
payment received by the Agent later than 10:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) shall
be deemed to have been received on the following Business Day and any applicable
interest or fee shall continue to accrue.

(b) Subject to the provisions set forth in the definition of "Interest
Period" herein, whenever any payment is due on a day other than a Business Day,
such payment shall be made on the following Business Day, and such extension of
time shall in such case be included in the computation of interest or fees, as
the case may be.

(c) Unless the Agent receives notice from the Borrower prior to the
date on which any payment is due to the Banks that the Borrower will not make
such payment in full as and when required, the Agent may assume that the
Borrower has made such payment in full to the Agent on such date in immediately
available funds and the Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance
upon such assumption, distribute to each Bank on such due date an amount equal
to the amount then due such Bank. If and to the extent the Borrower has not
made such payment in full to the Agent, each Bank shall repay to the Agent on
demand such amount distributed to such Bank, together with interest thereon at
the Federal Funds Rate for each day from the date such amount is distributed to
such Bank until the date repaid.

2.13 Payments by the Banks to the Agent. (a) Unless the Agent receives
notice from a Bank on or prior to the Closing Date or, with respect to any
Borrowing after the Closing Date, by 2:00 p.m. (San Francisco time) on the
Business Day prior to the date of such Borrowing, that such Bank will not make
available as and when required hereunder to the Agent for the account of the
Borrower the amount of that Bank's Pro Rata Share of the Borrowing, the Agent
may assume that each Bank has made such amount available to the Agent in
immediately available funds on

42
<PAGE>

the Borrowing Date and the Agent may (but shall not be so required), in reliance
upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower on such date a
corresponding amount. If and to the extent any Bank shall not have made its
full amount available to the Agent in immediately available funds and the Agent
in such circumstances has made available to the Borrower such amount, that Bank
shall on the Business Day following such Borrowing Date make such amount
available to the Agent, together with interest at the Federal Funds Rate for
each day during such period. A notice of the Agent submitted to any Bank with
respect to amounts owing under this subsection (a) shall be conclusive, absent
manifest error. If such amount is so made available, such payment to the Agent
shall constitute such Bank's Loan on the date of Borrowing for all purposes of
this Agreement. If such amount is not made available to the Agent on the
Business Day following the Borrowing Date, the Agent will notify the Borrower of
such failure to fund and, upon demand by the Agent, the Borrower shall pay such
amount to the Agent for the Agent's account, together with interest thereon for
each day elapsed since the date of such Borrowing, at a rate per annum equal to
the interest rate applicable at the time to the Loans comprising such Borrowing.

(b) The failure of any Bank to make any Loan on any Borrowing Date
shall not relieve any other Bank of any obligation hereunder to make a Loan on
such Borrowing Date, but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of any
other Bank to make the Loan to be made by such other Bank on any Borrowing Date.

2.14 Sharing of Payments, Etc. If, other than as expressly provided
elsewhere herein, any Bank shall obtain on account of the Loans made by it any
payment (whether voluntary, involuntary, through the exercise of any right of
set-off, or otherwise) in excess of its Pro Rata Share, such Bank shall
immediately (a) notify the Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase from the other
Banks such participations in the Loans made by them as shall be necessary to
cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess payment pro rata with each of
them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment is
thereafter recovered from the purchasing Bank, such purchase shall to that
extent be rescinded and each other Bank shall repay to the purchasing Bank the
purchase price paid therefor, together with an amount equal to such paying
Bank's ratable share (according to the proportion of (i) the amount of such
paying Bank's required repayment to (ii) the total amount so recovered from the
purchasing Bank) of any interest or other amount paid or payable by the
purchasing Bank in respect of the total amount so recovered. The Borrower
agrees that any Bank so purchasing a participation from another Bank may, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all its rights of payment (including
the right of set-off) with respect to such participation as fully as if such
Bank were the direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such
participation. The Agent will keep records (which shall be conclusive and
binding in the absence of manifest error)

43
<PAGE>

of participations purchased under this Section and will in each case notify the
Banks following any such purchases or repayments.

2.15 Discretionary Swingline Loans.

(a) From time to time, subject to the conditions set forth below, at
the request of the Borrower, made through the Agent as set forth below, BofA in
its sole and absolute discretion may make short-term loans to the Borrower not
to exceed in the aggregate at any one time outstanding the principal sum of
$10,000,000, to be used by the Borrower to cover overdrafts, for cash management
purposes, or for other general working capital needs of the Borrower (each, a
"Swingline Loan"). The availability of Swingline Loans is conditioned on the
satisfaction of each of the following conditions: (i) it shall be in the sole
and absolute discretion of BofA, on each occasion that a Swingline Loan is
requested, whether to make such Swingline Loan; (ii) each Swingline Loan shall
bear interest from the time made until the time repaid, or until the time, if
any, that such Swingline Loan is converted into a Base Rate Loan as provided
below, at the rate(s) from time to time applicable to Base Rate Loans hereunder;
(iii) at the time of making of any Swingline Loan, the aggregate Effective
Amount of all Swingline Loans, together with the aggregate Effective Amount of
all Facility A Revolving Loans and the Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations,
without duplication, shall not exceed the aggregate Facility A Commitment; (iv)
each Swingline Loan, when made, all interest accrued thereon, and all
reimbursable costs and expenses incurred or payable in connection therewith,
shall constitute an Obligation of Borrower hereunder; and (v) each request for a
Swingline Loan from BofA pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall be made by the
Borrower to the Agent, shall be funded by BofA through the Agent, and shall be
repaid by the Borrower through the Agent (in order that the Agent may keep an
accurate record of the outstanding balance at any time of Swingline Loans so as
to monitor compliance with the terms and provisions hereof), and each such
request shall be in writing unless the Agent in its sole discretion accepts an
oral or telephonic request. Each Swingline Loan shall be made upon the
Borrower's irrevocable written notice delivered to the Agent substantially in
the form of a Notice of Borrowing (which notice must be received by the Agent
prior to 1:00 p.m. (San Francisco time) on the requested date of such Swingline
Loan, specifying:

(i) the amount of the Swingline Loan, which shall be in a
minimum amount of $250,000 or any multiple of $100,000 in excess
thereof; and

(ii) the requested date of such Swingline Loan, which shall
be a Business Day;

(b) If any Swingline Loan made pursuant to this Section 2.15, and in
compliance with the conditions set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph
of this Section 2.15, is not repaid by the Borrower on or before the seventh
calendar day

44
<PAGE>

following the day that it was funded by BofA, BofA shall have the right in
BofA's sole and absolute discretion, by giving notice to the Borrower and the
Banks, to cause such Swingline Loan automatically upon the giving of such notice
to be converted into a Facility A Revolving Loan which is a Base Rate Loan, and
upon receipt of such notice each Bank shall fund to the Agent, for the account
of BofA, such Bank's ratable share of such Facility A Revolving Loan, based on
such Bank's Pro Rata Share; provided, that if any Insolvency Proceeding has been
commenced with respect to the Borrower on or prior to the date on which such
Swingline Loan is due, and in lieu of funding its Pro Rata Share of a Facility A
Revolving Loan, each Bank shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and
unconditionally agrees to, purchase from BofA a participation in such Swingline
Loan equal to the product of such Bank's Pro Rata Share times the amount of such
Swingline Loan.

(c) Each Bank's obligation in accordance with this Agreement to make
Facility A Revolving Loans upon the failure of a Swingline Loan to be repaid in
full when due, or to purchase participations in such Swingline Loans, shall, in
each case, be absolute and unconditional and without recourse to BofA and shall
not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any set-off, counterclaim,
recoupment, defense or other right which such Bank may have against BofA, the
Borrower or any other Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or
continuance of a Default, an Event of Default or a Material Adverse Effect; or
(iii) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not
similar to any of the foregoing.

ARTICLE III
THE LETTERS OF CREDIT
---------------------

3.01 The Letter of Credit Subfacility. (a) On the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein and as a subfacility of the Facility A
Commitment, (i) the Issuing Banks agree, from time to time on any Business Day
during the period from the Closing Date to the date that is 30 days prior to the
Revolving Termination Date to issue Letters of Credit for the account of the
Borrower and Stratton and to amend or renew Letters of Credit previously issued
by them, in each case in accordance with subsections 3.02(c) and 3.02(d); and
(ii) the Banks severally agree to participate in Letters of Credit Issued for
the account of the Borrower and Stratton; provided, that the Issuing Banks shall
not be obligated to Issue, and no Bank shall be obligated to participate in, any
Letter of Credit if, as of the date of Issuance of such Letter of Credit (the
"Issuance Date"), (1) the Effective Amount of all L/C Obligations plus the
Effective Amount of all Facility A Revolving Loans plus the Effective Amount of
all Swingline Loans exceeds the combined Facility A Commitments, or (2) the
Effective Amount of L/C Obligations exceeds the L/C Commitment. Within the
foregoing limits, and subject to the other terms and conditions hereof, the
ability of the Borrower and Stratton to obtain Letters of Credit shall be fully
revolving, and, accordingly, the Borrower and

45
<PAGE>

Stratton may, during the foregoing period, obtain Letters of Credit to replace
Letters of Credit which have expired or which have been drawn upon and
reimbursed.

(b) No Issuing Bank is under any obligation to Issue any Letter of
Credit if:

(i) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority
or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain such Issuing
Bank from Issuing such Letter of Credit, or any Requirement of Law
applicable to such Issuing Bank or any request or directive (whether or not
having the force of law) from any Governmental Authority with jurisdiction
over such Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or request that such Issuing Bank
refrain from, the Issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of
Credit in particular or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank with respect to
such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for
which such Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in
effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon such Issuing Bank any
unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable on the Closing
Date and which such Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it;

(ii) such Issuing Bank has received written notice from any
Bank, the Agent, the Borrower or Stratton, on or prior to the Business Day
prior to the requested date of Issuance of such Letter of Credit, that one
or more of the applicable conditions contained in Article V is not then
satisfied;

(iii) the expiry date of any requested Letter of Credit is (A)
with respect to Commercial Letters of Credit supporting the purchase of
inventory by the Borrower, more than (1) 180 days after the date of
Issuance or (2) 30 days prior to the Revolving Termination Date, unless the
Majority Banks have approved such expiry date in writing, or (B) with
respect to any other Letter of Credit, 30 days prior to the Revolving
Termination Date, unless all of the Banks have approved such expiry date in
writing;

(iv) the expiry date of any requested Letter of Credit is prior
to the maturity date of any financial obligation to be supported by the
requested Letter of Credit;

(v) any requested Letter of Credit does not provide for drafts
(unless there is a demand for payment in the documentation required to be
delivered in connection with any drawing), or is not otherwise in form and
substance acceptable to such Issuing Bank, or the Issuance of a Letter of
Credit shall violate any applicable policies of such Issuing Bank;

46
<PAGE>

(vi) any Standby Letter of Credit is for the purpose of
supporting the issuance of any letter of credit by any other Person other
than with respect to any Existing Letter of Credit so designated in
Schedule 3.03; or

(vii) such Letter of Credit is to be used for a purpose other
than any permitted use of the proceeds of Facility A Revolving Loans as set
forth in Section 7.11.

3.02 Issuance, Amendment and Renewal of Letters of Credit. (a) Each
Letter of Credit shall be issued upon the irrevocable written request of the
Borrower and, if Stratton is the applicant, Stratton, received by the Issuing
Bank (with a copy sent by the Borrower or Stratton to the Agent) prior to 10:00
a.m. (San Francisco time) on the proposed date of Issuance for Letters of Credit
in the form of Exhibit H, I or J hereto and at least four days prior to the
proposed date of Issuance for other forms of Letters of Credit. Each such
request for issuance of a Letter of Credit shall be by facsimile, confirmed by
telephone, in the form of an L/C Application, and shall specify in form and
detail satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank: (i) the proposed date of
issuance of the Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day); (ii) the face
amount of the Letter of Credit; (iii) the expiry date of the Letter of Credit;
(iv) the name and address of the beneficiary thereof; (v) the documents to be
presented by the beneficiary of the Letter of Credit in case of any drawing
thereunder; (vi) the full text of any certificate to be presented by the
beneficiary in case of any drawing thereunder; and (vii) such other matters as
the Issuing Bank may require.

(b) Prior to the Issuance of any Letter of Credit, the applicable
Issuing Bank will confirm with the Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the
Agent has received a copy of the L/C Application or L/C Amendment Application
from the Borrower and, if Stratton is the applicant, from Stratton and, if not,
such Issuing Bank will provide the Agent with a copy thereof. Unless such
Issuing Bank has received notice on or before 11:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) on
the date such Issuing Bank is to issue a requested Letter of Credit from the
Agent (A) directing such Issuing Bank not to issue such Letter of Credit because
such issuance is not then permitted under subsection 3.01(a) as a result of the
limitations set forth in clauses (1) or (2) thereof or subsection 3.01(b)(ii);
or (B) that one or more conditions specified in Article V are not then
satisfied; then, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, such Issuing Bank
shall, on the requested date, issue a Letter of Credit in accordance with such
Issuing Bank's usual and customary business practices.

(c) From time to time while a Letter of Credit is outstanding and
prior to the Revolving Termination Date, any Issuing Bank will, upon the written
request of the Borrower and, if Stratton is the applicant, Stratton, received by
such Issuing Bank (with a copy sent by the Borrower or Stratton to the Agent) at
least four days (or such shorter time as such Issuing Bank may

47
<PAGE>

agree in a particular instance in its sole discretion) prior to the proposed
date of amendment, amend any Letter of Credit issued by it. Each such request
for amendment of a Letter of Credit shall be made by facsimile, confirmed by
telephone, made in the form of an L/C Amendment Application and shall specify in
form and detail satisfactory to such Issuing Bank: (i) the Letter of Credit to
be amended; (ii) the proposed date of amendment of the Letter of Credit (which
shall be a Business Day); (iii) the nature of the proposed amendment; and (iv)
such other matters as such Issuing Bank may require. The applicable Issuing
Bank shall be under no obligation to amend any Letter of Credit if: (A) such
Issuing Bank would have no obligation at such time to issue such Letter of
Credit in its amended form under the terms of this Agreement; or (B) the
beneficiary of any such letter of Credit does not accept the proposed amendment
to the Letter of Credit. The Agent will promptly notify the Banks of the
receipt by it of any L/C Application or L/C Amendment Application.

(d) The Issuing Banks and the Banks agree that, while a Letter of
Credit is outstanding and prior to the Revolving Termination Date, at the option
of the Borrower and Stratton and upon the written request of the Borrower and,
if Stratton is the applicant, Stratton, received by the applicable Issuing Bank
(with a copy sent by the Borrower or Stratton to the Agent) at least four days
(or such shorter time as such Issuing Bank may agree in a particular instance in
its sole discretion) prior to the proposed date of notification of renewal, such
Issuing Bank shall be entitled to authorize the automatic renewal of any Letter
of Credit issued by it. Each such request for renewal of a Letter of Credit
shall be made by facsimile, confirmed by telephone, in the form of an L/C
Amendment Application, and shall specify in form and detail satisfactory to such
Issuing Bank: (i) the Letter of Credit to be renewed; (ii) the proposed date of
notification of renewal of the Letter of Credit (which shall be a Business Day);
(iii) the revised expiry date of the Letter of Credit; and (iv) such other
matters as such Issuing Bank may require. The applicable Issuing Bank shall be
under no obligation so to renew any Letter of Credit if: (A) such Issuing Bank
would have no obligation at such time to issue or amend such Letter of Credit in
its renewed form under the terms of this Agreement; or (B) the beneficiary of
any such Letter of Credit does not accept the proposed renewal of the Letter of
Credit. If any outstanding Letter of Credit shall provide that it shall be
automatically renewed unless the beneficiary thereof receives notice from the
applicable Issuing Bank that such Letter of Credit shall not be renewed, and if
at the time of renewal such Issuing Bank would be entitled to authorize the
automatic renewal of such Letter of Credit in accordance with this subsection
3.02(d) upon the request of either or both of the Borrower and Stratton, as
applicable, but such Issuing Bank shall not have received any L/C Amendment
Application with respect to such renewal or other written direction by either or
both of the Borrower and Stratton, as applicable, with respect thereto, such
Issuing Bank shall nonetheless be permitted to allow such Letter of Credit to
renew, and the Borrower and Stratton and the Banks

48
<PAGE>

hereby authorize such renewal, and, accordingly, such Issuing Bank shall be
deemed to have received an L/C Amendment Application from either or both of the
Borrower and Stratton, as applicable, requesting such renewal.

(e) The Issuing Banks may, at their election (or as required by the
Agent at the direction of the Majority Banks), deliver any notices of
termination or other communications to any Letter of Credit beneficiary or
transferee, and take any other action as necessary or appropriate, at any time
and from time to time, in order to cause the expiry date of such Letter of
Credit to be a date not later than the Revolving Termination Date.

(f) This Agreement shall control in the event of any conflict with any
L/C-Related Document (other than any Letter of Credit).

(g) The Issuing Banks will also deliver to the Agent, concurrently or
promptly following delivery of a Letter of Credit, or amendment to or renewal of
a Letter of Credit, to an advising bank or a beneficiary, a true and complete
copy of each such Letter of Credit or amendment to or renewal of a Letter of
Credit.

3.03 Existing Letters of Credit; Risk Participations, Drawings and
Reimbursements. (a) On and after the Closing Date, the Existing Letters of
Credit shall be deemed for all purposes, including for purposes of the fees to
be collected pursuant to subsections 3.08(a) and 3.08(c), and reimbursement
costs and expenses to the extent provided herein, Letters of Credit outstanding
under this Agreement and entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents, and shall be governed by the applications and agreements
pertaining thereto and by this Agreement. Each Existing Letter of Credit
designated as a "standby letter of credit" on Schedule 3.03 shall be deemed to
be a Standby Letter of Credit, and each Existing Letter of Credit designated as
a "commercial documentary letter of credit" on Schedule 3.03 shall be deemed to
be a Commercial Letter of Credit. Each Bank shall be deemed to, and hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Issuing Banks on
the Closing Date a participation in each such Letter of Credit and each drawing
thereunder in an amount equal to the product of (i) such Bank's Pro Rata Share
times (ii) the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit
and the amount of such drawing, respectively. For purposes of subsection
2.01(a) and subsection 2.10(b), the Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed
to utilize the Pro Rata Share of each Bank.

(b) Immediately upon the Issuance of each Letter of Credit in addition
to those described in subsection 3.03(a), each Bank shall be deemed to, and
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the applicable
Issuing Bank a participation in such Letter of Credit and each drawing
thereunder in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Pro Rata

49
<PAGE>

Share of such Bank, times (ii) the maximum amount available to be drawn under
such Letter of Credit and the amount of such drawing, respectively. For
purposes of subsection 2.01(a), each Issuance of a Letter of Credit shall be
deemed to utilize the Facility A Commitment of each Bank by an amount equal to
the amount of such participation.

(c) In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of Credit
by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, the applicable Issuing Bank will
promptly notify the Borrower and, if Stratton is the applicant, Stratton. The
Borrower or Stratton shall reimburse such Issuing Bank prior to 10:00 a.m. (San
Francisco time), on each date that any amount is paid by such Issuing Bank under
any Letter of Credit (each such date, an "Honor Date"), in an amount equal to
the amount so paid by such Issuing Bank. In the event the Borrower or Stratton
fails to reimburse such Issuing Bank of any Letter of Credit for the full amount
of any drawing under such Letter of Credit by 10:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) on
the Honor Date, such Issuing Bank will promptly notify the Agent and the Agent
will promptly notify each Bank thereof, and the Borrower shall be deemed to have
requested that Base Rate Loans be made by the Banks to be disbursed on the Honor
Date under such Letter of Credit, subject to the conditions set forth in Section
5.02 (including, without limitation, the condition that no Insolvency Proceeding
shall have been commenced by or against the Borrower or Stratton on the Honor
Date). Any notice given by an Issuing Bank or the Agent pursuant to this
subsection 3.03(c) may be oral if immediately confirmed in writing (including by
facsimile); provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not
affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice.

(d) Each Bank shall upon any notice pursuant to subsection 3.03(c)
make available to the Agent for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank an
amount in Dollars and in immediately available funds equal to its Pro Rata Share
of the amount of the drawing, whereupon the participating Banks shall (subject
to subsection 3.03(e)) each be deemed to have made a Facility A Revolving Loan
consisting of a Base Rate Loan to the Borrower in that amount. If any Bank so
notified fails to make available to the Agent for the account of the applicable
Issuing Bank the amount of such Bank's Pro Rata Share of the amount of the
drawing by no later than 11:00 a.m. (San Francisco time) on the Honor Date, then
interest shall accrue on such Bank's obligation to make such payment, from the
Honor Date to the date such Bank makes such payment, at a rate per annum equal
to the Federal Funds Rate in effect from time to time during such period. The
Agent will promptly give notice of the occurrence of the Honor Date, but failure
of the Agent to give any such notice on the Honor Date or in sufficient time to
enable any Bank to effect such payment on such date shall not relieve such Bank
from its obligations under this Section 3.03.

(e) With respect to any unreimbursed drawing that is not converted
into Facility A Revolving Loans consisting of Base

50
<PAGE>

Rate Loans to the Borrower in whole or in part, because of the Borrower's
failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 5.02 or for any other
reason, the Borrower and Stratton shall be deemed to have incurred from an
Issuing Bank an L/C Borrowing in the amount of such drawing, which L/C Borrowing
shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear
interest at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin
plus 2% per annum, and each Bank's payment to such Issuing Bank pursuant to
subsection 3.03(d) shall be deemed payment in respect of its participation in
such L/C Borrowing and shall constitute an L/C Advance from such Bank in
satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 3.03.

(f) Each Bank's obligation in accordance with this Agreement to make
the Facility A Revolving Loans or L/C Advances, as contemplated by this Section
3.03, as a result of a drawing under a Letter of Credit, shall be absolute and
unconditional and without recourse to the Issuing Banks (except in circumstances
arising solely as a result of willful misconduct or gross negligence by the
Issuing Banks) and shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any
set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Bank may
have against any Issuing Bank, the Borrower, Stratton or any other Person for
any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default, an Event
of Default or a Material Adverse Effect; or (iii) any other circumstance,
happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

3.04 Repayment of Participations. (a) Upon (and only upon) receipt by the
Agent for the account of an Issuing Bank of immediately available funds from the
Borrower or Stratton (i) in reimbursement of any payment made by such Issuing
Bank under the Letter of Credit with respect to which any Bank has paid the
Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank for such Bank's participation in the
Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 3.03 or (ii) in payment of interest
thereon, the Agent will pay to each Bank, in the same funds as those received by
the Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank, the amount of such Bank's Pro
Rata Share of such funds, and such Issuing Bank shall receive the amount of the
Pro Rata Share of such funds of any Bank that did not so pay the Agent for the
account of such Issuing Bank.

(b) If the Agent or any Issuing Bank is required at any time to return
to the Borrower or Stratton, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian,
or any official in any Insolvency Proceeding, any portion of the payments made
by the Borrower or Stratton to the Agent for the account of such Issuing Bank
pursuant to subsection 3.04(a) in reimbursement of a payment made under the
Letter of Credit or interest or fee thereon, each Bank shall, on demand of the
Agent, forthwith return to the Agent or such Issuing Bank the amount of its Pro
Rata Share of any amounts so returned by the Agent or such Issuing Bank plus
interest thereon from the date such demand is made to the date such amounts are
returned by such Bank to the Agent or such

51
<PAGE>

Issuing Bank, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate in effect from
time to time.

3.05 Role of the Issuing Banks. (a) Each Bank, the Borrower and Stratton
agree that, in paying any drawing under a Letter of Credit, the applicable
Issuing Bank shall not have any responsibility to obtain any document (other
than any sight draft and certificates expressly required by the Letter of
Credit) or to ascertain or inquire as to the validity or accuracy of any such
document or the authority of the Person executing or delivering any such
document.

(b) No Agent-Related Person nor any of the respective correspondents,
participants or assignees of an Issuing Bank shall be liable to any Bank for:
(i) any action taken or omitted in connection herewith at the request or with
the approval of the Banks (including the Majority Banks, as applicable); (ii)
any action taken or omitted in the absence of gross negligence or willful
misconduct; or (iii) the due execution, effectiveness, validity or
enforceability of any L/C-Related Document.

(c) The Borrower and Stratton hereby assume all risks of the acts or
omissions of any beneficiary or transferee with respect to its use of any Letter
of Credit; provided, however, that this assumption is not intended to, and shall
not, preclude the Borrower's or Stratton's pursuing such rights and remedies as
either may have against the beneficiary or transferee at law or under any other
agreement. No Agent-Related Person, nor any of the respective correspondents,
participants or assignees of any Issuing Bank, shall be liable or responsible
for any of the matters described in clauses (i) through (vii) of Section 3.06;
provided, however, anything in such clauses to the contrary notwithstanding,
that the Borrower and Stratton may have a claim against an Issuing Bank, and an
Issuing Bank may be liable to the Borrower and Stratton, to the extent, but only
to the extent, of any direct, as opposed to consequential or exemplary, damages
suffered by the Borrower and Stratton which the Borrower and Stratton prove were
caused by an Issuing Bank's willful misconduct or gross negligence or an Issuing
Bank's willful failure to pay under any Letter of Credit after the presentation
to it by the beneficiary of a sight draft and certificate(s) strictly complying
with the terms and conditions of a Letter of Credit. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing: (i) an Issuing Bank may accept documents that
appear on their face to be in order, without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary; and (ii)
an Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for the validity or sufficiency of any
instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign a
Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in
whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason.

3.06 Obligations Absolute. The obligations of the Borrower and Stratton
under this Agreement and any L/C-Related Document to

52
<PAGE>

reimburse the Issuing Banks for drawings under Letters of Credit, and to repay
any L/C Borrowing and any drawings under Letters of Credit converted into
Facility A Revolving Loans, shall be unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be
paid strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and each such other
L/C-Related Document under all circumstances, including the following:

(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement or
any L/C-Related Document;

(ii) any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or
in any other term of, all or any of the obligations of the Borrower and
Stratton in respect of any Letter of Credit or any other amendment or
waiver of or any consent to departure from all or any of the L/C-Related
Documents;

(iii) the existence of any claim, set-off, defense or other
right that the Borrower or Stratton may have at any time against any
beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Person for
whom any such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), an Issuing
Bank or any other Person, whether in connection with this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby or by the L/C-Related Documents or any
unrelated transaction;

(iv) any draft, demand, certificate or other document presented
under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect; or any loss or delay in the transmission or
otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any
Letter of Credit;

(v) any payment by an Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit
against presentation of a draft or certificate that does not strictly
comply with the terms of any Letter of Credit; or any payment made by an
Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit to any Person purporting to be a
trustee in bankruptcy, debtor-in-possession, assignee for the benefit of
creditors, liquidator, receiver or other representative of or successor to
any beneficiary or any transferee of any Letter of Credit, including any
arising in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding;

(vi) any exchange, release or non-perfection of any collateral,
or any release or amendment or waiver of or consent to departure from any
other guarantee, for all or any of the obligations of the Borrower or
Stratton in respect of any Letter of Credit; or

(vii) any other circumstance or happening whatsoever, whether or
not similar to any of the foregoing, including any other circumstance that
might otherwise

53
<PAGE>

constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, the Borrower,
Stratton or a guarantor.

3.07 Cash Collateral Pledge. Upon (i) the request of the Agent, (A) if an
Issuing Bank has honored any full or partial drawing request on any Letter of
Credit and such drawing has resulted in an L/C Borrowing hereunder, or (B) if,
as of the Revolving Termination Date, any Letters of Credit may for any reason
remain outstanding and partially or wholly undrawn, or (ii) the occurrence of
the circumstances described in subsection 2.07(a) requiring the Borrower to Cash
Collateralize Letters of Credit, then, the Borrower shall immediately Cash
Collateralize the L/C Obligations in an amount equal to the L/C Obligations.

3.08 Letter of Credit Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees and, in the case of
Standby Letters of Credit issued for the account of Stratton, the Borrower and
Stratton jointly and severally agree, to pay to the Agent for the account of
each of the Banks based on their respective Pro Rata Shares a letter of credit
fee with respect to the Standby Letters of Credit equal to the Risk
Participation Percentage of the average daily maximum amount available to be
drawn of the outstanding Standby Letters of Credit, computed on a quarterly
basis in arrears on the last Business Day of each fiscal quarter based upon
Standby Letters of Credit outstanding for that quarter as calculated by the
Agent. Such letter of credit fees shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears
on the first Business Day following each fiscal quarter during which Standby
Letters of Credit are outstanding, commencing on the first such quarterly date
to occur after the Closing Date, through the Revolving Termination Date, with
the final payment to be made on the Revolving Termination Date.

(b) The Borrower agrees and, in the case of Standby Letters of Credit
issued for the account of Stratton, the Borrower and Stratton jointly and
severally agree, to pay to the applicable Issuing Bank for its sole account a
letter of credit fronting fee for each Standby Letter of Credit Issued by such
Issuing Bank, equal to 0.15% per annum of the face amount (or increased face
amount, as the case may be) of such Standby Letter of Credit. Such Letter of
Credit fronting fee shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the first
Business Day following each fiscal quarter during which such Letter of Credit is
outstanding, commencing on the first such quarterly date to occur after the
Closing Date.

(c) The Borrower agrees and, in the case of Standby Letters of Credit
issued for the account of Stratton, the Borrower and Stratton jointly and
severally agree, to pay to the Issuing Banks from time to time on demand the
normal issuance, presentation, amendment and other processing fees, and other
standard costs and charges, of the Issuing Banks relating to Standby Letters of
Credit and Commercial Letters of Credit as from time to time in effect.

54
<PAGE>

3.09 Uniform Customs and Practice. The Uniform Customs and Practice for
Documentary Credits as published by the International Chamber of Commerce
("UCP") most recently at the time of issuance of any Letter of Credit shall
(unless otherwise expressly provided in the Letters of Credit) apply to such
Letter of Credit.

3.10 Acknowledgment of Accommodation; Waiver of Defenses. (a) For the
purposes of implementing the provisions of this Article III, the Borrower and
Stratton each irrevocably appoints the other as its agent and attorney-in-fact
for all purposes, including the giving and receiving of notices and other
communications.

(b) Each of the Borrower and Stratton acknowledges and agrees that
Obligations for Letters of Credit issued for the account of Stratton have been
established on a joint and several basis as an accommodation to the Borrower and
Stratton and at their request, and that the Borrower is benefited thereby.

(c) The Borrower shall be absolutely and unconditionally liable for
the repayment of all L/C Obligations, whether incurred by the Borrower or
Stratton, all as if the Borrower was the primary beneficiary of all Letters of
Credit.

(d) Each of the Borrower and Stratton authorizes the Agent and the
Banks, without notice or demand and without affecting the liability of either
hereunder, from time to time, either before or after the termination of this
Agreement, to (i) renew, compromise, extend, accelerate or otherwise change the
time for payment of, or otherwise change the terms of the L/C Obligations or any
other Obligation or any part thereof including any increase or decrease of the
rate of interest thereon; (ii) receive and hold security for the payment of the
L/C Obligations or any other Obligation, and exchange, enforce, waive, release,
fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any such security; (iii) apply
such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as the Agent in its
discretion may determine; and (iv) release Stratton or any other party and hold
the Borrower liable for all L/C Obligations or other Obligations or other
Obligations of Stratton.

(e) The Borrower waives any right to require the Agent to (i) proceed
against the Borrower or Stratton in any particular order or proceed first or
concurrently against any other party; (ii) proceed against or exhaust any
security held from the Borrower or Stratton or any other party; or (iii) pursue
any other remedy in the Agent's or the Banks' power whatsoever. The Borrower
waives any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense, or the
cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability of the Borrower or Stratton
or any other party, or any claim that the obligations of one exceed or are more
burdensome than those of the other including, without limitation, any defense of
the Borrower arising directly or indirectly from the failure of Stratton to
obtain any required consent of any

55
<PAGE>

Governmental Authority. The Borrower waives any right of subrogation,
reimbursement, indemnification and contribution (contractual, statutory or
otherwise), including without limitation, any claim or right of subrogation
under the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of the U.S. Code) or any successor statute,
arising from the existence or performance of its obligations hereunder, and
waives any right to enforce any remedy which the Agent or the Banks now have or
may hereafter have against either of them, and waives any benefit of and any
right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by the Agent or the
Banks. The Borrower waives all presentments, demands for performance, notices
of nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor, and
notices of acceptance of this Agreement and of the existence, creation, or
incurrence of new or additional indebtedness.

(f) The Borrower warrants and agrees that the waivers and consents
set forth in this Section 3.10 are made with full knowledge of their
significance and with the understanding that events giving rise to any defense
waived may diminish, destroy or otherwise adversely affect rights which the
Borrower or Stratton may have against each other, the Agent, the Banks or
others.

(g) Stratton shall be liable only with respect to Letters of Credit
issued for its own account, and shall have no liability with respect to Letters
of Credit issued for the account of the Borrower. The parties acknowledge that
this letter of credit subfacility is made available for the activities of the
Borrower and Stratton. The parties further acknowledge that Stratton, as a
regulated insurance company, is prohibited from incurring indebtedness on behalf
of, or guarantying the indebtedness of, the Borrower unless such incurrence or
guaranty is directly related to Stratton's insurance operations. Accordingly,
the parties agree that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, Stratton shall have no obligation to any party hereunder for any
liability created hereunder except with respect to the issuance, drawing,
reimbursement, repayment, collateralization and payment of interest, fees and
other costs attributable to the Letters of Credit issued for the account of
Stratton for the benefit of persons to whom Stratton has incurred or will incur
liability arising out of the operation of Stratton's insurance activities in the
ordinary course of business.

ARTICLE IV
TAXES, YIELD PROTECTION AND ILLEGALITY
--------------------------------------

4.01 Taxes. (a) Any and all payments by the Borrower to each Bank or the
Agent under this Agreement and any other Loan Document shall be made free and
clear of, and without deduction or withholding for any Taxes. In addition, the
Borrower shall pay all Other Taxes.

(b) The Borrower agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Bank and
the Agent for the full amount of Taxes or Other

56
<PAGE>

Taxes (including any Taxes or Other Taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on amounts
payable under this Section) paid by the Bank or the Agent and any liability
(including interest, additions to tax and expenses) arising therefrom or with
respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or
legally asserted. Payment under this indemnification shall be made within 30
days after the date the Bank or the Agent makes written demand therefor.

(c) If the Borrower shall be required by law to deduct or withhold any
Taxes or Other Taxes from or in respect of any sum payable hereunder to any Bank
or the Agent, then:

(i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that
after making all required deductions and withholdings (including deductions
and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section)
such Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, receives an amount equal to the
sum it would have received had no such deductions or withholdings been
made;

(ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and withholdings;

(iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted or
withheld to the relevant taxing authority or other authority in accordance
with applicable law; and

(iv) the Borrower shall also pay to each Bank or the Agent for
the account of such Bank, at the time interest is paid, all additional
amounts which the respective Bank specifies as necessary to preserve the
after-tax yield the Bank would have received if such Taxes or Other Taxes
had not been imposed.

(d) Within 30 days after the date of any payment by the Borrower of
Taxes or Other Taxes, the Borrower shall furnish the Agent the original or a
certified copy of a receipt evidencing payment thereof, or other evidence of
payment satisfactory to the Agent.

(e) If the Borrower is required to pay additional amounts to any Bank
or the Agent pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, then such Bank shall
use reasonable efforts (consistent with legal and regulatory restrictions) to
change the jurisdiction of its Lending Office so as to eliminate any such
additional payment by the Borrower which may thereafter accrue, if such change
in the judgment of such Bank is not otherwise disadvantageous to such Bank.

4.02 Illegality. (a) If any Bank determines that the introduction of any
Requirement of Law, or any change in any Requirement of Law, or in the
interpretation or administration of any Requirement of Law, has made it
unlawful, or that any central bank or other Governmental Authority has asserted
that it is

57
<PAGE>

unlawful, for any Bank or its applicable Lending Office to make Eurodollar Rate
Loans, then, on notice thereof by the Bank to the Borrower through the Agent,
any obligation of that Bank to make Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be suspended
until the Bank notifies the Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving
rise to such determination no longer exist.

(b) If a Bank determines that it is unlawful to maintain any
Eurodollar Rate Loan, the Borrower shall, upon its receipt of notice of such
fact and demand from such Bank (with a copy to the Agent), prepay in full such
Eurodollar Rate Loans of that Bank then outstanding, together with interest
accrued thereon and amounts required under Section 4.04, either on the last day
of the Interest Period thereof, if the Bank may lawfully continue to maintain
such Eurodollar Rate Loans to such day, or immediately, if the Bank may not
lawfully continue to maintain such Eurodollar Rate Loan. If the Borrower is
required to so prepay any Eurodollar Rate Loan, then concurrently with such
prepayment, the Borrower shall borrow from the affected Bank, in the amount of
such repayment, a Base Rate Loan.

(c) If the obligation of any Bank to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate
Loans has been so terminated or suspended, the Borrower may elect, by giving
notice to the Bank through the Agent that all Loans which would otherwise be
made by the Bank as Eurodollar Rate Loans shall be instead Base Rate Loans.

(d) Before giving any notice to the Agent under this Section, the
affected Bank shall designate a different Lending Office with respect to its
Eurodollar Rate Loans if such designation will avoid the need for giving such
notice or making such demand and will not, in the judgment of the Bank, be
illegal or otherwise disadvantageous to the Bank.

4.03 Increased Costs and Reduction of Return. (a) If any Bank determines
that, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change (other than any change
by way of imposition of or increase in reserve requirements included in the
calculation of the Eurodollar Rate or in respect of the assessment rate payable
by any Bank to the FDIC for insuring U.S. deposits) in or in the interpretation
of any law or regulation or (ii) the compliance by that Bank with any guideline
or request from any central bank or other Governmental Authority (whether or not
having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to such Bank
of agreeing to make or making, funding or maintaining any Eurodollar Rate Loans
or participating in Letters of Credit, or, in the case of any Issuing Bank, any
increase in the cost to such Issuing Bank of agreeing to issue, issuing or
maintaining any Letter of Credit or of agreeing to make or making, funding or
maintaining any unpaid drawing under any Letter of Credit, then the Borrower
shall be liable for, and shall from time to time, upon demand (with a copy of
such demand to be sent to the Agent), pay to the Agent for the account of such
Bank, additional amounts as are sufficient to compensate such Bank for such
increased costs.

58
<PAGE>

(b) If any Bank shall have determined that (i) the introduction of any
Capital Adequacy Regulation, (ii) any change in any Capital Adequacy Regulation,
(iii) any change in the interpretation or administration of any Capital Adequacy
Regulation by any central bank or other Governmental Authority charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or (iv) compliance by the Bank (or its
Lending Office) or any corporation controlling the Bank with any Capital
Adequacy Regulation, affects or would affect the amount of capital required or
expected to be maintained by the Bank or any corporation controlling the Bank
and (taking into consideration such Bank's or such corporation's policies with
respect to capital adequacy and such Bank's desired return on capital)
determines that the amount of such capital is increased as a consequence of its
Commitments, loans, credits or obligations under this Agreement, then, upon
demand of such Bank to the Borrower through the Agent, the Borrower shall pay to
the Bank, from time to time as specified by the Bank, additional amounts
sufficient to compensate the Bank for such increase.

4.04 Funding Losses. The Borrower shall reimburse each Bank and hold each
Bank harmless from any loss or expense which the Bank may sustain or incur as a
consequence of:

(a) the failure of the Borrower to make on a timely basis any payment
of principal of any Eurodollar Rate Loan;

(b) the failure of the Borrower to borrow, continue or convert a Loan
after the Borrower has given (or is deemed to have given) a Notice of Borrowing
or a Notice of Conversion/ Continuation;

(c) the failure of the Borrower to make any prepayment in accordance
with any notice delivered under Section 2.06;

(d) the prepayment (including pursuant to Section 2.07) or other
payment (including after acceleration thereof) of a Eurodollar Rate Loan on a
day that is not the last day of the relevant Interest Period; or

(e) the automatic conversion under Section 2.04 of any Eurodollar Rate
Loan to a Base Rate Loan on a day that is not the last day of the relevant
Interest Period;

including any such loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment
of funds obtained by it to maintain its Eurodollar Rate Loans or from fees
payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. For
purposes of calculating amounts payable by the Borrower to the Banks under this
Section and under subsection 4.03(a), each Eurodollar Rate Loan made by a Bank
(and each related reserve, special deposit or similar requirement) shall be
conclusively deemed to have been funded at the LIBOR used in determining the
Eurodollar Rate for such Eurodollar Rate Loan by a matching deposit or other
borrowing in the interbank eurodollar market for a comparable

59
<PAGE>

amount and for a comparable period, whether or not such Eurodollar Rate Loan is
in fact so funded.

4.05 Inability to Determine Rates. If the Agent determines that for any
reason adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining the Eurodollar
Rate for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar
Rate Loan or that the Eurodollar Rate applicable pursuant to subsection 2.09(a)
for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Eurodollar Rate
Loan does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of funding
such Loan, the Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Bank.
Thereafter, the obligation of the Banks to make or maintain Eurodollar Rate
Loans, hereunder shall be suspended until the Agent upon the instruction of the
Majority Banks revokes such notice in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the
Borrower may revoke any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation
then submitted by it. If the Borrower does not revoke such Notice, the Banks
shall make, convert or continue the Loans, as proposed by the Borrower, in the
amount specified in the applicable notice submitted by the Borrower, but such
Loans shall be made, converted or continued as Base Rate Loans instead of
Eurodollar Rate Loans.

4.06 Survival. The agreements and obligations of the Borrower in this
Article IV shall survive the payment of all other Obligations.

carried under similar circumstances by such other Persons.

7.07 Payment of Obligations. The Borrower, the General Partner and
Stratton shall, and shall cause each Subsidiary to, pay and discharge as the

finances and accounts with their respective directors, officers, and independent
public accountants, all at the expense of the Borrower and at such reasonable
times during normal business hours and as often as may be reasonably desired,

fiscal quarter and the three immediately preceding fiscal quarters, equal to or

the aggregate amount of Loans so borrowed shall be added to the amount of Funded
Debt outstanding at the end of such quarter for purposes of determining the
Leverage Ratio at the end of such quarter.

times a minimum Partners' Equity of not less than $50,000,000.

7.14 Other General Partner Obligations.
--------------------------------- 

(a) The General Partner shall cause the Borrower to pay and perform
each of its Obligations when due. The General Partner acknowledges and agrees
that it is executing this Agreement as a principal as well as the general
partner on behalf of the Borrower, and that its obligations hereunder as general
partner are full recourse obligations to the same extent as those of the
Borrower.

(b) The General Partner represents, warrants and covenants that it is
Solvent, both before and after giving effect to the consummation of the
Reorganization and each of the other transactions contemplated by the Loan
Documents, and that it will remain Solvent until all Obligations hereunder shall
have been repaid in full and all commitments shall have terminated, and will
retain sufficient assets upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Registration Statements and from time to time thereafter to pay, in full,
the maximum potential liability of the General Partner under or in connection
with the Tax Audits. The General Partner shall advise the Agent in writing from
time to time of all material developments in connection with the Tax Audit,
including, without limitation, any material change in the maximum potential
liability of the General Partner in connection therewith or any material change
in the amount of assets retained by the General Partner regarding such liability
pursuant to this Section 7.14.

(c) The General Partner, for so long as it is the general partner of
the Borrower, (i) agrees that its sole business will be to act as the general
partner of the Borrower, the MLP and any further limited partnership of which
the Borrower or the MLP is, directly or indirectly, a limited partner and to
undertake activities that are ancillary or related thereto (including being a
limited partner in the Borrower), (ii) shall not enter into or conduct any
business or incur any debts or liabilities except in connection with or
incidental to (A) its performance of the activities required or authorized by
the MLP Partnership Agreement or the Borrower's Partnership Agreement or

described in or contemplated by the MLP Registration Statement and (B) the
acquisition, ownership or disposition of Partnership Interests in the Borrower
or partnership interests in the MLP or any further limited partnership of which
the Borrower or the MLP is, directly or indirectly, a limited partner, except
that, notwithstanding the foregoing, employees of the General Partner may
perform services for Ferrell Companies, Inc. and its Affiliates.

(d) The General Partner agrees that, until all Obligations hereunder
shall have been repaid in full and all commitments shall have terminated, it
will not exercise any rights it may have (at law, in equity, by contract or
otherwise) to terminate, limit or otherwise restrict (whether through repurchase
or otherwise and whether or not the General Partner shall remain a general
partner in the Borrower) the ability of the Borrower to use the name
"Ferrellgas".

(e) The General Partner shall not take any action or refuse to take
any reasonable action the effect of which, if taken or not taken, as the case
may be, would be to cause the Borrower to be treated as an association taxable
as a corporation or otherwise to be taxed as an entity other than a partnership
for federal income tax purposes.

(f) Not later than 45 days after the Closing Date, the General
Partner shall amend its Certificate of Incorporation to delete Article EIGHTH
thereof.

7.15 Other Stratton Obligations. Stratton shall not engage in any
business other than insuring potential general liability and worker's
compensation liabilities of the Borrower and its Affiliates, provided, however,
that the maximum amount of the liabilities insured by Stratton in any policy

7.16 Monetary Judgments. If one or more judgments, orders, decrees or
arbitration awards is entered against the Borrower or any Subsidiary involving
in the aggregate a liability (to the extent not covered by independent third-
party insurance as to which the insurer does not dispute coverage other than
through a standard reservation of rights letter) as to any single or related
series of transactions, incidents or conditions, of more than $10 million, then
the Borrower shall reserve for such amount in excess of $10 million, on a
quarterly basis, with each quarterly reserve being at least equal to one-twelfth
of such amount in excess of $10 million. Such amount so reserved shall be
treated as establishment of a reserve for purposes of calculating Available Cash
hereunder.

maintain Stratton as a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary.

or assets in one or more related transactions, to another Person unless (i) the

conveyance or other disposition shall have been made assumes all the Obligations
of the Borrower pursuant to an assumption agreement in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Agent, under this Agreement; (iii) immediately after such
transaction no Default or Event of Default exists; and (iv) the Borrower or any

transaction) equal to or greater than the Consolidated Net Worth of the Borrower
immediately preceding the transaction and (B) shall, at the time of such

Person formed by such consolidation or into or with which the Borrower is merged
or to which such sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other
disposition is made shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and
after the date of such consolidation, merger, sale, lease, conveyance or other
disposition, the provisions of this Agreement referring to the "Borrower" shall
refer to or include instead the successor Person and not the Borrower), and may
exercise every right and power of the Borrower under this Agreement with the
same effect as if such successor Person had been named as the Borrower herein;
provided, however, that the predecessor Borrower shall not be relieved from the
obligation to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the
Obligations except in the case of a sale of all of such Borrower's assets that
meets the requirements of Section 8.03 hereof.

8.04 Acquisitions. Without limiting the generality of any other provision
of this Agreement, neither the Borrower nor any Subsidiary shall consummate any
Acquisition unless (i) the acquiree is primarily a retail propane distribution
business; (ii) such Acquisition is undertaken in accordance with all applicable
Requirements of Law; (iii) the prior, effective written consent or approval to
such Acquisition of the board of directors or equivalent governing body of the
acquiree is obtained; and (iv) immediately after giving effect thereto, no
Default or Event of Default will occur or be continuing and each of the
representations and warranties of the Borrower herein is true on and as of the
date of such Acquisition, both before and after giving effect thereto.

8.05 Limitation on Indebtedness. The Borrower shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue,
assume, guarantee or otherwise become directly or indirectly liable with respect
to (collectively, "incur") any Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) and the
Borrower shall not issue any Disqualified Interests and shall not permit any of
its Subsidiaries to issue any shares of preferred stock; provided, however, that
the Borrower may incur Indebtedness and any Subsidiary of the Borrower may incur
Acquired Debt if:

(a) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Borrower's most recently
ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are
available immediately preceding the date on which such additional
Indebtedness is incurred would have been at least 2.75 to 1 if such date is

83
<PAGE>

on or prior to August 1, 1996 and 3.00 to 1 if such date is after August 1,
1996, in each case, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma
application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional
Indebtedness had been incurred at the beginning of such four-quarter
period; and

(b) either (x) such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of
payment to the Obligations and no principal payment thereon shall be
required prior to July 1, 2000, whether upon stated maturity, mandatory
prepayment, acceleration or otherwise, or (y) such Indebtedness shall be
Permitted Senior Debt and the Senior Debt Ratio Test shall have been met at
the time of incurrence thereof.

The foregoing limitations of this Section 8.05 will not apply to: (i)
the Indebtedness represented by the Senior Notes and any Subsidiary Note
Guarantees; (ii) the Obligations; (iii) the incurrence by the Borrower of
Indebtedness in respect of Capitalized Lease Obligations in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed $15,000,000; (iv) the Existing Indebtedness set
forth on Schedule 8.05; (v) the incurrence by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries of Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness in exchange for, or the
proceeds of which are used to extend, refinance, renew, replace, defease or
refund any then outstanding Indebtedness of the Borrower on such Subsidiary not
incurred in violation of this Agreement; (vi) Hedging Obligations with respect
to any floating rate Indebtedness that is permitted by the terms of this
Agreement to be outstanding; (vii) Indebtedness of any Subsidiary of the
Borrower to the Borrower or any of its Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries; (viii) the
incurrence by the Borrower or Stratton of Indebtedness owing directly to its
insurance carriers (without duplication) in connection with the Borrower's, its
Subsidiaries' or its Affiliates' self-insurance programs or other similar forms
of retained insurable rights for their respective retail propane businesses,
consisting of reinsurance agreements and indemnification agreements (and
guarantees of the foregoing) secured by Letters of Credit, provided that the
Indebtedness evidenced by such reinsurance agreements, indemnification
agreements, guarantees and Letters of Credit shall be counted (without
duplication) for purposes of all calculations pursuant to the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio test; (ix) Surety Instruments required in the ordinary course of
business or in connection with the enforcement of rights or claims of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or in connection with judgments that do not
result in a Default or Event of Default; (x) subject to the provisions of
Section 8.04, the incurrence by the Borrower (or any Subsidiary of the Borrower
that is a Guarantor) of Indebtedness in connection with Acquisitions of retail
propane businesses in favor of the sellers of such businesses in a principal
amount not to exceed $15,000,000 in any fiscal year or $45,000,000 in the
aggregate outstanding at any one time, provided that the principal amount of
such Indebtedness incurred in connection with any such acquisition shall not
exceed the fair market value of the assets

84
<PAGE>

so acquired, and the Borrower shall deliver an officer's certificate to the
Agent, signed by a Responsible Officer, stating that the acquiring Person is
Solvent, both before and after giving effect to the Acquisition; and (xi) in
addition to the Indebtedness permitted under the foregoing clauses (i) through
(x), the incurrence by the Borrower of Indebtedness in an aggregate principal
amount outstanding not to exceed $15,000,000 at any time, provided that any
Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (xi) shall be subordinated in
right of payment to the Obligations and no principal payment thereon shall be
required prior to July 1, 2000, whether upon stated maturity, mandatory
prepayment, acceleration or otherwise.

The "Senior Debt Ratio Test" will be met with respect to the
incurrence of any Indebtedness by the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower
if the ratio of (1) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Senior Debt on
the date of and after giving effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness (the
"Incurrence Date") to (2) Consolidated Cash Flow for the Borrower's most
recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements
are available immediately preceding the Incurrence Date would have been 2.50 to
1 or less. For purposes of the computation in clause (1) of the foregoing
sentence, the outstanding principal amount of Indebtedness under this Agreement
shall be deemed to equal the aggregate amount of the Commitments hereunder. The
foregoing calculation of Consolidated Cash Flow shall give pro forma effect to
Acquisitions (including all mergers and consolidations), Asset Sales and other
dispositions and discontinuances of operations that have been made by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries during the four-quarter reference period or
subsequent to such reference period and on or prior to the Incurrence Date in
the manner set forth in the definition of Leverage Ratio.

For purposes of this Section 8.05, any revolving Indebtedness (under
this Agreement or otherwise) shall be deemed to have been incurred only at such
time at which the agreements and instruments (or any amendments thereto that
increase the amount of such revolving Indebtedness) are executed, in an amount
equal to the maximum amount of such revolving Indebtedness permitted to be
borrowed thereunder.

8.06 Transactions with Affiliates. The Borrower shall not, and shall not
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of
any of its properties or assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or
enter into any contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee
with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate, including any Non-Recourse
Subsidiary (each of the foregoing, an "Affiliate Transaction"), unless (a) such
Affiliate Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the Borrower or
the relevant Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable
transaction by the Borrower or such Subsidiary with an unrelated Person and (b)
with respect to (i) any Affiliate Transaction with an aggregate value in excess
of $500,000, a

85
<PAGE>

majority of the directors of the General Partner having no direct or indirect
economic interest in such Affiliate Transaction determines by resolution that
such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (a) above and approves such
Affiliate Transaction and (ii) any Affiliate Transaction involving the purchase
or other acquisition or sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of properties
or assets other than in the ordinary course of business, in each case, having a
fair market value or for net proceeds in excess of $15,000,000, the Borrower
delivers to the Agent an opinion as to the fairness to the Borrower or such
Subsidiary from a financial point of view issued by an investment banking firm
of national standing; provided, however, that (i) any employment agreement or
stock option agreement entered into by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
in the ordinary course of business and consistent with the past practice of the
Borrower (or the General Partner) or such Subsidiary, Restricted Payments
permitted by the provisions of Section 8.12, and transactions entered into by
the Borrower or Stratton in the ordinary course of business in connection with
reinsuring the self-insurance programs or other similar forms of retained
insurable risks of the retail propane businesses operated by the Borrower, its
Subsidiaries and its Affiliates, in each case, shall not be deemed Affiliate
Transactions, and (ii) nothing herein shall authorize the payments by the
Borrower to the General Partner or any other Affiliate of the Borrower for
administrative expenses incurred by such Person other than such out-of-pocket
administrative expenses as such Person shall incur and the Borrower shall pay in
the ordinary course of business.

8.07 Use of Proceeds. The Borrower shall not, and shall not suffer or

is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person,
other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired,
provided that the Consolidated Cash Flow of such Person to the extent that
dividends, distributions, loans, advances or transfers thereof is limited by
such encumbrance or restriction on the date of acquisition is not taken into
account in determining whether such acquisition was permitted by the terms of
this Agreement, (v) customary non-assignment provisions in leases entered into
in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices, (vi)
purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of
business that impose restrictions of the nature described in clause (d) above on
the property so acquired, or (vii) Permitted Refinancing Indebtedness of any

any such action. The Agent and each Issuing Bank shall in all cases be fully
protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Majority
Banks and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto
shall be binding upon all of the Banks.

(b) For purposes of determining compliance with the conditions
specified in Section 5.01, each Bank that has executed this Agreement shall be
deemed to have consented to, approved or accepted or to be satisfied with, each
document or other matter either sent by the Agent or an Issuing Bank to such
Bank for consent, approval, acceptance or satisfaction, or required thereunder
to be consented to or approved by or acceptable or satisfactory to the Bank.

10.05 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge
or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, except with
respect to defaults in the payment of principal, interest and fees required to
be paid to the Agent for the account of the Banks, unless the Agent shall have
received written notice from a Bank or the Borrower referring to this Agreement,
describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a
"notice of default". The Agent will notify the Banks of its receipt of any such
notice. The Agent shall take such action with respect to such Default or Event
of Default as may be requested by the Majority Banks in accordance with Article
IX; provided, however, that unless and until the Agent has received any such
request, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Banks.

10.06 Credit Decision. Each Bank acknowledges that none of the Agent-
Related Persons or any Issuing Bank has made any representation or warranty to
it, and that no act by the Agent or any Issuing Bank hereinafter taken,
including any review of the affairs of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, shall
be deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any Agent-Related
Person or any Issuing Bank to any Bank. Each Bank represents to the Agent and
the Issuing Banks that it has, independently and without reliance upon any
Agent-Related Person or any Issuing Bank and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own appraisal of and
investigation into the

98
<PAGE>

business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and all applicable bank
regulatory laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and made its
own decision to enter into this Agreement and to extend credit to the Borrower
hereunder. Each Bank also represents that it will, independently and without
reliance upon any Agent-Related Person or any Issuing Bank and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking
action under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such
investigations as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition and
creditworthiness of the Borrower. Except for notices, reports and other
documents to be furnished to the Banks by the Agent or any Issuing Bank as
specified on Schedule 10.06, neither the Agent nor any Issuing Bank shall have
any duty or responsibility to provide any Bank with any credit or other
information concerning the business, prospects, operations, property, financial
and other condition or creditworthiness of the Borrower which may come into the
possession of any of the Agent-Related Persons or any Issuing Bank. The Agent
shall promptly deliver to the Banks the items specified on Schedule 10.6 that
are required to be provided by the Borrower only to the extent such items are
actually provided by the Borrower.

10.07 Indemnification. Whether or not the transactions contemplated
hereby are consummated, the Banks shall indemnify upon demand the Agent-Related
Persons and the Issuing Banks (to the extent not reimbursed by or on behalf of
the Borrower and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), pro
rata in accordance with its Pro Rata Share on the date the Borrower's
reimbursement obligation arises, from and against any and all Indemnified
Liabilities; provided, however, that no Bank shall be liable for the payment to
the Agent-Related Persons or the Issuing Banks of any portion of such
Indemnified Liabilities resulting solely from such Person's gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Without limitation of the foregoing, each Bank shall
reimburse the Agent and the Issuing Banks upon demand for their ratable share of
any costs or out-of-pocket expenses (including Attorney Costs) incurred by them
in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery, administration,
modification, amendment or enforcement (whether through negotiations, legal
proceedings or otherwise) of, or legal advice in respect of rights or
responsibilities under, this Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any document
contemplated by or referred to herein, to the extent that the Agent or the
applicable Issuing Bank is not reimbursed for such expenses by or on behalf of
the Borrower. The undertaking in this Section shall survive the payment of all
Obligations hereunder and the resignation or replacement of the Agent or any
Issuing Bank.

10.08 Agent in Individual Capacity. BofA and its Affiliates may make
loans to, issue letters of credit for the account of, accept deposits from,
acquire equity interests in and

99
<PAGE>

generally engage in any kind of banking, trust, financial advisory, underwriting
or other business with the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates as
though BofA were not the Agent or an Issuing Bank hereunder and without notice
to or consent of the Banks. The Banks acknowledge that, pursuant to such
activities, BofA or its Affiliates may receive information regarding the
Borrower or its Affiliates (including information that may be subject to
confidentiality obligations in favor of the Borrower or such Subsidiary) and
acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no obligation to provide such
information to them. With respect to its Loans and participations in Letters of
Credit, BofA shall have the same rights and powers under this Agreement as any
other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Agent or an
Issuing Bank.

10.09 Successor Agent. The Agent may, and at the request of the Majority
Banks shall, resign as Agent upon 30 days' notice to the Banks. If the Agent
resigns under this Agreement, the Majority Banks shall appoint from among the
Banks a successor agent for the Banks. If no successor agent is appointed prior
to the effective date of the resignation of the Agent, the Agent may appoint,
after consulting with the Banks and the Borrower, a successor agent from among
the Banks. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as successor agent hereunder,
such successor agent shall succeed to all the rights, powers and duties of the
retiring Agent and the term "Agent" shall mean such successor agent and the
retiring Agent's appointment, powers and duties as Agent shall be terminated.
After any retiring Agent's resignation hereunder as Agent, the provisions of
this Article X and Sections 11.04 and 11.05 shall inure to its benefit as to any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Agent under this
Agreement. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as Agent by the date
which is 30 days following a retiring Agent's notice of resignation, the
retiring Agent's resignation shall nevertheless thereupon become effective and
the Banks shall perform all of the duties of the Agent hereunder until such
time, if any, as the Majority Banks appoint a successor agent as provided for
above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, BofA may not be removed as the
Agent at the request of the Majority Banks unless BofA shall also simultaneously
be replaced as an "Issuing Bank" hereunder pursuant to documentation in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to BofA.

10.10 Withholding Tax. (a) If any Bank is a "foreign corporation,
partnership or trust" within the meaning of the Code and such Bank claims
exemption from, or a reduction of, U.S. withholding tax under Sections 1441 or
1442 of the Code, such Bank agrees with and in favor of the Agent, to deliver to
the Agent:

(i) if such Bank claims an exemption from, or a reduction of,
withholding tax under a United States tax treaty, properly completed IRS
Forms 1001 and W-8 before the payment of any interest in the first calendar
year and before the payment of any interest in each third succeeding

100
<PAGE>

calendar year during which interest may be paid under this Agreement;

(ii) if such Bank claims that interest paid under this Agreement
is exempt from United States withholding tax because it is effectively
connected with a United States trade or business of such Bank, two properly
completed and executed copies of IRS Form 4224 before the payment of any
interest is due in the first taxable year of such Bank and in each
succeeding taxable year of such Bank during which interest may be paid
under this Agreement, and IRS Form W-9; and

(iii) such other form or forms as may be required under the Code
or other laws of the United States as a condition to exemption from, or
reduction of, United States withholding tax.

Such Bank agrees to promptly notify the Agent of any change in circumstances
which would modify or render invalid any claimed exemption or reduction.

(b) If any Bank claims exemption from, or reduction of, withholding
tax under a United States tax treaty by providing IRS Form 1001 and such Bank
sells, assigns, grants a participation in, or otherwise transfers all or part of
the Obligations of the Borrower to such Bank, such Bank agrees to notify the
Agent of the percentage amount in which it is no longer the beneficial owner of
Obligations of the Borrower to such Bank. To the extent of such percentage
amount, the Agent will treat such Bank's IRS Form 1001 as no longer valid.

(c) If any Bank claiming exemption from United States withholding tax
by filing IRS Form 4224 with the Agent sells, assigns, grants a participation
in, or otherwise transfers all or part of the Obligations of the Borrower to
such Bank, such Bank agrees to undertake sole responsibility for complying with
the withholding tax requirements imposed by Sections 1441 and 1442 of the Code.

(d) If any Bank is entitled to a reduction in the applicable
withholding tax, the Agent may withhold from any interest payment to such Bank
an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax after taking into account
such reduction. If the forms or other documentation required by subsection (a)
of this Section are not delivered to the Agent, then the Agent may withhold from
any interest payment to such Bank not providing such forms or other
documentation an amount equivalent to the applicable withholding tax.

(e) If the IRS or any other Governmental Authority of the United
States or other jurisdiction asserts a claim that the Agent did not properly
withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Bank (because the
appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such
Bank failed

101
<PAGE>

to notify the Agent of a change in circumstances which rendered the exemption
from, or reduction of, withholding tax ineffective, or for any other reason)
such Bank shall indemnify the Agent fully for all amounts paid, directly or
indirectly, by the Agent as tax or otherwise, including penalties and interest,
and including any taxes imposed by any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to
the Agent under this Section, together with all costs and expenses (including
Attorney Costs). The obligation of the Banks under this subsection shall
survive the payment of all Obligations and the resignation or replacement of the
Agent.

<PAGE>

be, affect the rights or duties of the Issuing Banks under this Agreement or any
L/C-Related Document relating to any Letter of Credit Issued or to be Issued by
any such Issuing Bank, (ii) no amendment, waiver or consent shall, unless in

or rights or privileges thereunder waived, in a writing executed solely by the
parties thereto.

11.02 Notices. (a) Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section
3.02, all notices, requests and other communications shall be in writing
(including, unless the context expressly otherwise provides, by facsimile
transmission, provided that any matter transmitted by the Borrower by facsimile
(i) shall be immediately confirmed by a telephone call to the recipient at the
number specified on Schedule 11.02, and (ii) shall be followed promptly by
delivery of a hard copy original thereof) and mailed, faxed or delivered, to the
address or facsimile number specified for notices on Schedule 11.02; or, as
directed to the Borrower or the Agent, to such other address as shall be
designated by such party in a written notice to the other parties, and as
directed to any other party, at such other address as shall be designated by
such party in a written notice to the Borrower and the Agent.

(b) All such notices, requests and communications shall, when
transmitted by overnight delivery, or faxed, be effective when delivered for
overnight (next-day) delivery, or transmitted in legible form by facsimile
machine, respectively, or if mailed, upon the third Business Day after the date

address specified for the "Issuing Banks" on the applicable signature page
hereof.

(c) Any agreement of the Agent and the Banks herein to receive certain
notices by telephone or facsimile is solely for the convenience and at the
request of the Borrower. The Agent and the Banks shall be entitled to rely on
the authority of any Person purporting to be a Person authorized by the Borrower
to give such notice and the Agent and the Banks shall not have any liability to
the Borrower or other Person on account of any action taken or not taken by the
Agent or the Banks in reliance upon such telephonic or facsimile notice. The
obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans and L/C Obligations shall not be
affected in any way or to any extent by any failure by the Agent and the Banks
to receive written confirmation of any telephonic or facsimile notice or the
receipt by the Agent and the Banks of a confirmation which is at variance with
the terms understood by the Agent and the Banks to be contained in the
telephonic or facsimile notice.

103
<PAGE>

11.03 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to exercise and no delay
in exercising, on the part of the Agent or any Bank, any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy,
power or privilege.

11.04 Costs and Expenses. The Borrower shall:

(a) whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, pay or reimburse BofA (including in its capacity as Agent and an
Issuing Bank) within five Business Days after demand (subject to subsection
5.01(f)) for all costs and expenses incurred by BofA (including in its capacity
as Agent and an Issuing Bank) in connection with the development, preparation,
delivery, administration and execution of, and any amendment, supplement, waiver
or modification to (in each case, whether or not consummated), this Agreement,
any Loan Document and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or
therewith, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby, including reasonable (giving due regard to the prevailing
circumstances) Attorney Costs incurred by BofA (including in its capacity as
Agent and an Issuing Bank) with respect thereto; and

(b) pay or reimburse the Agent, the Arranger, each Issuing Bank and
each Bank within five Business Days after demand for all costs and expenses
(including Attorney Costs) incurred by them in connection with the enforcement,
attempted enforcement, or preservation of any rights or remedies under this
Agreement or any other Loan Document during the existence of an Event of Default
or after acceleration of the Loans (including in connection with any "workout"
or restructuring regarding the Loans, and including in any Insolvency Proceeding
or appellate proceeding).

11.05 Indemnity. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, the Borrower shall indemnify and hold the Agent-Related Persons,
the Issuing Banks, and each Bank and each of their respective officers,
directors, employees, counsel, agents and attorneys-in-fact (each, an
"Indemnified Person") harmless from and against any and all liabilities,
obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits and
reasonable (giving due regard to the prevailing circumstances) costs, charges,
expenses and disbursements (including Attorney Costs) of any kind or nature
whatsoever which may at any time (including at any time following repayment of
the Loans, the termination of the Letters of Credit and the termination,
resignation or replacement of the Agent or replacement of any Bank or Issuing
Bank) be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against any such Person in any way
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any document contemplated by or
referred to herein, or the transactions contemplated hereby, or any action taken
or omitted by any such Person under or in connection with any of the foregoing,
including with respect to

104
<PAGE>

any investigation, litigation or proceeding (including any Insolvency Proceeding
or appellate proceeding) related to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Loans or Letters of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof, whether or not
any Indemnified Person is a party thereto (all the foregoing, collectively, the
"Indemnified Liabilities"); provided, that the Borrower shall have no obligation
hereunder to any Indemnified Person with respect to Indemnified Liabilities
resulting solely from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such
Indemnified Person. The agreements in this Section shall survive payment of all
other Obligations.

11.06 Payments Set Aside. To the extent that the Borrower makes a payment
to the Agent or the Banks, or the Agent or the Banks exercise their right of
set-off, and such payment or the proceeds of such set-off or any part thereof
are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set
aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the
Agent or such Bank in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any
other party, in connection with any Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise, then (a)
to the extent of such recovery the obligation or part thereof originally
intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect
as if such payment had not been made or such set-off had not occurred, and (b)
each Bank severally agrees to pay to the Agent upon demand its pro rata share of
any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Agent.

11.07 Successors and Assigns. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, except that the Borrower may not assign or transfer any
of its rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the Agent and each Bank. Any attempted or purported assignment in
contravention of the preceding sentence shall be null and void.

11.08 Assignments, Participations, Etc. (a) Any Bank may, with the
written consent of the Borrower (at all times other than during the existence of
an Event of Default), the Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank(s), which
consents shall not be unreasonably withheld, at any time assign and delegate to
one or more Eligible Assignees (provided that no written consent of the
Borrower, the Agent or an Issuing Bank shall be required in connection with any
assignment and delegation by a Bank to an Eligible Assignee that is an Affiliate
of such Bank) (each an "Assignee") all, or any ratable part of all, of the
Loans, the Commitments, the L/C Obligations and the other rights and obligations
of such Bank hereunder with respect to Facility A and Facility B, in an
aggregate minimum amount of $10,000,000, pro-rated between Facility A and
Facility B; provided that such Bank shall retain an aggregate amount of not less
than $10,000,000 in respect thereof, unless such Bank assigns and delegates all
of its rights and obligations hereunder to one or more Eligible Assignees on the
time and subject to the conditions set forth

105
<PAGE>

herein; and provided, further, however, that the Borrower and the Agent may
continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with the
interest so assigned to an Assignee until (i) written notice of such assignment,
together with payment instructions, addresses and related information with
respect to the Assignee, shall have been given to the Borrower and the Agent by
such Bank and the Assignee; (ii) such Bank and its Assignee shall have delivered
to the Borrower and the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance in the form of
Exhibit E ("Assignment and Acceptance"), together with any Note or Notes subject
to such assignment; and (iii) the assignor Bank or Assignee has paid to the
Agent a processing fee in the amount of $3,500.

(b) From and after the date that the Agent notifies the assignor Bank
that it has received (and provided its consent with respect to) an executed
Assignment and Acceptance and payment of the above-referenced processing fee,
(i) the Assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, shall have the rights and obligations of a Bank under
the Loan Documents, and (ii) the assignor Bank shall, to the extent that rights
and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents have been assigned
by it pursuant to such Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be
released from its obligations under the Loan Documents.

(c) Within five Business Days after its receipt of notice by the Agent
that it has received an executed Assignment and Acceptance and payment of the
processing fee (and provided that it consents to such assignment in accordance
with subsection 11.08(a)), if the Assignee so requests, the Borrower shall
execute and deliver to the Agent, new Notes evidencing such Assignee's assigned
Loans and Commitment and, if the assignor Bank has retained a portion of its
Loans and its Commitment and so requests, replacement Notes in the principal
amount or amounts of the Loans retained by the assignor Bank (such Notes to be
in exchange for, but not in payment of, the Notes held by such Bank).
Immediately upon each Assignee's making its processing fee payment under the
Assignment and Acceptance, this Agreement shall be deemed to be amended to the
extent, but only to the extent, necessary to reflect the addition of the
Assignee and the resulting adjustment of the Commitments arising therefrom. The
Commitment allocated to each Assignee shall reduce such Commitments of the
assigning Bank pro tanto and the Agent shall promptly prepare and distribute a
new Schedule 2.01 reflecting the new commitments.

(d) Any Bank may at any time sell to one or more commercial banks or
other Persons not Affiliates of the Borrower (a "Participant") participating
interests in any Loans, the Commitment of that Bank and the other interests of
that Bank (the "originating Bank") hereunder and under the other Loan Documents;
provided, however, that (i) the originating Bank's obligations under this
Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) the originating

106
<PAGE>

Bank shall remain solely responsible for the performance of such obligations,
(iii) the Borrower, the Issuing Banks and the Agent shall continue to deal
solely and directly with the originating Bank in connection with the originating
Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
and (iv) no Bank shall transfer or grant any participating interest under which
the Participant has rights to approve any amendment to, or any consent or waiver
with respect to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except to the extent
such amendment, consent or waiver would require unanimous consent of the Banks
as described in the first proviso to Section 11.01. In the case of any such
participation, the Participant shall be entitled to the benefit of Sections
4.01, 4.03 and 11.05 as though it were also a Bank hereunder, and if amounts
outstanding under this Agreement are due and unpaid, or shall have been declared
or shall have become due and payable upon the occurrence of an Event of Default,
each Participant shall be deemed to have the right of set-off in respect of its
participating interest in amounts owing under this Agreement to the same extent
as if the amount of its participating interest were owing directly to it as a
Bank under this Agreement.

(e) Each Bank agrees to take normal and reasonable precautions and
exercise due care to maintain the confidentiality of all information identified
as "confidential" or "secret" by the Borrower and provided to it by the
Borrower or any Subsidiary, or by the Agent on such Borrower's or Subsidiary's
behalf, under this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and neither it nor any
of its Affiliates shall use any such information other than in connection with
or in enforcement of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents; except to the
extent such information (i) was or becomes generally available to the public
other than as a result of disclosure by the Bank, or (ii) was or becomes
available on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the Borrower,
provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with the
Borrower known to the Bank; provided, however, that any Bank may disclose such
information (A) at the request or pursuant to any requirement of any
Governmental Authority to which the Bank is subject or in connection with an
examination of such Bank by any such authority; (B) pursuant to subpoena or
other court process; (C) when required to do so in accordance with the
provisions of any applicable Requirement of Law; (D) to the extent reasonably
required in connection with any litigation or proceeding to which the Agent, any
Bank or their respective Affiliates may be party; (E) to the extent reasonably
required in connection with the exercise of any remedy hereunder or under any
other Loan Document; (F) to such Bank's independent auditors and other
professional advisors; (G) to any Affiliate of such Bank, or to any Participant
or Assignee, actual or potential, provided that such Affiliate, Participant or
Assignee agrees to keep such information confidential to the same extent
required of the Banks hereunder, and (H) as to any Bank, as expressly permitted
under the terms of any other document or agreement regarding

107
<PAGE>

confidentiality to which the Borrower is party or is deemed party with such
Bank.

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, any Bank
may at any time create a security interest in, or pledge, all or any portion of
its rights under and interest in this Agreement and any Note held by it in favor
of any Federal Reserve Bank in accordance with Regulation A of the FRB or U.S.
Treasury Regulation 31 CFR (S)203.14, and such Federal Reserve Bank may enforce
such pledge or security interest in any manner permitted under applicable law.

11.09 Set-off. In addition to any rights and remedies of the Banks
provided by law, if an Event of Default exists or the Loans have been
accelerated, each Bank is authorized at any time and from time to time, without
prior notice to the Borrower, any such notice being waived by the Borrower to
the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits
(general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held by,
and other indebtedness at any time owing by, such Bank to or for the credit or
the account of the Borrower against any and all Obligations owing to such Bank,
now or hereafter existing, irrespective of whether or not the Agent or such Bank
shall have made demand under this Agreement or any Loan Document and although
such Obligations may be contingent or unmatured. Each Bank agrees promptly to
notify the Borrower and the Agent after any such set-off and application made by
such Bank; provided, however, that the failure to give such notice shall not
affect the validity of such set-off and application.

11.10 Notification of Addresses, Lending Offices, Etc. Each Bank shall
notify the Agent in writing of any changes in the address to which notices to
the Bank should be directed, of addresses of any Lending Office, of payment
instructions in respect of all payments to be made to it hereunder and of such
other administrative information as the Agent shall reasonably request.

11.11 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
separate counterparts, each of which, when so executed, shall be deemed an
original, and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to
constitute but one and the same instrument.

11.12 Severability. The illegality or unenforceability of any provision
of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder shall not in
any way affect or impair the legality or enforceability of the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or any instrument or agreement required hereunder.

11.13 No Third Parties Benefited. This Agreement is made and entered into
for the sole protection and legal benefit of the Borrower, the Banks, the Agent
and the Agent-Related Persons, and their permitted successors and assigns, and
no other Person shall be a direct or indirect legal beneficiary of, or have any
direct

108
<PAGE>

or indirect cause of action or claim in connection with, this Agreement or any
of the other Loan Documents.

11.14 Governing Law and Jurisdiction. (a) THIS AGREEMENT AND ALL NOTES
ISSUED HEREUNDER SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK; PROVIDED THAT THE AGENT AND THE BANKS SHALL RETAIN ALL
RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

(b) ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT OR
ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT MAY BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR
OF THE UNITED STATES FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND BY EXECUTION AND
DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE GENERAL PARTNER, STRATTON,
THE AGENT AND THE BANKS CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO
THE NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS. EACH OF THE BORROWER, THE
GENERAL PARTNER, STRATTON, THE AGENT AND THE BANKS IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY
OBJECTION, INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE
GROUNDS OF FORUM NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE
BRINGING OF ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY DOCUMENT RELATED HERETO. THE BORROWER, THE GENERAL PARTNER,
STRATTON, THE AGENT AND THE BANKS EACH WAIVE PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS,
COMPLAINT OR OTHER PROCESS, WHICH MAY BE MADE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PERMITTED BY
NEW YORK LAW.

11.15 Waiver of Jury Trial. THE BORROWER, THE GENERAL PARTNER, STRATTON,
THE BANKS AND THE AGENT EACH WAIVE THEIR RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF
ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT, THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY, IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LITIGATION OF ANY TYPE BROUGHT BY
ANY OF THE PARTIES AGAINST ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY AGENT-RELATED PERSON,
PARTICIPANT OR ASSIGNEE, WHETHER WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS,
OR OTHERWISE. THE BORROWER, THE GENERAL PARTNER, STRATTON, THE BANKS AND THE

Schedule 6.10

Federal Examination
- - -------------------

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has examined the Borrower's and Parent's
consolidated income tax returns for years ended July 31, 1987 and 1986 and has
proposed certain adjustments which relate principally to the purchase price
allocations for an acquisition made during 1987. As a result, the IRS has
proposed the following:

- - - To disallow $90 million of deductions for amortization of customer
relationships taken or to be taken on the Borrower's and Parent's
consolidated income tax returns.

On April 20, 1993, the United States Supreme Court held in Newark
Morning Ledger v. United States that a taxpayer may amortize customer
based intangibles if that taxpayer can prove such intangibles are
capable of being valued and whether that value diminishes over time.
The Borrower and Parent strongly contend they have met this burden of
proof and feel this recent landmark Supreme Court decision provides
definite authority for the positions taken during the Borrower's
allocation of purchase price to customer relationships. The valuation
of the customer relationships was prepared by Deloitte and Touche, a
national firm.

- - - To disallow $61 million of deductions taken for depreciation of customer
tanks. The Borrower and Parent assert the methods and principals used
during the valuation of the customer tanks are defensible. This valuation
was prepared by the American Appraisal Associates, a national firm.

The Borrower and Parent intend to vigorously defend against these proposed
adjustments and are in the process of protesting these adjustments through the
appeals process of the IRS. At this time, it is not possible to determine the
ultimate resolution of this matter.

__________, 1994

To: The Financial Institutions (the "Banks") from time to time party to the
Credit Agreement referred to below (the "Credit Agreement"), and

Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association, as Agent (in such
capacity, the "Agent")

Ladies and Gentlemen:

This opinion is being delivered in connection with that certain Credit
Agreement, dated as of July 5, 1994 (the "Credit Agreement"), among Ferrellgas,
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, ("Borrower"), Stratton Insurance Company,
Inc., a Vermont corporation and a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Borrower
("Stratton"), Ferrellgas, Inc , a Delaware corporation and the sole general
partner of Borrower ("General Partner"), the several financial institutions from
time to time party to the Credit Agreement ("Banks"), and Bank of America
National Trust and Savings Association, as agent for the Banks (in such
capacity, the "Agent").

References to Schedules, Sections and subsections are to such parts of
the Credit Agreement unless otherwise noted. Capitalized terms used herein
shall have the meanings given them in the Credit Agreement, unless specifically
defined herein.

We have acted as counsel to the Borrower, Stratton and the General
Partner in connection with the execution and delivery by each of them of the
Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which each is a party. We have
generally acted as counsel to affiliates of the Borrower since 1976.

We have also acted as counsel to Ferrellgas Finance Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Borrower, (at all times a
Subsidiary, and sometimes also referred to herein as "Guarantor"), in connection
with the execution and delivery by it of the Continuing Guaranty dated as of
____________, 1994 (the "Guaranty").
<PAGE>

In our capacity as such counsel, we have been furnished with and have
examined originals or copies, certified or otherwise identified to our
satisfaction as being true copies, of such records, agreements, instruments, and
documents as, in our judgment, are necessary or relevant as the basis for the
opinions expressed below.

We have obtained and relied upon such certificates and assurances from
public officials as we have deemed necessary. We have investigated such
questions of law and fact for the purpose of rendering this opinion as we have
deemed necessary.

Certain of the opinions rendered herein are qualified by the
discussion following the numbered paragraphs.

On the basis of the foregoing, and in reliance thereon, we are of the
opinion that:

1. The General Partner, Stratton, the Borrower and each of its
Subsidiaries:

(a) is a corporation or partnership duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation;

(b) has the power and authority and all material governmental
licenses, authorizations, consents and approvals to own its assets, carry on its
business in the manner contemplated by the Loan Documents and the Registration
Statements and to execute, deliver, and perform its obligations under the Loan
Documents and such additional obligations as are contemplated by the
Registration Statements;

(c) is duly qualified as a foreign corporation or partnership and is
licensed and in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction where its
ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct of its business
requires such qualification or license or where the failure so to qualify would
not have a Material Adverse Effect; and

(d) is in compliance with all material Requirements of Law.

2. The execution, delivery and performance by the Borrower, the
General Partner and Stratton of the Credit Agreement and each other Loan
Document to which the General Partner, the Borrower or any Subsidiary is party,
have been duly authorized by all necessary partnership action on behalf of the
Borrower and all necessary corporate action on behalf of the General Partner and
any Subsidiary, and do not and will not:

(a) contravene the terms of any of the General Partner's, the
Borrower's or any Subsidiary's Organization Documents;
<PAGE>

(b) conflict with or result in any breach or contravention of, or the
creation of any Lien under, any document evidencing any Contractual Obligation
of which we are aware to which the General Partner, the Borrower or any
Subsidiary is a party or any order, injunction, writ or decree of any
Governmental Authority to which such Person or its property is subject where
such conflict, breach, contravention or Lien could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect; or

(c) violate any material Requirement of Law.

3. No approval, consent, exemption, authorization, or other action
by, or notice to, or filing with, any Governmental Authority is necessary or
required in connection with (a) the consummation of the Reorganization according
to the terms and conditions described in the Registration Statements and in
accordance with applicable law, (b) the execution, delivery or performance by,
or enforcement against, the General Partner, the Borrower or any Subsidiary of
the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, or (c) the continued operation
of Borrower's business as contemplated to be conducted after the date hereof by
the Loan Documents and the Registration Statements except in each case such
approvals, consents, exemptions, authorizations or other actions, notices or
filings (i) as have been obtained, (ii) as may be required under state
securities or Blue Sky laws, (iii) as are of a routine or administrative nature
and are either (A) not customarily obtained or made prior to the consummation of
transactions such as the transactions described in clauses (a), (b) or (c), or
(B) expected to be obtained in the ordinary course of Borrower's business
subsequent to the consummation of the transactions described in clauses (a), (b)
or (c), or (iv) that, if not obtained, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

4. The Credit Agreement and each other Loan Document to which the
General Partner, the Borrower or any Subsidiary is a party constitute the legal,
valid and binding obligations of such Person, enforceable against such Person in
accordance with their respective terms, except as enforceability may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar laws affecting the enforcement
of creditors' rights generally or by equitable principles relating to
enforceability.

5. Except as specifically disclosed in Schedule 6.05, there are no
actions, suits, proceedings, claims or disputes pending, or to the best of our
knowledge, threatened or contemplated, at law, in equity, in arbitration or
before any Governmental Authority, against the General Partner, the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties which:

(a) purport to affect or pertain to the Credit Agreement or any other
Loan Document, the Registration Statements or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby; or
<PAGE>

(b) if determined adversely to the Borrower or its Subsidiaries, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No injunction, writ,
temporary restraining order or any order of any nature has been issued by any
court or other Governmental Authority purporting to enjoin or restrain the
execution, delivery or performance of the Credit Agreement or any other Loan
Document or any of the transactions contemplated by the Registration Statements,
or directing that the transactions provided for in the Loan Documents or the
Registration Statements not be consummated as therein provided.

6. To the best of our knowledge, no Default or Event of Default
exists or would result from the incurring, continuing or converting of any
Obligations by the Borrower. As of the Closing Date, to the best of our
knowledge neither the Borrower nor any Affiliate of the Borrower is in default
under or with respect to any Contractual Obligation in any respect that,
individually or together with all such defaults, could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, or that would, if such default had occurred
after the Closing Date, create an Event of Default under subsection 9.01(e)
other than a default under Section 4.09 of the Indenture relating to the
Existing Senior Notes.

7. (a) Each Plan is in compliance in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code and other federal or state law. Each
Plan which is intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has received
a favorable determination letter from the IRS and to the best of our knowledge,
nothing has occurred which would cause the loss of such qualification.

(b) There are no pending, or to the best of our knowledge, threatened
claims, actions or lawsuits, or actions by any Governmental Authority, with
respect to any Plan which has resulted or could reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect. There has been no prohibited transaction or other
violation of the fiduciary responsibility rule with respect to any Plan which
could reasonably result in a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) To the best of our knowledge, no ERISA Event has occurred or is
reasonably expected to occur with respect to any Pension Plan.

8. Neither the Borrower nor any Affiliate of the Borrower is
generally engaged in the business of purchasing or selling Margin Stock or
extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying Margin Stock.

9. To the best of our knowledge, there is no proposed tax assessment
against the Borrower that would, if made, have a Material Adverse Effect except
with respect to the Tax Audit as described in Schedule 6.10.

10. None of the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower, is an
"Investment Company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
The 
<PAGE>

Borrower is not subject to regulation under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, the Federal Power Act, the Interstate Commerce Act, any state
public utilities code, or any other Federal or state statute or regulation
limiting its ability to incur Indebtedness.

11. To the best of our knowledge, the Borrower or its Subsidiaries
own or are licensed or otherwise have the right to use all of the patents,
trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights, contractual franchises,
authorizations and other rights that are reasonably necessary for the operation
of their respective businesses, without conflict with the rights of any other
Person. To the best of our knowledge, no slogan or other advertising device,
product, process, method, substance, part or other material now employed, or now
contemplated to be employed, by the Borrower or any Subsidiary infringes upon
any rights held by any other Person. Except as specifically disclosed in
Schedule 6.15, no claim or litigation regarding any of the foregoing is pending
or threatened, and no patent, invention, device, application, principle or any
statute, law, rule, regulation, standard or code is pending or, to the best of
our knowledge, proposed, which, in either case, could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.

12. The Borrower has no Subsidiaries or other Affiliates other than
those specifically disclosed in part (a) of Schedule 6.16 and has no equity
investments in any other corporation or entity other than those Permitted
Investments specifically disclosed in part (b) of Schedule 6.16.

13. The Borrower is subject to taxation under the Code only as a
partnership and not as a corporation.

14. To the best of our knowledge, none of the representations or
warranties made by the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower in the Loan
Documents or any of the Registration Statements as of the date hereof, and none
of the statements contained in any exhibit, report, statement or certificate
furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Affiliate of the Borrower in
connection with the Loan Documents or the Registration Statements (including the
other offering and disclosure materials delivered by or on behalf of the
Borrower to the Banks prior to the Closing Date), contains any untrue statement
of a material fact or omits any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading as of the time when made or delivered.
<PAGE>

We hereby expressly authorize the Banks and the Agent to rely upon any
and all opinions delivered by us in connection with the Reorganization or the
Registration Statements, all as if such opinions were addressed to the Banks and
the Agent directly.

[Assumptions, Qualifications and Limitations]

The opinions expressed herein are solely for the benefit of the Banks
and the Agent in connection with the above transactions and may not be relied
upon or used in any manner or for any purposes by any other person, other than
counsel to the Banks and the Agent, or as required by law to comply with the
requirements of bank examiners acting under applicable law and regulations from

BORROWER: FERRELLGAS, L.P. and
STRATTON INSURANCE
COMPANY, INC.
GUARANTOR:

CONTINUING GUARANTY
-------------------

To: The Financial Institutions (the "Banks") from time to time party to the
Credit Agreement referred to below (the "Credit Agreement"), and

Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association, as Agent (in such
capacity, the "Agent")

(1) For valuable consideration, the undersigned ("Guarantor")
absolutely and unconditionally guarantees to the Agent and the Banks the payment
when due, upon maturity, acceleration or otherwise, of any and all indebtedness
of FERRELLGAS, L.P., a Delaware Limited Partnership, and STRATTON INSURANCE
COMPANY, INC., a Vermont corporation (collectively and severally, "Borrower").
If any or all of the indebtedness of Borrower to the Agent or the Banks becomes
due and payable hereunder, Guarantor absolutely and unconditionally promises to
pay such indebtedness to the Agent (for its account or the account of the Banks,
as the case may be), or order, on demand, in lawful money of the United States
of America. The word "indebtedness" is used herein in its most comprehensive
sense and includes any and all advances, debts, obligations and liabilities of
Borrower or either of them to the Agent and/or the Banks under or pursuant to
that certain Credit Agreement dated as of ______________, among Borrower,
Ferrellgas, Inc., a Delaware corporation, the Banks and the Agent, as the same
may be amended, 
<PAGE>

modified, supplemented or renewed from time to time (the "Credit Agreement"),
whether the same is heretofore, now, or hereafter made, incurred or created,
whether voluntary or involuntary and however arising, whether direct or acquired
by Agent or Banks by assignment or succession, absolute or contingent,
liquidated or unliquidated, determined or undetermined, and whether Borrower may
be liable individually or jointly with others, or whether recovery upon such
indebtedness may be or hereafter become barred by any statute of limitations, or
whether such indebtedness may be or hereafter become otherwise unenforceable.

(2) The liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty (exclusive of
liability under any other guaranties executed by Guarantor) shall not exceed at
any one time the total of (a) One Hundred Eighty-Five Million and 00/100 Dollars
($185,000,000.00), for the principal amount of the indebtedness, (b) all
interest, fees, and other costs and expenses relating to or arising out of the
indebtedness or such part of the indebtedness as shall not exceed the foregoing
limitation, and (c) attorneys' fees, costs and expenses as provided in paragraph
13 hereof. Agent and Banks may permit the indebtedness of Borrower to exceed
Guarantor's liability, and may apply any amounts received from any source, other
than from Guarantor, to the unguaranteed portion of Borrower's indebtedness.
This is a continuing guaranty relating to any indebtedness, including that
arising under successive transactions which shall either continue the
indebtedness or from time to time renew it after it has been satisfied. Any
payment by Guarantor shall not reduce Guarantor's maximum obligation hereunder,
unless written notice to that effect be actually received by Agent at or prior
to the time of such payment.
<PAGE>

(3) The obligations hereunder are independent of the obligations of
Borrower, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against
Guarantor whether action is brought against Borrower or whether Borrower be
joined in any such action or actions; and Guarantor waives the benefit of any
statute of limitations affecting Guarantor's liability hereunder.

(4) Guarantor authorizes Agent and Banks, without notice or demand and
without affecting Guarantor's liability hereunder, from time to time, either
before or after revocation hereof, to (a) renew, compromise, extend, accelerate
or otherwise change the time for payment of, or otherwise change the terms of
the indebtedness or any part thereof, including increase or decrease of the rate
of interest thereon; (b) receive and hold security for the payment of this
Guaranty or the indebtedness guaranteed, and exchange, enforce, waive, release,
fail to perfect, sell, or otherwise dispose of any such security; (c) apply such
security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as Agent in its
discretion may determine; and (d) release or substitute any one or more of the
endorsers or guarantors.

(5) Guarantor waives any right to require Agent or Banks to (a)
proceed against Borrower; (b) proceed against or exhaust any security held from
Borrower; or (c) pursue any other remedy in Agent's or Banks's power whatsoever.
Guarantor waives any defense arising by reason of any disability or other
defense of Borrower, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever of the liability
of Borrower, or any claim that Guarantor's obligations exceed or are more
burdensome than those of Borrower. Guarantor waives all presentments, demands
for performance, notices of nonperformance, protests, notices 
<PAGE>

of protest, notices of dishonor, and notices of acceptance of this Guaranty and
of the existence, creation, or incurring of new or additional indebtedness.

(6) Guarantor understands and acknowledges that if Agent forecloses
(for itself or on behalf of Banks), either by judicial foreclosure or by
exercise of power of sale, any deed of trust securing the indebtedness, that
foreclosure could impair or destroy any ability that Guarantor may have to seek
reimbursement, contribution or indemnification from Borrower or others based on
any right Guarantor may have of subrogation, reimbursement, contribution or
indemnification for any amounts paid by Guarantor under this Guaranty.
Guarantor further understands and acknowledges that in the absence of this
paragraph, such potential impairment or destruction of Guarantor's rights, if
any, may entitle Guarantor to assert a defense to this Guaranty. By executing
this Guaranty, Guarantor freely, irrevocably and unconditionally: (i) waives
and relinquishes that defense and agrees that Guarantor will be fully liable
under this Guaranty even though Agent may foreclose (for itself or on behalf of
Banks), either by judicial foreclosure or by exercise of power of sale, any deed
of trust securing the indebtedness; (ii) agrees that Guarantor will not assert
that defense in any action or proceeding which Agent or Banks may commence to
enforce this Guaranty; (iii) acknowledges and agrees that the rights and
defenses waived by Guarantor in this Guaranty include any right or defense that
Guarantor may have or be entitled to assert; and (iv) acknowledges and agrees
that Agent and Banks are relying on this waiver in creating the indebtedness,
and that this waiver is a material part of the consideration which Agent and
Banks are receiving for creating the indebtedness.
<PAGE>

(7) Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that Guarantor shall have the
sole responsibility for obtaining from Borrower such information concerning
Borrower's financial condition or business operations as Guarantor may require,
and that neither Agent nor Banks has any duty at any time to disclose to
Guarantor any information relating to the business operations or financial
conditions of Borrower.

(8) To secure all of Guarantor's obligations hereunder, Guarantor
assigns and grants to Agent (for the benefit of itself and the Banks) a security
interest in all moneys, securities and other property of Guarantor now or
hereafter in the possession of Agent, and all deposit accounts of Guarantor
maintained with Agent, and all proceeds thereof. Upon default or breach of any
of Guarantor's obligations to Agent or Banks, Agent or Banks may apply any
deposit account to reduce the indebtedness, and may foreclose any collateral as
provided in the Uniform Commercial Code and in any security agreements between
Agent or Banks and Guarantor.

(9) Any obligations of Borrower to Guarantor, now or hereafter
existing, including but not limited to, any obligations to Guarantor as
subrogees of Agent or Banks or resulting from Guarantor's performance under this
Guaranty, are hereby subordinated to the indebtedness. Such obligations of
Borrower to Guarantor if Agent so requests shall be enforced and performance
received by Guarantor as trustee for Agent and Banks and the proceeds thereof
shall be paid over to Agent on account of the indebtedness of Borrower to Agent
and Banks, but without reducing or affecting in any manner the liability of
Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guaranty.
<PAGE>

(10) This Guaranty may be revoked at any time by Guarantor in respect
to future transactions, unless there is a continuing consideration as to such
transactions which Guarantor does not renounce. Such revocation shall be
effective upon actual receipt by Agent at the address shown below of written
notice of revocation. Revocation shall not affect any of Guarantor's
obligations or Agent's or Banks's rights with respect to transactions which
precede Agent's receipt of such notice, regardless of whether or not the
indebtedness related to such transactions, before or after revocation, has been
renewed, compromised, extended, accelerated, or otherwise changed as to any of
its terms, including time for payment or increase or decrease of the rate of
interest thereon. Revocation by any other guarantor of Borrower's indebtedness
shall not affect any obligations of Guarantor. If this Guaranty is revoked,
returned, or canceled, and subsequently any payment or transfer of any interest
in property by Borrower to Agent or Banks is rescinded or must be returned by
Agent or Banks to Borrower, this Guaranty shall be reinstated with respect to
any such payment or transfer, regardless of any such prior revocation, return,
or cancellation.

(11) It is not necessary for Agent or Banks to inquire into the powers
of Borrower or of the officers, directors, partners or agents acting or
purporting to act on Borrower's behalf, and any indebtedness made or created in
reliance upon the professed exercise of such powers shall be guaranteed
hereunder.

(12) Agent and Banks may, without notice to Guarantor and without
affecting Guarantor's obligations hereunder, assign the indebtedness and this
Guaranty, in whole or in part. Guarantor agrees that Agent and Banks may
disclose to any 
<PAGE>

prospective purchaser and any purchaser of all or part of the indebtedness any
and all information in Agent's or Banks' possession concerning Guarantor, this
Guaranty and any security for this Guaranty.

(13) Guarantor agrees to pay to Agent, on demand, all out-of-pocket
expenses and attorneys' fees (including allocated costs for in-house legal
services) incurred by Agent or Banks prior to the commencement of any legal
action or arbitration proceeding in connection with the enforcement of this
Guaranty and any instrument or agreement required under this Guaranty. In the
event of a legal action or arbitration proceeding, the prevailing party shall be
entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees (including allocated costs for in-house
legal services), costs and necessary disbursements incurred in connection with
such action or proceeding, as determined by the court or arbitrator.

(14) (a) THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK; PROVIDED THAT THE AGENT AND
THE BANKS SHALL RETAIN ALL RIGHTS ARISING UNDER FEDERAL LAW.

(b) ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING WITH RESPECT TO THIS GUARANTY MAY
BE BROUGHT IN THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK OR OF THE UNITED STATES FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK, AND BY EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS
GUARANTY, GUARANTOR CONSENTS, FOR ITSELF AND IN RESPECT OF ITS PROPERTY, TO THE
NON-EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THOSE COURTS. GUARANTOR IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY
OBJECTION, 
<PAGE>

INCLUDING ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OR BASED ON THE GROUNDS OF FORUM
NON CONVENIENS, WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE BRINGING OF ANY ACTION
OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF THIS GUARANTY OR ANY DOCUMENT
RELATED HERETO. GUARANTOR WAIVES PERSONAL SERVICE OF ANY SUMMONS, COMPLAINT OR
OTHER PROCESS, WHICH MAY BE MADE BY ANY OTHER MEANS PERMITTED BY NEW YORK LAW.

(15) GUARANTOR WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY
CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
GUARANTY, IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR OTHER LITIGATION OF ANY TYPE, WHETHER
WITH RESPECT TO CONTRACT CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, OR OTHERWISE. GUARANTOR AGREES
THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE TRIED BY A COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A
JURY. WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, GUARANTOR AGREES THAT ITS RIGHT TO A
TRIAL BY JURY IS WAIVED BY OPERATION OF THIS SECTION AS TO ANY ACTION,
COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHER PROCEEDING WHICH SEEKS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, TO CHALLENGE
THE VALIDITY OR ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS GUARANTY OR ANY PROVISION HEREOF. THIS
WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR
MODIFICATIONS TO THIS GUARANTY.

Indenture, then such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio shall be calculated based upon
the Consolidated Cash Flow and the Fixed Charges of the General Partner for such

consolidated basis and in accordance with GAAP.

<PAGE>

The terms and provisions contained in the Notes annexed hereto as 
Exhibit A and Exhibit B, and the Guarantees annexed hereto as Exhibit C shall
- - --------- --------- ---------
constitute, and are hereby expressly made, a part of this Indenture. To the
extent applicable, the Company, each Guarantor and the Trustee, by their
execution and delivery of this Indenture, expressly agree to such terms and
provisions and to be bound thereby.

Section 2.02. Execution and Authentication.

At least one Officer of each of the General Partner (in the case of the
Partnership) and Finance Corp. shall sign the Notes for the Issuers by manual or
facsimile signature. The seal of each Issuer shall be reproduced on the Notes
and may be in facsimile form.

If an Officer of the General Partner or Finance Corp. whose signature is
on a Note no longer holds that office at the time the Note is authenticated, the
Note shall nevertheless be valid.

A Note shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of
the Trustee. The signature of the Trustee shall be conclusive evidence that the
Note has been authenticated under this Indenture. The form of Trustee's
certificate of authentication to be borne by the Notes shall be substantially as
set forth in Exhibit A hereto.

The Trustee shall, upon a written order of the Issuers signed by an
Officer of the General Partner and Finance Corp., authenticate Notes for
original issue up to an aggregate principal amount stated in paragraph 4 of the
Notes. The aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding at any time shall
not exceed the amount set forth herein except as provided in Section 2.07
hereof.

The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Issuers
to authenticate Notes. Unless limited by the terms of such appointment, an
authenticating agent may authenticate Notes whenever the Trustee may do so.
Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes
authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as an
Agent to deal with the Partnership or Finance Corp. or an Affiliate of the
Partnership or Finance Corp.

Section 2.03. Registrar and Paying Agent.

The Issuers shall maintain (i) an office or agency where Notes may be
presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (including any co-
registrar, the "Registrar") and (ii) an office or agency where Notes may be
presented for payment ("Paying Agent"). The Registrar shall keep a register of
the Notes and of their transfer and exchange. The Issuers may appoint one or
more co-registrars and one or more additional paying agents. The term "Paying
Agent" includes any additional paying agent. The Issuers may change any Paying
Agent, Registrar or co-registrar without prior notice to any Holder of a Note.
The Issuers shall notify the Trustee and the Trustee shall notify the Holders of
the Notes of the name and address of any Agent not a party to this Indenture.
The Partnership, Finance Corp. or any Guarantor may act as Paying Agent,
Registrar or co-registrar. The Issuers shall enter into an appropriate agency
agreement with any Agent not a party to this Indenture, which shall be subject
to any obligations imposed by the provisions of the TIA. The agreement shall
implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate to such Agent. The
Issuers shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of any such Agent. If
the Issuers fail to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, or fails to give the
foregoing 

14
<PAGE>

notice, the Trustee shall act as such, and shall be entitled to appropriate
compensation in accordance with Section 7.07 hereof.

The Issuers initially appoint the Trustee as Registrar, Paying Agent and
agent for service of notices and demands in connection with the Notes.

Section 2.04. Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust.

The Issuers shall require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to
agree in writing that the Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of
the Holders of the Notes or the Trustee all money held by the Paying Agent for
the payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, and
shall notify the Trustee of any Default by the Issuers or any Guarantors in
making any such payment. While any such Default continues, the Trustee may
require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. The Issuers
at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the
Trustee. Upon payment over to the Trustee, the Paying Agent (if other than the
Partnership, Finance Corp. or a Guarantor) shall have no further liability for
the money delivered to the Trustee. If the Partnership, Finance Corp. or any
Guarantor acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate and hold in a separate trust
fund for the benefit of the Holders of the Notes all money held by it as Paying
Agent. Upon any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding relating to the
Partnership, Finance Corp. or any Guarantor, the Trustee shall serve as Paying
Agent for the Notes.

Section 2.05. Lists of Holders of the Notes.

The Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably
practicable the most recent list available to it of the names and addresses of
Holders of the Notes and shall otherwise comply with TIA (S) 312(a). If the
Trustee is not the Registrar, the Issuers and/or any Guarantors shall furnish to
the Trustee at least seven Business Days before each interest payment date and
at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing a list in such form
and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and
addresses of Holders of the Notes, including the aggregate principal amount of
the Notes held by each thereof, and the Issuers and each Guarantor, if any,
shall otherwise comply with TIA (S) 312(a).

Section 2.06. Transfer and Exchange.

When Notes are presented to the Registrar with a request to register the
transfer or to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Notes of other
denominations, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange if
its requirements for such transactions are met; provided, however, that any Note
presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be duly
endorsed or accompanied by a written instruction of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Registrar and the Trustee duly executed by the Holder
thereof or by his attorney duly authorized in writing. To permit registrations
of transfer and exchanges, the Issuers shall issue and the Trustee shall
authenticate Notes at the Registrar's request, subject to such rules as the
Trustee may reasonably require.

Neither the Issuers nor the Registrar shall be required to (i) issue,
register the transfer of or exchange Notes during a period beginning at the
opening of business on a Business Day 15 days before the day of any selection of
Notes for redemption under Section 3.02 hereof or 

15
<PAGE>

(ii) register the transfer of or exchange any Note so selected for redemption in
whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Note being redeemed in
part.

No service charge shall be made to any Holder of a Note for any
registration of transfer or exchange (except as otherwise expressly permitted
herein), but the Issuers may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith
(other than such transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable upon
exchanges pursuant to Sections 2.10, 3.06 or 9.05 hereof, which shall be paid by
the Issuers).

Prior to due presentment to the Trustee for registration of the transfer
of any Note, the Trustee, any Agent, the Issuers and each Guarantor, if any, may
deem and treat the Person in whose name any Note is registered as the absolute
owner of such Note for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of,
premium, if any, and interest on such Note and for all other purposes
whatsoever, whether or not such Note is overdue, and none of the Trustee, any
Agent, the Issuers or any Guarantor shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

Section 2.07. Replacement Notes.

If any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Trustee, or the Issuers and
the Trustee receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or
theft of any Note, the Issuers shall issue and the Trustee, upon the written
order of the Issuers signed by (i) two Officers of the General Partner and (ii)
two Officers of Finance Corp., shall authenticate a replacement Note if the
Trustee's requirements for replacements of Notes are met. If required by the
Trustee, the Issuers or the Guarantors, if any, an indemnity bond must be
supplied by the Holder that is sufficient in the judgment of the Trustee, the
Issuers and the Guarantors to protect the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Trustee,
any Agent or any authenticating agent from any loss which any of them may suffer
if a Note is replaced. Each of the Partnership, Finance Corp, each Guarantor
and the Trustee may charge for its expenses in replacing a Note.

Every replacement Note is an additional obligation of the Issuers and the
Guarantors, if any, and shall be entitled to all of the benefits of this
Indenture equally and ratably with all other Notes duly issued hereunder.

Section 2.08. Outstanding Notes.

The Notes outstanding at any time are all the Notes authenticated by the
Trustee except for those cancelled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation
and those described in this Section 2.08 as not outstanding. If a Note is
replaced pursuant to Section 2.07 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding unless the
Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Note is held by a
bona fide purchaser. If the principal amount of any Note is considered paid
under Section 4.01 hereof, it ceases to be outstanding and interest on it ceases
to accrue. Subject to Section 2.09 hereof, a Note does not cease to be
outstanding because the Partnership, Finance Corp., any Guarantor, a Subsidiary
of the Partnership, Finance Corp. or any Guarantor or an Affiliate of the
Partnership, Finance Corp. or any Guarantor holds the Note.

Section 2.09. Treasury Notes.

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of
Notes have concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, Notes owned by the
Partnership, Finance Corp., 

16
<PAGE>

any Guarantor, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of the
Partnership, Finance Corp. or any Guarantor shall be considered as though not
outstanding, except that for purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall
be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver or consent, only Notes
which a Responsible Officer knows to be so owned shall be so considered.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Notes that are to be acquired by the Partnership,
Finance Corp., any Guarantor, any Subsidiary of the Partnership, Finance Corp.
or any Guarantor or an Affiliate of the Partnership, Finance Corp. or any
Guarantor pursuant to an exchange offer, tender offer or other agreement shall
not be deemed to be owned by the Partnership, Finance Corp., such Guarantor, a
Subsidiary of the Partnership, Finance Corp. or such Guarantor or an Affiliate
of the Partnership, Finance Corp. or such Guarantor until legal title to such
Notes passes to the Partnership, Finance Corp., such Guarantor, Subsidiary of
the Partnership, Finance Corp. or such Guarantor or Affiliate of the
Partnership, Finance Corp. or such Guarantor, as the case may be.

Section 2.10. Temporary Notes.

Until definitive Notes are ready for delivery, the Issuers may prepare and
the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Notes. Temporary Notes shall be
substantially in the form of definitive Notes but may have variations that the
Issuers and the Trustee consider appropriate for temporary Notes. Without
unreasonable delay, the Issuers shall prepare and the Trustee, upon receipt of
the written order of the Issuers signed by (i) two Officers of the General
Partner and (ii) two Officers of Finance Corp., shall authenticate definitive
Notes in exchange for temporary Notes. Until such exchange, temporary Notes
shall be entitled to the same rights, benefits and privileges as definitive
Notes.

Section 2.11. Cancellation.

The Issuers at any time may deliver Notes to the Trustee for cancellation.
The Registrar and Paying Agent shall forward to the Trustee any Notes
surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The
Trustee shall cancel all Notes surrendered for registration of transfer,
exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and shall destroy cancelled Notes
(subject to the record retention requirement of the Exchange Act), unless the
Issuers direct cancelled Notes to be returned to them. The Issuers may not
issue new Notes to replace Notes that they have redeemed or paid or that have
been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation. All cancelled Notes held by the
Trustee shall be destroyed and certification of their destruction delivered to
the Issuers, unless by a written order, signed by (i) two Officers of the
General Partner and (ii) two Officers of Finance Corp., the Issuers shall direct
that cancelled Notes be returned to them.

Section 2.12. Defaulted Interest.

If the Issuers or any Guarantor defaults in a payment of interest on the
Notes, the Issuers or such Guarantor (to the extent of its obligations under its
Note Guarantees) shall pay the defaulted interest in any lawful manner plus, to
the extent lawful, interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the Persons
who are Holders of the Notes on a subsequent special record date, which date
shall be at the earliest practicable date but in all events at least five
Business Days prior to the payment date, in each case at the rate provided in
the Notes and in Section 4.01 hereof. The Issuers shall fix or cause to be
fixed each such special record date and payment date, and shall, promptly
thereafter, notify the Trustee of any such date. At least 15 days before the
special record date, the Issuers (or the Trustee, in the name of and at the
expense of the Issuers) shall 

17
<PAGE>

mail to Holders of the Notes a notice that states the special record date, the
related payment date and the amount of such interest to be paid.

Section 2.13. Record Date.

The record date for purposes of determining the identity of Holders of the
Notes entitled to vote or consent to any action by vote or consent authorized or
permitted under this Indenture shall be determined as provided for in TIA (S)
316(c).

Section 2.14. CUSIP Number.

The Issuers in issuing the Notes may use a "CUSIP" number and, if they do
so, the Trustee shall use the CUSIP number in notices of redemption or exchange
as a convenience to Holders; provided that any such notice may state that no
representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number
printed in the notice or on the Notes and that reliance may be placed only on
the other identification numbers printed on the Notes. The Issuers will
promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP number.

Section 3.02. Selection of Notes to Be Purchased or Redeemed.

18
<PAGE>

If the Issuers elect to redeem less than all of either series of Notes
pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of Section 3.07 hereof and
paragraph 5 of the applicable series of Notes, the Trustee shall select the
Notes to be redeemed as follows:

The Trustee shall select the Floating Rate Senior Notes or Fixed Rate
Senior Notes (as applicable) to be redeemed among the Holders of the same series
of Notes on a pro rata basis, by lot or in accordance with any other method the
trustee considers fair and appropriate.

If less than all of the Notes properly tendered in an Asset Sale Offer
pursuant to Sections 3.09 and 4.10 hereof are to be purchased, the Trustee shall
select the Floating Rate Senior Notes and Fixed Rate Senior Notes to be
purchased as follows:

The Trustee shall select the Notes to be purchased between the Floating
Rate Senior Notes and the Fixed Rate Senior Notes on a pro rata basis and then
among the Holders of Floating Rate Senior Notes and Fixed Rate Senior Notes on a
pro rata basis.

The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuers in writing of the Notes
selected for redemption and, in the case of any Note selected for partial
purchase or redemption, the principal amount thereof to be purchased or
redeemed. Notes and portions of Notes selected shall be in amounts of $1,000 or
whole multiples of $1,000; except that if all of the Notes of a Holder are to be
purchased or redeemed, the entire outstanding amount of Notes held by such
Holder, even if not a multiple of $1,000, shall be purchased or redeemed.
Except as provided in the preceding sentence, provisions of this Indenture that
apply to Notes called for redemption also apply to portions of Notes called for
redemption.

In the event the Issuers are required to make an Asset Sale Offer pursuant
to Section 4.10 hereof and the amount of Excess Proceeds to be applied to such
purchase would result in the purchase of a principal amount of Notes which is
not evenly divisible by $1,000, the Trustee shall promptly refund to the Issuers
the portion of such Excess Proceeds that is not necessary to purchase the
immediately lesser principal amount of Notes that is so divisible.

Section 3.03. Notice of Redemption.

At least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a redemption date, the
Issuers shall mail or cause to be mailed, by first class mail, a notice of
redemption to each Holder whose Notes are to be redeemed at its registered
address.

19
<PAGE>

The notice shall identify the Notes to be redeemed and shall state:

(a) the redemption date;

(b) the redemption price;

(c) if any Note is being redeemed in part, the portion of the principal
amount of such Note to be redeemed and that, after the redemption date upon
surrender of such Note, a new Note or Notes in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion shall be issued upon cancellation of the original Note;

(d) the name and address of the Paying Agent;

(e) that Notes called for redemption must be surrendered to the Paying
Agent to collect the redemption price;

(f) that, unless the Issuers default in making such redemption payment,
interest on Notes called for redemption ceases to accrue on and after the
redemption date;

(g) the paragraph of the Notes and/or Section of this Indenture
pursuant to which the Notes called for redemption are being redeemed; and

(h) that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of
the CUSIP number, if any, listed in such notice or printed on the Notes.

At the Issuers' request, the Trustee shall give the notice of redemption
in the Issuers' name and at their expense; provided, however, that the Issuers
shall have delivered to the Trustee, at least 45 days prior to the redemption
date, an Officers' Certificate requesting that the Trustee give such notice and
setting forth the information to be stated in such notice as provided in the
preceding paragraph (which request may be revoked by so notifying the Trustee in
writing on or before the Business Day immediately preceding the date requested
for the mailing of such notice).

Section 3.04. Effect of Notice of Redemption.

Once notice of redemption is mailed in accordance with Section 3.03
hereof, Notes called for redemption become irrevocably due and payable on the
redemption date at the redemption price. A notice of redemption may not be
conditional.

Section 3.05. Deposit of Redemption Price.

One Business Day prior to the redemption date, the Issuers shall deposit
with the Trustee or with the Paying Agent money sufficient to pay the redemption
price of and accrued interest on all Notes to be redeemed on that date. The
Trustee or the Paying Agent shall promptly return to the Issuers any money
deposited with the Trustee or the Paying Agent by the Issuers in excess of the
amounts necessary to pay the redemption price of, and accrued interest on, all
Notes to be redeemed.

20
<PAGE>

If the Issuers comply with the provisions of the preceding paragraph, on
and after the redemption date, interest shall cease to accrue on the Notes or
the portions of Notes called for redemption. If a Note is redeemed on or after
an interest record date but on or prior to the related interest payment date,
then any accrued and unpaid interest shall be paid to the Person in whose name
such Note was registered at the close of business on such record date. If any
Note called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender for redemption
because of the failure of the Issuers to comply with the preceding paragraph,
interest shall be paid on the unpaid principal, from the redemption date until
such principal is paid, and to the extent lawful on any interest not paid on
such unpaid principal, in each case at the rate provided in the Notes and in
Section 4.01 hereof.

Section 3.06. Notes Redeemed in Part.

Upon surrender of a Note that is redeemed in part, the Issuers shall issue
and, upon the Issuers' written request, the Trustee shall authenticate for the
Holder at the expense of the Issuers a new Note equal in principal amount to the
unredeemed portion of the Note surrendered.

Section 3.07. Optional Redemption.

The Issuers may redeem all or any portion of either series of Notes, upon
the terms and at the redemption prices set forth in paragraph 5 of the
applicable series of Notes. Any redemption pursuant to this Section 3.07 shall
be made pursuant to the provisions of Sections 3.01 through 3.06 hereof.

Section 3.08. Mandatory Redemption.

The Company shall redeem $5,000,000 principal amount of the Floating Rate
Senior Notes on each of August 1, 1999 and August 1, 2000, upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph 6 of the Floating Rate Senior
Notes. Except pursuant to the preceding sentence and as set forth below under
Section 4.10 and Section 4.14 hereof, the Issuers shall not be required to make
mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the Notes.

Section 3.09. Asset Sale Offers.

(a) In the event that, pursuant to Section 4.10 hereof, the Issuers shall
be required to commence an offer to all Holders to purchase Notes (an "Asset
Sale Offer"), it shall follow the procedures specified in this Section 3.09.

(b) The Asset Sale Offer shall commence on the date (the "Commencement
Date") specified in Section 4.10 hereof and shall remain open for a period
specified by the Issuers, which shall be in accordance with Section 4.10 hereof
(the "Offer Period"). No later than five Business Days after the termination of
the Offer Period and, in any event, on a Floating Rate Interest Payment Date (as
defined in the Floating Rate Senior Notes) (the "Purchase Date"), the Issuers
shall purchase the principal amount of Notes required to be purchased pursuant
to Section 4.10 hereof (the "Offer Amount") or, if less than the Offer Amount
has been tendered, all Notes tendered in response to such Asset Sale Offer.
Payment for any Notes so purchased shall be made in the same manner as interest
payments are made.

21

If the Purchase Date is on or after an interest record date and on or
before the related interest payment date, any accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, shall be paid to the Person in whose name a Note is registered at the close
of business on such record date, and no additional interest shall be payable to
Holders who tender Notes pursuant to such Asset Sale Offer.

Upon the commencement of an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuers shall send, by
first class mail, a notice to the Trustee and each of the Holders. The notice
shall contain all instructions and materials necessary to enable such Holders to
tender Notes pursuant to such Asset Sale Offer. The Asset Sale Offer shall be
made to all Holders. The notice, which shall govern the terms of the Asset Sale
Offer, shall state:

hereof, the Offer Period, and the expiration date of the Offer Period;

(b) the Offer Amount, the purchase price and the Purchase Date;

(c) that any Note not tendered and accepted for payment shall continue
to accrue interest;

(d) that, unless the Issuers default in making such payment, any Note

Asset Sale Offer shall be required to surrender the Note, with the form
entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the Note
completed, to the Issuers, a depositary, if appointed by the Issuers, or a
Paying Agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of the
Offer Period;

(g) that Holders shall be entitled to withdraw their election if the
Issuers, the depositary or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, receives,
not later than the close of the Offer Period, a telegram, telex, facsimile
transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal
amount of the Note the Holder delivered for purchase and a statement that
such Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Note purchased;

(h) that, if the aggregate principal amount of Notes surrendered by
Holders exceeds the Offer Amount, the Notes to be purchased shall be selected
pursuant to the terms of Section 3.02 hereof, and that Holders whose Notes
were purchased only in part shall be issued new Notes (accompanied by a
notation of the Note Guarantees duly endorsed by each Guarantor) equal in
principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered; and

(i) the circumstances and material facts regarding the Asset Sale or
Asset Sales giving rise to such Asset Sale Offer, including but not limited
to, information with respect to pro forma and historical financial
information if material operations of the Partnership or any Subsidiary were
divested in such Asset Sale or Asset Sales.

On or before the Purchase Date, the Issuers shall, to the extent lawful,
accept for payment, pursuant to the terms of Section 3.02 hereof, the Offer
Amount of Notes or portions 

22
<PAGE>

thereof tendered pursuant to the Asset Sale Offer, or if less than the Offer
Amount has been tendered, all Notes tendered, and shall deliver to the Trustee
an Officers' Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were
accepted for payment by the Issuers in accordance with the terms of this Section
3.09. The Issuers, the depositary or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall
promptly (but in any case not later than five days after the Purchase Date) mail
or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the
Notes tendered by such Holder and accepted by the Issuers for purchase, and the
Issuers shall promptly issue a new Note, and the Trustee, upon written request
from the Issuers shall authenticate and mail or deliver such new Note to such
Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note
surrendered. Any Note not so accepted shall be promptly mailed or delivered by
the Issuers to the Holder thereof. The Issuers shall publicly announce the
results of such Asset Sale Offer on the Purchase Date.

Other than as specifically provided in this Section 3.09, any purchase
pursuant to this Section 3.09 shall be made pursuant to the provisions of
Sections 3.01 through 3.06 hereof to the extent applicable.

period, would have been more than 2.25 to 1;

(c) such Restricted Payment (the amount of any such payment, if other

Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees, (iii) applicable law, (iv) any
instrument governing Indebtedness or Capital Interests of a Person acquired by
the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries as in effect at the time of such

27
<PAGE>

restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any
Person, other than the Person, or the property or assets of the Person, so
acquired, provided that the Consolidated Cash Flow of such Person to the extent
that dividends, distributions, loans, advances or transfers thereof is limited
by such encumbrance or restriction on the date of acquisition is not taken into
account in determining whether such acquisition was permitted by the terms of
the Indenture, (v) customary non-assignment provisions in leases entered into in
the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practices, (vi)
purchase money obligations for property acquired in the ordinary course of
business that impose restrictions of the nature described in clause (d) above on

permitted to be incurred hereunder and that is incurred to extend, refinance,
renew, replace, defease or refund Indebtedness outstanding pursuant to the

Interests.

The Partnership shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, issue, assume, guarantee or otherwise
become directly or indirectly liable with respect to (collectively, "incur") any
Indebtedness (including Acquired Debt) and the Partnership shall not issue any
Disqualified Interests and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to issue any
shares of preferred stock; provided, however, that the Partnership may incur
Indebtedness and any Subsidiary of the Partnership may incur Acquired Debt if:

(a) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Partnership's most recently
ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements are
available immediately preceding the date on which such additional
Indebtedness is incurred would have been at least 2.75 to 1 if such date is
on or prior to August 1, 1996 and 3.00 to 1 if such date is after August 1,
1996, in each case, determined on a pro forma basis (including a pro forma
application of the net proceeds therefrom), as if the additional Indebtedness
had been incurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period; and

(b) either (x) such Indebtedness shall be subordinated in right of
payment to the Notes and shall have a Weighted Average Life to Maturity
greater than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Notes or
(y) such Indebtedness shall be Permitted Senior Debt and the Senior Debt
Ratio Test shall have been met at the time of incurrence thereof.

The foregoing limitations of this Section 4.09 will not apply to: (i) the

purposes in an aggregate outstanding principal amount not to exceed $20 million
at any time on or prior to August 1, 1996 and $40 million thereafter, provided,
in each case, that the outstanding principal balance of such revolving
Indebtedness (or, if such revolving Indebtedness is incurred as an addition or
extension to the Credit Facility, the outstanding principal balance under the
Credit Facility in excess of the limits set forth in clause (ii) above) shall be
reduced to zero for a period of 30 consecutive days during each fiscal year;
(iv) the incurrence by the Partnership of Indebtedness in respect of Capitalized
Lease Obligations in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $15 million;
(v) the Existing Indebtedness; (vi) the incurrence by the

or such Subsidiary not incurred in violation of the Indenture; (vii) Hedging
Obligations that are incurred for the purpose of fixing or hedging interest rate
risk with respect to any floating rate Indebtedness that is permitted by the
terms of the Indenture to be outstanding; (viii) Indebtedness of any Subsidiary
of the Partnership to the Partnership or any of its Wholly Owned Subsidiaries;
(ix) the incurrence by the Partnership or the Insurance Company Subsidiary of
Indebtedness owing directly to its insurance carriers (without duplication) in
connection with the Partnership's, its Subsidiaries' or its Affiliates' self-
insurance programs or other similar forms of retained insurable rights for their
respective retail propane businesses, consisting of reinsurance agreements and
indemnification agreements (and guarantees of the foregoing) secured by letters
of credit, provided that the Indebtedness evidenced by such reinsurance
agreements, indemnification agreements, guarantees and letters of credit shall
be counted (without duplication) for purposes of all calculations pursuant to
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test above; (x) surety bonds and appeal bonds
required in the ordinary course of business or in connection with the
enforcement of rights or claims of the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries or
in connection with judgments that do not result in a Default or Event of
Default; (xi) the incurrence by the Partnership (or any Subsidiary of the
Partnership that is a Guarantor) of Indebtedness in connection with acquisitions
of retail propane businesses in favor of the sellers of such businesses in a
principal amount not to exceed $15 million in any fiscal year or $45 million in
the aggregate outstanding at any one time, provided that the principal amount of
such Indebtedness incurred in connection with any such acquisition shall not
exceed the fair market value of the assets so acquired; and (xii) in addition to
the Indebtedness permitted under the foregoing clauses (i) through (xi), the
incurrence by the Partnership of Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount
outstanding not to exceed $15 million at any time, provided that any
Indebtedness incurred pursuant to this clause (xii) shall be subordinated in
right of payment to the Notes and shall have a Weighted Average Life to Maturity
greater than the remaining Weighted Average Life to Maturity of the Notes.

The "Senior Debt Ratio Test" will be met with respect to the incurrence of
any Indebtedness by the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Partnership if the
ratio of (1) the aggregate outstanding principal amount of Senior Debt on the
date of and after giving effect to the incurrence of such Indebtedness (the
"Incurrence Date") to (2) the Consolidated Cash Flow for the Partnership's most
recently ended four full fiscal quarters for which internal financial statements
are available immediately preceding the Incurrence Date would have been 2.50 to
1 or less. For purposes of the computation in clause (1) of the foregoing
sentence, the outstanding principal amount of Indebtedness under the Credit
Facility shall be deemed to equal the principal amount of such Indebtedness
actually outstanding plus the maximum additional principal amount of such
Indebtedness available thereunder, and letters of credit shall be deemed to have
a principal amount equal to the maximum potential liability of the Partnership
or any of its Subsidiaries thereunder. The foregoing calculation of
Consolidated Cash Flow shall give pro forma effect to acquisitions (including
all mergers and consolidations), dispositions and discontinuance of operations
that have been made by the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries during the
four-quarter reference period or subsequent to such reference period and on or
prior to the Incurrence Date assuming that all such acquisitions, dispositions
and discontinuance of operations had occurred on the first day of the four-
quarter reference period in the same manner as described in the definition of
"Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio".

<PAGE>

For purposes of this Section 4.09, any revolving Indebtedness (under the
Credit Facility or otherwise) shall be deemed to have been incurred only at such
time at which the agreements and instruments (or any amendments thereto that
increase the amount, reduce the Weighted Average Life to Maturity, change any
subordination provisions or create any additional obligor of such revolving
Indebtedness) are executed, in an amount equal to the maximum amount of such
revolving Indebtedness permitted to be borrowed thereunder, and the
Partnership's ability to borrow or reborrow such revolving Indebtedness up to
such maximum permitted amount shall not thereafter be limited by the provisions
of this Section 4.09 (other than the proviso set forth in clause (iii) of the
second paragraph of this Section 4.09.)

Section 4.10. Asset Sales.

The Partnership shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, (i) sell, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of any assets (including by way
of a sale-and-leaseback) other than sales of inventory in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice (provided that the sale, lease,
conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Partnership shall be governed by the provisions of Sections 4.14 and/or 5.01
hereof and not by the provisions of this Section 4.10), or (ii) issue or sell
Equity Interests of any of its Subsidiaries, in the case of either clause (i) or
(ii) above, whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions,
(a) that have a fair market value in excess of $5 million, or (b) for net
proceeds in excess of $5 million (each of the foregoing, an "Asset Sale"),
unless (x) the Partnership (or the Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives
consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the fair market
value (evidenced by a resolution of the Board of Directors set forth in an
Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee) of the assets sold or otherwise
disposed of and (y) at least 80% of the consideration therefor received by the
Partnership or such Subsidiary is in the form of cash; provided, however, that
the amount of (A) any liabilities (as shown on the Partnership's or such
Subsidiary's most recent balance sheet or in the notes thereto), of the
Partnership or any Subsidiary (other than liabilities that are by their terms
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes) that are assumed by the
transferee of any such assets and (B) any notes or other obligations received by
the Partnership or any such Subsidiary from such transferee that are immediately
converted by the Partnership or such Subsidiary into cash (to the extent of the
cash received), shall be deemed to be cash for purposes of this provision; and
provided, further, that the 80% limitation referred to in this clause (y) shall
not apply to any Asset Sale in which the cash portion of the consideration
received therefrom, determined in accordance with the foregoing proviso, is
equal to or greater than what the after-tax proceeds would have been had such
Asset Sale complied with the aforementioned 80% limitation. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Asset Sales shall not be deemed to include (1) any transfer of assets
by the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries to a Subsidiary of the Partnership
that is a Guarantor, (2) any transfer of assets by the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries to any Person in exchange for other assets used in a line of
business permitted under Section 4.16 hereof and having a fair market value not
less than that of the assets so transferred and (3) any transfer of assets
pursuant to a Permitted Investment.

Within 270 days after any Asset Sale, the Partnership may apply the Net
Proceeds from such Asset Sale to (a) permanently reduce Indebtedness outstanding
under the Credit Facility (with a permanent reduction of availability in the
case of revolving Indebtedness) or (b) an investment in capital expenditures or
other long-term tangible assets, in each case, in the same line of business as
the Partnership was engaged in on the date of this Indenture. Pending the final
application of any such Net Proceeds, the Partnership may temporarily reduce
borrowings 

30
<PAGE>

under the Credit Facility or otherwise invest such Net Proceeds in any manner
that is not prohibited by this Indenture. Any Net Proceeds from the Asset Sale
that are not applied or invested as provided in the first sentence of this
paragraph will be deemed to constitute "Excess Proceeds." When the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $15 million, the Issuers shall make an Asset
Sale Offer to all Holders of Notes to purchase the maximum principal amount of
Notes that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in
cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Article 3 hereof. The Issuers shall commence an Asset
Sale Offer with respect to Excess Proceeds within 10 Business Days after the
date that Excess Proceeds exceeds $15 million by mailing the notice required in
Section 3.09 hereof to the Holders. The Offer Period shall be not less than 30
days and not more than 40 days, unless a longer period is required by law. The
Issuers shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act
and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws
and regulations are applicable in connection with such Asset Sale Offer. To the
extent that the aggregate amount of Notes tendered pursuant to such Asset Sale
Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Partnership may use such deficiency
for general business purposes. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes
surrendered by Holders thereof exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the
Trustee shall select the Notes to be purchased on a pro rata basis. Upon
completion of such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be
reset at zero.

Section 4.11. Transactions with Affiliates.

The Partnership shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of its properties or
assets to, or purchase any property or assets from, or enter into any contract,
agreement, understanding, loan, advance or guarantee with, or for the benefit
of, any Affiliate, including any Non-Recourse Subsidiary (each of the foregoing,
an "Affiliate Transaction"), unless (a) such Affiliate Transaction is on terms
that are no less favorable to the Partnership or the relevant Subsidiary than
those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the
Partnership or such Subsidiary with an unrelated Person and (b) with respect to
(i) any Affiliate Transaction with an aggregate value in excess of $500,000, a
majority of the directors of the General Partner having no direct or indirect
economic interest in such Affiliate Transaction determines by resolution that
such Affiliate Transaction complies with clause (a) above and approves such
Affiliate Transaction and (ii) any Affiliate Transaction involving the purchase
or other acquisition or sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of properties
or assets other than in the ordinary course of business, in each case, having a
fair market value or for net proceeds in excess of $15 million, the Partnership
delivers to the Trustee an opinion as to the fairness to the Partnership or such
Subsidiary from a financial point of view issued by an investment banking firm
of national standing; provided, however, that (i) any employment agreement or
stock option agreement entered into by the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business and consistent with the past
practice of the Partnership (or the General Partner) or such Subsidiary, (ii)
Restricted Payments permitted by the provisions of Section 4.07 hereof, and
(iii) transactions entered into by the Partnership or the Insurance Company
Subsidiary in the ordinary course of business in connection with reinsuring the
self-insurance programs or other similar forms of retained insurable risks of
the retail propane businesses operated by the Partnership, its Subsidiaries and
its Affiliates, in each case, shall not be deemed Affiliate Transactions.

Section 4.12. Liens.

The Partnership shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, directly or indirectly, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien on
any asset now owned or hereafter acquired, or any income or profits therefrom or
assign or convey any right to receive income therefrom, except Permitted Liens.

Section 4.13. Subsidiary Note Guarantees.

The Partnership may, at any time that it transfers or causes to be
transferred to any of its Subsidiaries assets, businesses or properties having a
fair market value (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors, whose
determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a resolution of such Board)
of $5 million or more, cause such Subsidiary to unconditionally guarantee,
jointly and severally, the Issuers' payment obligations under the Notes as
provided in Article 10 hereof pursuant to a supplemental indenture in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B, together with an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
that such supplemental indenture has been duly executed and delivered by such
Subsidiary and is in compliance with the terms of this Indenture.

Section 4.14. Offer to Purchase Upon Change of Control.

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Issuers shall make an
offer (a "Change of Control Offer") to each Holder to purchase all or any part
of such Holder's Notes on the next succeeding Floating Rate Interest Payment
Date which is at least 40 days after the Change of Control (the "Change of
Control Payment Date") at an offer price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date
of purchase (the "Change of Control Payment"). The Issuers shall comply with
the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities
laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations are
applicable in connection with such Change of Control Offer.

The Issuers shall commence such Change of Control Offer within 10 days
following any Change of Control by mailing a notice of such Change of Control to
each Holder at its last registered address with a copy to the Trustee and the
Paying Agent. The Change of Control Offer shall remain open from the time of
mailing until the close of business on the Business Day preceding the Change of
Control Payment Date. The notice, which shall govern the terms of the Change of
Control Offer, shall state:

(1) that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this
Section 4.14 and that all Notes tendered will be accepted for payment;

(2) the amount of the Change of Control Payment and the Change of Control
Payment Date;

(3) that any Notes not tendered will continue to accrue interest in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture;

(4) that, unless the Issuers default in the payment of the Change of
Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change
of Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest after the Change of
Control Payment Date;

32
<PAGE>

(5) that Holders electing to have Notes purchased pursuant to the Change
of Control Offer will be required to surrender their Notes, with the
form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of
the Note completed, to the Paying Agent at the address specified in
the notice prior to the close of business on the Business Day
preceding the Change of Control Payment Date;

(6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the Paying
Agent receives, not later than the close of business on the Business
Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date, a telegram, telex,
facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder,
the principal amount of Notes the Holder delivered for purchase, and a
statement that such Holder is withdrawing its election to have such
Notes purchased;

(7) that Holders whose Notes are being purchased only in part will be
issued new Notes equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion
of the Notes surrendered, which unpurchased portion must be equal to
$1,000 in principal amount or an integral multiple thereof; and

(8) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of Control
(including, but not limited to, information with respect to pro forma
historical financial information after giving effect to such Change of
Control, information regarding the Person or Persons acquiring control
and such Person's or Persons' business plans going forward).

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Issuers shall, to the extent
lawful, (i) accept for payment Notes or portions thereof tendered pursuant to
the Change of Control Offer, (ii) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal
to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Notes or portions thereof so
tendered and (iii) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee the Notes so
accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating the Notes or portions
thereof tendered to the Issuers. The Paying Agent shall promptly, but in no
event later than three Business Days following the Change of Control Payment
Date, mail to each Holder of Notes so accepted payment in an amount equal to the
Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Issuers shall promptly issue a
new Note, and the Trustee shall authenticate and mail or deliver a new Note to
such Holder equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes
surrendered, if any; provided, that each such new Note shall be in a principal
amount of $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof. The Issuers shall publicly
announce in The Wall Street Journal, or if no longer published, a national
newspaper of general circulation the results of the Change of Control Offer on
or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date.

Section 4.15. Partnership or Corporate Existence.

Subject to Article 5 and Article 10 hereof, as the case may be, each
Issuer and each of the Guarantors, if any, shall do or cause to be done all
things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect (i) its corporate
or partnership existence, and the corporate or partnership existence of each of
their Subsidiaries, in accordance with the respective organizational documents
(as the same may be amended from time to time) of each Issuer, any such
Guarantor or any such Subsidiary, as the case may be, and (ii) the rights
(charter and statutory), licenses and franchises of each Issuer, the Guarantors
and their respective Subsidiaries; provided, however, that the Issuers and the
Guarantors shall not be required to preserve any such right, 

33
<PAGE>

license or franchise, or the corporate, partnership or other existence of any of
their respective Subsidiaries, if an officer of the General Partner or Finance
Corp., as the case may be, shall determine that the preservation thereof is no
longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Issuers, the Guarantors
and their Subsidiaries, taken as a whole and that the loss thereof is not
adverse in any material respect to the Holders of the Notes.

Section 4.16. Line of Business.

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries will not materially or substantially engage in any business other
than that in which the Partnership and its Subsidiaries were engaged on the date
of this Indenture.

The Partnership will not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
enter into any arrangement with any Person providing for the leasing by the
Partnership or such Subsidiary of any property that has been or is to be sold or
transferred by the Partnership or such Subsidiary to such Person in
contemplation of such leasing; provided, however, that the Partnership or such
Subsidiary may enter into such sale and leaseback transaction if (i) the
Partnership could have (A) incurred Indebtedness in an amount equal to the
Attributable Debt relating to such sale and leaseback transaction pursuant to
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio Test set forth in paragraph (a) of Section 4.09
and (B) secured a Lien on such Indebtedness pursuant to Section 4.12, or (ii)
the lease in such sale and leaseback transaction is for a term not in excess of

property.

Corp.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 4.09 hereof, Finance Corp. shall
not incur any Indebtedness unless (a) the Partnership is a co-obligor or
guarantor of such Indebtedness or (b) the net proceeds of such Indebtedness are
lent to the Partnership, used to acquire outstanding debt securities issued by
the Partnership or used directly or indirectly to refinance or discharge
Indebtedness permitted under the limitations of this Section 4.18. Finance

obtaining money or arranging financing for the Partnership.

ARTICLE 6
DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES

Section 6.01. Events of Default.

An "Event of Default" occurs if:

(a) the Issuers or the Guarantors default in the payment of interest on
the Notes when the same becomes due and payable and such default continues
for a period of 30 days;

(b) the Issuers or the Guarantors default in the payment of principal
of or premium, if any, on the Notes when the same becomes due and payable at
maturity, upon redemption (including in connection with an offer to purchase)
or otherwise;

(c) the Issuers fail for a period of 20 days to observe or perform any
covenant, condition or agreement on the part of the Issuers to be observed or
performed pursuant to Sections 4.07, 4.09, 4.10, 4.14 and 5.01 hereof;

(d) the Issuers or any Guarantor fails to comply with any of their
other respective agreements or covenants in, or provisions of, the Notes, the
Note Guarantees or this Indenture and the Default continues for the period
and after the notice specified below;

(e) a default occurs under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under
which there may be issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any
Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries
(or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries), whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists or shall be
created hereafter, which default (i) is caused by a failure to pay principal
of or premium, if any, or interest on such Indebtedness prior to the
expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (a "Payment
Default") or (ii) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to
its express maturity and, in each case, the principal amount of such
Indebtedness, together with the principal amount of any other Indebtedness as
to which there has been a Payment Default or the maturity of which has been
so accelerated, aggregates $10 million or more, excluding any acceleration of
maturity of the Indebtedness represented by the General Partner's Existing
Floating Rate Notes and Existing Fixed Rate Notes to the extent that such
Indebtedness shall be redeemed on or prior to the 40th day after the date of
this Indenture;

(f) a final judgment or final judgments for the payment of money are
entered by a court or courts of competent jurisdiction against the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries and such judgments are not paid,
discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days, provided that the aggregate of
all such undischarged judgments exceeds $10 million;

(g) except as otherwise permitted hereunder, any Note Guarantee shall
be held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or shall
cease for any reason to be in 

36
<PAGE>

full force and effect or any Guarantor (or its successors or assigns), or any
Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor (or its successors or assigns),
shall deny or disaffirm its obligations under its Note Guarantee;

(h) the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to or within
the meaning of any Bankruptcy Law:

(i) commences a voluntary case,

(ii) consents to the entry of an order for relief against it in an
involuntary case,

(iii) consents to the appointment of a Custodian of it or for all
or substantially all of its property,

(iv) makes a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or

(v) generally is not paying its debts as they become due; or

(i) a court of competent jurisdiction enters an order or decree under
any Bankruptcy Law that:

(i) is for relief against the Partnership or any Subsidiary of the
Partnership in an involuntary case,

(ii) appoints a Custodian of the Partnership or any Subsidiary of
the Partnership or for all or substantially all of the property of the
Partnership or any Subsidiary of the Partnership, or

(iii) orders the liquidation of the Partnership or any Subsidiary
of the Partnership,

and the order or decree remains unstayed and in effect for 60 consecutive
days.

A Default under clause (d) is not an Event of Default until the Trustee
notifies the Issuers, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes notify the Issuers and the Trustee, of the Default and
the Issuers do not cure the Default within 60 days after receipt of the notice.
The notice must specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that
the notice is a "Notice of Default."

In the case of any Event of Default pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 6.01 occurring by reason of any willful action (or inaction) taken (or
not taken) by or on behalf of the Issuers with the intention of avoiding payment
of the premium that the Issuers would have had to pay if the Issuers then had
elected to redeem the Notes pursuant to Section 3.07 hereof, an equivalent
premium shall also become and be immediately due and payable to the extent
permitted by law, anything in this Indenture or in the Notes to the contrary
notwithstanding. If an Event of Default occurs prior to August 1, 1998 by
reason of any willful action (or inaction) taken (or not taken) by or on behalf
of the Issuers with the intention of avoiding the prohibition on redemption of
the Notes prior to August 1, 1998 pursuant to Section 3.07 hereof, then the

37
<PAGE>

premium payable for purposes of this paragraph for each of the years beginning
on August 1 of the years set forth below shall be as set forth in the following
table expressed as a percentage of the amount that would otherwise be due but
for the provisions of this sentence, plus accrued interest, if any, to the date
of payment:

Year Percentage
---- ----------

1994................... 110.00%
1995................... 108.75%
1996................... 107.50%
1997................... 106.25%

Section 6.02. Acceleration.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default specified in
clauses (h) and (i) of Section 6.01 hereof relating to either Issuer, any
Significant Subsidiary or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would
constitute a Significant Subsidiary) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by
notice to the Issuers, or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes by written notice to the Issuers and the Trustee may
declare the unpaid principal of and any accrued interest on all the Notes to be
due and payable. Upon such declaration the principal and interest shall be due
and payable immediately (together with the premium referred to in Section 6.01
hereof, if applicable). If an Event of Default specified in clause (h) or (i)
of Section 6.01 hereof relating to either Issuer, any Significant Subsidiary or
any group of Subsidiaries that, taken together, would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary occurs, such an amount shall ipso facto become and be immediately due
and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or
any Holder. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes by written notice to the Trustee may rescind an acceleration
and its consequences if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or
decree and if all existing Events of Default (except nonpayment of principal or
interest that has become due solely because of the acceleration) have been cured
or waived.

Section 6.03. Other Remedies.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue
any available remedy to collect the payment of principal of, premium, if any,
and interest on the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of the
Notes or this Indenture.

The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of
the Notes or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay or
omission by the Trustee or any Holder of a Note in exercising any right or
remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or
constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. All remedies
are cumulative to the extent permitted by law.

Section 6.04. Waiver of Past Defaults.

Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding by notice to the Trustee may on behalf of the Holders of
all of the Notes waive an existing Default or Event of Default and its
consequences hereunder, except a continuing Default or Event of Default in the
payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on, the Notes

(including in connection with an offer to purchase) (provided, however, that the
Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding
Notes may rescind an acceleration and its consequences, including any related
payment default that resulted from such acceleration). Upon any such waiver,
such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom
shall be deemed to have been cured for every purpose of this Indenture; but no
such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

Section 6.05. Control by Majority.

Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes
may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for
exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power
conferred on it. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that
conflicts with law or this Indenture or that the Trustee determines may be
unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders of Notes or that may involve
the Trustee in personal liability.

Section 6.06. Limitation on Suits.

A Holder of a Note may pursue a remedy with respect to this Indenture or
the Notes only if:

(a) the Holder of a Note gives to the Trustee written notice of a
continuing Event of Default or the Trustee receives such notice from either
Issuer;

(b) the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the then
outstanding Notes make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(c) such Holder of a Note or Holders of Notes offer and, if requested,
provide to the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any
loss, liability or expense;

(d) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 60 days after
receipt of the request and the offer and, if requested, the provision of
indemnity; and

(e) during such 60-day period the Holders of a majority in principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes do not give the Trustee a direction
inconsistent with the request; provided, however, that such provision does
not affect the right of a Holder of a Note to sue for enforcement of any
overdue payment thereon.

A Holder of a Note may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another
Holder of a Note or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder of a
Note.

Section 6.07. Rights of Holders of Notes to Receive Payment.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any
Holder of a Note to receive payment of principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on the Note, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the Note
(including in connection with an Asset Sale Offer or a Change of Control Offer),
or to bring suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such
respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such
Holder.

Section 6.08. Collection Suit by Trustee.

If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(a) or (b) hereof occurs
and is continuing, the Trustee is authorized to recover judgment in its own name
and as trustee of an express trust against the Issuers for the whole amount of
principal of, premium, if any, and interest remaining unpaid on the Notes and
interest on overdue principal and, to the extent lawful, interest and such
further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of
collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

Section 6.09. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.

The Trustee is authorized to file such proofs of claim and other papers or
documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the
Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the
Holders of the Notes allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Issuers
(or any other obligor upon the Notes, including the Guarantors), its creditors
or its property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect, receive and
distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims
and any custodian in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each
Holder to make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee
shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to
the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other
amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof. To the extent that the
payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under
Section 7.07 hereof out of the estate in any such proceeding shall be denied for
any reason, payment of the same shall be secured by a Lien on, and shall be paid
out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other
properties that the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding
whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or
otherwise. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to
authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or
the rights of any Holder, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the
claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.

Section 6.10. Priorities.

If the Trustee collects any money pursuant to this Article, it shall pay
out the money in the following order:

First: to the Trustee, its agents and attorneys for amounts due under
Section 7.07 hereof, including payment of all compensation, expenses and
liabilities incurred, and all advances made, by the Trustee and the costs and
expenses of collection;

Second: to Holders of Notes for amounts due and unpaid on the Notes
for principal, premium, if any, and interest, ratably, without preference or
priority of any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Notes
for principal, premium, if any, and interest, respectively; and

40
<PAGE>

Third: to the Partnership or to such party as a court of competent
jurisdiction shall direct.

The Trustee may fix a record date and payment date for any payment to
Holders of Notes pursuant to this Section 6.10.

Section 6.11. Undertaking for Costs.

In any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this
Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by
it as a Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by any party
litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit, and the
court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in the suit, having due regard to
the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by the party litigant.
This Section does not apply to a suit by the Trustee, a suit by a Holder of a
Note pursuant to Section 6.07 hereof, or a suit by Holders of more than 10% in
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes.

ARTICLE 7
TRUSTEE

Section 7.01. Duties of Trustee.

(a) If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee

expense.

(f) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money received by
it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the Issuers. Money held in

or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction of any of

42
<PAGE>

or any Guarantor with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee.
However, in the event that the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest it must
eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the SEC for permission to
continue as trustee or resign. Any Agent may do the same with like rights and
duties. The Trustee is also subject to Sections 7.10 and 7.11 hereof.

Section 7.04. Trustee's Disclaimer.

The Trustee shall not be responsible for and makes no representation as to
the validity or adequacy of this Indenture or the Notes, it shall not be
accountable for the Issuers' use of the proceeds from the Notes or any money
paid to the Issuers or upon the Issuers' direction under any provision of
this Indenture, it shall not be responsible for the use or application of any
money received by any Paying Agent other than the Trustee, and it shall not be
responsible for any statement or recital herein or any statement in the Notes or
any other document in connection with the sale of the Notes or pursuant to this
Indenture other than its certificate of authentication.

Section 7.05. Notice of Defaults.

If a Default or Event of Default occurs and is continuing and if it is
known to the Trustee, the Trustee shall mail to Holders of Notes a notice of the
Default or Event of Default within 90 days after it occurs. Except in the case
of a Default or Event of Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, or
interest on any Note (including any failure to make any mandatory redemption
payment required hereunder), the Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long
as a committee of its Responsible Officers in good faith determines that
withholding the notice is in the interests of the Holders of the Notes.

Section 7.06. Reports by Trustee to Holders of the Notes.

Within 60 days after each November 1 beginning with the November 1
following the date of this Indenture, and for so long as Notes remain
outstanding, the Trustee shall mail to the Holders of the Notes a brief report
dated as of such reporting date that complies with TIA (S) 313(a) (but if no
event described in TIA (S) 313(a) has occurred within the twelve months
preceding the reporting date, no report need be transmitted). The Trustee also
shall comply with TIA (S) 313(b)(2). The Trustee shall also transmit by mail
all reports as required by TIA (S) 313(c).

A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to the Holders of Notes
shall be mailed to the Issuers and filed with the SEC and each stock exchange on
which the Notes are listed in accordance with TIA (S) 313(d). The Issuers shall
promptly notify the Trustee when the Notes are listed on any stock exchange.

Section 7.07. Compensation and Indemnity.

The Issuers and the Guarantors, if any, shall pay to the Trustee from time
to time reasonable compensation for its acceptance of this Indenture and its
services hereunder. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law
on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Issuers and the
Guarantors, if any, shall reimburse the Trustee promptly upon request for all
reasonable disbursements, advances and expenses incurred or made by it in
addition to the compensation for its services. Such expenses shall include the
reasonable compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustee's agents and
counsel.

43
<PAGE>

The Issuers and the Guarantors, if any, shall indemnify the Trustee
against any and all losses, liabilities or expenses incurred by it arising out
of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under
this Indenture, including the costs and expenses of enforcing this Indenture
against the Issuers and the Guarantors (including this Section 7.07), and
defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by either Issuer, any
Guarantor or any Holder or any other person) or liability in connection with the
exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder, except to the
extent any such loss, liability or expense may be attributable to its negligence
or bad faith. The Trustee shall notify the Issuers promptly of any claim for
which it may seek indemnity. Failure by the Trustee to so notify the Issuers
shall not relieve the Issuers and the Guarantors, if any, of their obligations
hereunder. The Issuers and the Guarantors, if any, shall defend the claim and
the Trustee shall cooperate in the defense. The Trustee may have separate
counsel and the Issuers and the Guarantors, if any, shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel. The Issuers and the Guarantors, if any, need
not pay for any settlement made without their consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld.

The obligations of the Issuers and the Guarantors, if any, under this
Section 7.07 shall survive the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.

To secure the Issuers' and the Guarantors' payment obligations in this
Section, the Trustee shall have a Lien prior to the Notes on all money or
property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay
principal and interest on particular Notes. Such Lien shall survive the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture.

When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of
Default specified in Section 6.01(h) or (i) hereof occurs, the expenses and the
compensation for the services (including the fees and expenses of its agents and
counsel) are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any
Bankruptcy Law.

The Trustee shall comply with the provisions of TIA (S) 313(b)(2) to the
extent applicable.

Section 7.08. Replacement of Trustee.

A resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor
Trustee shall become effective only upon the successor Trustee's acceptance of
appointment as provided in this Section.

The Trustee may resign in writing at any time and be discharged from the
trust hereby created by so notifying the Issuers. The Holders of Notes of a
majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may remove the
Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and the Issuers in writing. The Issuers may
remove the Trustee if:

(a) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10 hereof;

(b) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order for
relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy Law;

(c) a Custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its
property; or

(d) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting.

44
<PAGE>

If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office
of Trustee for any reason, the Issuers shall promptly appoint a successor
Trustee. Within one year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may appoint a
successor Trustee to replace the successor Trustee appointed by the Issuers.

If a successor Trustee does not take office within 60 days after the
retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Issuers, any
Guarantor, or the Holders of Notes of at least 10% in principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Trustee.

If the Trustee, after written request by any Holder of a Note who has been
a Holder of a Note for at least six months, fails to comply with Section 7.10
hereof, such Holder of a Note may petition any court of competent jurisdiction
for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment
to the retiring Trustee and to the Issuers. Thereupon, the resignation or
removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor
Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this
Indenture. The successor Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to
Holders of the Notes. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property
held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, provided all sums owing to the
Trustee hereunder have been paid and subject to the Lien provided for in Section
7.07 hereof. Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this
Section 7.08, the Issuers' and the Guarantors' obligations under Section 7.07
hereof shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee.

Section 7.09. Successor Trustee by Merger, etc.

If the Trustee consolidates, merges or converts into, or transfers all or
substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another corporation, the
successor corporation without any further act shall be the successor Trustee.

Section 7.10. Eligibility; Disqualification.

There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder that is a corporation
organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America or
of any state thereof that is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate
trustee power, that is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state
authorities and that has a combined capital and surplus of at least $100 million
as set forth in its most recent published annual report of condition.

This Indenture shall always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirements
of TIA (S) 310(a)(1), (2) and (5). The Trustee is subject to TIA (S) 310(b).

Section 7.11. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Issuers.

The Trustee is subject to TIA (S) 311(a), excluding any creditor
relationship listed in TIA (S) 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been
removed shall be subject to TIA (S) 311(a) to the extent indicated therein.

The Issuers may, at the option of the Board of Directors and the Board of
Directors of Finance Corp. evidenced in each case by a resolution set forth in
an Officers' Certificate, at any time elect to have either Section 8.02 or 8.03
hereof be applied to all outstanding Notes upon compliance with the conditions
set forth below in this Article 8.

Section 8.02. Legal Defeasance and Discharge.

Upon the Issuers' exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option
applicable to this Section 8.02, each of the Issuers and each of the Guarantors,
if any, shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.04 hereof, be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with
respect to all outstanding Notes and Note Guarantees on the date the conditions
set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter, "Legal Defeasance"). For this
purpose, Legal Defeasance means that the Issuers shall be deemed to have paid
and discharged the entire Indebtedness represented by the outstanding Notes,
which shall thereafter be deemed to be "outstanding" only for the purposes of
Section 8.05 hereof and the other Sections of this Indenture referred to in (a)
and (b) below, and to have satisfied all their other obligations under such
Notes and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on demand of and at the expense of
the Issuers, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), except
for the following provisions which shall survive until otherwise terminated or
discharged hereunder: (a) the rights of Holders of outstanding Notes to receive
solely from the trust fund described in Section 8.04 hereof, and as more fully
set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of, premium, if
any, and interest on such Notes when such payments are due, (b) the Issuers' and
Guarantors' obligations with respect to such Notes under Article 2 and Section
4.02 hereof, (c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the
Trustee hereunder and the Issuers' and the Guarantors' obligations in connection
therewith and (d) this Article 8. Subject to compliance with this Article 8, the
Issuers may exercise their option under this Section 8.02 notwithstanding the
prior exercise of its option under Section 8.03 hereof.

Section 8.03. Covenant Defeasance.

Upon the Issuers' exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option
applicable to this Section 8.03, each of the Issuers and each of the Guarantors,
if any, shall, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.04 hereof, be released from its obligations under the covenants
contained in Sections 4.07, 4.08, 4.09, 4.10, 4.11, 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, 4.16,
4.17, 4.18 and 5.01 hereof with respect to the outstanding Notes and Note
Guarantees on and after the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied
(hereinafter, "Covenant Defeasance"), and the Notes shall thereafter be deemed
not "outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or
declaration or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in
connection with such covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "outstanding"
for all other purposes hereunder (it being understood that such Notes shall not
be deemed outstanding for accounting purposes). For this purpose, Covenant
Defeasance means that, with respect to the outstanding Notes, the Issuers may
omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term,
condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant, whether directly or
indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to any such covenant or
by reason of any reference in any such covenant to 

46
<PAGE>

any other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply
shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01 hereof,
but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture, such Notes and
the Note Guarantees, if any, shall be unaffected thereby. In addition, upon the
Issuers' exercise under Section 8.01 hereof of the option applicable to this
Section 8.03 hereof, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.04 hereof, Sections 6.01(e) and 6.01(f) hereof shall not constitute
Events of Default.

Section 8.04. Conditions to Legal or Covenant Defeasance.

The following shall be the conditions to the application of either Section
8.02 or 8.03 hereof to the outstanding Notes:

received from, or there has been published by, the Internal Revenue Service a
ruling or (ii) since the date of this Indenture, there has been a change in
the applicable federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that, and
based thereon such Opinion of Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of the
outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income
tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject to
federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same
times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal 
income tax purposes as a result of such Covenant Defeasance and will be
subject to federal 

47
<PAGE>

income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as
would have been the case if such Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;

(d) no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing on the
date of such deposit or, insofar as Sections 6.01(h) or 6.01(i) hereof is
concerned, at any time in the period ending on the 91st day after the date of
deposit (or greater period of time in which any such deposit of trust funds
may remain subject to Bankruptcy Law insofar as those apply to the deposit by
the Issuers);

(e) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in a

Subsidiaries is bound;

Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuers with the
intent of preferring the Holders over any other creditors of the Issuers or
the Guarantors, if any, or with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying
or defrauding any other creditors of the Issuers or others; and

(h) the Issuers shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions
precedent provided for or relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant

Other Miscellaneous Provisions.

Subject to Section 8.06 hereof, all money and non-callable Government
Securities (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or other
qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 8.05, the
"Trustee") pursuant to Section 8.04 hereof in respect of the outstanding Notes
shall be held in trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the
provisions of such Notes and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly or
through any Paying Agent (including either Issuer acting as Paying Agent) as the
Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Notes of all sums due and to
become due thereon in respect of principal, premium, if any, and interest, but
such money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required

firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification
thereof delivered to the Trustee (which may be the opinion delivered under
Section 8.04(a) hereof), are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be
required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant
Defeasance.

Section 8.06. Repayment to Issuers.

Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by
the Issuers, in trust for the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or
interest, if any, on any Note and remaining unclaimed for two years after such
principal, and premium, if any, or interest, if any, have become due and payable
shall be paid to the Issuers on its request or (if then held by the Issuers)
shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Note shall
thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Issuers for
payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with
respect to such trust money, and all liability of the Issuers as trustee
thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such
Paying Agent, before being required to make any such repayment, may at the
expense of the Issuers cause to be published once, in the New York Times and The
Wall Street Journal (national edition), notice that such money remains unclaimed
and that, after a date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days
from the date of such notification or publication, any unclaimed balance of such
money then remaining will be repaid to the Issuers.

Section 8.07. Reinstatement.

If the Trustee or Paying Agent is unable to apply any United States
dollars or non-callable Government Securities in accordance with Section 8.02 or
8.03 hereof, as the case may be, by reason of any order or judgment of any court
or governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such
application, then the Issuers' and the Guarantors' obligations under this
Indenture, the Notes and the Note Guarantees shall be revived and reinstated as
though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof until
such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in
accordance with Section 8.02 or 8.03 hereof, as the case may be; provided,
however, that, if the Issuers and the Guarantors make any payment of principal
of, premium, if any, or interest, if any, on any Note following the
reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuers and the Guarantors shall be
subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Notes to receive such payment
from the money held by the Trustee or Paying Agent.

ARTICLE 9
AMENDMENT, SUPPLEMENT AND WAIVER

Section 9.01. Without Consent of Holders of Notes.

Notwithstanding Section 9.02 of this Indenture, the Issuers, the
Guarantors, if any, and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or
the Notes without the consent of any Holder of a Note:

49
<PAGE>

(a) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency;

(b) to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of
certificated Notes;

(c) to provide for the assumption of the Partnership's, Finance Corp.'s
or any Guarantor's obligations to the Holders of the Notes in the case of a
merger or consolidation pursuant to Article 5 or Article 10 hereof, as the
case may be;

(d) to make any change that would provide any additional rights or
benefits to the Holders of the Notes (including providing for Note Guarantees
pursuant to Section 4.13 hereof) or that does not adversely affect the legal
rights hereunder of any Holder of the Note; or

(e) to comply with requirements of the SEC in order to effect or
maintain the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA.

Upon the request of the Issuers accompanied by a resolution of the Board
of Directors of each of the General Partner and Finance Corp. authorizing the
execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon receipt by the
Trustee of the documents described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee shall
join with the Issuers and the Guarantors in the execution of any amended or
supplemental Indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture
and make any further appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein
contained, but the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into such amended or
supplemental Indenture that affects its own rights, duties or immunities under
this Indenture or otherwise.

Section 9.02. With Consent of Holders of Notes.

Except as provided below in this Section 9.02, the Issuers, the
Guarantors, if any, and the Trustee may amend or supplement this Indenture or
the Notes with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes), and, subject to
Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, any existing Default or Event of Default (other
than a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium,
if any, or interest on the Notes, except a payment default resulting from an
acceleration that has been rescinded) or compliance with any provision of this
Indenture or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including consents
obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Notes).

Upon the request of the Issuers accompanied by a resolution of the Board
of Directors of each of the General Partner and Finance Corp. authorizing the
execution of any such amended or supplemental Indenture, and upon the filing
with the Trustee of evidence satisfactory to the Trustee of the consent of the
Holders of Notes as aforesaid, and upon receipt by the Trustee of the documents
described in Section 7.02 hereof, the Trustee shall join with the Issuers and
the Guarantors, if any, in the execution of such amended or supplemental
Indenture unless such amended or supplemental Indenture affects the Trustee's
own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which
case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter
into such amended or supplemental Indenture.

It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Notes under
this Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or
waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance
thereof.

After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section becomes
effective, the Issuers shall mail to the Holders of Notes affected thereby a
notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of
the Issuers to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in
any way impair or affect the validity of any such amended or supplemental
Indenture or waiver. Subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.07 hereof, the Holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may waive
compliance in a particular instance by the Issuers or any Guarantor with any
provision of this Indenture, the Note or the Note Guarantees. However, without
the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment or waiver may not (with
respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder):

(a) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to
an amendment, supplement or waiver;

(b) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or
alter any of the provisions with respect to the redemption of the Notes
(other than provisions of Section 4.10 and Section 4.15 hereof);

(c) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest,
including default interest, on any Note;

51
<PAGE>

(d) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of principal of
or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes (except a rescission of
acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes and a waiver of the payment
default that resulted from such acceleration);

(e) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Notes;

(f) make any change in Section 6.04 or 6.07 hereof or in the provisions
of this Indenture relating to the rights of Holders of Notes to receive
payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes;

(g) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a
payment required by Section 4.10 or Section 4.14 hereof);

(h) make any change to the subordination provisions of Article 10
hereof that adversely affects Holders;

(i) except pursuant to Article 8 and Article 10 hereof, release any
Guarantor from its obligations under its Note Guarantee, or change any Note
Guarantee in any manner that would adversely affect the Holders; or

(j) make any change in this sentence of this Section 9.02.

Section 9.03. Compliance with Trust Indenture Act.

Every amendment or supplement to this Indenture or the Notes shall be set
forth in an amended or supplemental Indenture that complies with the TIA as then
in effect.

Section 9.04. Revocation and Effect of Consents.

Until an amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective, a consent to
it by a Holder of a Note is a continuing consent by the Holder of a Note and
every subsequent Holder of a Note or portion of a Note that evidences the same
debt as the consenting Holder's Note, even if notation of the consent is not
made on any Note. However, any such Holder of a Note or subsequent Holder of a
Note may revoke the consent as to its Note if the Trustee receives written
notice of revocation before the date the waiver, supplement or amendment becomes
effective. An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective in accordance
with its terms and thereafter binds every Holder.

Section 9.05. Notation on or Exchange of Notes.

The Trustee may place an appropriate notation about an amendment,
supplement or waiver on any Note thereafter authenticated. The Issuers in
exchange for all Notes may issue and the Trustee shall authenticate new Notes
(accompanied by a notation of the Note Guarantees duly endorsed by the
Guarantors) that reflect the amendment, supplement or waiver.

Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Note shall not
affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.

52
<PAGE>

Section 9.06. Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc.

The Trustee shall sign any amended or supplemental Indenture authorized
pursuant to this Article 9 if the amendment or supplement does not adversely
affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee. The
Issuers and the Guarantors may not sign an amendment or supplemental Indenture
until the Board of Directors of each of the General Partner and Finance Corp.
approves it. In executing any amended or supplemental indenture, the Trustee
shall be entitled to receive and (subject to Section 7.01 hereof) shall be fully
protected in relying upon, an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel
stating that the execution of such amended or supplemental indenture is
authorized or permitted by this Indenture.

ARTICLE 10
NOTE GUARANTEES

Section 10.01. Note Guarantee.

Each Subsidiary of the Partnership which in accordance with Section 4.13
hereof has guaranteed the obligations of the Issuers under the Notes, upon
execution of a counterpart of this Indenture, hereby jointly and severally
unconditionally guarantees to each Holder of a Note authenticated and delivered
by the Trustee irrespective of the validity or enforceability of this Indenture,
the Notes or the obligations of the Issuers under this Indenture or the Notes,
that: (i) the principal of and interest on the Notes will be paid in full when
due, whether at the maturity or interest payment or mandatory redemption date,
by acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, and interest on the overdue
principal of and interest, if any, on the Notes and all other obligations of the
Issuers to the Holders or the Trustee under this Indenture or the Notes will be
promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance with the terms of this
Indenture and the Notes; and (ii) in case of any extension of time of payment or
renewal of any Notes or any of such other obligations, they will be paid in full
when due or performed in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal,
whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise. Failing payment when due of
any amount so guaranteed for whatever reason, each Guarantor will be obligated
to pay the same whether or not such failure to pay has become an Event of
Default which could cause acceleration pursuant to Section 6.02 hereof. Each
Guarantor agrees that this is a guarantee of payment not a guarantee of
collection.

Each Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations with regard to this Note
Guarantee shall be joint and several, unconditional, irrespective of the
validity or enforceability of the Notes or the obligations of the Issuers under
this Indenture, the absence of any action to enforce the same, the recovery of
any judgment against either Issuer or any other obligor with respect to this
Indenture, the Notes or the obligations of the Issuers under this Indenture or
the Notes, any action to enforce the same or any other circumstances (other than
complete performance) which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Each Guarantor further, to the extent
permitted by law, waives and relinquishes all claims, rights and remedies
accorded by applicable law to guarantors and agrees not to assert or take
advantage of any such claims, rights or remedies, including but not limited to:
(a) any right to require the Trustee, the Holders or the Issuers (each, a
"Benefitted Party") to proceed against the Issuers or any other Person or to
proceed against or exhaust any security held by a Benefitted Party at any time
or to pursue any other remedy in any Benefitted Party's power before proceeding
against such Guarantor; (b) the defense of the statute of limitations in any
action hereunder or in any action 

53
<PAGE>

for the collection of any Indebtedness or the performance of any obligation
hereby guaranteed; (c) any defense that may arise by reason of the incapacity,
lack of authority, death or disability of any other Person or the failure of a
Benefitted Party to file or enforce a claim against the estate (in
administration, bankruptcy or any other proceeding) of any other Person; (d)
demand, protest and notice of any kind including but not limited to notice of
the existence, creation or incurring of any new or additional Indebtedness or
obligation or of any action or non-action on the part of such Guarantor, either
Issuer, any Benefitted Party, any creditor of such Guarantor, either Issuer or
on the part of any other Person whomsoever in connection with any Indebtedness
or obligations hereby guaranteed; (e) any defense based upon an election of
remedies by a Benefitted Party, including but not limited to an election to
proceed against such Guarantor for reimbursement; (f) any defense based upon any
statute or rule of law which provides that the obligation of a surety must be
neither larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the
principal; (g) any defense arising because of a Benefitted Party's election, in
any proceeding instituted under the Federal Bankruptcy Code, of the application
of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code; or (h) any defense based
on any borrowing or grant of a security interest under Section 364 of the
Federal Bankruptcy Code. Each Guarantor hereby covenants that its Note
Guarantees will not be discharged except by complete performance of the
obligations contained in its Note Guarantees and this Indenture.

If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to
return to either the Partnership, Finance Corp. or any Guarantor, or any
Custodian acting in relation to any of the Partnership, Finance Corp. or such
Guarantor, any amount paid by the Partnership, Finance Corp. or such Guarantor
to the Trustee or such Holder, the applicable Note Guarantees, to the extent
theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full force and effect. Each
Guarantor agrees that it will not be entitled to any right of subrogation in
relation to the Holders in respect of any obligations guaranteed hereby until
payment in full of all obligations guaranteed hereby.

Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between such Guarantor, on the one
hand, and the Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, (i) the maturity of
the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Section 6.02
hereof for the purposes of this Note Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay,
injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration as to the Issuers
or any other obligor on the Notes of the obligations guaranteed hereby, and (ii)
in the event of any declaration of acceleration of those obligations as provided
in Section 6.02 hereof, those obligations (whether or not due and payable) will
forthwith become due and payable by such Guarantor for the purpose of this Note
Guarantee.

Section 10.02. Limitation of Guarantor's Liability.

Each Guarantor and by its acceptance hereof, each beneficiary hereof,
hereby confirm that it is its intention that the Note Guarantees by such
Guarantor not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of the
Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent
Transfer Act or any similar federal or state law to the extent applicable to any
Note Guarantees. To effectuate the foregoing intention, each such person hereby
irrevocably agrees that the obligation of such Guarantor under its Note
Guarantees under this Article 10 shall be limited to the maximum amount as will,
after giving effect to such maximum amount and all other (contingent or
otherwise) liabilities of such Guarantor that are relevant under such laws, and
after giving effect to any collections from, rights to receive contribution from
or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in respect of the
obligations of such other Guarantor under this Article 10, result in the
obligations of such Guarantor in respect of such 

54
<PAGE>

maximum amount not constituting a fraudulent conveyance. Each beneficiary under
the Note Guarantees, by accepting the benefits hereof, confirms its intention
that, in the event of a bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding
of either Issuer or any Guarantor in which concurrent claims are made upon such
Guarantor hereunder, to the extent such claims will not be fully satisfied, each
such claimant with a valid claim against such Issuer shall be entitled to a
ratable share of all payments by such Guarantor in respect of such concurrent
claims.

Section 10.03. Guarantors May Consolidate, etc., on Certain Terms.

No Guarantor shall consolidate with or merge with or into (whether or not
such Guarantor is the surviving Person), another corporation, Person or entity
whether or not it is affiliated with such Guarantor unless (i) subject to the
provisions of the following paragraph and Section 10.4 hereof, the Person formed
by or surviving any such consolidation or merger (if other than such Guarantor)
assumes all the obligations of such Guarantor pursuant to a supplemental
indenture in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, under its Note
Guarantee, the Notes and this Indenture, (ii) immediately after giving effect to
such transaction, no Default or Event of Default exists, and (iii) such
Guarantor, or any Person formed by or surviving any such consolidation or
merger, (A) shall have Consolidated Net Worth (immediately after giving effect
to such transaction), equal to or greater than the Consolidated Net Worth of
such Guarantor immediately preceding the transaction and (B) will be permitted
by virtue of the Partnership pro forma Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio to incur,
immediately after giving effect to such transaction, at least $1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio test set
forth in the Section 4.09 hereof. In case of any such consolidation, merger,
sale or conveyance and upon the assumption by the successor corporation, by
supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory
in form to the Trustee, of the Note Guarantee in this Indenture and the due and
punctual performance and observance of all of the covenants and conditions of
this Indenture to be performed by the Guarantor, such successor corporation
shall succeed to and be substituted for the Guarantor with the same effect as if
it had been named herein as a Guarantor.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) a Guarantor may consolidate with or
merge with or into the Partnership or Finance Corp. (subject to the provisions
of Section 5.01 hereof) and (B) a Guarantor may consolidate with or merge with
or into any other Guarantor.

Section 10.04. Releases Following Sale of Assets.

Upon a sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets
of any Guarantor, by way of merger, consolidation or otherwise, or a sale or
other disposition of all of the capital stock of any Guarantor, then such
Guarantor (in the event of a sale or other disposition, by way of such a merger,
consolidation or otherwise, of all of the Capital Interests of such Guarantor)
or the corporation acquiring the property (in the event of a sale or other
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor) shall
be released and relieved of its obligations under its Note Guarantees; provided
that the Net Proceeds of such sale or other disposition are applied in
accordance with Section 4.10 hereof. The Trustee will deliver to such Guarantor
a signed acknowledgment of such release.

(Back of Note)

10% SERIES A FIXED RATE SENIOR NOTE
DUE AUGUST 1, 2001

Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in
the Indenture (as defined below) unless otherwise indicated.

1. Interest. Ferrellgas, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the
"Partnership"), and Ferrellgas Finance Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Finance
Corp." and, together with the Partnership, the "Issuers") promise to pay
interest on the principal amount of this Note at the rate and in the manner
specified below. The Issuers shall pay interest in cash on the principal amount
of this Note at the rate per annum of 10%. The Issuers will pay interest semi-
annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing on
February 1, 1995, to Holders of record on the immediately preceding January 15
and July 15, or if any such day is not a Business Day (as defined in the
Indenture), on the next succeeding Business Day (each a "Fixed Rate Interest
Payment Date"). Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months. Interest shall accrue from the most recent
date to which interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from the
date of the original issuance of the Notes. To the extent lawful, the Issuers
shall pay interest on overdue principal at the rate of 1% per annum in excess of
the then applicable interest rate on the Notes; it shall pay interest on overdue
installments of interest (without regard to any applicable grace periods) at the
same rate to the extent lawful.

2. Method of Payment. The Issuers will pay interest on the Notes
(except defaulted interest) to the Persons who are registered Holders of Notes
at the close of business on the record date next preceding the Fixed Rate
Interest Payment Date, even if such Notes are cancelled after such record date
and on or before such Fixed Rate Interest Payment Date. The Holder hereof must
surrender this Note to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The
Issuers will pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at
the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
The Issuers, however, may pay principal, premium, if any, and interest by check
payable in such money. The Notes will be payable both as to principal and
interest at the office or agency of the Issuers maintained for such purpose
within the City and State of New York or, at the option of the Issuers, payment
of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders of Notes at their
respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders. Unless otherwise
designated by the Issuers, the Issuers' office or agency in New York, New York
will be the office of the Trustee maintained for such a purpose.

3. Paying Agent and Registrar. Initially, the Trustee will act as
Paying Agent and Registrar. The Issuers may change any Paying Agent, Registrar
or co-registrar without notice to any Holder. Either Issuer or any Guarantor
may act in any such capacity.

4. Indenture. The Issuers issued the Notes under an Indenture dated
as of July 5, 1994 (the "Indenture") between Partnership, Finance Corp. and the
Trustee. The terms of the Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those
made part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15
U.S. Code (S)(S) 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture. The
Notes are subject to all such terms, and Holders of the Notes are referred to

6. Mandatory Redemption. Except as described in paragraph 7 below,
the Issuers shall not be required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund

Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture), the Issuers shall be required
to offer to purchase all Notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase.
Holders of Notes that are subject to an offer to purchase will receive a notice

have such Notes purchased by completing the form entitled "Option of Holder to
Elect Purchase" appearing below.

(b) When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds from Asset Sales (as
defined in the Indenture) exceeds $15 million, the Issuers shall be required to
purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes that may be purchased out of the
Excess Proceeds at 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer. If the
aggregate principal amount of Notes surrendered by Holders thereof exceeds the
amount of Excess Proceeds, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected pursuant
to the terms of Section 3.02 of the Indenture (with such adjustments as may be
deemed appropriate by the Issuers so that only Notes in denominations of $1,000,
or integral multiples thereof, shall be purchased). To the extent that the
aggregate amount of Notes tendered by Holders thereof is less than the Excess
Proceeds, the Issuers may use such deficiency for general business purposes.
Holders of Notes which are the subject of an offer to purchase will receive a
notice therefor from the Issuers prior to any related purchase date, and may
elect to have such Notes purchased by completing the form entitled "Option of
Holder to Elect Purchase" appearing below.

principal of and interest on this Note and for all other purposes whatsoever,
whether or not this Note is overdue, and neither the Trustee, any Agent, the
Issuers nor any Guarantor shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The
registered holder of a Note shall be treated as its owner for all purposes.

11. Amendments and Waivers. Subject to certain exceptions, the
Indenture or the Notes may be amended with the consent of the Holders of at
least a majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including
consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for
Notes), and any existing default or compliance with any provision of the
Indenture or the Notes may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including consents
obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Notes).
Without the consent of any Holder, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended to
cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency, to provide for uncertificated Notes
in addition to or in place of certificated Notes, to provide for assumption of
the Issuers' or any Guarantor's obligations to Holders in the case of a merger

Holder under the Indenture or to comply with the requirements of the Commission
in order to effect or maintain the qualification of the Indenture under the
Trust Indenture Act. Without the consent of each Holder affected, an amendment
or waiver may not (with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder of
Notes): (i) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to
an amendment, supplement or waiver, (ii) reduce the principal of or change the
fixed maturity of any Note or alter the provisions with respect to the

described above under the caption "Redemption or Repurchase at the Option of
Holders"), (iii) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest
on any Note, (iv) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of

principal amount of the Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted
from such acceleration), (v) make any Note payable in money other than that
stated in the Notes, (vi) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture
relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of Notes to
receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes,

12. Defaults and Remedies. Events of Default include: default for
30 days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes; default in payment
when due of principal of or premium, if any, on the Notes at maturity, upon
redemption or otherwise; failure for 20 days by the Partnership to comply with
Sections 4.07, 4.09, 4.10, 4.14 or 5.01 of the Indenture; failure by the
Partnership or the Guarantors for 60 days after notice from the Trustee or the
Holder of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding to
comply with any of its other agreements in the Indenture or the Notes; default
under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or
by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed
by the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is
guaranteed by the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries) whether such
Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date of the
Indenture, which default (a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of or
premium, if any, or interest on such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the
grace period provided in such Indebtedness (a "Payment Default") or (b) results
in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity and, in
each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a
Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $10
million or more, excluding any acceleration of maturity of the Indebtedness
represented by the General Partner's Existing Floating Rate Notes and Existing
Fixed Rate Notes to the extent that such Indebtedness shall be redeemed on or
prior to the 40th day after the date of this Indenture; failure by the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries to pay final judgments aggregating in
excess of $10 million, which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a
period of 60 days; except as permitted by the Indenture, any Note Guarantee
shall be held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or shall
cease for any reason to be in full force and effect or any Guarantor, or any
Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor, shall deny or disaffirm its
obligations under its Note Guarantees; and certain events of bankruptcy or
insolvency with respect to the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries. If any
Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at
least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the
Notes to be due and payable immediately; except that in the case of an Event of
Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, relating to the
Partnership, any Significant Subsidiary or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken
together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding Notes will
become due and payable without further action or notice. Holders of the Notes
may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture.
Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or
power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of the Notes notice of any
continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default
relating to the payment of principal or interest) if it determines that
withholding notice is in their interest. The Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by notice to the Trustee, may on
behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of
Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or
Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest
on the Notes. The Issuers are required to deliver to the Trustee annually a
statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuers are required
upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, to deliver to the
Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.

13. Trustee Dealings with Issuers. The Trustee under the Indenture,
in its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits
from, and perform services for the Issuers, any Guarantor or their respective
Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Issuers, any Guarantor or their
respective Affiliates, as if it were not Trustee; however, if the 

A-6
<PAGE>

Trustee acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within
90 days, apply to the Commission for permission to continue as Trustee or
resign.

14. No Recourse Against Others. No past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder, as such, of either Issuer or any
Guarantor, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuers
or any Guarantor under the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the Indenture or for
any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their
creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note and the related Note Guarantees, if
any, waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of
the consideration for the issuance of the Notes.

15. Authentication. This Note shall not be valid until authenticated
by the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating agent.

16. Abbreviations. Customary abbreviations may be used in the name
of a Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (=
tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship
and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts
to Minors Act).

17. CUSIP Numbers. Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the
Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Issuers have caused
CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes and has directed the Trustee to use
CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No
representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on
the Notes or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed
only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.

SERIES B FLOATING RATE SENIOR NOTE
DUE AUGUST 1, 2001

Capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned to them in the
Indenture (as defined below) unless otherwise indicated.

1. Interest. Ferrellgas, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the
"Partnership"), and Ferrellgas Finance Corp., a Delaware corporation ("Finance
Corp." and, together with the Partnership, the "Issuers") promise to pay
interest on the principal amount of this Note at a rate equal to the Applicable
LIBOR Rate. The Issuers will pay interest quarterly on February 1, May 1,
August 1 and November 1 of each year, or if any such day is not a Business Day,
on the next succeeding Business Day (each, a "Floating Rate Interest Payment
Date"), commencing on November 1, 1994, to Holders of record on the immediately
preceding January 15, April 15, July 15 and October 15. Interest on this Note
will accrue from the most recent date to which interest has been paid or, if no
interest has been paid, from the date of the original issuance of this Note.
Interest on this Note shall accrue to, but not include, the date of repayment of
such principal; provided, however, that if such repayment occurs after 12:00
noon, New York City time, interest shall be deemed to accrue until the following
Business Day. To the extent lawful, the Issuers shall pay interest on overdue
principal at the rate of 1% per annum in excess of the then applicable interest
rate on this Note; they shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest
(without regard to any applicable grace periods) at the same rate to the extent
lawful. On each Floating Rate Interest Payment Date, interest on this Note will
be paid for the Initial Quarterly Period or the immediately preceding Quarterly
Period, as applicable. Interest shall be calculated on a formula basis in
respect of the Initial Quarterly Period and each Quarterly Period by multiplying
the principal amount of this Note by the Applicable LIBOR Rate, and multiplying
such product by the LIBOR Fraction. Anything to the contrary in this Note
notwithstanding, the interest rate on this Note shall in no event be in excess
of the maximum rate permitted by the law of any state of applicable
jurisdiction, as the same may be modified by Federal law.

The "Applicable LIBOR Rate" means for each Quarterly Period during which
any Floating Rate Senior Note is outstanding subsequent to the Initial Quarterly
Period, 312.5 basis points over the rate determined by the Partnership (notice
of such rate to be sent to the Trustee by the Company on the date of
determination thereof) equal to the average (rounded upwards, if necessary, to
the nearest 1/16 of 1%) of the offered rates for deposits in U.S. dollars for a
period of three months, as set forth on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page as of 11:00
a.m., London time, on the Interest Rate Determination Date for such Quarterly
Period; provided, however, that if only one such offered rate appears on the
Reuters Screen LIBO Page, the Applicable LIBOR Rate for such Quarterly Period
shall mean such offered rate. If such rate is not available at 11:00 a.m.,
London time, on the Interest Rate Determination Date for such Quarterly Period,
then the Applicable LIBOR Rate for such Quarterly Period shall mean the
arithmetic mean (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest 1/16 of 1%) of
the interest rates per annum at which deposits in amounts equal to $1 million in
U.S. dollars are offered by the Reference Banks to leading banks in the London
Interbank Market for a period of six months as of 11:00 a.m., London time, on
the Interest Rate Determination Date for such Quarterly Period. If on any
Interest Rate Determination Date, at least two of the Reference Banks provide
such offered quotations, then the Applicable LIBOR Rate for such Quarterly
Period shall be determined in accordance with the preceding sentence on the
basis of the offered quotation of those Reference Banks providing 

B-3
<PAGE>

such quotations; provided, however that if fewer than two of the Reference Banks
are so quoting such interest rates as mentioned above, the Applicable LIBOR Rate
for such Quarterly Period shall be deemed to be the Applicable LIBOR Rate for
the next preceding Quarterly Period and in the case of the Quarterly Period next
succeeding the Initial Quarterly Period, the Applicable LIBOR Rate shall be 7
7/8%. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Applicable LIBOR Rate for the Initial
Quarterly Period shall be 7 7/8%.

"Interest Rate Determination Date" means, with respect to the Initial
Quarterly Period and each Quarterly Period, the second Working Day prior to the
first day of such Initial Quarterly Period or Quarterly Period, as applicable.

"LIBOR Fraction" means the actual number of days in the Initial Quarterly
Period or Quarterly period, as applicable, divided by 360; provided, however,
that the number of days in the Initial Quarterly Period and each Quarterly
Period shall be calculated by including the first day of such Initial Quarterly
Period or Quarterly Period and excluding the last.

"Initial Quarterly Period" means the period from and including July 5,
1994 through and including October 31, 1994.

"Quarterly Period" means the period from and including a scheduled
Floating Rate Interest Payment Date through the day next preceding the following
scheduled Floating Rate Interest Payment Date.

"Reference Banks" means each of Barclays Bank PLC, London Branch, the Bank
of Tokyo, Ltd, London Branch, Bankers Trust Company, London Branch, and National
Westminster Bank PLC, London Branch, and any such replacement bank thereof as
listed on the Reuters Screen LIBO Page and their respective successors, and if
any of such banks are not at the applicable time providing interest rates as
contemplated within the definition of the "Applicable LIBOR Rate," Reference
Banks shall mean the remaining bank or banks so providing such rates. In the
event that less than two of such banks are providing such rates, the Issuers
shall use reasonable efforts to appoint additional Reference Banks so that there
are at least two such banks providing such rates; provided, however, that such
banks appointed by the Issuers shall be London offices of leading banks engaged
in the Eurodollar Market.

"Reuters Screen LIBO Page" means the display designated as page "LIBO" on
the Reuter Monitor Money Rates Service (or such other page as may replace the
LIBO page on that service for the purpose of displaying London Interbank Offered
Rates of major banks).

"Working Day" means any day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or a day on
which banking institutions in New York, New York or London, England are
authorized or obligated by law or executive order to close.

2. Method of Payment. The Issuers will pay interest on this Note (except
defaulted interest) to the Person who is the registered Holder of such Note at
the close of business on the record date next preceding the Floating Rate
Interest Payment Date, even if such Note is cancelled after such record date and
on or before such Floating Rate Interest Payment Date. The Holder hereof must
surrender this Note to a Paying Agent to collect principal payments. The
Issuers will pay principal and interest in money of the United States that at
the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts.
The Issuers, however, may pay principal, premium, if any, and interest by check
payable in such money. The Notes will be payable both 

B-4
<PAGE>

as to principal and interest at the office or agency of the Issuers maintained
for such purpose within the City and State of New York or, at the option of the
Issuers, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to the Holders of Notes
at their respective addresses set forth in the register of Holders. Unless
otherwise designated by the Issuers, the Issuers' office or agency in New York,
New York will be the office of the Trustee maintained for such a purpose.

3. Paying Agent and Registrar. Initially, the Trustee will act as Paying
Agent and Registrar. The Issuers may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or co-
registrar without notice to any Holder. Either Issuer or any Guarantor may act
in any such capacity.

4. Indenture. The Issuers issued the Notes under an Indenture dated as of
July 5, 1994 (the "Indenture") between Partnership, Finance Corp. and the
Trustee. The terms Notes include those stated in the Indenture and those made
part of the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.
Code (S)(S) 77aaa-77bbbb) as in effect on the date of the Indenture. The Notes
are subject to all such terms, and Holders of the Notes are referred to the
Indenture and such act for a statement of such terms. The terms of the
Indenture shall govern any inconsistencies between the Indenture and the Notes.
The Notes are unsecured general obligations of the Issuers limited to
$250,000,000 in aggregate principal amount. The Floating Rate Senior Notes are
limited to $50,000,000 in aggregate principal amount.

5. Optional Redemption. The Issuers may redeem all or any portion of the
Floating Rate Senior Notes on any Floating Rate Interest Payment Date on or
after August 1, 1995, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice to each
Holder, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount
then redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.

6. Mandatory Redemption. The Issuers shall redeem $5,000,000 principal
amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes on each of August 1, 1999 and August 1,
2000 at a redemption price equal to 100% of principal amount thereof, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The Issuers may reduce the
principal amount of Floating Rate Senior Notes to be redeemed pursuant to this
paragraph 6 by subtracting 100% of the principal amount of any Floating Rate
Senior Notes that the Issuers have delivered to the Trustee for cancellation or
that the Issuers have redeemed other than pursuant to this paragraph 6. The
Issuers may so subtract the principal amount of a Floating Rate Senior Note only
once.

Except as described in this paragraph 6 and in paragraph 7 below, the
Issuers shall not be required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund
payments with respect to the Notes.

7. Redemption or Repurchase at Option of Holder. (a) If there is a
Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture), the Issuers shall be required
to offer to purchase all Notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. Holders of
Notes that are subject to an offer to purchase will receive a notice therefor
from the Issuers prior to any related purchase date, and may elect to have such
Notes purchased by completing the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect
Purchase" appearing below.

(b) When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds from Asset Sales (as
defined in the Indenture) exceeds $15 million, the Issuers shall be required to
purchase the maximum principal amount of Notes that may be purchased out of the
Excess Proceeds at 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date fixed for the closing of such offer. If the
aggregate principal amount of Notes surrendered by Holders thereof exceeds 

B-5
<PAGE>

the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Notes to be redeemed shall be selected
pursuant to the terms of Section 3.02 of the Indenture (with such adjustments as
may be deemed appropriate by the Issuers so that only Notes in denominations of
$1,000, or integral multiples thereof, shall be purchased). To the extent that
the aggregate amount of Notes tendered by Holders thereof is less than the
Excess Proceeds, the Issuers may use such deficiency for general business
purposes. Holders of Notes which are the subject of an offer to purchase will
receive a notice therefor from the Issuers prior to any related purchase date,
and may elect to have such Notes purchased by completing the form entitled
"Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" appearing below.

8. Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption shall be mailed at least
30 days but not more than 60 days before the redemption date to each Holder of
Notes to be redeemed at its registered address. Notes may be redeemed in part
but only in whole multiples of $1,000, unless all of the Notes held by a Holder
are to be redeemed. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue
on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

9. Denominations, Transfer, Exchange. The Notes are in registered form
without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000.
The transfer of Notes may be registered and Notes may be exchanged as provided
in the Indenture. The Registrar and the Trustee may require a Holder, among
other things, to furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to
pay any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture. The
Registrar need not exchange or register the transfer of any Note or portion of a
Note selected for redemption. Also, it need not exchange or register the
transfer of any Notes for a period of 15 days before a selection of Notes to be
redeemed, during the period between a record date and the corresponding Floating
Rate Interest Payment Date.

10. Persons Deemed Owners. Prior to due presentment to the Trustee for
registration of the transfer of this Note, the Trustee, any Agent, the Issuers
and the Guarantors may deem and treat the Person in whose name this Note is
registered as its absolute owner for the purpose of receiving payment of
principal of and interest on this Note and for all other purposes whatsoever,
whether or not this Note is overdue, and neither the Trustee, any Agent, the
Issuers nor any Guarantor shall be affected by notice to the contrary. The
registered holder of a Note shall be treated as its owner for all purposes.

11. Amendments and Waivers. Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture
or the Notes may be amended with the consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes (including consents
obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for Notes), and any
existing default or compliance with any provision of the Indenture or the Notes
may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount
of the then outstanding Notes (including consents obtained in connection with a
tender offer or exchange offer for Notes). Without the consent of any Holder,
the Indenture or the Notes may be amended to cure any ambiguity, defect or
inconsistency, to provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of
certificated Notes, to provide for assumption of the Issuers' or any Guarantor's
obligations to Holders in the case of a merger or consolidation or to make any
change that would provide any additional rights or benefits to the Holders or
that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder under the Indenture or
to comply with the requirements of the Commission in order to effect or maintain
the qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act. Without the
consent of each Holder affected, an amendment or waiver may not (with respect to
any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder of Notes): (i) reduce the principal
amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or
waiver, (ii) reduce the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any Note or
alter the provisions with 

B-6
<PAGE>

respect to the redemption of the Notes (other than provisions relating to the
covenants described above under the caption "Redemption or Repurchase at Option
of Holder"), (iii) reduce the rate of or change the time for payment of interest
on any Note, (iv) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of
principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes (except a rescission
of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted
from such acceleration), (v) make any Note payable in money other than that
stated in the Notes, (vi) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture
relating to waivers of past Defaults or the rights of Holders of Notes to
receive payments of principal of or premium, if any, or interest on the Notes,
(vii) waive a redemption payment with respect to any Note (other than a payment
required by one of the covenants described above under the caption "Redemption
or Repurchase at the Option of Holders"), (viii) except as otherwise permitted
in the Indenture, release any Guarantor from its obligations under its Note
Guarantee or change any Note Guarantee in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights of the Holders of Senior Notes or (ix) make any change in the
foregoing amendment and waiver provisions.

12. Defaults and Remedies. Events of Default include: default for 30
days in the payment when due of interest on the Notes; default in payment when
due of principal of or premium, if any, on the Notes at maturity, upon
redemption or otherwise; failure for 20 days by the Partnership to comply with
Sections 4.07, 4.09, 4.10, 4.14 or 5.01 of the Indenture; failure by the
Partnership or the Guarantors for 60 days after notice from the Trustee or the
Holder of at least 25% in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding to
comply with any of its other agreements in the Indenture or the Notes; default
under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or
by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed
by the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is
guaranteed by the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries) whether such
Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the date of the
Indenture, which default (a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of or
premium, if any, or interest on such Indebtedness prior to the expiration of the
grace period provided in such Indebtedness (a "Payment Default") or (b) results
in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its express maturity and, in
each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a
Payment Default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates $10
million or more, excluding any acceleration of maturity of the Indebtedness
represented by the General Partner's Existing Floating Rate Notes and Existing
Fixed Rate Notes to the extent that such Indebtedness shall be redeemed on or
prior to the 40th day after the date of this Indenture; failure by the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries to pay final judgments aggregating in
excess of $10 million, which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a
period of 60 days; except as permitted by the Indenture, any Note Guarantee
shall be held in any judicial proceeding to be unenforceable or invalid or shall
cease for any reason to be in full force and effect or any Guarantor, or any
Person acting on behalf of any Guarantor, shall deny or disaffirm its
obligations under its Note Guarantees; and certain events of bankruptcy or
insolvency with respect to the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries. If any
Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at
least 25% in principal amount of the then outstanding Notes may declare all the
Notes to be due and payable immediately; except that in the case of an Event of
Default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency, relating to the
Partnership, any Significant Subsidiary or any group of Subsidiaries that, taken
together, would constitute a Significant Subsidiary, all outstanding Notes will
become due and payable without further action or notice. Holders of the Notes
may not enforce the Indenture or the Notes except as provided in the Indenture.
Subject to certain limitations, Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
then outstanding Notes may direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust 

B-7
<PAGE>

or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of the Notes notice of any
continuing Default or Event of Default (except a Default or Event of Default
relating to the payment of principal or interest) if it determines that
withholding notice is in their interest. The Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by notice to the Trustee, may on
behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes waive any existing Default or Event of
Default and its consequences under the Indenture except a continuing Default or
Event of Default in the payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest
on the Notes. The Issuers are required to deliver to the Trustee annually a
statement regarding compliance with the Indenture, and the Issuers are required
upon becoming aware of any Default or Event of Default, to deliver to the
Trustee a statement specifying such Default or Event of Default.

13. Trustee Dealings with Issuers. The Trustee under the Indenture, in
its individual or any other capacity, may make loans to, accept deposits from,
and perform services for the Issuers, any Guarantor or their respective
Affiliates, and may otherwise deal with the Issuers, any Guarantor or their
respective Affiliates, as if it were not Trustee; however, if the Trustee
acquires any conflicting interest it must eliminate such conflict within 90
days, apply to the Commission for permission to continue as Trustee or resign.

14. No Recourse Against Others. No past, present or future director,
officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder, as such, of either Issuer or any
Guarantor, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuers
or any Guarantor under the Notes, the Note Guarantees or the Indenture or for
any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their
creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note and the related Note Guarantees, if
any, waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of
the consideration for the issuance of the Notes.

15. Authentication. This Note shall not be valid until authenticated by
the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating agent.

16. Abbreviations. Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a
Holder or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (=
tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship
and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts
to Minors Act).

17. CUSIP Numbers. Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the
Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures, the Issuers have caused
CUSIP numbers to be printed on the Notes and has directed the Trustee to use
CUSIP numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders. No
representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers either as printed on
the Notes or as contained in any notice of redemption and reliance may be placed
only on the other identification numbers placed thereon.

GOVERN AND BE USED TO CONSTRUE THE INDENTURE, THE NOTES AND THE NOTE GUARANTEES,

authorized to execute and deliver this Supplemental Indenture.
