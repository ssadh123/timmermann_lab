Item 5. Other Events

1. On January 24, 1994, American Express Company issued a press
release announcing its plan to issue a special dividend to its common
shareholders, a portion of which follows:

NEW YORK, January 24, 1994 - The American Express Company today announced
plans to issue a special dividend to common shareholders consisting of common
shares of its subsidiary, Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc.

The tax free dividend would complete a restructuring of the Company
around the businesses that operate under the American Express brand name: 
consumer card, corporate services, travel, asset management, financial
planning and international banking.

The move, which is subject to certain conditions, would establish Lehman
Brothers as an independent, publicly-owned corporation during the second
quarter of 1994. Prior to the spin-off, American Express plans to strengthen
Lehman Brothers' equity base, in order to reinforce the firm's strong
competitive position and help it achieve solid credit ratings.

The additional equity at Lehman Brothers will come from:

- the purchase of about $160 million of newly-issued Lehman Brothers
common shares by employees of the firm. Approximately $60 million of this
amount would come from an employee ownership plan that was established last
year.

- the purchase by American Express of $200 million of newly-issued
Lehman Brothers perpetual voting preferred shares, which would be held for
investment purposes.

- the purchase by American Express of $890 million of newly-issued
Lehman Brothers common shares, which will be included in the subsequent
dividend to shareholders.

In recognition of its capital infusion, American Express would receive 50
percent of any Lehman Brothers net income over $400 million per year, with a
cap of $50 million per year for each of the next eight years. The cumulative
payout would not exceed $400 million. In addition, American Express would
receive the revenue and earnings-related participations due to Lehman Brothers
from Travelers Corporation as part of the sale of the retail brokerage and
asset management businesses of Shearson Lehman Brothers last year. The
Travelers participations are expected to yield $50 million pre-tax annually
for the next three years, depending on the revenues and profits of Smith
Barney Shearson.

The special dividend to shareholders would represent all of the common
shares of Lehman Brothers held by American Express. It will also include
common shares that will be received in exchange for Lehman Brothers money
market preferred stock currently held by American Express.

Following the transaction, American Express expects that common
shareholders will receive a cash dividend from the Lehman and American Express
shares that is equivalent to the current dividend now payable on American
Express shares. Future dividends would, however, be based on the determination
of each company's Board of Directors and their respective assessments of the
performance and financial requirements of the companies at that time.

<PAGE>
More than 90 percent of Lehman Brothers common shares are expected to be
publicly held following completion of the transaction. The remainder will be
owned by Lehman Brothers employees. American Express will own $200 million of
preferred shares; it will not hold any common shares. Nippon Life will
continue to hold $508 million of cumulative voting convertible preferred
shares. American Express will not be represented on the Lehman Brothers
Board and there will be no directors in common between the two companies.
Richard S. Fuld Jr. will continue as President and Chief Executive Officer of
Lehman Brothers.

Final terms of the transaction and the special dividend have not yet been
determined. The special dividend and other matters are subject to a number of
conditions including: receipt of a favorable tax opinion, regulatory
clearances, market conditions and final approval by the American Express
Board. In addition, the capital infusion and certain other matters are
subject to approval by the Lehman Brothers' Board. Aside from closing related
costs, no earnings gains or losses are anticipated from this transaction for
either American Express or Lehman Brothers.

2. On January 24, 1994, American Express Company issued the following
press release reporting its 1993 earnings:

NEW YORK, January 24, 1994 -- American Express today reported 1993
consolidated income from continuing operations of $1.6 billion, or $3.17 per
share, compared with $578 million, or $1.12 per share, a year ago. The year
ago earnings are before accounting changes.

Results for both periods reflected a number of significant items. The
1993 results include a gain of $433 million on the secondary public offering
of First Data Corporation (FDC). The 1992 results included a net charge of
$217 million related to a restructuring charge at Travel Related Services
(TRS) and additional reserves at Balcor, which were partially offset by a gain
on the initial public offering of FDC.

Separately, American Express announced plans to spin-off its
subsidiary Lehman Brothers (Lehman) to shareholders through a dividend
payable during the second quarter of 1994. Lehman, which is now treated as a
"discontinued operation," reported 1993 income of $376 million before net
losses from the sale of various businesses and their related earnings for the
year. Lehman results are discussed in more detail in the Lehman section.

Including discontinued operations, American Express consolidated net
income for 1993 totaled $1.5 billion, or $2.92 per share, compared with $461
million, or $0.88 per share a year ago.

For the fourth quarter, American Express reported consolidated income
from continuing operations of $291 million, or $0.57 per share, compared with
$255 million, or $0.51 per share a year ago. Including discontinued
operations, consolidated fourth quarter net income totaled $399 million, or
$0.78 per share, compared with $82 million, or $0.15 per share, a year ago.

Travel Related Services (TRS) reported 1993 net income of $895
million, compared with net income of $243 million before the change in
accounting last year. Year-ago results included a $342 million restructuring
charge ($492 million pre-tax) largely related to reengineering initiatives
designed to lower ongoing costs.

<PAGE>
Net revenues were down slightly, reflecting discount rate reductions,
a decrease in net card fees, and lower net interest on lending products. 
This decline was largely offset by an increase in billed business, reflecting
higher spending per Cardmember and an increase in the number of Service
Establishments accepting the Card.

Excluding interest expense, credit provisions and the 1992
restructuring charge, total expenses were essentially flat compared to a year
ago. These results were achieved as a result of the company's ongoing
reengineering initiatives, which offset costs associated with overall growth
in business volumes and franchise building investments.

Credit provisions declined significantly reflecting actions taken last
year to restructure the portfolio, as well as ongoing improvements in credit
management.

For the fourth quarter, TRS net income was $213 million, compared with
$181 million a year ago.

IDS Financial Services (IDS) reported record net income of $358
million, a 21 percent increase from $297 million before the change in
accounting last year.

Revenue and earnings growth benefited primarily from an increase in
management fees and net investment income that resulted from higher asset
levels. Results also benefited from wider investment margins compared to
year-ago levels.

IDS reported record sales of annuities, mutual funds, and life and
related insurance products, while sales of investment certificates decreased
from last year.

For the fourth quarter, IDS net income was $98 million, compared with
$82 million a year ago.

American Express Bank (AEB) reported 1993 net income of $81 million,
compared with $26 million before the change in accounting last year. Last
year's results reflected the recognition of additional reserves on
credit-related exposures, principally those associated with discontinued real
estate lending activities in the United Kingdom, as well as a restructuring
charge.

Results for 1993 reflect growth in fee income and foreign exchange
activities, as well as benefits from lower short-term funding costs.

Total nonperforming loans and other nonperforming assets (in-substance
foreclosures and assets acquired in loan settlements) of $132 million
decreased $53 million from last year and $66 million from the third quarter,
largely as a result of the disposition of United Kingdom real estate loans.

AEB's net income was $20 million for the fourth quarters of both 1993
and 1992.

Lehman Brothers (Lehman) As noted earlier, American Express today
announced plans to spin-off Lehman to its shareholders as a special dividend. 
Accordingly, Lehman results are shown in the attached consolidated financial
statement as "discontinued operations."

<PAGE>
The businesses that now comprise Lehman reported 1993 net income of
$376 million, before net losses from the sale of various businesses and their
related earnings for the year. After accounting for these items, Lehman
reported a net loss of $102 million, compared with a net loss of $124 million
last year.

The 1992 results reflected a series of charges that totaled $316
million after-tax, consisting of: $59 million ($90 million pre-tax) of
additional legal provisions; a $107 million ($162 million pre-tax) writedown
in the carrying value of certain real estate invstments in the fourth quarter;
and charges of $150 million ($245 million pre-tax) related to Lehman's
holdings of Computervision Corporation.

Excluding the businesses that have been sold, Lehman's revenues, net
of interest expense, increased 23 percent, reflecting increased market making
and principal transactions across all business lines. Investment banking
revenues increased, reflecting higher underwriting volume. Total
non-interest expenses grew 7 percent, excluding the 1992 charges mentioned
above, as a result of higher levels of compensation and benefits expense
related to increased revenue and profitability.

After preferred dividend requirements, American Express' share of
Lehman's results was a net loss of $127 million, compared with a net loss of
$149 million last year.

For the fourth quarter, Lehman's net income was $114 million, compared
with a net loss of $166 million a year ago, which included the additional
legal provisions and real estate writedowns mentioned above. The Company's
share of Lehman's fourth quarter results was net income of $108 million,
compared with a net loss of $173 million a year ago.

Corporate and Other reported 1993 net expenses of $203 million,
compared with net expenses of $205 million last year before: the Company's
share of FDC's net income of $40 million in 1993 and $92 million in 1992; a
$433 million after-tax gain in 1993 and a $425 million after-tax gain in 1992
from the public offerings of FDC common stock; and $300 million in additional
reserves related to The Balcor Company in 1992. After accounting for these
items, Corporate and Other reported net income of $270 million in 1993 and $12
million last year.

The Company reduced its ownership interest in FDC from 100 percent to
54 percent in April 1992, and to 22 percent in March 1993.

Change in U.S. federal income tax rate. The Company's results for the
12 months ended December 31, 1993 include a $30 million one-time benefit from
the impact of a change in the U.S. federal income tax rate (from 34 percent to
35 percent) on the Company's net deferred tax assets.

Accounting Changes. Results for the 12 months ended December 31, 1992
reflected the Company's adoption of two new accounting standards, SFAS No. 106
and SFAS No. 109, which together increased 1992 income from continuing
operations by $33 million.

(B) As a result of the Company's public offering of FDC common stock in April
1992, American Express' former 100 percent ownership interest in FDC was
reduced to approximately 54 percent. On March 29, 1993, the Company further
