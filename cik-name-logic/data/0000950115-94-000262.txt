(UNAUDITED)

(1) BASIS OF PRESENTATION

KCI Medical Services, a division of KCI Therapeutic Services (KCITS), Inc.
which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kinetic Concepts, Inc. (KCI), is
engaged in the business of offering for rental and sale movable critical
care and life support equipment. KCI Medical Services also sells disposable
medical care products to hospitals and other health care providers for use
in conjunction with such equipment.

On September 30, 1994, MEDIQ/PRN Life Support Services-I, Inc., an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of MEDIQ Inc., entered into an Asset Purchase
Agreement with KCITS. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement dated August 23,
1994, MEDIQ acquired certain of the assets and assumed certain liabilities
of KCI Medical Services for approximately $84 million including $2 million
for an agreement not to compete. In addition to the sales price, KCI will
retain the accounts receivable of KCI Medical Services.

The accompanying statements of operations before taxes reflect the
operations of KCI Medical Services as described in the Asset Purchase
Agreement. The statements of operating results do not include charges for
income taxes since income taxes are considered to be corporate expenses.

The accompanying statements of operations before taxes have been prepared
without audit but, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments
necessary to a fair statement of the information presented for the
nine-month periods ended September 30, 1993 and 1994. Such adjustments are
of a normal, recurring nature. The results for the nine-month period ended
September 30, 1994 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be
expected for the full year.

(2) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(A) REVENUE RECOGNITION

Service and rental revenue is recognized as services are rendered.
Sales and other revenue is recognized when products are shipped.

(B) DEPRECIATION

Depreciation on equipment is calculated on the straight-line method
over three to ten years which is the useful lives of the assets.
Depreciation expense was $10,396 and $10,075 for the nine months ended
September 30, 1994 and 1993, respectively.

(C) AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL

Goodwill is amortized over fifteen to thirty-five years from the date
of acquisition using the straight-line method.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS)

(1) BASIS OF PRESENTATION

KCI Medical Services, a division of KCI Therapeutic Services (KCITS), Inc.
which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kinetic Concepts, Inc. (KCI), is
engaged in the business of offering for rental and sale movable critical
care and life support equipment. KCI Medical Services also sells disposable
medical care products to hospitals and other health care providers for use
in conjunction with such equipment.

On September 30, 1994, MEDIQ/PRN Life Support Services-I, Inc. (MEDIQ), an
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MEDIQ Inc., entered into an Asset
Purchase Agreement with KCITS. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement dated
August 23, 1994, MEDIQ acquired certain of the assets and assumed certain
liabilities of KCI Medical Services as of September 30, 1994, for
approximately $84 million including $2 million for an agreement not to
compete. In addition to the sales price, KCI will retain the accounts
receivable of KCI Medical Services.

In June, 1993, KCI acquired the operating assets of Clinical Systems, Inc.
(CSI), a provider of intravenous services and supplies to the home health
care market. Assets of CSI were consolidated with KCI Medical Services and
subject to the Asset Purchase Agreement between KCITS and MEDIQ, therefore,
CSI assets are included with the KCI Medical Services assets in the
accompanying statement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. CSI
operating results from the date of acquisition to December 31, 1993 are
included in the KCI Medical Services statement of operations for 1993.

On July 2, 1990, KCI acquired Medirec, a Utah corporation, pursuant to an
Agreement and plan of Merger dated May 30, 1990 (the Medirec Agreement). In
accordance with the Medirec Agreement, KCI Acquisition Corp., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of KCI, merged with Medirec. The acquisition was
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Medirec was renamed
KCI Medical Services. Originally, a division of Medirec leased certain
medical equipment under long-term lease agreements which were accounted for
as direct financing leases. Upon consolidation into KCITS, this division of
Medirec was separated into KCI Financial Services. KCI Financial Services
was not included in the Asset Purchase Agreement between KCITS and
MEDIQ/PRN.

The accompanying statements of assets acquired and liabilities assumed
reflect the historical cost basis of the assets acquired and the
liabilities assumed by MEDIQ pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement. The
accompanying statements of operating revenue and expenses reflect the
operations of KCI Medical Services as described in the Asset Purchase
Agreement. The statements of operating results do not include charges for
income taxes since income taxes are considered to be corporate expenses.

(b) Pro Forma Financial Information.

On September 30, 1994, MEDIQ Incorporated (the 'Company') acquired, through
wholly-owned subsidiaries, certain assets used by the medical equipment rental
division of Kinetic Concepts, Inc. ('KCI') for a purchase price of approximately
$65.3 million in cash and $18.8 million principal amount of notes payable to KCI
(the 'Acquisition').

The following pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for
the nine months ended June 30, 1994 and the year ended September 30, 1993 give
effect to the Acquisition and the financing thereof as if such transaction had
occurred at the beginning of fiscal 1993. The pro forma condensed consolidated
balance sheet as of June 30, 1994 gives effect to the Acquisition and the
financing thereof as if such transactions had occurred as of that date. The
Acquisition was accounted for pursuant to the purchase method of accounting.

The pro forma financial data presented herein is based on management's
estimate of the effects of the Acquisition and financing thereof. The pro forma 
financial data is based upon current available information and certain
assumptions that the Company believes are reasonable. The Company does not 
expect the receipt of additional information to have a material adverse affect
on the pro forma financial data. The pro forma condensed consolidated 
statements of operations for the nine months ended June 30, 1994 and the year 
ended September 30, 1993 and and the pro forma condensed consolidated balance 
sheet as of June 30, 1994 are unaudited, but in the opinion of the Company 
include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary
for a fair presentation of the results of operations and financial position 
for the periods presented.

The historical financial data of the Company included in the pro forma
statements is as of the periods presented. The historical financial data of KCI
included in the pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for
the nine months ended June 30, 1994 and the year ended September 30, 1993 are
for the nine months ended September 30, 1994 (unaudited), and the year ended
December 31, 1993 (audited), respectively. The historical financial data of KCI
included in the pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet is as of
September 30, 1994 (unaudited).

The pro forma condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine
months ended June 30, 1994 and the year ended September 30, 1993, and the pro
forma condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 1994 are not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations or financial position that
actually would have been achieved had the transactions described been
consummated as of the dates indicated, or that may be achieved in the future.
