CLARK EQUIPMENT REPORTS SECOND QUARTER EARNINGS

SOUTH BEND, INDIANA, July 25, 1994 -- Clark Equipment Company today
announced second quarter net income of $62.5 million, or $3.59 per share,
which compares to second quarter 1993 net income of $10.8 million, or
$0.62 per share. Second quarter 1994 results include a $32.9 million gain
equal to $1.88 per share related to the initial public offering of CAPCO,
Clark's former Brazil-based automotive supply business. Excluding the
CAPCO gain, second quarter net income from continuing operations was $29.8
million, or $1.71 per share. The announcement was made by Leo J.
McKernan, Clark chairman and chief executive officer.

In announcing earnings, Mr. McKernan said, "Clark Equipment Company's
profits continued their strong upward trend in the second quarter 1994.
Income from consolidated operations was up sharply, benefiting from strong
North American markets for Bobcat skid-steer loaders, construction
machinery and a continued recovery in European markets." Referring to
VME, Clark's 50-percent-owned joint venture, Mr. McKernan added that
Clark's share of VME net income for second quarter 1994 was $15.5 million,
or $0.89 per share, a sharp improvement over the net income of $0.9
million recorded in second quarter 1993.

For the six months ended June 30, 1994, Clark net income from continuing
operations, excluding the CAPCO gain, was $55.2 million, or $3.17 per
share, compared to $11.0 million, or $0.63 per share for the first six
months of 1993. Clark consolidated revenues for the first half of 1994
were $447.7 million compared to $350.4 million in the first six months of
1993.

Commenting on the quarter's significant events, Mr. McKernan said that
Clark completed the divestiture of CAPCO (NYSE: CAB), through an initial
public offering of ten million shares at $12 per share on May 5, 1994.
Clark continues to hold one million CAPCO shares, which currently have a
market value of approximately $10 million. CAPCO operating results have
been removed from current and historical Clark operating data and are
reported as a discontinued operation.

Referring to Clark's May 13 acquisition of Blaw-Knox Construction
Equipment Corporation, Mr. McKernan said, "Blaw-Knox is a worldwide leader
in the asphalt paver business and has a dominant share of the U.S.
market." He added that Blaw-Knox annual sales are expected to be about
$100 million in 1994. Its operating results for June and half of May are
included in Clark's reported sales and earnings. The net effect of the
Blaw-Knox acquisition and the CAPCO divestiture had no material impact on
operating earnings for the second quarter 1994.

Clark consolidated operations, which include Melroe Company, Clark-Hurth
Components and Blaw-Knox, generated net income of $14.3 million, or $0.82
per share, on sales of $242.5 million for second quarter 1994. These
results compare to Clark's consolidated net income of $8.4 million, or
$0.48 per share, on sales of $187.3 million in the same period of 1993.
Commenting on Clark consolidated operations, Mr. McKernan said, "Gross
margins and operating margins for the consolidated businesses improved in
the second quarter, compared to the second quarter 1993 and the first
quarter 1994." Sales and earnings of Blaw-Knox were not included in
second quarter 1993 results.

Clark new orders in the second quarter were $243.4 million, an increase of
approximately 28 percent, compared to orders of $190.4 million in the same
1993 period. First quarter 1994 orders were $247.5 million, driven by
record March orders at Melroe. Backlog at June 30, 1994, was $191.2
million, up sharply from $121.0 million in second quarter 1993 and $167.7
million recorded in first quarter 1994. Orders and backlogs in second
quarter 1994 include Blaw-Knox. Historical data does not include Blaw-
Knox or CAPCO.

Discussing the performance of Clark's Melroe Company, Mr. McKernan said,
"Melroe sales and earnings reached record levels in second quarter 1994.
Skid-steer industry retail sales in North America exceeded second quarter
1993 by more than 20 percent. Melroe 1994 skid-steer sales improved in
all North American geographic regions." He added that Bobcat mini-
excavator sales in North America also reached record levels in 1994, with
June year-to-date sales more than double the results in the first six
months of 1993. In Europe, Melroe's second quarter skid-steer sales were
up slightly compared to 1993. Weak sales in Germany were offset by
improved results in other markets, especially Italy and Scandinavia. 
Mini-excavator sales in Europe also rose slightly from last year's level.

Discussing the performance of Clark's off-highway components manufacturing
business, Mr. McKernan said, "Clark-Hurth sales and earnings increased due
to continued strong momentum in North American and European construction
machinery markets. Total orders for the second quarter were more than 45
percent ahead of the same period in 1993. The biggest gains came from
Europe, where most major markets showed good year-to-year improvement." 
He added that better plant capacity utilization combined with stringent
cost controls led to improved profits compared to first quarter 1994.

"At Blaw-Knox, sales and earnings also increased compared to 1993," said
Mr. McKernan, adding that North American shipments increased by more than
15 percent in second quarter 1994 compared to the same period in 1993.
"Improved paver and parts sales combined with cost reductions helped
increase margins from the second quarter 1993 level," said Mr. McKernan.
"Increased highway spending and a pick up in commercial paving activity
drove much of the increase. Export sales to the Mideast and the Far East
showed improvement," he said, noting that European markets remained
stagnant with no clear signs of recovery. However, European margins
improved on flat volumes due to continuing cost reduction efforts.

Discussing the performance of VME, Mr. McKernan said, "VME earnings
improvements were driven by higher sales volumes, improved price
realization, and lower interest costs due to declining debt levels. VME
North American markets continued to show strength in all product areas,
while most European economies continued their slow progress toward
economic recovery." VME earnings for the second quarter increased to
$15.5 million, or $0.89 per share, compared to $0.9 million, or $0.05 per
share, in the same 1993 period. Sales were $406.0 million, up 24 percent
from second

<PAGE>
quarter 1993 sales of $327.1 million and 24 percent above first quarter 1994. 

Looking ahead, Mr. McKernan said, "We believe current results and order
rates provide an optimistic picture of business activity for the balance
of the year. Even though normal seasonal patterns in our continuing
businesses dictate that third quarter results will come in below the
seasonal peaks reached in the second quarter, we expect third quarter 1994
results to show a substantial improvement over Clark's 1993 performance."

Clark Equipment Company designs, manufactures and markets skid-steer
loaders, construction machinery, asphalt paving equipment, and axles and
transmissions for off-highway equipment.
