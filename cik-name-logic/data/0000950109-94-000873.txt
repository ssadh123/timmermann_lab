AmSouth Bancorporation ("AmSouth") is filing this Current Report on Form
8-K to present pro forma financial statements that give effect to the pending
mergers and acquisitions as of March 31, 1994, described below.

Pending Mergers and Acquisitions as of March 31, 1994

. On July 29, 1993, AmSouth signed an agreement to acquire Parkway Bank, 
which is headquartered in Fort Myers, Florida, and its parent company,
Parkway Bancorp, Inc. ("Parkway"). These acquisitions were consummated on
April 4, 1994. AmSouth issued approximately 629,000 shares of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share ("AmSouth Common Stock") in exchange for
the outstanding shares of Parkway. These acquisitions will be accounted
for as a pooling-of-interests under generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP").

. On August 3, 1993, AmSouth signed an agreement to acquire First Federal 
Savings Bank, Calhoun, Georgia ("Calhoun"), headquartered in Calhoun,
Georgia. This acquisition was consummated on April 7, 1994. AmSouth
issued approximately 442,000 shares of AmSouth Common Stock in exchange
for the outstanding shares of Calhoun. The acquisition will be accounted
for as a pooling-of-interests under GAAP.

. On August 9, 1993, AmSouth signed an agreement to acquire Citizens 
National Bank of Naples, which is headquartered in Naples, Florida, and
its parent company, Citizens National Corporation ("Citizens"). These
acquisitions were consummated on April 4, 1994. AmSouth issued
approximately 1,604,000 shares of AmSouth Common Stock in exchange for
the outstanding shares of Citizens. These acquisitions will be accounted
for as a pooling-of-interests under GAAP.

. On September 12, 1993, AmSouth signed an agreement, which was amended on 
May 11, 1994, to acquire Fortune Bank, which is headquartered in
Clearwater, Florida, and its parent company, Fortune Bancorp, Inc.
("Fortune"). Under the terms of the amended agreement, Fortune
shareholders may make an election to receive either cash or AmSouth
Common Stock based on a formula which takes into consideration AmSouth's
stock price during a future pricing period. In addition to receiving cash
or shares of AmSouth Common Stock, Fortune preferred shareholders will
also receive $1.81 per Fortune preferred share in cash. Approximately one-
half of Fortune's shares will be exchanged for cash and one-half for
AmSouth Common Stock (plus $1.81 per Fortune preferred share in cash to
each Fortune preferred shareholder), subject to adjustment based upon the
average price per share of AmSouth Common Stock during a specified
period, with AmSouth issuing approximately 4,507,000 shares of AmSouth
Common Stock and approximately $145.8 million in cash. At March 31, 1994,
Fortune had total consolidated assets of approximately $2.7 billion and
total consolidated deposits of approximately $1.8 billion. The
acquisition will be accounted 
<PAGE>

for as a purchase under GAAP and is subject to approval by the Fortune
shareholders at a meeting currently scheduled for May 23, 1994, and the
fulfillment of certain other closing conditions. Regulatory approvals
have been received. Assuming receipt of shareholder approval, the Fortune
acquisition is currently expected to close on or about June 23, 1994.

. On March 9, 1994, AmSouth signed an agreement to acquire The Bank of 
Tampa, which is located in Tampa, Florida, and its parent company, The
Tampa Banking Company ("Tampa"). At March 31, 1994, Tampa had total
consolidated assets of approximately $213.0 million and total
consolidated deposits of approximately $197.0 million. Under the terms of
the agreement, AmSouth will issue 1.5592 shares of AmSouth Common Stock
for each of the outstanding shares of Tampa common stock, subject to
adjustment. At March 31, 1994, Tampa had approximately 626,000 shares of
common stock outstanding. The acquisition will be accounted for as a
pooling-of-interests under GAAP.

. On March 31, 1994, AmSouth signed an agreement to acquire Community 
Federal Savings Bank ("Community"), headquartered in Fort Oglethorpe,
Georgia. At March 31, 1994, Community had total assets of approximately
$103.0 million and total deposits of approximately $89.0 million. Under
the terms of the agreement, AmSouth will pay $65.50 for each of the
outstanding shares of Community common stock for a total purchase price
of approximately $17.2 million. The acquisition will be accounted for as
a purchase under GAAP.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED PRO FORMA COMBINED CONDENSED STATEMENT OF CONDITION
MARCH 31, 1994
(In Thousands Except Share Amounts)

(A) The following pro forma adjustments are necessary to record the transactions
for Fortune:

<TABLE> 
<S> <C> 
(1) To eliminate goodwill $ (9,877)

(2) To eliminate core deposit intangible (3,277)

(3) To establish income tax liability (1,000)

(4) To recapture a tax bad debt reserve as a result of the
reversal of a special deduction for bad debts allowed 
for certain savings and loan associations that is not 
available to commercial banks (5,900)

(5) To write off prepaid expenses (1,622)

(6) To eliminate deferred loan costs-FASB 91 (2,442)

(7) To establish deferred taxes on applicable items above 
assuming a 38% tax rate 2,789
---------
$ (21,329)
=========
</TABLE>

(B) These amounts reflect purchase accounting adjustments of the book value of
the assets and liabilities of Fortune estimated at fair values. Current
market values of investment securities were determined using publicly quoted
prices. Certain long-term fixed rate loans and deposits were valued based on
prevailing market interest rates. The final purchase accounting adjustments
may vary to the extent that the market values of the assets and liabilities
change.

</TABLE> 

The fair market value of the loans is approximately equal to the book value;
therefore, no fair value adjustment is necessary.

Deferred taxes are established on the net difference between the fair value
adjustments and the deductible portion of the estimated acquisition costs.

(C) Fortune stock options which are exercisable prior to the merger are assumed
to be exercised before the merger as follows:

<TABLE> 
<S> <C> 
Number of Fortune options outstanding 164,979
Average exercise price per share 18.615
-----------
Proceeds from exercise $ 3,071
===========
</TABLE> 

The impact upon Fortune's statement of condition as a result of the exercise
will be the issuance of 164,979 shares of $0.01 par value common stock with
a resulting $2 increase in common stock, a $3,069 increase in capital
surplus and a $3,071 increase in cash.

If the outstanding Fortune stock options are not exercised prior to the
merger, AmSouth has the option, on a case by case basis, to convert the
options into either (1) an option to purchase, on the same terms as the
Fortune common stock, shares of AmSouth Common Stock in an amount and at a
price appropriately adjusted to reflect the per share consideration received
by holders of Fortune common stock; or (2) cash in an amount equal to the
difference between (a) the per share consideration to be received by holders
of Fortune common stock in the merger and (b) the exercise price of such
option. The assumption that all of the Fortune stock options will be
exercised before the merger represents the most dilutive outcome. If either
option (1) or option (2) discussed above were to occur, the pro forma
combined condensed statement of condition and statement of earnings would
not be materially different from that reported.

(D) In connection with the acquistion, each common and preferred shareholder of
Fortune may make an election to receive either cash or AmSouth Common Stock
based on a formula which takes into consideration AmSouth's stock price
during a future pricing period. In addition to receiving cash or shares of
AmSouth Common Stock, Fortune preferred shareholders will also receive $1.81
per Fortune preferred share in cash. Approximately one-half of Fortune's
shares will be exchanged for cash and one-half for AmSouth Common Stock
(plus $1.81 per Fortune preferred share in cash to each Fortune preferred
shareholder), subject to adjustment based upon the average price per share
of AmSouth Common Stock, with AmSouth issuing approximately 4,507,000 shares
and approximately $145.8 million in cash. The cash consideration is assumed
to be funded by AmSouth's issuance of $145,819 of long-term debt at an
assumed interest rate of 7.5%.

Based upon an average price per share of AmSouth Common Stock of $28.125,
approximately 4,507,000 shares of AmSouth Common Stock will be issued with a
resulting $4,507 increase to common stock and a $122,252 increase in capital
surplus. The remaining capital of Fortune, after all fair value adjustments
and accounting adjustments will be eliminated.

(E) Certain Parkway stock options which are exercisable prior to the merger are
assumed to be exercised before the merger resulting in the issuance of
approximately 118,000 shares of Parkway common stock and the receipt of
$146. The impact upon Parkway's statement of condition as a result of the
exercise will be the issuance of approximately 118,000 shares of $0.01 par
value common stock with a resulting $1 increase in common stock, a $145
increase in capital surplus and a $146 increase in cash.

(F) Upon consummation of the merger with Parkway, each share of Parkway common
stock was converted into 0.4886 of a share of AmSouth Common Stock. The
Parkway transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests;
therefore, the effect upon shareholders' equity will be to increase AmSouth
shareholders' equity by the total equity of Parkway. The unaudited pro forma
financial statements have been prepared to reflect that AmSouth issued in
the aggregate approximately 629,000 shares of AmSouth Common Stock to the
shareholders of Parkway. A reclassification from capital surplus to common
stock results from the issuance of the shares.

(G) Upon consummation of the merger with Calhoun, each share of Calhoun common
stock was converted into 0.9991 of a share of AmSouth Common Stock. The
Calhoun transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests;
therefore, the effect upon shareholders' equity will be to increase AmSouth
shareholders' equity by the total equity of Calhoun. The unaudited pro forma
financial statements have been prepared to reflect that AmSouth issued in
the aggregate approximately 442,000 shares of AmSouth Common Stock to the
shareholders of Calhoun. A reclassification from capital surplus to common
stock results from the issuance of the shares.

(H) Certain Citizen stock options which are exercisable prior to the merger are
assumed to be exercised before the merger resulting in the issuance of
approximately 208,000 shares of Citizen common stock and the receipt of
$646. The impact upon Citizen's statement of condition as a result of the
exercise will be the issuance of approximately 208,000 shares of $0.01 par
value common stock with a resulting $2 increase in common stock, a $644
increase in capital surplus and a $646 increase in cash.

(I) Upon consummation of the merger with Citizens, each share of Citizens common
stock was converted into 0.3609 of a share of AmSouth Common Stock. The
Citizens transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests;
therefore, the effect upon shareholders' equity will be to increase AmSouth
shareholders' equity by the total equity of Citizens. The unaudited pro
forma financial statements have been prepared to reflect that AmSouth issued
in the aggregate approximately 1,604,000 shares of AmSouth Common Stock to
the shareholders of Citizens. A reclassification from capital surplus to
common stock results from the issuance of the shares.
<PAGE>

(J) Upon consummation of the merger with Tampa, each share of Tampa common stock
will be converted into 1.5592 shares of AmSouth Common Stock. The Tampa
transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests; therefore, the
effect upon shareholders' equity will be to increase AmSouth shareholders'
equity by the total equity of Tampa. The unaudited pro forma financial
statements have been prepared assuming that AmSouth will issue in the
aggregate approximately 979,000 (1.5592 X 627,907) shares of AmSouth Common
Stock to the shareholders of Tampa. A reclassification from capital surplus
to common stock results from the issuance of the shares.

(K) The following pro forma adjustments are necessary to record the transactions
for Community:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
(1) To recapture a tax bad debt reserve as a result of the 
reversal of a special deduction for bad debts allowed for 
certain savings and loan associations that is not 
available to commercial banks (441)

(2) To write off miscellaneous assets (56)

(3) To eliminate deferred loan fees-FASB 91 456

(4) To establish deferred taxes on applicable items above 
assuming a 38% tax rate (152)
---------
$ (193)
========= 
</TABLE>

(L) These amounts reflect purchase accounting adjustments of the book value of
the assets and liabilities of Community estimated at fair values. Current
market values of investment securities were determined using publicly quoted
prices. Certain long-term fixed rate loans and deposits were valued based on
prevailing market interest rates. The final purchase accounting adjustments
may vary to the extent that the market values of the assets and liabilities
change.

Deferred taxes at 38% on applicable items 210
Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired 7,954
-----------
$ 17,956
===========
</TABLE> 

The fair market values of the fixed assets and the Federal Home Loan Bank
advances are approximately equal to the book value: therefore, no fair value
adjustments are necessary.

Deferred taxes are established on the net difference between the fair value
adjustments and the deductible portion of the estimated acquisition costs.

(M) AmSouth is purchasing all of the outstanding shares of Community for a total
cash purchase price of $17,069. There is no impact on AmSouth's
shareholders' equity, with all of the Community shareholders' equity being
eliminated and no new shares of AmSouth being issued.

purchase accounting adjustments. Included in the Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Condensed Statement of Earnings for the twelve months ended
December 31, 1993, is the Mid-State Federal statement of earnings for the
twelve months ended September 30, 1993, the last available twelve month
period (which is representative of normal operations).

The expected decrease for each of the twelve months ended December 31,
indicated below, on future net income and shareholders' equity of the
projected aggregate purchase accounting adjustments reflected in the
accompanying unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements
assuming the merger was consummated on January 1, 1993 are as follows:

</TABLE> 

The Excess of Cost Over Fair Value of Net Assets Acquired is being amortized
on a straight line basis over twenty years. The accretion (amortization) of
all other items is generally over a shorter period and generally on an
accelerated method. Therefore, the expected decrease for each of the twelve
months ended December 31, 1994 - 1998 on future net income and shareholders'
equity increases each year.

(G) To eliminate interest expense on $1,310 of Parkway's 9% convertible
