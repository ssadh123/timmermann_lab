FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

SOCIETY CORPORATION DECLARES 14 PERCENT DIVIDEND INCREASE
AND RECORD ANNUAL EARNINGS

CLEVELAND, January 20, 1994 -- Society Corporation (NYSE: SCY)
today declared a 14.3 percent increase in its quarterly common share
dividend from $0.28 per share to $0.32 per share, payable March 15, 1994, to
shareholders of record on February 28, 1994, with an ex-dividend date of
February 21, 1994.

"This increase marks the 29th consecutive year we have
increased the dividend," said Robert W. Gillespie, chairman and chief
executive officer, "and reflects a combination of strong operating
performance in 1993 as well as confidence in the 1994 outlook as we approach
the merger with KeyCorp."

The Board of Directors of KeyCorp is scheduled to meet for the
last time before the merger on February 17, 1994. At that meeting,
KeyCorp's board is expected to consider a dividend recommendation that,
considering the merger exchange ratio of 1.205 shares of stock in the new
company for each common share of KeyCorp, would be comparable to the
indicated Society dividend, and would have the same record and payable
dates. Such a dividend by KeyCorp would represent a 24.4 percent increase
over its 1993 dividend.

Society's dividend action was reviewed and approved by KeyCorp
(NYSE: KEY) as required by the Merger Agreement between Society and KeyCorp.

1993 FOURTH QUARTER AND ANNUAL EARNINGS REVIEW

Society Corporation also reported fourth quarter operating
earnings

before a restructuring charge of $96.6 million or $0.82 per common share, 
up 14 percent from the year-ago quarter. On the same basis, 1993 earnings 
were a record $386.7 million or $3.26 per common share, up 21 percent. The 
1993 fourth quarter's restructuring charge which related to the pending
merger with KeyCorp totaled $39.6 million after-tax, or $0.33 per common 
share. Including the impact of this restructuring charge, Society reported 
fourth quarter and record full-year 1993 earnings of $57.0 million and 
$347.2 million, respectively, or $0.49 and $2.93 per common share.

"Obviously, the announced merger with KeyCorp represented the
most significant event of the quarter and is a major milestone in the
history of both companies," said Gillespie. "I am happy to report that
integration planning for the merger, which will expand the franchise and
product delivery capabilities for both companies, is proceeding ahead of
schedule. The new management team has been announced. Working together
they have already completed a plan for 1994, confirming preliminary
merger-related expense reduction estimates. Victor J. Riley, Jr., chairman
and chief executive officer of KeyCorp, and I have been very much involved
throughout this process and could not be more pleased with the teamwork and
results we have seen. Shareholder meetings to approve the merger have been
scheduled for February 16, 1994, and we expect to close the transaction in
early March."

Commenting on financial performance, James W. Wert, vice
chairman and chief financial officer, noted, "The high level of financial
performance continued in the fourth quarter. On an operating earnings
basis, the fourth quarter return on average assets was 1.47 percent and
return on average common equity was 18.8 percent. For the full-year 1993,
our operating return on average assets and on average common equity were
1.51 percent and 19.8 percent, respectively. These profitability measures
continued to place Society at or near the top of industry performance
rankings. During the fourth quarter, average loans increased 3 percent from

the 1993 third quarter level reflecting growth in a number of loan
portfolios. In addition, credit quality measures continued to improve with
non-performing assets declining $80 million or 26 percent during the
quarter, representing 0.83 percent of assets. Similarly, net charge-offs
declined from 1993 third quarter levels and totaled $17.5 million during the
fourth quarter, representing 0.41 percent of average loans."

Continuing, Wert said, "When we announced the agreement to
merge with KeyCorp, it was noted that a one-time restructuring charge
representing the estimated costs of consolidating the operations of the two
companies would be taken in the 1993 fourth quarter. At that time, the
restructuring charge was estimated at $90-$110 million pre-tax, which would
be split between the two companies. Detailed analyses, completed recently 
and representing the work of some 40 task forces, indicated a somewhat 
higher charge of $118.7 million due largely to increased relocation and 
severance costs. Society's portion of the charge was $53.9 million before 
taxes and, as was the case at KeyCorp, was taken in the 1993 fourth quarter."

Net interest income in the fourth quarter was up $6.7 million
or 2.3 percent from the year-ago quarter reflecting a $1.4 billion or 6
percent increase in the level of average earning assets which was slightly
offset by a decline in the net interest margin to 5.10 percent from 5.33
percent in the 1992 fourth quarter. Compared with the 1993 third quarter,
net interest income was up slightly reflecting the favorable impact of an
$896 million or 4 percent increase in average earning assets, which included
a $541 million or 3 percent increase in average loans. This favorable impact
was partially offset by a decline in the net interest margin from 5.25
percent in the 1993 third quarter to 5.10 percent in the current quarter.
The decline was consistent with expectations and reflected primarily the
narrowing of spreads available on the replacement of maturing securities and
interest rate swaps.

Noninterest income in the 1993 fourth quarter was $113.6
million, little changed from the year-ago quarter but down $57.3 million
from the 1993 third quarter. When non-recurring items are excluded from the
1993 third quarter results, fourth quarter noninterest income was down $5.7
million. This decline reflected a $9.5 million decrease in trust income
related to a full-quarter's impact from the 1993 third quarter sale of
Ameritrust Texas. Fourth quarter noninterest income was up about $6.5
million from the 1993 third quarter, after adjusting for the impact of the
Ameritrust Texas sale.

Noninterest expense totaled $257.5 million, up $10.3 million
or 4 percent from the year-ago quarter after excluding the current quarter's
$53.9 million restructuring charge. On the same basis, fourth quarter
noninterest expense was up $7.1 million from comparable third quarter
expenses, reflecting increased compensation costs as well as higher real
estate owned expense and increases spread over a number of other categories.

The provision for loan losses in the 1993 fourth quarter was
$13.2 million, down from $17.0 million in the 1993 third quarter. This
decrease reflected the continued decline in net charge-offs during the
current quarter to $17.5 million, or 0.41 percent of average loans, from
$21.1 million, or 0.51 percent, in the prior quarter.

Nonperforming loans at December 31, 1993, were $162.8 million
and represented 0.91 percent of loans, down $36.9 million or 18 percent from
the end of the 1993 third quarter when nonperforming loans represented 1.17
percent of loans. Compared with the year-ago quarter, nonperforming loans
were down $185.9 million or 53 percent. Coverage of nonperforming loans by
the allowance for loan losses increased during the fourth quarter to 295
percent from 243 percent at September 30, 1993, and 144 percent at December
31, 1992.

Nonperforming assets at the end of the fourth quarter totaled
$224.4 million, down $79.9 million or 26 percent from September 30, 1993,
and down $272.6 million or 55 percent from the end of the prior year.
Nonperforming assets at December 31, 1993, represented 1.25 percent of total
loans plus other real estate owned and other nonperforming assets compared
with 1.78 percent at September 30, 1993, and 3.07 percent at December 31,
1992.

At December 31, 1993, assets totaled $27.0 billion and equity
capital $2.0 billion. The December 31, 1993, Tier 1 capital ratio was
estimated at 8.44 percent and the Total Capital ratio was estimated at 12.60
percent.

1993 PRO-FORMA RESULTS HIGHLIGHTS

On October 4, 1993, Society Corporation and KeyCorp of Albany,
New York, announced the signing of a definitive agreement to merge. The
transaction, which requires approval of shareholders of both Society and
KeyCorp, as well as the receipt of regulatory approvals, is expected to
close in March 1994. The new company will be called Key Bancshares Inc. and
will be headquartered in Cleveland. As of December 31, 1993, the new
company would have ranked as the 11th-largest bank holding company in the
nation with $59.7 billion in total assets and nearly 1,400 branch and
affiliate offices in 18 states.

Commenting on 1993 pro-forma results, Wert noted, "One of the
strengths of the pending merger is the fact that based on 1993 performance
both KeyCorp and Society are high performing companies. On a pro-forma
basis, 1993 earnings for the new company were $790.6 million. The return on
average assets and return on average total equity were 1.39 percent and 18.9
percent, respectively. The restructuring charge taken in the fourth quarter
of 1993 by both companies totaled $118.7 million ($80.7 million after-tax or
$0.34 per common share), slightly in excess of the $110 million upper-end 
of the previously announced expected charge. Personnel costs including

severance, relocation, and other employee costs ($49.6 million); systems
and facilities costs ($35.7 million), and merger costs ($20.5 million)
comprised the majority of the restructuring charge. Net charge-offs in 1993
totaled $212.8 million, representing 0.56 percent of average loans. The
December 31, 1993 allowance for loan losses was 2.00 percent of period-end
loans and covered 239 percent of nonperforming loans which totaled $336.3
million and represented 0.84 percent of year-end loans."

NOTES TO PRO FORMA FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS

(1) The pro forma combined summary of operations does not reflect per-tax
restructuring charges, including one-time merger expenses, of $118.7 million
(as categorized below). These charges were recognized by Society and KeyCorp
in the fourth quarter of 1993. Reported net income including restructuring
charges was $347.2 million, or $2.93 per share, for Society and $362.8
million, or $3.43 per share, for KeyCorp. On a pro forma basis, the net
income for the new company was $709.9 million, or $2.89 per share. The pro
forma balance sheet data and the summary of operations prior to the
effective time of the merger may not be indicative of the results that
actually would have occurred if the merger had been in effect during the
periods presented or which may be attained in the future.

KEY BANCSHARES INC. (PRO FORMA)
NOTES TO PRO FORMA FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS (CONTINUED)

(2) Although no assurance can be given, KeyCorp and Society also expect that
cost savings will be achieved by Key Bancshares Inc. at an annual rate of
$80 to $105 million by the end of the first quarter of 1995 as a result of
steps to be taken to integrate their operations and to achieve efficiencies 
in certain combined lines of business. Merger integration task forces, made 
up of representatives of both companies, have confirmed these preliminary
estimates. It is presently expected that approximately 50% of the
anticipated annualized savings will be achieved in 1994. The pro forma
financial highlights do not give effect to these expected cost savings.

(3) Pro forma financial highlights reflect the combination of KeyCorp and
Society, accounted for as a pooling of interests, through the exchange of
124,169,748 shares of Key Bancshares Inc. Common Stock for all outstanding
shares of KeyCorp Common Stock at an Exchange Ratio of 1.205 shares of Key
Bancshares Inc. Common Stock for each share of KeyCorp Common Stock. In
addition, 1,280,000 shares of Key Bancshares Inc. Preferred Stock will be
exchanged for all outstanding shares of KeyCorp Preferred Stock on a
share-for-share basis.

(4) The pro forma financial highlights do not give effect to the pending
acquisitions by KeyCorp of Commercial Bancorporation of Colorado and the
Greeley Bank (Colorado) due to immateriality. During the fourth quarter,
KeyCorp completed its previously announced acquisition of Jackson Bank and
Society completed its previously announced acquisition of Schaenen Wood and
Associates.
