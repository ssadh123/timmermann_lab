Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

(a) On October 18, 1994, pursuant to an Asset Purchase
Agreement dated September 18, 1994 (the "Agreement") among 3Com
Corporation (the "Company"), NiceCom, Ltd., an Israeli corporation
("NiceCom"), Nice Systems, Ltd., an Israeli corporation and the parent
company of NiceCom ("Nice Systems"), Nice Software, Ltd., an Israeli
corporation affiliated with Nice Systems, and Nachman Shelef and Avinoam
Rubinstein, as such Agreement was amended on October 17, 1994, the Company
and 3Com Israel, Ltd., an Israeli corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Company ("Sub"), purchased substantially all the assets and assumed
substantially all the liabilities of NiceCom (the "Acquisition"). The
negotiated value for the purchase of the assets and liabilities of NiceCom
was approximately $53.0 million. Such $53.0 million amount was paid using
funds from the Company's working capital and the issuance of 93,162 shares
of Common Stock of the Company, with an aggregate value of approximately
$3.5 million that was issued to Messrs. Shelef and Rubinstein. Under the
terms of the Agreement, a portion of such cash and stock was deposited into
an escrow account as security for the indemnification of the Company by
NiceCom for breaches of the representations, warranties and covenants of
NiceCom set forth in the Agreement. Except with respect to breaches of
certain representations and warranties, such account is the sole and
exclusive source of any claim or remedy by the Company against NiceCom or
its stockholders in connection with the Acquisition. Subject to reduction
based on outstanding or resolved claims, the cash and stock in such account
will be distributed to NiceCom and Messrs. Shelef and Rubinstein in the
future. In addition to the purchase price for the assets, 3Com assumed
all outstanding options held by NiceCom employees with an aggregate value
of approximately $5.5 million.

Prior to the Acquisition, no material relationship existed between
the Company and NiceCom or any of its affiliates, any director or officer
of the Company, or any associate of any such director or officer.

NiceCom is engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing,
marketing and servicing computer networking equipment. The Company intends
to continue developing and integrating the NiceCom product technology
into the Company's business.

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties agree as follows: 

ARTICLE I

Purchase and Sale; Purchase Price, Manner of Payment and Closing

1.1 Purchase and Sale. Purchaser or a subsidiary of
Purchaser ("Sub") shall purchase the Purchased Assets and assume
the Assumed Liabilities (both as defined below) at the Closing in
exchange for the Aggregate Consideration (as defined below).

1.2 Purchase Price. In consideration of the sale,
conveyance, assignment, transfer and delivery of the Purchased
Assets, Purchaser shall (a) pay, or cause Sub to pay, to Seller,
the Aggregate Consideration (as herein defined) and (b) assume,
or cause Sub to assume, the Assumed Liabilities. As used herein,
"Aggregate Consideration" means Fifty Three Million Thirty-Seven
Thousand U.S. Dollars ($53,037,312) in value comprised of the
Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration determined as
follows.

1.3 Cash Consideration and Stock Consideration. "Cash
Consideration" shall mean the cash consideration to be paid to
Seller as consideration for the Purchased Assets, which shall be
Fifty Three Million Thirty-Seven Thousand Three Hundred and
Twelve U.S. Dollars ($53,037,312) minus the Value of the Stock
Consideration. "Stock Consideration" shall mean the Purchaser
Common Stock to be issued by Purchaser and delivered to Shelef
and Rubinstein pursuant to Section 1.4 (the "Restricted Shares"). 
The Stock Consideration shall be allocated as follows (where the
dollar amounts are the value of Purchaser stock subject to such
stock rights): an aggregate of $3,519,817 in Restricted Shares to
Shelef and Rubinstein distributed in proportion to their
respective stock held in Seller. The "Value of the Stock
Consideration" shall be equal to the Purchaser Closing Price
multiplied by the number of Restricted Shares. "Purchaser
Closing Price" shall mean the average of the closing prices of a
share of Purchaser's common stock on the ten (10) consecutive
trading days up to and including the second trading day prior to
the Closing Date. Seller shall be responsible for distributing
the Stock Consideration to Shelef and Rubinstein in proportion to
their equity interests in Seller. 

1.4 Issuance of Restricted Shares. Purchaser shall issue
for distribution to Shelef and Rubinstein an aggregate number of
shares of Purchaser Common Stock equal to $3,519,817 divided by
the Purchaser Closing Price. [ ] of
the number of shares so issued shall be delivered to Seller for
distribution to Shelef and Rubinstein at the Closing. [ 
] of the number of shares so issued will be
held in the Escrow Fund pursuant to the Escrow Agreement as set
forth in Section 1.5(c). Such Restricted Shares shall be subject
to the following restrictions: (a) such shares shall be issued
pursuant to the terms and conditions of Purchaser's Restricted
Stock Plan (or terms substantially similar thereto), and (b) such
shares shall be subject to vesting over two years in equal annual
increments (i.e., one-half of such shares shall vest on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date and one-half shall vest on the
second anniversary of the Closing Date), provided that Shelef and
Rubinstein are employed by Purchaser on such anniversaries,
provided further, that such shares shall vest if Shelef and
Rubinstein are terminated for Purchaser's convenience and not for
"cause" as such term is defined in the agreement regarding the
Restricted Shares.

1.5 Manner of Payment of the Purchase Price. The Purchase
Price shall be payable as follows: 

(a) At the Closing, (i) Purchaser shall deliver to
Seller the Cash Consideration, less [ ] of
the Cash Consideration to be delivered into escrow pursuant to 
Section 1.5(b), by wire transfers or immediately available funds,
(ii) Purchaser or Sub shall assume the Assumed Liabilities, and
(iii) Purchaser shall issue the Restricted Shares as provided in
Section 1.4 less [ ] of the Stock
Consideration to be delivered into escrow pursuant to Section
1.5(c). Said wire transfers shall be made to such bank accounts
as Seller shall specify by written notice to Purchaser delivered
at least five (5) business days before the Closing Date. For
purposes of paying the Cash Consideration, all amounts paid to
Seller shall be paid in U.S. dollars.

(b) Subject to the applicable provisions of Israel's
currency control regulations, the parties shall establish an
escrow account maintained by a mutually agreeable escrow agent
located in the United States into which Purchaser shall deposit
on the Closing Date [ ] of the
Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5(a) (the "Escrow
Fund"). The escrow deposits shall be made in accordance with a
mutually agreed escrow agreement (the "Escrow Agreement").

(c) Purchaser shall deposit on the Closing Date with
the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement [ ] of
the Stock Consideration.

1.6 Time and Place of Closing. Subject to the remaining
provisions of this Section 1.6, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be consummated (the "Closing") at 4:00 p.m.
Israel time, at the offices of Seller on October 17, 1994 or on
such later date that the conditions of Closing set forth in
Sections 6.1 and 6.2 hereof are satisfied or waived, provided
that neither party has exercised its right to terminate this
Agreement under Section 10.2(b), or on such other date, or at
such other place, as shall be mutually agreed upon by Seller and
Purchaser. The date on which the Closing shall be scheduled to
occur in accordance with the preceding sentence is referred to in
this Agreement as the "Closing Date". If the Closing shall
occur, it shall be deemed to be effective at 12:01 a.m. on the
Closing Date at each place where the Purchased Assets are

4.3 Seller's Representations and Warranties. Seller
represents and warrants to Purchaser that, except as set forth in

and has qualified as a foreign corporation and is in good
standing, under the laws of all jurisdictions where the nature of
the Business or the nature or location of the assets which are
used primarily in the Business by such Subsidiary requires such
qualification and where the failure to so qualify would have a
Material Adverse Effect (as herein defined). As used herein,
"Material Adverse Effect" means a material adverse effect on the
business, financial condition, operations, assets or liabilities
of the Business, taken as a whole.

(d) No consent, authorization, order or approval of,

(except to the extent that enforcement thereof is affected by
laws pertaining to bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency and
creditors' rights and by the availability of injunctive relief,
specific performance and other equitable remedies).

(f) Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Seller, nor the execution and delivery by Seller of
the Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party nor the

the terms, conditions or provisions of Seller's Articles of
Incorporation or By-laws, or similar organizational documents, or
of any statute or administrative regulation, or of any order,
writ, injunction, judgment or decree of any court or any
governmental authority or of any arbitration award.

earnings of the Business for the years then ended, complete and
accurate copies of which are attached to the Disclosure Schedule,

accordance with Israeli GAAP applied in a manner consistent with
the audited financial statements as of December 31, 1993, except
for the omission of footnote disclosures required by Israeli GAAP
and except for the omission of normal accruals generally made at
year end. The financial statements described in paragraph (g) of
this Section 4.3 and this paragraph (h) are referred to in this
Agreement as the "Financial Statements". All taxes which Seller
has been required to collect or withhold have been duly withheld
or collected and, to the extent required, have been paid to the
proper taxing authority. Seller is not a party to any tax-
sharing agreement or similar arrangement with any other party. 
Seller will not be required to include any material adjustment in
taxable income for any tax period (or portion thereof) ending
after the Closing Date pursuant to any provision of the tax laws
of any jurisdiction requiring tax adjustments as a result of a
change in method of accounting implemented by Seller prior the
Closing Date for any tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or
before the Closing Date or pursuant to the provisions of any
agreement entered into by Seller prior to the Closing Date with
any taxing authority with regard to the tax liability of Seller
for any tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the

obligations; and (iv) minor irregularities of title which do not
in the aggregate materially detract from the value or use of the
Purchased Assets. No unreleased mortgage, trust deed, chattel
mortgage, security agreement, financing statement or other
instrument encumbering any of the Purchased Assets has been
recorded, filed, executed or delivered. 

(k) Seller has properly completed and filed all tax
returns (including, if applicable, income, excise, payroll,
capital stock, intangible, sales and use, value added,
employment, property and, without limitation by specific
enumeration of the foregoing, all other tax returns of every kind
and nature) which have heretofore been required to have been
filed by Seller and the Subsidiary. No extensions of time in
which to file any such returns are in effect. All taxes of the
type herein referred to (whether or not requiring the filing of
returns) relating to the Business, including all deficiency
assessments, additions to tax, penalties and interest of which
notice has been received which shall accrue prior to the Closing
Date, have been paid by Seller and the Subsidiary to the extent
due or are being contested by Seller and the Subsidiary in the
manner permitted by applicable law, and to the extent such taxes
are not yet due, they have been properly accrued for on Seller's
books and records as required by Israeli GAAP. There is no
action, suit, proceeding, investigation, audit or claim now
pending regarding any taxes relating to the income, properties or
operations of the Business for any period prior to the Closing. 
All taxes which Seller and the Subsidiary are respectively
required by law to withhold and collect have been duly withheld
and collected, and have been paid to the proper authorities to
the extent due and payable.

Seller's knowledge, there are no condemnation proceedings pending
or threatened with respect to any portion of the premises covered
by such leases.

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS

(ab) Seller owns all right, title and interest in and
to all patents, copyrights, technology, software, software tools,
know-how, processes, trade secrets, trademarks, service marks,
trade names and other proprietary rights used in or necessary for
the conduct of the Business as conducted to the date hereof or
contemplated, free and clear of all liens, claims and
encumbrances (including without limitation distribution rights)
(all of which are referred to as "Proprietary Rights") and Seller
has the right to transfer all such rights to Purchaser, except
for rights under Third Party Licenses (as hereinafter defined)
specified in the Disclosure Schedule. The foregoing
representation as it relates to Third Party Technology (as
hereinafter defined) is limited to Seller's interest pursuant to
the Third Party Licenses, all of which are valid and enforceable
and in full force and effect and which grant Seller such right to
Third Party Technology as are employed in or necessary to the
business of Seller as conducted or proposed to be conducted. The
Disclosure Schedule contains an accurate and complete list of (i)
all patents, trademarks (with separate listings of registered and
unregistered trademarks), tradenames, and registered copyrights
in or related to the Business, all applications and registration
statements therefor, and a list of all licenses and other
agreements relating thereto, and (ii) a list of all licenses and
other agreements with third parties (the "Third Party Licenses")
relating to any software, technology, know-how, or processes that
Seller is licensed or otherwise authorized by such third parties
to use, market, distribute or incorporate into products
distributed by Seller (such software, technology, know-how and
processes are collectively referred to as the "Third Party
Technology"). All of Seller's trademark or tradename
registrations related to the Business and all of Seller's
copyrights are valid and in full force and effect; and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
alter or impair any such rights. No claims have been asserted
against Seller (and Seller is not aware of any claims which are
likely to be asserted against Seller or which have been asserted
against others) by any person challenging Seller's use or
distribution of any patents, trademarks, tradenames, copyrights,
trade secrets, software, technology, know-how or processes
utilized by Seller (including, without limitation, the Third
Party Technology) or challenging or questioning the validity or
effectiveness of any license or agreement relating thereto
(including, without limitation, the Third Party Licenses). To
Seller's knowledge, the use by Seller of Third Party Technology
is in conformance with the terms of the Third Party Licenses, and
there is no valid basis for any claim of the type specified in
the immediately preceding sentence which could interfere with the
continued enhancement and exploitation by Seller of any of its
products. To Seller's knowledge, none of its present or
contemplated products nor the use of any patents, trademarks,
tradenames, copyrights, software, technology, know-how or
processes by Seller in the Business infringes on the rights of,
constitutes misappropriation of, or in any way involves unfair
competition with respect to, any proprietary information or
intangible property right of any third person or entity,
including without limitation any patent, trade secret, copyright,
trademark or tradename.

(ac) Seller has not granted any third party any right
to manufacture, reproduce, distribute, market or exploit any of
its products or any adaptations, translations, or derivative
works based on any of Seller's Products or any portion thereof. 
Except with respect to the rights of third parties to the Third
Party Technology, no third party has any right to manufacture,
reproduce, distribute, market or exploit any works or materials
of which any of the Seller's products are a "derivative work" as
that term is defined in the United States Copyright Act, Title
17, U.S.C. Section 101.

(ad) With the exception of Third Party Technology
described in Section 4.3(ab) above, all designs, drawings,
specifications, source code, object code, documentation, flow
charts and diagrams incorporating, embodying or reflecting any of
the Seller products at any stage of their development (the
"Seller Components") were written, developed and created solely
and exclusively by employees of Seller without the assistance of
any third party or entity or were created by third parties who
assigned ownership of their rights to Seller in valid and
enforceable consultant confidentiality and invention assignment
agreements. Seller has at all times used commercially reasonable
efforts to treat its products and Seller Components as containing
trade secrets and has not dealt with such items in such a manner
as to cause the loss of such trade secrets by release into the
public domain.

(ae) To Seller's knowledge, no employee of Seller is in
violation of any term of any employment contract, patent
disclosure agreement or any other contract or agreement relating
to the relationship of any such employee with Seller or, to the
best of Seller's knowledge, any other party because of the nature
of the business conducted by Seller or proposed to be conducted
by Seller.

(af) Each person presently or previously employed by
Seller (including independent contractors, if any) with access to
confidential information has executed a confidentiality and
non-disclosure agreement pursuant to the form of agreement
previously provided to Buyer or its representatives. Such
confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements constitute valid
and binding obligations of Seller and such person, enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms. To the best of Seller's
knowledge, neither the execution or delivery of such agreements,
nor the carrying on of Seller's business as employees by such
persons, nor the conduct of Seller's business as currently
anticipated, will conflict with or result in a breach of the
terms, conditions or provisions of or constitute a default under
any contract, covenant or instrument under which any of such

individually or in the aggregate could exceed $50,000 have been
communicated to or threatened against Seller nor, to the best of

Purchaser, Seller shall give, and shall cause the Subsidiary to
give, to Purchaser's officers, employees, agents, attorneys,
consultants and accountants reasonable access during normal

documents, records and personnel of Seller relating to the
Business and shall furnish, to Purchaser such information

the benefits to Seller under such agreements. Provided that such
benefits can be obtained, Purchaser shall perform the obligations
of Seller under such agreements. By way of example, if an

agreement cannot be assigned to Purchaser or Sub, Seller shall
arrange for the payment to Purchaser of such amount without

Purchaser shall cooperate to seek the assignment of such
agreements or, if such assignment can not be readily obtained, to
arrange with the other party to such contracts to include the
benefits of such agreements in agreements with Purchaser (either
in amendments to existing agreements with Purchaser or in new
agreements with Purchaser). In all cases the parties shall seek
to minimize the cost to Seller in connection with such assignment
or other arrangement. The contracts covered by this subclause
(ii) are those contracts with Epilogue and Trillium.

or otherwise acquire any of its capital stock, provided that
Subsidiary may repay a loan in the amount of $50,000 made by an
Affiliate of Nice Systems;

(xii) amend or terminate any contract,
agreement or license to which it is a party except in the
ordinary course of business;

(xiii) loan any amount to any person or entity,
or guaranty or act as a surety for any obligation except for

right which is to be assigned to the Purchaser or Sub is not
assignable, and the Purchaser or Sub need such permit in order to
operate the portion of the Business conducted by Seller and the
Subsidiary pursuant thereto, Purchaser shall use its best efforts
and make every good faith attempt (and Seller shall use its best
efforts in cooperation with Purchaser) to obtain such a permit.

(c) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use reasonable
efforts for a period of two years after the Closing Date to
ensure that it will not actively solicit for employment any
employees of Nice Systems or its Affiliates. Further, if Seller

such solicitation, Purchaser shall cease, or cause its Affiliate
to cease, such solicitation, provided such notice is received
prior to extension of a formal offer of employment.

(d) On or before the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
offer, or cause Sub to offer, to employ as of the Closing Date
substantially all of Seller's employees in positions, at
compensation, with benefits and upon terms and conditions which

the Incentive Plan will be provided to Seller simultaneous with
the execution of this Agreement.

equal force to Seller and Purchaser:

(a) Without implication that such laws apply to this
transaction, the parties to this Agreement shall not comply with
the provisions of any laws relating to bulk sales or transfers.

(b) From the date hereof until the Closing, or such
earlier date as Seller and Purchaser have mutually agreed to
discontinue discussion of the Acquisition (the "Expiration
Date"), Seller will not (and it will use its best efforts to
assure that its officers, directors, employees, agents and
affiliates do not on its behalf) take any action to solicit,
initiate, seek, encourage or support any inquiry, proposal or
offer from, furnish any information to, or participate in any
negotiations with, any corporation, partnership, person or other
entity or group (other than Purchaser) regarding any acquisition
of Seller, any merger or consolidation with or involving Seller,
or any acquisition of any material portion of the assets of
Seller. Seller shall not enter into any agreement contemplating
any of the foregoing. Seller agrees to indemnify Purchaser, its
representatives and agents from and against any claims by any
party to such negotiations based upon or arising out of the
negotiation or consummation of the Acquisition, as contemplated
by this Agreement based upon any pre-existing negotiations or
arrangements with a third party. Purchaser agrees that during
the date hereof until the Expiration Date, it shall not initiate
or continue any discussions with any corporation, partnership,

consolidation with or involving, or any acquisition of any

person or other entity or group.

intentionally perform any act which, if performed, or omit to
perform any act which, if omitted to be performed, would prevent
or excuse the performance of this Agreement by such party or by
its Affiliates as herein provided or which would result in any
representation or warranty herein contained of said party being
untrue in any material respect as if originally made on and as of
the Closing Date. 

(e) In the event the Acquisition is not consummated,
Purchaser and Seller will each use its reasonable efforts to
ensure for eighteen (18) months after negotiations of the
Acquisition have been terminated in writing that neither will
actively solicit for employment any employee or employees of the
other party who has or have been involved in the discussions or
due diligence conducted in connection with the Acquisition, or as
to whom one party has provided information to the other. This
provision shall not apply to Dono Van Mierop.

5.5 Key Shareholders' Obligations. 

(a) The Key Shareholders agree, to the extent a vote
is required with respect hereto, to vote in favor of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as shareholders of
Seller and (if such Key Shareholders are or control directors of

and to take such other steps as are reasonable on their
respective parts to cause Seller to perform its obligations

efforts to make available at the other party's expense, personnel
(for reasonable periods of time) of such disclosing party, as the
case may be, for purposes of depositions and testimony. 
Purchaser shall give reasonable assistance to Seller and the
Subsidiary, in order for Seller to record entries relating to the
closing of Seller's books relating to the Business. 

8.3 Benefits of Nonassignable Rights. Seller and Nice
Systems will use their best efforts to provide such assistance as
is necessary to pass through the benefits of any warranty, right
of indemnification, claim, cause of action, etc. which cannot be
assigned to Purchaser as required under Section 2.2(q) herein.

8.4 Fibronics Agreement. The Fibronics Agreement will
not be assigned until Seller has renegotiated the terms thereof,
in consultation with Purchaser. Upon completion of such
renegotiation to the satisfaction of Purchaser, such agreement
shall be assigned to Purchaser. If such agreement cannot be
renegotiated within a reasonable time, Seller shall terminate
such agreement, and Seller and Purchaser shall each pay one half
of the termination payment as specified in the Fibronics
Agreement. 

8.5 Use of Trade Secrets. Seller shall cease, and shall
cause its Affiliates to cease, to use any trade secret, secret
formula or other confidential information related to the Business
among the Purchased Assets. 

8.6 Use of Trademarks. Seller shall cease, and shall cause
its Affiliates to cease, to use any name or trademark which is
similar or deceptively similar to any of the names or trademarks
which are included among the Purchased Assets. The foregoing
notwithstanding, Purchaser acknowledges the use of the word
"Nice" as a trademark of Nice Systems and agrees to the use of
the word "Nice" in any trademark by Seller and its Affiliates as
long as such mark is not otherwise substantially identical to the
existing trademarks of Seller.

8.7 Payments of Accounts Receivable. Following the Closing
Date, Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use their best efforts,
consistent with the historical collection practices of Seller and
the Subsidiary, to collect the Accounts Receivable. In the event
Seller or any of its Affiliates shall receive any instrument of
payment with respect to any of such uncollected Accounts
Receivable, Seller shall forthwith deliver it to Purchaser, or
cause it to be delivered to Purchaser forthwith, at the address
of Purchaser specified in Section 11.6 hereof, endorsed where
necessary, without recourse, in favor of Purchaser. 

8.8 Third Party Claims. The parties shall cooperate with
each other with respect to the defense of any claims or
litigation made or commenced by third parties subsequent to the
Closing Date which are not subject to the indemnification
provisions contained in Article IX hereof, provided that the
party requesting cooperation shall reimburse the other party for
the other party's reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of
furnishing such cooperation. 

8.9 Further Assurances. The parties shall execute and/or
cause to be executed such further documents, and perform such
further acts, as may be necessary to transfer and convey the
Purchased Assets to Purchaser and Sub, on the terms herein
contained, and to otherwise comply with the terms of this
Agreement and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. 

8.10 Non-Assignment. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary contained herein, Seller shall not be obligated to
assign or cause the Subsidiary to assign to Purchaser or Sub any
contract, purchase order, sales order, license, lease, permit,
approval or other instrument which provides that it may not be
assigned, or under applicable law may not be assigned, without
the consent of the other party thereto and for which such consent
is not obtained, but in any such event, Seller shall cooperate
with Purchaser in any reasonable arrangement designed to provide
the benefits thereof to Purchaser and Sub. 

8.11 Confidentiality. Each party acknowledges that in the
course of the performance of this Agreement, it may obtain the
Confidential Information (as defined below) of the other parties. 
The Receiving Party (as defined below) shall, at all times, both
during the term of this Agreement and thereafter, keep in
confidence and trust all of the Disclosing Party's (as defined
below) Confidential Information received by it. The Receiving
Party shall not disclose the Confidential Information of the
Disclosing Party other than as expressly permitted under the
terms of this Agreement or by a separate written agreement and
shall not use any confidential information that constitutes
Proprietary Rights. The Receiving Party shall take all
reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of the
Disclosing Party's Confidential Information and to prevent it
from falling into the public domain or into the possession of
unauthorized persons. The Receiving Party shall not disclose
Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any person or
entity other than its officers or employees (or outside legal or
accounting advisors) who need access to such Confidential
Information in order to effect the intent of this Agreement and
who have entered into confidentiality agreements with such
person's employer or who are subject to ethical restrictions on
disclosure which protects the Confidential Information of the
Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party shall immediately give
notice to the Disclosing Party of any unauthorized use or
disclosure of Disclosing Party's Confidential Information. The
Receiving Party agrees to assist the Disclosing Party to remedy
such unauthorized use or disclosure of its Confidential
Information. These obligations shall not apply to the extent
that Confidential Information includes information which:

(a) is already known to the Receiving Party at the
time of disclosure, which knowledge the Receiving Party shall
have the burden of proving;

(b) is, or, through no act or failure to act of the
Receiving Party, becomes publicly known;

(c) is received by the Receiving Party from a third
party without restriction on disclosure (although this exception
shall not apply if such third party is itself violating a
confidentially obligation by making such disclosure);

(d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party
without reference to the Confidential Information of the
Disclosing Party, which independent development the Receiving
Party will have the burden of proving;

(e) is approved for release by written authorization
of the Disclosing Party; or

(f) is required to be disclosed by a government agency
to further the objectives of this Agreement or by a proper order
of a court of competent jurisdiction; provided, however that the
Receiving Party will use its best efforts to minimize such
disclosure and will consult with and assist the Disclosing Party
in obtaining a protective order prior to such disclosure.

"Confidential Information" shall mean confidential information of
a party ("Disclosing Party") which is disclosed to another party
("Receiving Party"). Confidential Information shall include, but
not be limited to, trade secrets, know-how, inventions,
techniques, processes, algorithms, software programs, schematics,
designs, contracts, customer lists, financial information, sales
and marketing plans and business information. For purposes of
this Section 8.11, Confidential Information of Seller shall be
deemed to be Confidential Information of Purchaser for purposes
of Nice Systems' obligations hereunder after the Closing.

9.2 Seller's Indemnification Covenants. Subject to the
provisions of Section 9.4 hereof, Seller and the Key Shareholders
shall indemnify, save and keep Purchaser, its Affiliates and
their respective successors and permitted assigns (the "Purchaser
Indemnitees"), harmless against and from all liability, demands,
claims, actions or causes of action, assessments, losses, fines,
penalties, costs, damages and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, sustained or incurred by any of the Purchaser
Indemnitees as a result of or arising out of or by virtue of: 

(a) any inaccuracy in a representation or breach of a
warranty made by Seller to Purchaser herein or in any document
delivered to Purchaser in connection herewith;

(b) the failure of Seller or the Subsidiary to comply
with, or the breach by Seller or the Subsidiary of, any of the
covenants of this Agreement, or of any document delivered at the
Closing pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, to be
performed by Seller or a Subsidiary;

(c) the failure of Seller or the Subsidiary to
discharge any liabilities of Seller and the Subsidiary, other
than the Assumed Liabilities; 

(d) the failure of Seller or the Subsidiary to

agreement or commitment referenced in Section 4.3 above and
arising prior to the Closing Date, whether or not asserted at
that time; 

(e) any obligation to the OCS in excess of [ 
]
required to be paid by Purchaser or Sub in order to obtain the
rights required by Purchaser as specified in Section 6.2(m). In
calculating such amount, the parties shall include any amount of
funding which has been recognized in the Financial Statements but
which Purchaser elects not to receive from the OCS or which the
OCS determines not to provide. Such amount shall not be subject
to the deductible provided for below (i.e., Purchaser shall be
entitled to be paid from the Escrow Fund on any such amount in
excess of [ ] whether or not the deductible amount has
been met).

In addition to the foregoing, Purchaser shall be entitled to make
claims against the Escrow Fund for any claims arising out of the

pursuant to Section 6.2(h) and 5.2(d), including any amounts
charged by the parties to any of the contracts referred to in
Section 5.2(d) for the assignment of such contracts. Any such
claims by Purchaser shall not be subject to the [ ]
amount described in Section 9.4(a). In addition to the
foregoing, to the extent that the Seller or stockholders of
Seller have not made arrangements to pay the fees described in
Section 3.3(b) and such fees are paid by Purchaser, and if any
portion of the Escrow Fund is available for release on the first
anniversary of the Closing, such portion (in an amount equal to
such fees paid by Purchaser) shall be withheld from release from
the Escrow Fund, and Purchaser shall be entitled to an offset
against the Escrow with no minimum amount of claim. 

9.3 Escrow Fund. Except as provided below, the Escrow Fund
shall be the sole and exclusive source of any claim or remedy by
Purchaser Indemnitees under Section 9.2 as a result of or arising
out of or by virtue of any inaccuracy in a representation or
breach of warranty made by Seller or the Key Shareholders to
Purchaser herein. [ ] of the Escrow Fund (to the extent
it is not subject to an indemnification claim) shall be released
on [ 
] to Seller and an amount equal to an additional [ 
] of the total amount originally subject to the Escrow Fund plus
any interest earned thereon (to the extent it is not subject to
an indemnification claim) shall be distributed to Seller on the
date [ 
] The remaining amount subject to the Escrow
Fund (to the extent it is not subject to an indemnification
claim) shall be distributed to Seller on [ 

] All such amounts shall include a proportionate
number of the Restricted Shares held in the Escrow Fund and shall
be distributed by Seller to the stockholders entitled to receive
such amounts. Any claim of intentional misrepresentation or
fraud by Seller or the Key Shareholders shall not be subject to
the limitations in time or amount set forth above, provided,
however, that as to any such claims attributable solely to the
fraud of Nice Systems or of a Key Shareholder, the liability of
Nice Systems and the Key Shareholders shall be several and not
joint and such fraud shall not be attributable to the other
party. After [ 
] 
Purchaser may not make claims against the Escrow Fund except for
breach of the representations in [ 
] In the event it appears there would be tax

Seller's obligations pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.2
hereof are subject to the following limitations:

(a) Except as provided in Section 9.2, the Purchaser
Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover under Section 9.2
hereof until the total amount which Purchaser Indemnitees would
recover under Section 9.2 hereof, but for this Section 9.4(a),
exceeds [ ] and then only to the extent of the
recoverable amount in excess of [ ]

(b) the Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to
recover under Section 9.2(a) hereof unless a claim has been
asserted by written notice, specifying in reasonable detail the
alleged misrepresentation or breach of warranty, and is delivered
to Seller; and to be valid, any such notice must be received on
or prior to the date one year after the Closing (except with
respect to claims relating to those matters set forth in the next
to last sentence of Section 9.3, as to which the notice shall be
delivered on or prior to the date two years after the Closing).

9.5 Purchaser's Indemnification Covenants. Purchaser shall
indemnify, save and keep Seller, its Affiliates (including the
Subsidiary) and their respective successors and permitted assigns
(the "Seller Indemnitees"), harmless against and from all
liability, demands, claims, actions or causes of action,
assessments, losses, fines, penalties, costs, damages and
expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, sustained or
incurred by the Seller Indemnitees, as a result of or arising out
of or by virtue of: 

(a) any inaccuracy in a representation or breach of a
warranty made by Purchaser to Seller herein or in any document
delivered to Seller in connection herewith; 

(b) the failure of Purchaser or any of Sub to comply
with, or the breach by Purchaser or any of Sub of, any of the
covenants of this Agreement, or of any documents delivered at the
Closing pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, to be

9.6 Limitations on Purchaser's Indemnification Obligations. 
Purchaser's obligations pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.5
hereof are subject to the following limitations:

(a) the Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to
recover under Section 9.5(a) hereof until the total amount which
Seller Indemnitees would recover under Section 9.5(a) hereof, but
for this Section 9.6(a), exceeds [ ] and then only to the
extent of the recoverable amount in excess of [ ] and

(b) the Seller Indemnitees shall not be entitled to
recover under Section 9.5(a) hereof unless a claim has been
asserted by written notice, specifying in reasonable detail the
alleged misrepresentation or breach of warranty.

The foregoing notwithstanding, if the OCS makes a claim
against Seller for amounts due which are the responsibility of
Purchaser or Sub, such claims shall not be subject to any
deductible.

9.7 Third Party Claims. 

(a) Forthwith following the receipt of notice of a
claim, action or proceeding brought by a third party, including a
governmental agency, as to which a party desires to receive
indemnification under this Article IX (a "Third Party Claim"),
the party receiving the notice of the Third Party Claim (a) shall
notify the other party of its existence, setting forth with
reasonable specificity the facts and circumstances of which such
party has received notice and (b) if the party giving such notice
is a person entitled to indemnification under this Article IX (an
"Indemnified Party"), specifying the basis hereunder upon which
the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification is asserted. 
The Indemnified Party may, upon reasonable notice, tender the
defense of a Third Party Claim to the party having an obligation
of indemnification under this Article IX (an "Indemnifying
Party") or the Indemnifying Party may elect to accept the defense
of a Third Party Claim. If the defense of a Third Party Claim is
so tendered and such tender is accepted by the Indemnifying
Party, or if the Indemnifying Party shall acknowledge in writing
delivered to the Indemnified Party the Indemnifying Party's
obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to the
Third Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the
exclusive right to contest, defend and litigate the Third Party
Claim and shall have the exclusive right, in its discretion
exercised in good faith and upon the advice of counsel, to settle
any such matter, either before or after the initiation of
litigation, at such time and upon such terms as it deems fair and
reasonable, provided that at least ten (10) days prior to any
such settlement, it shall give written notice of its intention to
settle to the Indemnified Party. All expenses (including,
without limitation, attorneys' fees) incurred by the Indemnifying
Party in connection with the foregoing shall be paid by the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right
to be represented by counsel at its own expense in any defense
conducted by the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in connection with any settlement negotiated by an
Indemnifying Party, no Indemnified Party shall be required to (x)
enter into any settlement that does not include the delivery by
the claimant or plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a release
from all liability in respect of such claim or litigation or (y)
consent to the entry of any judgment that does not include a full
dismissal of the litigation or proceeding against the Indemnified
Party with prejudice. 

(b) In any case where an Indemnifying Party is
handling the defense of a claim as a result of its election to do
so, if the Indemnifying Party negotiates a settlement thereof,
the Indemnified Party may elect not to enter into such
settlement, provided that the Indemnified Party thereafter
assumes the defense of such claim and if the Indemnified Party
does so, then the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party to
the Indemnified Party for such Third Party Claim shall be the
amount of such proposed settlement. No failure by an
Indemnifying Party to acknowledge in writing its indemnification
obligations under this Article IX shall relieve it of such
obligations to the extent they exist. If, in accordance with the
foregoing provisions of this Section 9.7 an Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification against a Third Party Claim,
and if (i) the Indemnified Party shall not tender the defense of
the Third Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall fail to
accept the defense of a Third Party Claim which has been tendered
pursuant to this Section 9.7 or (iii) the Indemnifying Party
shall fail to so acknowledge its obligation of indemnification,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right, without prejudice to
its right of indemnification hereunder, in its discretion
exercised in good faith and upon the advice of counsel, to
contest, defend and litigate such Third Party Claim, and may
settle such Third Party Claim, either before or after the
initiation of litigation, at such time and upon such terms as the
Indemnified Party deems fair and reasonable, provided that at
least ten (10) days prior to any such settlement, written notice
of its intention to settle is given to the Indemnifying Party. 
If, pursuant to this Section 9.7, the Indemnified Party so
defends or settles a Third Party Claim for which it is entitled
to indemnification hereunder, as hereinabove provided, the
Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party
for the reasonable attorneys' fees and other expense of defending
the Third Party Claim which are incurred from time to time,
forthwith following the presentation to the Indemnifying Party of
itemized bills for said attorneys' fees and other expenses. All
payments to counsel shall be treated as indemnity amounts
hereunder. This Section 9.7 deals only with procedural matters
and nothing herein shall be construed to expand either parties'
obligations under Sections 9.1 to 9.6. All expenses incurred by
an Indemnifying Party in defending any Third Party Claim as to
which it has assumed the defense shall be treated for all
purposes as indemnification payments hereunder.

termination of this Agreement by either Seller or Purchaser as
provided in Section 10.2 hereof:

misrepresentation or breach and the Closing shall nonetheless
take place; or 

(b) decline to close, terminate this Agreement as
provided in Section 10.2 hereof, and thereafter seek damages to
the extent permitted in Section 10.5 hereof. 

10.5 Right to Damages. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 10.2 hereof, neither party hereto shall have
any claim against the other except if the circumstances giving
rise to such termination were caused by the other party's wilful

which event termination shall not be deemed or construed as
limiting or denying any legal or equitable right or remedy of
said party, and said party shall be entitled to recover its costs
and expenses which are incurred in pursuing its rights and
remedies (including reasonable attorneys' fees).

of a party to insist upon performance of any of the terms,
covenants or conditions of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements, to exercise any right or privilege in this Agreement
or any of the Ancillary Agreements conferred, or the waiver by
said party of any breach of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements,
shall not be construed as a subsequent waiver of any such terms,
covenants, conditions, rights or privileges, but the same shall
continue and remain in full force and effect as if no such
forbearance or waiver had occurred. Except as provided in
Section 10.4(a) hereof, no waiver shall be effective unless it is
in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the
waiving party. 

11.9 Counterparts. This Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall
be deemed to be an original, and all such counterparts shall
constitute but one instrument.

Ancillary Agreements shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon the parties hereto and thereto, respectively, and their
successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement,
express or implied, is intended to confer on any person other
than the parties hereto and thereto, respectively, and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights,
remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, including, without
limitation, third party beneficiary rights.

the Ancillary Agreements shall be assignable by either party
hereto or thereto without the prior written consent of the other

of its liabilities or obligations hereunder.

amended or supplemented, except pursuant to an instrument in
writing executed and delivered on behalf of each of the parties
hereto.

FIRST AMENDMENT TO ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This FIRST AMENDMENT TO ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT
("Amendment") is made as of October 17, 1994 by and among
NICECOM, LTD., a company organized under the laws of Israel
("Seller") and 3COM CORPORATION, a California corporation
("Purchaser") each of which are parties to an ASSET PURCHASE
AGREEMENT ("Agreement") dated September 18, 1994. 

RECITALS

A. Seller and Purchaser desire to amend certain provisions
of the Agreement regarding the method of payment of the purchase
price.

B. There are certain other parties to the Agreement but
such parties are not deemed to be parties for purposes of the
sections to be amended, and therefore no consent of such parties
hereto is required. 

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, for good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the
parties agree as follows: 

1. Defined Terms; No Other Amendment. Unless otherwise defined
herein, all capitalized terms shall have the same meanings as
provided in the Agreement. Except as specifically amended
hereby, all other terms of the Agreement shall continue in affect
without amendment, and this Amendment shall be deemed to be a
part of the Agreement.

2. Manner of Payment of the Purchase Price. The parties have
determined that the Purchase Price should be reduced in an amount
equivalent to an amount of cash or cash equivalents to be
retained by Seller. As a result Purchaser will reduce the
amount of the Cash Consideration to be paid by wire transfer by
an amount equivalent to the value of such cash and cash
equivalents, and Purchaser agrees that such cash and cash
equivalents shall not be a part of the assets to be acquired. 
Seller shall convert all securities held by it to cash, and shall
retain a portion of such cash as determined below. All other
cash shall be transferred by Seller to Sub at the Closing by
instruction to Seller bank to transfer such amount to an account
established by Sub. To effect this change the parties agree that
the following sections of the Agreement shall be amended as
follows: 

a. Section 1.2 shall read in full as follows: 

"Purchase Price. In consideration of the sale, conveyance,
assignment, transfer and delivery of the Purchased Assets,
Purchaser shall (a) pay, or cause Sub to pay, to Seller, the
Aggregate Consideration (as herein defined) and (b) assume, or
cause Sub to assume, the Assumed Liabilities. As used herein,
"Aggregate Consideration" means Fifty Three Million Thirty Seven
Thousand Three Hundred and Twelve U.S. Dollars ($53,037,312),
less an amount of U.S. Dollars equal to (i) Four Million Seven
Hundred Thousand (NIS4,700,000) Israeli Shekels multiplied by
(ii) the exchange rate obtained by 3Com upon the exchange of U.S.
dollars for Israeli Shekels on the Closing Date with respect to
the exchange necessary to obtain Shekels to pay the portion of
the purchase price to be paid by Sub. 

b. The first sentence of Section 1.3 shall read in
full as follows: 

"Cash Consideration" shall mean the cash consideration to be paid
to Seller as consideration for the Purchased Assets, which shall
be an amount equal to the Aggregate Consideration in U.S. Dollars
minus the Value of the Stock Consideration.

c. Section 1.5 is amended to add a new subsection
(a), and existing subsections (a), (b) and (c) (and all
references in the Agreement to such subsections) are redesignated
as (b), (c) and (d). 

d. Section 1.5 is amended to add a new subsection (a)
to read in full as follows:

"(a) A portion of the Purchase Price is attributable to the
Purchased Assets to be transferred to Sub, which shall be an
Israeli corporation, and such portion of the Purchase Price shall
be as set forth in the bill of sale for such Purchased Assets to
be delivered at the Closing. The remaining portion of the
Purchase Price shall be attributable to the Purchased Assets to
be transferred to Purchaser. The portion of the Purchase Price
attributable to the Purchased Assets to be transferred to Sub
shall be paid to Seller either in U.S. dollars or in Israeli
shekels."

e. Section 1.5(b) is amended to add the following
sentence at the end thereof: 

" For purposes of paying the Cash Consideration, a portion of the
Cash Consideration shall be payable in Israeli shekels, as
determined in Section 1.5(a) and the remaining amount paid to
Seller shall be paid in U.S. dollars."

f. Section 2.2 (e) is amended to read in full as
follows: "(e) all cash, cash equivalents, securities, notes
payable or other debts owed to Seller and deposits and rights
with respect to the Purchased Assets, and all lock-box accounts
which are used in the conduct of the Business, located in, or
arising under the laws of (i) Israel; or (ii) the United States,
as enumerated in the Disclosure Schedule (as defined below),
provided however, that an amount of cash or cash equivalents with
a value of 4,700,000 shekels shall not be a Purchased Asset;"

g. Section 2.3 is amended to include as an Excluded
Asset a certain amount of cash and an additional contract by
amending subsection (c) thereof to read in full as follows: "(c)
an amount of cash or cash equivalents with a value of 4,700,000
shekels, the Epilogue Agreement referred to in Section 5.2(d)
(ii), and all assets identified as excluded from purchase under
Exhibit 2.3(c) - List of Excluded Assets."

h. The definition of "Purchaser Closing Price in
Section 1.3 of the Agreement shall be revised to read in full as
follows "Purchaser Closing Price" shall mean the average of the
closing prices of a share of Purchaser's common stock on the ten
(10) consecutive trading days up to and including the third
trading day prior to the Closing Date.

3. VAT Payment Date. Purchaser and Sub have been advised that
pursuant to Section 20 of the VAT law of the Israel, the director
of VAT has approved the payment by Sub of any VAT that is due
directly to such director. The parties agree that VAT payments
with respect to the transaction are not required to be paid until
November 15, 1994, and, further, that such payments will not be
paid by Seller, and are not due from Sub to Seller, but will be
paid directly by Sub. Purchaser agrees to cause Sub to make such
payment and to indemnify Seller against any claims which may be
made against it by the director of VAT in respect of the
transaction. 

4. Calculation of Escrow Amounts. The foregoing amendments
notwithstanding, all calculations of the amounts to be deposited
in Escrow shall be based upon the Aggregate Consideration and the
Cash Consideration as defined in the Agreement prior to this
Amendment.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement
on the date first above written.
