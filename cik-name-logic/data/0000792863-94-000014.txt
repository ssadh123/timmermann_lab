Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
_____________________________________

On June 17, 1994 Infinity Broadcasting Corporation (the
"Company") and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Infinity Broadcasting
Corporation of Maryland, completed the acquisition of two radio stations
serving Washington, D.C. for a total purchase price of $60,500,000. In
the transaction, the Company's subsidiary acquired the assets of
WPGC-AM and WPGC-FM (Morningside, Maryland), from Cook Inlet Radio
Partners, L.P. and Cook Inlet Radio License Partnership, L.P.

The Purchase price of the acquisition was funded by bank
borrowings under the Company's Amended and Restated Credit Agreement,
dated as of June 7, 1994 (the "Credit Agreement"), with a syndicated
group of bank lenders. The Credit Agreement provides for aggregate
borrowings of up to $470 million, including an acquisition facility of
$265 million. Upon completion of the Cook Inlet acquisition,
approximately $89 million remained available to finance additional
acquisitions. The Company used approximately $23 million of that
remaining amount to complete the purchase of Detroit radio station
WXYT(AM) on June 27, 1994.

As required by federal law and the rules of the Federal
Communications Commission (the "FCC"), the FCC consented to the
Company's acquisition of the two Washington, D.C. stations, and such
consent became final on June 30, 1994. Under current FCC rules, the
Company is permitted to own multiple radio stations serving Washington,
D.C. In addition to the Washington, D.C. stations acquired from Cook
Inlet, the Company owns WJFK-AM/FM which serves Washington, D.C.

Section 5. Yield Protection, Etc.
______________________

5.1. Additional Costs.
________________

(a) The Company shall pay directly to each Bank from
time to time such amounts as such Bank may determine to be
necessary to compensate it for any costs which such Bank
determines are attributable to its making or maintaining of any
Eurodollar Loans or its obligation to make any Eurodollar Loans,
or any reduction in any amount receivable by such Bank in respect
of any of such Loans or such obligation (such increases in costs
and reductions in amounts receivable being herein called
"Additional Costs"), resulting from any Regulatory Change which:
________________

(i) changes the basis of taxation of any amounts
payable to such Bank under this Agreement or its Notes or
any other Basic Document in respect of any of such Loans
(other than taxes imposed on or measured by the overall net
income of such Bank or of its Applicable Lending Office for
any of such Loans by the jurisdiction in which such Bank is
incorporated or has its principal office or such Applicable
Lending Office); or

(ii) imposes or modifies any reserve, special
deposit or similar requirements (other than the Reserve
Requirement utilized in the determination of the Eurodollar
Rate for such Loan) relating to any extensions of credit or
other assets of, or any deposits with or other liabilities
of, such Bank (including any of such Loans or any deposits
referred to in the definition of "Eurodollar Base Rate" in
Section 1.01 hereof), or any commitment of such Bank
(including the Commitments of such Bank hereunder); or

(iii) imposes any other condition affecting this
Agreement or its Notes or any other Basic Document (or any
of such extensions of credit or liabilities) or its
Commitments.

If any Bank requests compensation from the Company under this
Section 5.01(a), the Company may, by notice to such Bank (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent), suspend the obligation of such
Bank to make or Continue Eurodollar Loans, or to Convert Base
Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans, until the Regulatory Change
giving rise to such request ceases to be in effect (in which case
the provisions of Section 5.04 hereof shall be applicable).

________________

(b) Without limiting the effect of the provisions of
paragraph (a) of this Section 5.01, in the event that, by reason
of any Regulatory Change, any Bank either (i) incurs Additional
Costs based on or measured by the excess above a specified level
of the amount of a category of deposits or other liabilities of
such Bank which includes deposits by reference to which the
interest rate on Eurodollar Loans is determined or a category of
extensions of credit or other assets of such Bank which includes
Eurodollar Loans or (ii) becomes subject to restrictions on the
amount of such a category of liabilities or assets which it may
hold, then, if such Bank so elects by notice to the Company (with
a copy to the Administrative Agent), the obligation of such Bank
to make or Continue, or to Convert Base Rate Loans into,
Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended until such Regulatory Change
ceases to be in effect (in which case the provisions of
Section 5.04 hereof shall be applicable).

(c) Without limiting the effect of the foregoing
provisions of this Section 5.01 (but without duplication), the
Company shall pay directly to each Bank from time to time on
request such amounts as such Bank may determine to be necessary
to compensate such Bank (or, without duplication, the bank
holding company of which such Bank is a subsidiary) for any costs
which it determines are attributable to the maintenance by such
Bank (or any Applicable Lending Office or such bank holding
company), pursuant to any law or regulation or any
interpretation, directive or request (whether or not having the
force of law) of any court or governmental or monetary authority
(i) following any Regulatory Change or (ii) implementing any
risk-based capital guideline or requirement (whether or not
having the force of law and whether or not the failure to comply
therewith would be unlawful) heretofore or hereafter issued by
any government or governmental or supervisory authority
implementing at the national level the Basle Accord (including,
without limitation, the Final Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (12 CFR
Part 208, Appendix A; 12 CFR Part 225, Appendix A) and the Final
Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of the Office of the Comptroller of
the Currency (12 CFR Part 3, Appendix A)), of capital in respect
of its Commitments or Loans (such compensation to include,
without limitation, an amount equal to any reduction of the rate
of return on assets or equity of such Bank (or any Applicable
Lending Office or such bank holding company) to a level below
that which such Bank (or any Applicable Lending Office or such
bank holding company) could have achieved but for such law,
regulation, interpretation, directive or request). For purposes
of this Section 5.01(c), "Basle Accord" shall mean the proposals

on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices in its paper
entitled "International Convergence of Capital Measurement and
Capital Standards" dated July 1988, as amended, modified and
supplemented and in effect from time to time or any replacement
thereof.

(d) Each Bank shall notify the Company of any event
occurring after the date of this Agreement that will entitle such
Bank to compensation under paragraph (a) or (c) of this
Section 5.01 as promptly as practicable after it obtains actual
knowledge thereof and determines to request such compensation and
will designate a different Applicable Lending Office for the
Loans of such Bank affected by such event if such designation
will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such
compensation and will not, in the reasonable opinion of such
Bank, be disadvantageous to such Bank, except that such Bank
shall have no obligation to designate an Applicable Lending
Office located in the United States of America, provided that no
________
Bank shall be entitled to compensation under this Section 5.01
for any costs incurred more than six months prior to the date the
respective Bank requests the Company for such compensation. Each
Bank will furnish to the Company a certificate setting forth the
basis and amount of each request by such Bank for compensation
under paragraph (a) or (c) of this Section 5.01. Determinations
and allocations by any Bank for purposes of this Section 5.01 of
the effect of any Regulatory Change pursuant to paragraph (a) or
(b) of this Section 5.01, or of the effect of capital maintained
pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section 5.01, on its costs or
rate of return of maintaining Loans or its obligation to make
Loans, or on amounts receivable by it in respect of Loans, and of
the amounts required to compensate such Bank under this
Section 5.01, shall be conclusive, provided that such
________
determinations and allocations are made on a reasonable basis.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.01 to the contrary, no
Bank shall be entitled to compensation (i) if any increase in
costs results from any Bank failing to comply with any of the
requirements set forth in Section 5.06(a) or (ii) for any costs
to a Bank that are already taken into account in the
determination of the applicable interest rate.

5.2. Limitation on Eurodollar Loans. Anything herein
______________________________
to the contrary notwithstanding, if, on or prior to the
determination of any Eurodollar Base Rate for any Eurodollar
Loans for any Interest Period:

63
<PAGE>
Credit Agreement
________________

(a) the Administrative Agent determines, which
determination shall be conclusive, that quotations of
interest rates for the relevant deposits referred to in the
definition of "Eurodollar Base Rate" in Section 1.01 hereof
are not being provided in the relevant amounts or for the
relevant maturities for purposes of determining rates of
interest for such Eurodollar Loans; or

(b) if such Loans are Term Loans and/or Revolving
Credit Loans, the Majority Term Loan Banks and/or Majority
Revolving Credit Banks, respectively, determine, which
determination shall be conclusive, and notify the
Administrative Agent that the relevant rates of interest
referred to in the definition of "Eurodollar Base Rate" in
Section 1.01 hereof upon the basis of which the rate of
interest for Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period is to
be determined are not likely adequately to cover the cost to
such Banks of making or maintaining Eurodollar Loans for
such Interest Period;

then the Administrative Agent shall give the Company and each of
the Banks which are to make or which hold such Loans prompt
notice thereof, and so long as such condition remains in effect,
such Banks shall be under no obligation to make additional
Eurodollar Loans, to Continue Eurodollar Loans or to Convert Base
Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans and the Company shall, on the
last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for such
Eurodollar Loans, Convert such Loans into Base Rate Loans in
accordance with Section 2.08 hereof.

5.3. Illegality. Notwithstanding any other provision
__________
of this Agreement or any other Basic Document, in the event that
it becomes unlawful for any Bank or its Applicable Lending Office
to honor its obligation to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans,
then such Bank shall promptly notify the Company thereof (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent) and such Bank's obligation to
make or Continue, or to Convert Loans of any other type into,
Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended until such time as such Bank
may again make and maintain Eurodollar Loans (in which case the
provisions of Section 5.04 hereof shall be applicable).

5.4. Treatment of Affected Loans. If the obligation
___________________________
of any Bank to make Eurodollar Loans or Continue, or to Convert
Base Rate Loans into, Eurodollar Loans shall be suspended
pursuant to Section 5.01 or 5.03 hereof, such Bank's Eurodollar
Loans shall be automatically Converted into Base Rate Loans on
the last day(s) of the then current Interest Period(s) for such

64

Credit Agreement
________________

Eurodollar Loans (or, in the case of a Conversion required by
Section 5.01(b) or 5.03 hereof, on such earlier date as such Bank
may specify to the Company with a copy to the Administrative
Agent) and, unless and until such Bank gives notice as provided
below that the circumstances specified in Section 5.01 or 5.03
hereof which gave rise to such Conversion no longer exist:

(a) to the extent that such Bank's Eurodollar Loans of
any series have been so Converted, all payments and
prepayments of principal which would otherwise be applied to
such Bank's Eurodollar Loans of such series shall be applied
instead to its Base Rate Loans of such series; and

(b) all Loans which would otherwise be made or
Continued by such Bank as Eurodollar Loans shall be made or
Continued instead as Base Rate Loans and all Base Rate Loans
of such Bank which would otherwise be Converted into
Eurodollar Loans shall remain as Base Rate Loans.

If such Bank gives notice to the Company with a copy to the
Administrative Agent that the circumstances specified in
Section 5.01 or 5.03 hereof which gave rise to the Conversion of
such Bank's Eurodollar Loans of any series pursuant to this
Section 5.04 no longer exist (which such Bank agrees to do
promptly upon such circumstances ceasing to exist) at a time when
Eurodollar Loans of such series held by other Banks are
outstanding, such Bank's Base Rate Loans of such series shall be
automatically Converted, on the first day(s) of the next
succeeding Interest Period(s) for such outstanding Eurodollar
Loans, to the extent necessary so that, after giving effect
thereto, all Loans of such series held by such Banks and by such
Bank are held pro rata (as to principal amounts, types and
Interest Periods) in accordance with their respective Loans of
such series.

5.5. Compensation. The Company shall pay to the
____________
Administrative Agent for account of each Bank, upon the request
of such Bank through the Administrative Agent, such amount or
amounts as shall be sufficient (in the reasonable opinion of such
Bank) to compensate it for any loss, cost or expense which such
Bank determines is attributable to:

(a) any payment, prepayment or Conversion of a
Eurodollar Loan held by such Bank for any reason (including,
without limitation, the acceleration of the Loans pursuant
to Section 9 hereof) on a date other than the last day of
the Interest Period for such Loan or any failure by the

65

________________

Company or any Subsidiary Borrower for any reason
(including, without limitation, by reason of a revocation of
a notice of prepayment given as permitted by Section 3.03(a)
hereof) to prepay a Eurodollar Loan on the date specified
for such prepayment in the relevant notice of prepayment
given pursuant to said Section 3.03(a); or

(b) any failure by the Company or any Subsidiary
Borrower for any reason (including, without limitation, the
failure of any of the conditions precedent specified in
Section 6 hereof to be satisfied) to borrow a Eurodollar
Loan from such Bank on the date for such borrowing specified
in the relevant notice of borrowing given pursuant to
Section 2.02 hereof.

Without limiting the effect of the preceding sentence, such
compensation shall include an amount equal to the excess, if any,
of (i) the amount of interest which otherwise would have accrued
on the principal amount so paid, prepaid or Converted or not
borrowed for the period from the date of such payment,
prepayment, Conversion or failure to borrow to the last day of
the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case
of a failure to borrow, the Interest Period for such Loan which
would have commenced on the date specified for such borrowing) at
the applicable rate of interest for such Loan provided for herein
over (ii) the amount of interest which otherwise would have
accrued on such principal amount at a rate per annum equal to the
interest component of the amount such Bank would have bid in the
London interbank market for Dollar deposits of leading banks in
amounts comparable to such principal amount and with maturities
comparable to such period (as reasonably determined by such
Bank). Each Bank will furnish a certificate to the Company
setting forth the basis and amount of each request by such Bank
for compensation under this Section 5.05, such certificate to be
conclusive as to the amount of compensation to which such Bank is
entitled provided the determination of such amount is made on a
reasonable basis.

5.6. U.S. Taxes.
__________

(a) Prior to the Effective Date, and from time to time
thereafter if requested by the Company or the Administrative
Agent or required because, as a result of a change in law or a
change in circumstances or otherwise, a previously delivered form
or statement becomes incomplete or incorrect in any material
respect, each Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction
outside the United States shall provide, if applicable, the

66
<PAGE>
Credit Agreement
________________

Administrative Agent and the Company with complete, accurate and
duly executed forms or other statements prescribed by the
Internal Revenue Service of the United States certifying such
Bank's exemption from, or entitlement to a reduced rate of,
United States withholding taxes (including backup withholding
taxes) with respect to its beneficial interest in payments to be
made to such Bank hereunder, under any of the Subsidiary Loan
Agreements and under any of the Notes. If such Bank has
transferred a beneficial interest in any part of any of the Notes
payable to it, it will forward to the Company or the
Administrative Agent any such statements or forms executed by the
Person to which it has transferred such beneficial interest.

(b) The Company and the Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold any and all present or future
taxes or withholdings, and all liabilities with respect thereto,
from payments hereunder, under any of the Subsidiary Loan
Agreements or under any of the Notes, if and to the extent that
the Company or the Administrative Agent in good faith determines
that such deduction or withholding is required by the law of the
United States, including, without limitation, any applicable
treaty of the United States. In the event the Company or the
Administrative Agent shall so determine that deduction or
withholding of taxes is required, it shall advise the affected
Bank as to the basis of such determination prior to actually
deducting and withholding such taxes. In the event the Company
or the Administrative Agent shall so deduct or withhold taxes
from amounts payable hereunder or under any of the Subsidiary
Loan Agreements or under any of the Notes, it (i) shall pay to or
deposit with the appropriate taxing authority in a timely manner
the full amount of taxes it has deducted or withheld; (ii) shall
provide evidence of payment of such taxes to, or the deposit
thereof with, the appropriate taxing authority and a statement
setting forth the amount of taxes deducted or withheld, the
applicable rate, and any other information or documentation
reasonably requested by the Banks from whom the taxes were
deducted or withheld; and (iii) shall forward to such Banks any
official tax receipts or other documentation with respect to the
payment or deposit of the deducted or withheld taxes as may be
issued from time to time by the appropriate taxing authority.
Unless the Company and the Administrative Agent shall have
received forms or other documents satisfactory to them indicating
that payments hereunder, under any of the Subsidiary Loan
Agreements or under any of the Notes or not subject to United
States withholding tax or are subject to such tax at a rate
reduced by an applicable tax treaty, the Company or the
Administrative Agent may withhold taxes from such payments at the

67
<PAGE>
Credit Agreement
________________

applicable statutory rate in the case of payment to or for any
Bank organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the
United States.

(c) Each Bank organized under the laws of the United
States or any state thereof agrees (i) that as between it and the
Company or the Administrative Agent, it shall be the Person to
deduct and withheld taxes, and to the extent required by law it
shall deduct and withhold taxes, on amounts that such Bank may
remit to any other Person(s) by reason of any undisclosed sale of
a participation in this Agreement to such other Person(s)
pursuant to Section 11.06; and (ii) to indemnify the Company and
the Administrative Agent and any officers, directors, agents or
employees of the Company or the Administrative Agent against and
to hold them harmless from any tax, interest, additions to tax,
penalties, reasonable counsel and accountants fees and
disbursements arising from the assertion by any appropriate
taxing authority of any claim against them relating to a failure
to withhold taxes as required by law with respect to amounts
described in clause (i) of this paragraph (c).

(d) Each assignee of a Bank's interest in this
Agreement or any Subsidiary Loan Agreement in conformity with
Section 11.06 shall be bound by this Section 5.06, so that such
assignee will have all of the obligations and provide all of the
forms and statements and all indemnities, representations and
warranties required to be given under this Section 5.06. Unless
the Company shall have consented in writing to such assignment,
no assignee of a Bank's interest in this Agreement or any
Subsidiary Loan Agreement shall have the right to any payment
under this Section 5.06 in excess of the amount that would have
been payable to the assignor Bank.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
any withholding taxes shall become payable solely as a result of
any change in any statute, treaty, ruling, determination or
regulation occurring after the Initial Date (as hereinafter
defined) in respect of any sum payable hereunder, under any
Subsidiary Loan Agreement or under any Note to any Bank (or any
participant in a Loan held by a Bank) or the Administrative Agent
(i) the sum payable by the Company shall be increased as may be
necessary so that after making all required deductions (including
deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
Section 5.06) such Bank (or any participant in a Loan held by a
Bank) or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) receives
an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such
deductions been made, (ii) the Company shall make such deductions

68
<PAGE>
Credit Agreement
________________

and (iii) the Company shall pay the full amount deducted to the
relevant taxation authority or other authority in accordance with
applicable law. For purposes of this Section 5.06, the term
"Initial Date" shall mean (i) in the case of the Administrative
____________
Agent, the date hereof, (ii) in the case of each Bank as of the
date hereof, the date hereof and (iii) in the case of any other
Bank, the date it becomes a Bank hereunder pursuant to Section
11.06. No amount payable hereunder to a holder of a
participation in a Loan shall be greater in amount than the
amount that would have been paid to the holder of the Loan had it
retained the Loan and not sold the participation thereon.

(f) If as a result of withholding taxes becoming
payable in connection with any amount payable to or with respect
to a Bank (i) the sum payable by the Company is increased
pursuant to clause (i) of Section 5.06(e) hereof and (ii) such
Bank utilizes a credit against any tax liability arising
hereunder for which it is liable (other than the income tax
liability directly satisfied by such withholding), then such Bank
shall promptly pay to the Company an amount equal to such amount
as the Bank estimates in a good faith exercise of its judgment
represents the credit so utilized (not to exceed the
corresponding sum payable by the Company pursuant to
Section 5.06(e) hereof), provided that a Bank shall not be
________
obligated to make any payment hereunder to the extent such
payment would result in such Bank's being in a worse after-tax
economic position than if amounts paid to such Bank had not been
subject to withholding taxes. In the event the credit is later
disallowed, deferred or recaptured for any reason, the Company
will pay the Bank such amount as will equal the amount of the
credit so disallowed, deferred or recaptured, provided that the
________
Company shall not be obligated to pay any amount hereunder to a
Bank with respect to any credit that is later disallowed or
recaptured in excess of the amount paid hereunder to the Company
by such Bank in respect of such credit. In any such case, the
applicable Bank shall provide to the Company a statement in
reasonable detail setting forth the determination of such credit
utilized by such Bank.

5.7. Replacement or Prepayment of Certain Banks. The
__________________________________________
Company may, with respect to any Bank that requests compensation
pursuant to Section 5.01 hereof, upon not less than three
Business Days prior notice to such Bank (with a copy to the
Administrative Agent) specifying the date for the consummation of
the assignment contemplated by said clause (i) or the termination
and/or payment(s) contemplated below require that such Bank
assign (in which case such Bank shall assign) as provided in

Section 11.06(a) hereof all (but not less than all) of its Loans
and Commitments (if any) to one or more other financial
institutions (which may be "Banks" hereunder) specified by the
Company in such notice willing to accept such assignment for an
amount equal to the sum of the outstanding aggregate principal
amount of such Bank's Loans and unpaid interest thereon (and
unpaid commitment fees owing to such Bank pursuant to Section
2.04 hereof) accrued to the date of the consummation of such
assignment (such assignment to be pursuant to documentation
reasonably acceptable to such Bank), provided that the Company
________
shall pay to such Bank upon the consummation of such assignment
(x) such amounts (if any) as are then owing to such Bank under
Section 5 hereof (and, including without limitation, the amounts
payable under Section 5.05 hereof, if any, that the Company would
be required to pay such Bank if the Loans assigned by it were
being prepaid by the Company on the date of such consummation)
and (y) all other amounts then owing by the Company to or for the
account of such Bank hereunder (other than such principal of its
Loans and such interest and commitment fees). If any Bank that
is a Reference Bank (or whose Applicable Lending Office is a
Reference Bank, as the case may be) shall be replaced pursuant to
this Section 5.07, such Reference Bank shall thereupon cease to
be a Reference Bank and, if as a result of the foregoing, there
shall only be two Reference Banks remaining, then the
Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Company) shall, by
notice to the Company and the Banks, designate another Bank as a
Reference Bank, so that there shall at all times be three
Reference Banks.

8.19. Certain Obligations Respecting Restricted
_________________________________________
Subsidiaries. The Company will, and will cause each of its

Restricted Subsidiaries to, take such action from time to time as
shall be necessary to ensure that the Company and each of its

Lien of the Security Agreement) at least the same percentage of
the issued and outstanding shares of each class of stock of each
of its Restricted Subsidiaries as is owned on the date of this

shall thereby become the owner of shares of capital stock of such
Restricted Subsidiary, the respective Obligor agrees forthwith to
deliver to the Collateral Agent pursuant to the Security

accompanied by undated stock powers executed in blank and shall
take such other action as the Collateral Agent and/or the
Administrative Agent shall request to perfect the security
interest created therein pursuant to the Security Agreement.

8.20. Additional Subsidiary Guarantors. The Company
________________________________
will take such action, and will cause each of its Restricted

necessary to ensure that all Restricted Subsidiaries of the

of the foregoing, in the event that the Company or any of its
existing Restricted Subsidiaries shall form any new Restricted
Subsidiary after the date hereof, the Company or such existing
Restricted Subsidiary will cause such new Restricted Subsidiary
to become a "Guarantor" under the Guarantee Agreement (and,
thereby, an "Obligor" hereunder) and a party to the Security
Agreement and to grant a security interest in its Properties to
the Collateral Agent as collateral security for the Secured
Obligations (as defined in the Security Agreement) pursuant to a
written instrument in form and substance satisfactory to the
Collateral Agent and the Administrative Agent, and to deliver
such proof of corporate action and incumbency of officers,
opinions of counsel and other documents as are consistent with

waive, amend or otherwise modify any provision of any of the
Management Investor Agreements, the Infinity Warrants, the New
Infinity Warrants, the Stock Purchase Agreement, the
Stockholders' Agreement or the Securities Purchase Agreement in
any manner that could reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Banks without the prior consent of the
Majority Banks.

terms of this Agreement and of the other Basic Documents,
together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental
thereto. None of the Co-Agents, in their capacity as Co-Agents,
shall have any duties or responsibilities under this Agreement or
any fiduciary relationship with the Administrative Agent, the

107

Credit Agreement
________________

Collateral Agent or any Bank, and no implied covenants,
functions, responsibilities, duties or liabilities shall be read
into this Agreement or any other Basic Document or otherwise
exist against any Co-Agent in its capacity as Co-Agent hereunder.
No Agent (which term, either in the singular or the plural, as
used in this sentence and in Section 10.05 and the first sentence
of Section 10.06 hereof shall include reference to such Agent's
affiliates and its own and its affiliates' officers, directors,
employees and agents): (a) shall have any duties or
responsibilities except those expressly set forth in the Basic
Documents; (b) shall by reason of any Basic Document be a trustee
for any of the Banks or the other Agents; (c) shall be
responsible to any of the Banks or the other Agents for any
recitals, statements, representations or warranties contained in
any Basic Document, or in any certificate or other document
referred to or provided for in, or received by it under any Basic
Document, or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness,
enforceability or sufficiency of any Basic Document or any other
document referred to or provided for herein or therein or for any
failure by any Obligor or any other Person to perform any of its
obligations hereunder or thereunder; (d) except as expressly
required by any Basic Document, shall be required to initiate or
conduct any litigation or collection proceedings under any Basic
Document; or (e) shall be responsible for any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it under any Basic Document or under any

or therein or in connection herewith or therewith, except for its
own gross negligence or willful misconduct. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of the Co-Agents and the
Collateral Agent shall be conclusively entitled to assume that
the conditions precedent set forth in Section 6.04 hereof have
been satisfied and the Administrative Agent shall be conclusively
entitled to assume that the conditions precedent set forth in
Section 6.04(a) hereof have been satisfied unless, in each case,
such Agent has received notices to the effect that any of such
conditions have not been satisfied from either the Majority Banks
or, with respect to the conversion of Term Loans under and as
defined in the Existing Credit Agreement to Term Loans hereunder,
the Majority Term Loan Banks, or, with respect to the conversion
of Revolving Credit Loans under and as defined in the Existing
Credit Agreement to Revolving Credit Loans hereunder or if the
related borrowing is of a Revolving Credit Loan, the Majority
Revolving Credit Banks, in each case referring to the relevant
subsection(s) and stating that the relevant condition(s) has not
been satisfied or unless the Company so notifies such Agent.
Each Agent may employ agents and attorneys-in-fact and shall not
be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any such

108
<PAGE>
Credit Agreement
________________

agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by such Agent in good faith.
Each Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the holder
thereof for all purposes hereof unless and until a notice of the
assignment or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the
Administrative Agent, together with a notice of such assignment
or transfer to the Company. Each of the Banks hereby irrevocably
authorizes the Administrative Agent to execute, deliver and/or
perform and/or acknowledge each of the Assignment Agreements,
each of the Subsidiary Loan Agreements and the Guarantee
Agreement and hereby agrees to be bound by all of the obligations
stated therein to be applicable to it as a Bank thereunder or as
a beneficiary thereof as if it were a party thereto. Each of the
Banks hereby irrevocably authorizes the Collateral Agent to
execute, deliver and/or perform each of the Security Documents
(other than the Guarantee Agreement). The Collateral Agent is
hereby authorized to determine that the cost to the Obligors is
disproportionate to the benefit to be realized by the Banks by
perfecting a Lien in any given Property and that in such
instances, the applicable Obligors shall not be required to
perfect such Lien in favor of the Collateral Agent (for the
benefit of the Banks) and provided that the Collateral Agent
shall have determined in its sole discretion that such item of
Collateral is immaterial or of inconsequential value. Each Bank
hereby agrees that for purposes of Sections 10.03 and 10.05 of
the Subordinated Indenture, the Administrative Agent shall be the
"Representative" of the Banks under and as defined in the
Subordinated Indenture.

10.2. Reliance by Each Agent. Each Agent shall be
______________________
entitled to rely upon any certification, notice or other
communication (including any thereof by telephone, telex,
telegram or cable) believed by it to be genuine and correct and
to have been signed or sent by or on behalf of the proper Person
or Persons, and upon advice and statements of legal counsel,
independent accountants and other experts selected by such Agent.
Each Agent shall provide each other Agent with a copy of each
certification, notice or other communication received by it under
this Agreement or any of the other Basic Documents. As to any
matters not expressly provided for by this Agreement or any other
Basic Document, each Agent shall in all cases be fully protected
in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder or thereunder
in accordance with instructions given by the Majority Banks or,
if and to the extent required hereby or by any other Basic
Document, in accordance with instructions given by all of the
Banks, the Majority Term Loan Banks and/or the Majority Revolving
Credit Banks, as the case may be, and such instructions of such
Banks and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto

109
<PAGE>
Credit Agreement
________________

shall be binding on all of the Banks or, if applicable, on all of
the Term Loan Banks and/or Revolving Credit Banks, as the case
may be.

10.3. Defaults.
________

(a) No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge or
notice of the occurrence of a Default unless such Agent has
received notice from another Agent, a Bank or the Company
specifying such Default and stating that such notice is a "Notice
of Default". In the event that any Agent receives such a notice
of the occurrence of a Default, such Agent shall give prompt
notice thereof to each other Agent and the Banks (and the
Administrative Agent shall give all other Agents and all Banks
prompt notice of each such non-payment).

(b) The Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent,
as the case may be, shall (subject to Sections 10.01, 10.05
and 10.07 hereof) take such action with respect to any Default as
shall be directed by the Majority Banks, or, if and to the extent
required herein or in any other Basic Document, all of the Banks,
the Majority Term Loan Banks and/or the Majority Revolving Credit
Banks, as the case may be, provided that, unless and until the
________
Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be,
shall have received such directions, the Administrative Agent or
the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, may (but shall not be
obligated to) take such action, or refrain from taking such
action, with respect to such Default as it shall deem advisable
in the best interest of all of the Banks, except to the extent
that this Agreement expressly requires that such action be taken,
or not be taken, only with the agreement or consent of the
Majority Banks, the Majority Term Loan Banks, the Majority
Revolving Credit Banks or all of the Banks.

10.4. Rights as a Bank. With respect to its
________________
Commitment(s) and the Loans made by it, each Agent (and any
successor to any Agent) in its capacity as a Bank hereunder or
under any Basic Document shall have the same rights and powers
hereunder or thereunder as any other Bank and may exercise the
same as though it were not acting as an Agent, and the term
"Bank" or "Banks" shall, unless the context otherwise indicates,
include each Agent in its individual capacity. Each Agent (and
any successor to any Agent) and its affiliates may (without
having to account therefor to any Bank) accept deposits from,
lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust
or other business with any of the Obligors (and any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates) as if it were not acting as an Agent,

110
<PAGE>
Credit Agreement
________________

and each Agent and its affiliates may accept fees and other
consideration from the Obligors for services in connection with
this Agreement or otherwise without having to account for the
same to the Banks.

10.5. Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify
_______________
each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent (to the
extent not reimbursed under Section 11.03 hereof, but without
limiting the obligations of the Company under said Section 11.03)
ratably in accordance with the aggregate principal amount of the
Loans and, if any of the Commitments are then in effect, the
aggregate unused amount of such Commitments held by the Banks,
for any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Administrative
Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, (including by
any Bank) arising out of or by reason of any investigation or any
way relating to or arising out of this Agreement or any other
Basic Document or any other documents contemplated by or referred
to herein or therein or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including, without limitation, the costs and expenses which the
Company is obligated to pay under Section 11.03 hereof, but
excluding, unless a Default has occurred and is continuing,
normal administrative costs and expenses incident to the
performance of its agency duties hereunder) or the enforcement of
any of the terms hereof or thereof or of any such other
documents, provided that no Bank shall be liable for any of the
foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the party to be indemnified.

10.6. Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Banks. Each
______________________________________
Bank agrees that it has, independently and without reliance on
any Agent or any other Bank, and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit
analysis of the Company and its Subsidiaries and decision to
enter into this Agreement and that it will, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent or any other Bank, and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at
the time, continue to make its own analysis and decisions in
taking or not taking action under this Agreement or any of the
other Basic Documents. No Agent shall be required to keep itself
informed as to the performance or observance by any Obligor or
other party of this Agreement or any of the other Basic Documents
or any other document referred to or provided for herein or
therein or to inspect the Properties or books of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. Except for notices, reports and other

documents and information expressly required to be furnished to
the Banks by the Administrative Agent hereunder, no Agent shall

credit or other information concerning the affairs, financial
condition or business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(or any of their affiliates) which may come into the possession
of such Agent or any of its affiliates.

10.7. Failure to Act. Except for action expressly
______________
required of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent
hereunder and under the other Basic Documents, the Administrative

satisfaction from the Banks of their indemnification obligations
under Section 10.05 hereof against any and all liability and

be unreasonably withheld), provided that any failure of the

Company to object to a proposed successor Agent within 15 days
after notice of the proposed appointment to the Company shall be
deemed to constitute consent of the Company to such appointment

accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring
Agent's giving of notice of resignation or the Majority Banks'
removal, as the case may be, and consented to by the Company (but

Agent may, on behalf of the relevant Banks, appoint a successor
Agent, which shall be a Bank which has an office in New York,
New York with a combined capital and surplus of at least
$500,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Agent
hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall
thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the rights,

retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and
obligations hereunder. After any retiring Agent's resignation or
removal hereunder as an Agent, the provisions of this Section 11
shall continue in effect for its benefit in respect of any
actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as

Agreement, such Investments shall be held in the name and under
the control of such Bank, and such Bank shall hold such
Investments as a collateral sub-agent for the Collateral Agent

rights or obligations under the Subsidiary Loan Agreement to
which it is a party or its Notes without the prior consent of all

the Administrative Agent.

11.6. Bank Assignments and Participations.
___________________________________

(a) Subject to paragraph (b) below, each Bank may
assign to any other Bank or any other bank or financial
institution all or any part of its Loans and Commitments,
provided that: (i) except for an assignment to any affiliate or
majority-owned subsidiary of the assigning Bank or to any other
Bank (each, an "Inter-Bank Assignment") or an assignment
_____________________
consented to by the Administrative Agent, any assignment of less
than all of such Bank's Loans and/or Commitments of each series
to a single assignee shall be in an amount such that, after
giving effect to such assignment and any other contemporaneous
assignment(s) to such assignee by any other Bank(s), such
assignee shall hold Loans and/or Commitments aggregating at least
$5,000,000 and (ii) each such partial assignment by such Bank of
its Term Loans or its Revolving Credit Loans or Commitments shall
be made in such a manner so that the same proportion of each of
its outstanding Term Loans or Revolving Credit Loans and
Commitments (if then in effect), as the case may be, is assigned
to the assignee. Upon written notice to the Company and the
Administrative Agent of an assignment permitted hereunder (which
notice shall identify the assignee, the amount of the assignor's
Loan(s) and Commitment(s) assigned in detail reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent), the assignee shall
have, to the extent of such assignment, the obligations, rights
and benefits of a Bank hereunder holding the Loan(s) and/or
Commitment(s) assigned to it (in addition to the Loan(s) and
Commitment(s) of such series, if any, theretofore held by such
assignee). In connection with the assignment by a Bank of all or
any portion of its Loan(s) and/or Commitment(s) to another Person
as permitted hereunder, upon request of such Bank or such Person,
the Company or any Subsidiary Borrower will issue promissory
notes in substantially the form of Exhibit A-1, A-2, A-3 or A-4
hereto (as appropriate) (as such form may have been modified),
each dated the date of the Notes originally issued hereunder or

118
<PAGE>
Credit Agreement
________________

under the related Subsidiary Loan Agreement (or, if interest has
been paid on such Loan(s), dated the Interest Accrual Date for
such Loans) payable to the order of such Person in a principal
amount equal to the Loan(s) so assigned and otherwise duly
completed, and the assigning Bank shall make an appropriate
notation on the schedule attached to the related Note(s) held by
it as to the principal amount of the Loan(s) and/or Commitment(s)
so assigned.

(b) If any assignment made pursuant to paragraph (a),
above shall be made to any Person that is organized under the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States of America
or any State thereof, such Person shall furnish such
certificates, documents or other evidence to the Company and the
Administrative Agent as shall be required by Section 5.06 hereof
to evidence such Person's exemption from U.S. withholding taxes
with respect to any payments under or pursuant to this Agreement
because any such payments to such Person are effectively
connected with the conduct by such Person of a trade or business
in the United States.

(c) A Bank may sell or agree to sell to one or more
other Persons a participation in all or any part of any Loans
held by it, or in its Commitment(s), provided that each purchaser
of a participation (a "Participant"), except as otherwise
___________
provided in Section 4.07(c) or 5.06(e) hereof, shall not have any
other rights or benefits under this Agreement or any Note or any
other Basic Document (the Participant's rights against such Bank
in respect of such participation to be those set forth in the
agreements executed by such Bank in favor of the Participant).
Each Bank's right to sell such participations is subject to the
following conditions: (i) such Bank's obligations under this
Agreement (including, without limitation, its Commitment(s), if
any, hereunder) shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall
remain solely responsible for the performance of such obligations
and (iii) the Obligors, the Agents, and the other Banks shall
continue to be entitled to deal solely and directly with such
Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under
this Agreement. All amounts payable by the Company to any Bank
under Section 5 hereof or by any Subsidiary Borrower as
contemplated by Section 5 of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement to
which such Subsidiary Borrower is a party in respect of the
Loan(s) held by it, and its Commitment(s), shall be determined as
if such Bank had not sold or agreed to sell any participations in
such Loan(s) and Commitment(s), and as if such Bank were funding
and maintaining each of such Loan(s) and Commitment(s) in the
same way that it is funding and maintaining the portion of such

119
<PAGE>
Credit Agreement
________________

Loan and Commitment in which no participations have been sold.
In no event shall a Bank that sells a participation agree with
the Participant to take or refrain from taking any action
hereunder or under any other Basic Document except that such Bank
may agree with the Participant that it will, on behalf of the
Participant, request the Company to furnish information to such
Bank for delivery to the Participant, of the type specified in
Section 8.01(p) hereof and may further agree with the Participant
that it will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree
to any of the following (but only if and to the extent that such
agreement would have an adverse effect on the Participant):
(i) increase or extend the term, or extend the time or waive any
requirement for the reduction or termination, of such Bank's
related Commitment(s) in which the Participant holds a
participation, (ii) extend the date fixed for the payment of
principal of or interest on the related Loan in which the
Participant holds a participation or any portion of any fee
payable to the Participant, (iii) reduce the amount of any such
payment of principal or (iv) reduce the rate at which interest is
payable thereon, or any fee payable to the Participant, to a
level below the rate at which the Participant is entitled to
receive such interest or fee.

(d) Anything in this Section 11.06 to the contrary
notwithstanding, any Bank may assign and pledge all or any
portion of its Loans and its Notes to any Federal Reserve Bank as
collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System and any Operating
Circular issued by such Federal Reserve Bank. No such assignment
shall release the assigning Bank from its obligations hereunder.

(e) A Bank may furnish any information concerning the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the possession of such Bank
from time to time to assignees and participants (including
prospective assignees and participants), subject, however, to the
provisions of Section 11.12(b) hereof.

11.7. Survival. The obligations of the Company under
________
Sections 5.01, 5.05, 5.06 and 11.03 hereof and the obligations of
the Banks under Sections 10.05 and 11.12 hereof shall survive the
repayment of the Loans and the termination of the Commitments.
In addition, each representation and warranty made, or deemed to
be made by a notice of any borrowing, herein or pursuant hereto
shall survive the making of such representation and warranty, and
no Bank shall be deemed to have waived, by reason of making any
Loan hereunder, any Default which may arise by reason of such
representation or warranty proving to have been false or

120
<PAGE>
Credit Agreement
________________

misleading, notwithstanding that such Bank or any of the Agents
may have had notice or knowledge or reason to believe that such
representation or warranty was false or misleading at the time
such extension of credit was made.

________
and section headings appearing herein are included solely for
convenience of reference and are not intended to affect the

hereto may execute this Agreement by signing any such
counterpart.

11.11. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE COMPANY, THE
____________________
AGENTS AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST

rights hereunder with respect to such pledge and security
interest;

time owing to such Obligor (including without limitation any
accounts or instruments) constituting part of the Collateral

terms of this Agreement.

of such Obligor (such shares constituting part of the Stock

and consent pertaining to such Stock Collateral for all purposes
not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Credit
Agreement or any instrument or agreement referred to herein or
therein, provided that such Obligor shall not vote the Stock
Collateral in any manner that is inconsistent with such terms.

(c) So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, without affecting the obligations of any of
the Borrowers under any provision of the Loan Documents to which
any such Borrower is a party prohibiting such action, each
Obligor which is the owner of Stock Collateral shall be permitted
to receive and retain any payments, distributions and/or
dividends, paid in cash, upon or in respect of any Stock
Collateral owned by such Obligor.

(d) So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred

(e) If any Event of Default shall have occurred, then
so long as such Event of Default shall continue, and whether or

consent pertaining to the Stock Collateral and shall be entitled
to exercise such powers in such manner as the Collateral Agent
shall determine in its sole discretion, provided that (x) the

12

<PAGE>

Collateral Agent shall not exercise any of its powers under this
clause (i) to the extent such exercise would require under then
existing law prior approval of the FCC without first obtaining
such approval and (y) prior to obtaining such approval each
Obligor shall continue to have the right to exercise such rights
(subject to the proviso set forth in Section 4.04(b) hereof), and
(ii) all dividends and other distributions upon or in respect of
the Stock Collateral, and all principal of, interest on and other
amounts in respect of Pledged Debt, shall be paid directly to the

and held by it as part of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement, and, if the Collateral Agent shall so request in
writing, the Obligors shall execute and deliver to the Collateral
Agent appropriate proxies, powers of attorney, dividend,
distribution and other orders, instruments and documents to such
ends.

(f) Subject to Sections 4.04(e) and 5.10 hereof, upon

communications received by it with respect to Stock Collateral
registered in such Obligor's name, as the case may be, and the
Collateral Agent shall promptly give to the respective Obligor,
as the case may be, copies of any notices and communications
received by the Collateral Agent with respect to Stock Collateral
pledged by such Obligor registered in the name of the Collateral
Agent or its agent or nominee. The Collateral Agent shall at all
times have the right to exchange certificates evidencing Stock
Collateral for certificates of smaller or larger denominations

Agreement.

(g) The Collateral Agent shall execute and deliver, or
cause to be executed and delivered, to each Obligor all such
proxies, powers of attorney, dividend, distribution and other
orders, and all such instruments, without recourse, as such
Obligor may reasonably request for the purpose of enabling such
Obligor to exercise the rights and powers which it is entitled to
exercise, or to receive the payments which it is entitled to
receive, pursuant to this Section 4.04.

13

<PAGE>

4.5. General Intangibles.
___________________

(a) For the purpose of enabling the Collateral Agent
to exercise rights and remedies under Section 4.06 hereof at such
time as the Collateral Agent shall be lawfully entitled to
exercise such rights and remedies, and for no other purpose, each
Obligor hereby grants to the Collateral Agent an irrevocable,
non-exclusive license (exercisable without payment of royalty or
other compensation to such Obligor) to use, assign, license or
sublicense any of the general intangibles (as such term is
defined in the Uniform Commercial Code) that constitute
Collateral now owned or hereafter acquired by such Obligor,
wherever the same may be located, including in such license
reasonable access to all media in which any of the licensed items
may be recorded or stored and to all computer programs used for
the compilation or printout thereof.

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, but subject to the provisions of Section 8 of each of
the Loan Documents so long as no Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, each Obligor will be permitted to
exploit, use, enjoy, protect, license, sublicense, assign, sell,
dispose of or take other actions with respect to general
intangibles that constitute Collateral in the ordinary course of
the business of the Obligors. In furtherance of the foregoing,
unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing
the Collateral Agent shall from time to time, upon the reasonable
request of any Obligor, execute and deliver any instruments,
certificates or other documents, in the form so requested but
without any recourse, warranty or representation whatsoever,
which such Obligor shall have certified are appropriate (in its
reasonable judgment) to allow it to take any action permitted
above (including relinquishment of the license provided pursuant
to clause (a) immediately above as to any specific general
intangibles that constitute Collateral). Further, upon the
termination of the obligations of the Obligors hereunder and the
release of the Lien provided for by this Agreement pursuant to
Section 5.05 hereof, the Collateral Agent shall grant back to
each Obligor the license granted pursuant to said clause (a),
without any recourse, warranty or representation whatsoever.

4.6. Events of Default, etc. Subject to Section 5.10
_______________________
hereof, during the period any Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing:

(a) each Obligor shall, at the request of the
Collateral Agent, assemble the Collateral owned by it at

14
<PAGE>

such place or places reasonably designated by the Collateral
Agent in its request;

(b) the Collateral Agent may make any reasonable
compromise or settlement deemed desirable with respect to
any of the Collateral and may extend the time of payment of,
arrange for payment in installments of, or otherwise modify
the terms of, any of the Collateral;

(c) the Collateral Agent shall have all of the rights
and remedies with respect to the Collateral of a secured
party under the Uniform Commercial Code (whether or not said
Code is in effect in the jurisdiction where the rights and
remedies are asserted);

(d) the Collateral Agent in its discretion may, in its
name or in the name of the relevant Obligor or otherwise,
demand, sue for, collect or receive any money or property at
any time payable or receivable on account of or in exchange
for any of the Collateral owned by such Obligor, but shall
be under no obligation to do so; and

(e) the Collateral Agent may, upon five Business Days'
prior written notice to the relevant Obligor of the time and
place, with respect to the Collateral owned by such Obligor
or any part thereof which shall then be or shall thereafter
come into the possession, custody or control of the
Collateral Agent or any of the other Secured Parties, or any
of their respective nominees or agents, sell, lease, assign
or otherwise dispose of all or any part of such Collateral,
at such place or places as the Collateral Agent deems best,
and for cash or on credit or for future delivery (without
thereby assuming any credit risk), at a public or private
sale, without demand of performance or notice of intention
to effect any such disposition or of time or place thereof
(except such notice as is required above or by applicable
law and cannot be waived) and the Collateral Agent or any
other Secured Party or anyone else may be the purchaser,
lessee, assignee or recipient of any or all of such
Collateral so disposed of at any public sale (or, to the
extent permitted by law, at any private sale), and, to the
maximum extent permitted by the law of the State of New York
(or, with respect to Collateral located outside of the State
of New York, to the maximum extent permitted by the law of
the State wherein such Collateral is located) thereafter
hold the same absolutely, free from any claim or right of
whatsoever kind, including any equity of redemption of such
Obligor, any such demand, notice or right and equity being

15

<PAGE>

hereby expressly waived and released, to the maximum extent
permitted by the law of the State of New York (or, with
respect to Collateral located outside of the State of New
York, to the maximum extent permitted by the law of the
State wherein such Collateral is located). The proceeds of
each collection, sale or other disposition under this
Section 4.06, including by virtue of the exercise of the
license granted to the Collateral Agent in Section 4.05(a)
hereof, shall be applied in accordance with Section 4.11
hereof.

4.7. Deficiency. If the proceeds of sale, collection
__________
or other realization of or upon the Collateral are insufficient
to cover the costs and expenses of such realization and the
payment in full of the Secured Obligations of any Obligor, such
Obligor shall remain liable for any deficiency in respect of
which it is obligated hereunder or under any other Basic
Document, as the case may be.

4.8. Removals, etc. Without 30 days' prior written
______________
notice to the Collateral Agent, none of the Obligors shall
maintain any of its books or records with respect to any
Collateral at any office or maintain its chief executive office
or its principal place of business at any place, or permit any
Collateral of such Obligor to be located anywhere other than at
the respective addresses indicated for such Obligor on Schedule
II hereto.

4.9. Private Sale. Subject to Section 4.13 hereof,
____________
each Obligor hereby waives any claims against any Secured Party
arising by reason of the fact that the price at which the
Collateral may have been sold at a private sale was less than the
price which might have been obtained at a public sale or was less
than the aggregate amount of such Obligor's Secured Obligations,
even if the Collateral Agent accepts the first offer received and
does not offer the Collateral to more than one offeree.

4.10. Securities Laws; Registration Rights. The
____________________________________
Company and each other Obligor which is the owner of Stock
Collateral agree that, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, if for any reason the
Collateral Agent desires to sell any of the Stock Collateral at a
public or private sale and in connection with such sale, in the
opinion of the Collateral Agent, no exemption from the
registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act"), is available, it will, upon the written
______________
request of the Collateral Agent, at its own expense:

16

<PAGE>
(a) use its best efforts to cause such Stock
Collateral to be registered under the provisions of the
Securities Act, and to cause the registration statement
relating thereto to become effective and to remain effective
for such period as prospectuses are required by law to be
furnished, and to make all amendments and supplements
thereto and to the related prospectus which, in the opinion
of the Collateral Agent, are necessary or advisable, all in
conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act and
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, or any successor thereto, applicable thereto;

(b) use its best efforts to qualify such Stock
Collateral under state securities or "Blue Sky" laws and to
obtain all necessary governmental approvals for the sale of
such Stock Collateral, as requested by the Collateral Agent;

(c) use its best efforts to cause each "Issuer" of
such Stock Collateral to make available to its security
holders, as soon as practicable, an earnings statement which
will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the
Securities Act; and

(d) use its best efforts to do or cause to be done all
such other acts and things as may be necessary to make such
sale of Stock Collateral or any part thereof valid and
binding and in compliance with applicable law.

Nothing in this Section 4.10 shall in any way alter the rights of
the Collateral Agent or any other Secured Party or the agreements
of each Obligor under Section 4.09 hereof.

4.11. Application of Proceeds. Except as otherwise
_______________________
herein expressly provided, the proceeds of any collection, sale
or other realization of all or any part of the Collateral, and
any other cash at the time held by the Collateral Agent under
this Section 4, shall be applied by the Collateral Agent:

_____
collection, sale or other realization, incurred by the

in respect of expenses or similar amounts, in respect of
which distributions shall be made pursuant to clause Fourth
below);

Fourth, to the ratable payment to the Banks, the Swap
______
Providers and the Agents of all other Secured Obligations to
the extent then due and payable to each of them; and

Finally, after payment in full of all Secured

of the respective Obligors, or their respective successors
or assigns, or to whomsoever else may be lawfully entitled
to receive the same as a court of competent jurisdiction may
direct, of any surplus then remaining from such proceeds
which relate to Collateral furnished by such Obligor.

As used in this Section 4, "proceeds" of Collateral shall mean
________
cash, securities and other property realized in respect of, and
distributions in kind of, Collateral, including any thereof
received under any reorganization, liquidation or adjustment of
debt of any Obligor or any issuer of or obligor on any of the
Collateral.

4.12. Attorney-in-Fact. Without limiting any other
________________
rights or powers granted by this Agreement while no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Collateral
Agent is hereby appointed the attorney-in-fact of each Obligor
for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Section 4
and taking any action and executing any instruments which the
Collateral Agent may deem necessary or advisable to accomplish
the purposes hereof, which appointment as attorney-in-fact is
irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Without limiting the

18
<PAGE>

generality of the foregoing, so long as the Collateral Agent
shall be entitled under this Section 4 to make collections in
respect of the Collateral, the Collateral Agent shall have the
right and power to receive, endorse and collect all checks made
payable to the order of any Obligor representing any dividend,
payment or other distribution in respect of the Collateral or any
part thereof and to give full discharge for the same.

4.13. Certain Rights and Obligations of the Collateral
________________________________________________
Agent and the Secured Parties. The Collateral Agent shall at all

times administer and/or sell or otherwise dispose of the

19

<PAGE>

single or partial exercise by the Collateral Agent or any other

remedies provided by law.

5.5. Release of Collateral. When all Secured
_____________________
Obligations shall have been paid in full and the Commitments of
the Banks under the Credit Agreement each shall have terminated,
the obligations of the Obligors under this Agreement shall

and at the sole expense of the respective Obligors, forthwith

licensee, either de facto or de jure, if such assignment of
________ _______
license or transfer of control would require under then existing
law (including the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, and
published rules and policies of the FCC) the prior approval of
the FCC without first obtaining such prior approval. Each
Obligor agrees to take, and the Company agrees to cause each
other Obligor which holds a FCC License to take, any action that
the Collateral Agent may reasonably request in order to obtain
from the FCC such approval as may be necessary to enable the
Collateral Agent to exercise and enjoy the full rights and
benefits granted to the Collateral Agent by this Agreement and

venue of any such proceeding brought in such a court and any
claim that any such proceeding brought in such a court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.

5.14. Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE OBLIGORS, THE
AGENTS AND THE BANKS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
