Item 5. Other Events

Valuation per Unit of Limited Partnership Interest

The Managing General Partner of the Partnership has estimated the
value per Unit of limited partnership interest at December 31, 1993 to be
$10.40. This value was based on estimated values of the Partnership's real
estate properties by the Managing General Partner, which were reviewed for
reasonableness by Cushman & Wakefield, an independent appraisal firm, with
adjustments for other Partnership assets and liabilities. The estimated
values of the properties do not necessarily reflect the amounts which could
be obtained upon an immediate liquidation of the properties. The value per
Unit does not represent the market price for the Units. In the limited
market for resale of Partnership Units, a seller would most likely receive
a discount to the $10.40 value upon sale of the Unit.

SIGNATURES

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the
undersigned hereunto duly authorized.
