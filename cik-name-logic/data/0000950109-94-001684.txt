RESTATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF
CORESTATES FINANCIAL CORP AND SUBSIDIARIES
(UNAUDITED)

The following unaudited condensed combined financial statements
reflect the restatement for the acquisition of Independence Bancorp, Inc.
("Independence") under the pooling of interests method of accounting ("the
Merger"). Under such method of accounting, the historical book values of the
assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity of Independence, as reported on its
consolidated balance sheet, and modified for intercompany balances, are carried
over onto the consolidated balance sheet of CoreStates and no goodwill or other
intangible assets are created. CoreStates will include in its Consolidated
Statement of Income for the year ending December 31, 1994 the results of
operations of Independence beginning January 1, 1994, as modified for
intercompany transactions and has combined and restated as its income for prior
periods the reported results of operations of Independence for such prior
periods, as modified for intercompany transactions.

The accompanying income statements for the three months ended March
31, 1994 and the year ended December 31, 1993 have been restated subsequent to
the release of March 31, 1994 financial statements to reflect merger-related
charges of $127.8 million after-tax, or $0.89 per share, related to the March
16, 1994 acquisition of Constellation Bancorp ("Constellation") in the first
quarter of 1994, rather than in the fourth quarter of 1993 as previously
reported. This restatement was made after discussions with the Securities and
Exchange Commission staff which resulted in these charges being reflected in the
quarter that the acquisition was consummated. This restatement has no effect on
CoreStates' financial position as reported for either March 31, 1994 or June 30,
1994. The restatement also has no effect on CoreStates' basic operating 
results, excluding the one-time merger-related charges. On a pre-tax basis, the
merger-related charges consisted of a $120.0 million provision for loan losses,
a $28.0 million addition to the OREO reserve, $13.0 million for the writedown of
purchased mortgage servicing rights and related assets, and $34.0 million for
expenses directly attributable to the Constellation acquisition. 

This restated financial information is based on the adjustments set
forth herein and in the notes to such statements. The restated information has
been prepared using the historical consolidated financial statements of both
CoreStates and Independence and should be read in conjunction with such
historical financial statements and notes thereto. Certain amounts have been
reclassified for comparative purposes. The restated condensed combined
financial statements do not purport to be indicative of the combined financial
position or results of operations for future periods or indicative of the
results that actually would have been realized had the entities been combined
during these periods. 

The accompanying unaudited restated financial statements reflect an
equivalent per Independence Common Share value of 1.5 CoreStates Common Shares
which represents the number of CoreStates Common Shares issued upon consummation
of the Merger on June 27, 1994 in exchange for each Independence Common Share
outstanding.

Cash dividends per share declared for the periods presented assume
that CoreStates would have declared cash dividends per share equal to the cash
dividends per share declared by CoreStates prior to December 31, 1993.

Unaudited proforma financial information reflecting CoreStates
proposed business combination with Germantown Savings Bank ("Germantown") is 
presented on pages 13-17. See "Pro Forma Financial Information" on page 12.

(A) Certain amounts have been reclassified for comparative purposes.

(B) Reflects the elimination of intercompany interest on deposits, long-term 
debt and federal funds transactions.

(C) In 1993, Independence retroactively adopted FAS 109 as of January 1, 1987.
Independence's adoption of FAS 109 and the impact of applying pooling of
interests accounting rules had the following effects on restated income 
and period-end common shareholders' equity:

(D) Effective January 1, 1993, CoreStates adopted FAS 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." CoreStates recognized the January
1, 1993 FAS 112 transitional liability of $20.0 million, $13.0 million
after-tax or $0.09 per share, as the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle. The impact of FAS 112 on Independence is immaterial.

(E) Effective January 1, 1992, CoreStates adopted FAS 106, "Employers
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions." CoreStates
elected to recognize immediately the January 1, 1992 transitional liability
of $128.7 million, $84.9 million after-tax or $0.62 per share, as the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The impact of FAS
106 on Independence is immaterial.

(F) During the first quarter of 1994, Independence recognized a $3.4 million
after-tax, or $0.02 per share, impairment loss on certain mortgage 
securities. The loss was the result of a write down to fair value of these
securities which were deemed to be impaired. This resulted from a Financial
Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") interpretation of a 1993 accounting
change, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115. The
interpretation reached by a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task
Force in March 1994 provided more definitive criteria for recognition of
impairment losses on these types of securities.

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION
OF CORESTATES FINANCIAL CORP AND SUBSIDIARIES
(UNAUDITED)

The following unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements
reflect the proposed combination of CoreStates and Germantown Savings Bank
("Proposed Combination") as if it had become effective on January 1, 1993 for
pro forma statement of income presentation and on June 30, 1994 for pro forma
balance sheet presentation. The Proposed Combination will be accounted for, in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as a purchase of
Germantown by CoreStates. Under the purchase method of accounting, all assets
and liabilities of Germantown at June 30, 1994 have been adjusted, net of income
tax effects, to their current fair values and combined with the asset and
liability book values of CoreStates. The Consolidated Balance Sheet and
Statements of Income of CoreStates reflect the restatement for the June 27, 1994
acquisition of Independence Bancorp, Inc. under the pooling of interests method
of accounting as presented on pages 3-11.

This pro forma financial information is based on the estimates and
assumptions set forth in the notes to such statements. The pro forma
adjustments made in connection with the development of the pro forma information
are preliminary and have been made solely for purposes of developing such pro
forma information as necessary to comply with the disclosure requirements of the
Commission. Where applicable, the pro forma adjustments have been separately
tax effected at a 35% statutory rate. The pro forma information has been 
prepared using the historical consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto. The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements do not
purport to be indicative of the combined financial position or results of
operations of future periods or indicative of the results that actually would
have been realized had the entities been a single entity during these periods.

The accompanying unaudited pro forma financial information assumes that
5.399 million CoreStates Common Shares will be issued in the Proposed
Combination. 

Pro forma cash dividends declared for the periods presented assume that
CoreStates would have declared cash dividends per share equal to the cash
dividends per share declared by CoreStates prior to June 30, 1994.

(A) Elimination of intercompany deposits and other intercompany funding.

(B) Reflects charges of approximately $41.9 million, $27.3 million after the
related tax effects, for expenses directly attributable to the Proposed
Combination including $16.1 million to cash out Germantown stock options,
$10.0 million to write down duplicate Germantown facilities and systems and
$9.0 million for employee severance.

(C) Represents the purchase price in the Proposed Combination using the
following assumptions:

1) Shareholders of Germantown will receive, for each of the 4,195,647
Germantown Common Shares outstanding at June 30, 1994, $62 per
share payable 55% in equivalent value CoreStates Common Shares,
45% in cash, for a total purchase price of $260 million. 
2) The market value for CoreStates Common Shares, for purposes of
Germantown pro forma calculations, was assumed to be $26.50 per
share.

3) CoreStates Common Shares issued in the Proposed Combination will
equal 5.399 million shares. 
4) The cash portion of the purchase price was assumed to be raised
through the issuance of seven-year notes at 7 1/4%.
5) The elimination of Germantown's total shareholders' equity at
June 30, 1994 after reduction for the $41.9 million, $15.7
million after-tax, of expenses directly attributable to the
proposed combination.

(D) Represents the estimated adjustments of Germantown's assets and liabilities
to their fair values (which were determined using information available at
the most recent practicable date), the intangible asset related to the
value of the deposit base acquired, which is estimated to be approximately
$28 million ($43 million marked up for deferred taxes as required by FAS
109), and the adjustment of approximately $101 million arising from the
excess of the total purchase price over net assets acquired (i.e.
goodwill).

(A) Reflects the elimination of intercompany interest on long-term debt and
other intercompany funding and intercompany servicing fees.

(B) Reflects the anticipated impact of the purchase accounting adjustments
(which were determined using information available at the most recent
practicable date) assuming the Proposed Combination was effective on
January 1, 1993. For the purposes of determining the effects on the pro
forma combined condensed statements of income, the following pro forma
adjustments have been made (in thousands): 

1) Amortization of the premium on the loan and investment securities
portfolios and certificates of deposit and the related income tax
effects.
2) Amortization of intangibles including goodwill and deposit base
intangible which was calculated using lives of 15 years and 10 years,
respectively. As required by FAS 109, the provision for income taxes
assumes that the amortization of the deposit base intangible is
deductible for Federal income tax purposes.
3) Interest expense on the seven-year 7 1/4% notes which were assumed
issued to fund the cash portion of the purchase price.

(C) Effective January 1, 1993, CoreStates adopted FAS 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." CoreStates recognized the January
1, 1993 FAS 112 transitional liability of $20.0 million, $13.0 million
after-tax or $0.09 per share, as the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle. The impact of FAS 112 on Germantown is immaterial.

(D) During the first quarter of 1994, Independence recognized a $3.4 million
after-tax, or $0.02 per share, impairment loss on certain mortgage
securities. The loss was the result of a write down to fair value of these
securities which were deemed to be impaired. This resulted from a Financial
