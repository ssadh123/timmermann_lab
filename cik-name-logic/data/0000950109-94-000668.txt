HOUGHTON MIFFLIN COMPANY

7 1/8% Notes Due 2004

UNDERWRITING AGREEMENT
----------------------

1. Introductory. Houghton Mifflin Company, a Massachusetts
corporation ("Company"), proposes to issue and sell all of its debt securities
registered under the registration statement referred to in Section 2(a) ("Reg-
istered Securities"). The Registered Securities will be issued under an
indenture, dated as of March 15, 1994 ("Indenture"), between the Company and The
First National Bank of Boston, a national banking association, as Trustee, in
one or more series, which series may vary as to interest rates, maturities,
redemption provisions, selling prices and other terms, with all such terms for
any particular series of the Registered Securities being determined at the time
of sale. Particular series of the Registered Securities will be sold pursuant
to a Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3, for resale in accordance with
terms of offering determined at the time of sale.

The Registered Securities involved in any such offering are
hereinafter referred to as the "Securities". The firm or firms which agree to
purchase the Securities are hereinafter referred to as the "Underwriters" of
such Securities, and the representative or representatives of the Underwriters,
if any, specified in a Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3 are hereinafter
referred to as the "Representatives"; provided, however, that if the Terms
Agreement does not specify any representative of the Underwriters, the term
"Representatives", as used in this Agreement (other than in Sections 2(b), 5(c)
and 6 and the second sentence of Section 3), shall mean the Underwriters.

2. Representations and Warranties of the Company. The Company
represents and warrants to, and agrees with, each Underwriter that:

(a) A registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 33-51700), 
including a prospectus, relating to the Registered Securities has been
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission") and has
become effective. Such registration statement,

1
<PAGE>

as amended at the time of any Terms Agreement referred to in Section 3, is
hereinafter referred to as the "Registration Statement", and the prospectus
included in such Registration Statement, as supplemented as contemplated
by Section 3 to reflect the terms of the Securities and the terms of
offering thereof, as first filed with the Commission pursuant to and in
accordance with Rule 424(b) ("Rule 424(b)") under the Securities Act of
1933 ("Act"), including all material incorporated by reference therein, is
hereinafter referred to as the "Prospectus".

(b) On the effective date of the registration statement 
relating to the Registered Securities, such registration statement
conformed in all re-spects to the requirements of the Act, the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939 ("Trust Indenture Act") and the rules and
regulations of the Commission ("Rules and Regulations") and did not
include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not mis-leading, and on the date of each Terms
Agreement referred to in Section 3, the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus will conform in all respects to the requirements of the Act,
the Trust Indenture Act and the Rules and Regulations, and neither of
such documents will include any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, except that the
foregoing does not apply to statements in or omissions from any of such
documents based upon written information furnished to the Company by any
Underwriter through the Representatives specifically for use therein.

3. Purchase and Offering of Securities. The obligation of the
Underwriters to purchase the Securities will be evidenced by an exchange of
telegraphic or other written communications ("Terms Agreement") at the time the
Company determines to sell the Securities. The Terms Agreement will incorporate
by reference the provisions of this Agreement, except as otherwise provided
therein, and will specify the firm or firms which will be Underwriters, the
names of any Representatives, the principal amount to be purchased by each 
Underwriter, the purchase 

2
<PAGE>

price to be paid by the Underwriters and the terms of the Securities not
already specified in the Indenture, including, but not limited to, interest
rate, maturity, any redemption provisions and any sinking fund requirements
and whether any of the Securities may be sold to institutional investors
pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts (as defined below). The Terms Agreement
will also specify the time and date of delivery and payment (such time and
date, or such other time not later than seven full business days thereafter as
the Representatives and the Company agree as the time for payment and
delivery, being herein and in the Terms Agreement referred to as the "Closing
Date"), the place of delivery and payment and any details of the terms of the
offering that should be reflected in the prospectus supplement relating to the
offering of the Securities. The obligations of the Underwriters to purchase
the Securities will be several and not joint. It is understood that the
Underwriters propose to offer the Securities for sale as set forth in the
Prospectus. The Securities delivered to the Underwriters on the Closing Date
may be represented by a single, global security to be deposited with The
Depository Trust Company or may be in definitive, fully registered form, in
such denominations and registered in such names as the Underwriters may
request.

If the Terms Agreement provides for sales of Securities pursuant to
delayed delivery contracts, the Company authorizes the Underwriters to solicit
offers to purchase Securities pursuant to delayed delivery contracts sub-
stantially in the form of Annex I attached hereto, with such changes therein as
the Company may authorize or approve ("Delayed Delivery Contracts"). Delayed
Delivery Contracts are to be with institutional investors, including commercial
and savings banks, insurance companies, pension funds, investment companies and
educational and charitable institutions. On the Closing Date, the Company will
pay, as compensation, to the Representatives for the accounts of the
Underwriters, the fee set forth in such Terms Agreement in respect of the
principal amount of Securities to be sold pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts
("Contract Securities"). The Underwriters will not have any responsibility in
respect of the validity or the performance of Delayed Delivery Contracts. If
the Company executes and delivers Delayed Delivery Contracts, the Contract
Securities will be deducted from the Securities to be purchased by the 

3
<PAGE>

several Underwriters and the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be
purchased by each Underwriter will be reduced pro rata in proportion to the
principal amount of Securities set forth opposite each Underwriter's name in
such Terms Agreement, except to the extent that the Representatives determine
that such reduction shall be otherwise than pro rata and so advise the
Company. The Company will advise the Representatives not later than the
business day prior to the Closing Date of the principal amount of Contract
Securities.

4. Certain Agreements of the Company. The Company agrees with the several
Underwriters that it will furnish to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom,
counsel for the Underwriters, one signed copy of the registration statement
relating to the Registered Securities, including all exhibits, in the form it
became effective and of all amendments thereto and that, in connection with each
offering of Securities:

(a) The Company will file the Prospectus with the Commission pursuant
to and in accordance with Rule 424(b)(2)(or, if applicable and if consented
to by the Representatives, subparagraph (5)) not later than the second
business day following the execution and delivery of the Terms Agreement.

(b) The Company will advise the Representatives promptly of any
proposal to amend or supplement the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus and will afford the Representatives a reasonable opportunity to
comment on any such proposed amendment or supplement; and the Company will
also advise the Representatives promptly of the filing of any such
amendment or supplement and of the institution by the Commission of any
stop order proceedings in respect of the Registration Statement or of any
part thereof and will use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of any
such stop order and to obtain as soon as possible its lifting, if issued.

(c) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Securities is
required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of
which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would include an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make

4
<PAGE>

the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, or if it is necessary at any time to
amend the Prospectus to comply with the Act, the Company promptly will
prepare and file with the Commission an amendment or supplement which
will correct such statement or omission or an amendment which will effect
such compliance. Neither the Representatives' consent to, nor the
Underwriters' delivery of, any such amendment or supplement shall
constitute a waiver of any of the conditions set forth in Section 5.

(d) As soon as practicable, but not later than 16 months, after the
date of each Terms Agreement, the Company will make generally available to
its securityholders an earnings statement covering a period of at least 12
months beginning after the latest to occur of (i) the effective date of the
registration statement relating to the Registered Securities, (ii) the
effective date of the most recent post-effective amendment to the
Registration Statement to become effective prior to the date of such Terms
Agreement and (iii) the date of the Company's most recent Annual Report on
Form 10-K filed with the Commission prior to the date of such Terms
Agreement, which will satisfy the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act.

(e) The Company will furnish to the Representatives copies of the
Registration Statement, including all exhibits, any related preliminary
prospectus, any related preliminary prospectus supplement, the Prospectus
and all amendments and supplements to such documents, in each case as soon
as available and in such quantities as are reasonably requested.

(f) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Securities
for sale and the determination of their eligibility for investment under
the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives designate and will
continue such qualifications in effect so long as required for the
distribution; provided, however, that nothing herein shall require the
-------- ------- 
Company to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not now
so qualified or to take 

5
<PAGE>

any action that would subject it to general service of process in any
jurisdiction where it is not now so subject.

(g) During the period of five years after the date of any Terms
Agreement, the Company will, upon request, furnish to the Representatives
and to each of the other Underwriters, if any, as soon as practicable
after the end of each fiscal year, a copy of its annual report to
stockholders for such year; and the Company will, upon request, furnish to
the Representatives (i) as soon as available, a copy of each report or
definitive proxy statement of the Company filed with the Commission under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or mailed to stockholders, and (ii)
from time to time, such other information concerning the Company as the
Representatives may reasonably request.

(h) The Company will pay all expenses incident to the performance of
its obligations under this Agreement and will reimburse the Underwriters
for any expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel)
incurred by them in connection with qualification of the Registered
Securities for sale and determination of their eligibility for investment
under the laws of such jurisdictions as the Representatives may designate
and the printing of memoranda relating thereto, for any fees charged by
investment rating agencies for the rating of the Securities and for
expenses incurred in distributing the Prospectus, any preliminary
prospectuses and any preliminary prospectus supplements to Underwriters.

(i) For a period beginning at the time of execution of the Terms
Agreement and ending 30 days after the Closing Date, without the prior
consent of the Representatives, the Company will not offer, sell, contract
to sell or otherwise dispose of any United States dollar-denominated debt
securities issued or guaranteed by the Company and having a maturity of
more than one year from the date of issue.

5. Conditions of the Obligations of the Underwriters. The obligations of
the several Underwriters to purchase and pay for the Securities will be subject
to 

6
<PAGE>

the accuracy of the representations and warranties on the part of the Company
herein, to the accuracy of the statements of Company officers made pursuant
to the provisions hereof, to the performance by the Company of its obliga-
tions hereunder and to the following additional conditions precedent:

(a) On or prior to the date of the Terms Agreement, the
Representatives shall have received letters, dated the date of delivery
thereof, of Ernst & Young (with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries
(the "Subsidiaries") (other than McDougal, Littell & Company, a Delaware
corporation ("McDougal, Littell"))) and Crowe Chizek and Company (with
respect to McDougal Littell), substantially in the form principally agreed
upon on March 22, 1994.

(b) The Prospectus shall have been filed with the Commission in
accordance with the Rules and Regulations and Section 4(a) of this
Agreement. No stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and no proceedings for
that purpose shall have been instituted or, to the knowledge of the Company
or any Underwriter, shall be contemplated by the Commission.

(c) Subsequent to the execution of the Terms Agreement, there shall
not have occurred: (i) any change, or any development involving a
prospective change, in or affecting particularly the business or properties
of the Company or its Subsidiaries which, in the judgment of a majority in
interest of the Underwriters, including any Representatives, materially
impairs the investment quality of the Securities or the Registered
Securities; (ii) any down-grading in the rating of any debt securities of
the Company by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization"
(as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Act), or any public
announce-ment that any such organization has under surveillance or review
its rating of any debt securities of the Company (other than an
announcement with positive implications of a possible upgrading, and no
implication of a possible downgrading, of such rating); (iii) any
suspension or limitation of trading in securities generally on the 
New York 

7
<PAGE>

Stock Exchange, or any setting of minimum prices for trading on such
exchange, or any suspension of trading of any securities of the Company
on any exchange or in the over-the-counter market; (iv) any banking
moratorium declared by federal or New York authorities; or (v) any
outbreak or escalation of major hostilities in which the United States is
involved, any declaration of war by Congress or any other substantial
national or international calamity or emergency if, in the judgment of a
majority in interest of the Underwriters, including any Representatives,
the effect of any such outbreak, escalation, declaration, calamity or
emergency makes it impractical or inadvisable to proceed with completion
of the sale of and payment for the Securities.

(d) The Representatives shall have received an opinion, dated the
Closing Date, of Goodwin, Procter & Hoar, counsel for the Company, or Paul
D. Weaver, Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the Company, to the

their business as described in the Prospectus;

(ii) The Company and the Subsidiaries are duly qualified to do
business as foreign corporations in good standing in all other

which the conduct of their business requires such qualification,
except where the failure to so qualify would not have a material
adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole;

(iii) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by the Company and has been duly qualified under the Trust
Indenture Act; the Securities have been duly authorized; the

8
<PAGE>

Indenture and sold pursuant to Delayed Delivery Contracts, will
constitute, valid and legally binding obligations of the Company
enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights and to general equity principles; and the
Securities other than any Contract Securities conform, and any
Contract Securities, when so issued and delivered and sold, will
conform, to the description thereof contained in the Prospectus ;

(iv) No consent, approval, authorization or order of, or filing
with, any governmental agency or body or any court is required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Terms Agreement
(including the provisions of this Agreement) in connection with the
issuance or sale of the Securities by the Company, except such as
have been obtained and made under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act
and such as may be required under state securities laws;

(v) The execution, delivery and performance of the Indenture,
the Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this Agreement) and
any Delayed Delivery Contracts and the issuance and sale of the
Securities and compliance with the terms and provisions thereof will
not result in a breach or violation of any of the terms and provisions
of, or constitute a default under, any statute, any rule, regulation
or order of any governmental agency or body or any court having
jurisdiction over the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their prop-
erties or any agreement or instrument to which the Company or any such
Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any such Subsidiary
is bound or to which any of the properties of the Company or any such
Subsidiary is subject, 

9

sell the Securities as contemplated by the Terms Agreement
(including the provisions of this Agreement);

(vi) The Registration Statement has become effective under the
Act, the Prospectus was filed with the Commission pursuant to the sub-
paragraph of Rule 424(b) specified in such opinion on the date
specified therein, and, to the best knowledge of such counsel, no stop
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or
of any part thereof has been issued and no proceedings for that
purpose have been instituted or are pending or contemplated under the
Act, and the registration statement relating to the Registered Securi-
ties, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement and the
Prospectus, as of the date of the Terms Agreement, and any amendment
or supplement thereto, as of its date, complied as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Act, the Trust
Indenture Act and the Rules and Regulations; and

(vii) The Terms Agreement (including the provisions of this
Agreement) and any Delayed Delivery Contracts have been duly
authorized, executed and delivered by the Company.

In addition, such counsel shall state that such counsel have no reason to
believe that such registration statement, as of its effective date, the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as of the date of the Terms Agreement,
or any such amendment or supplement, as of its date, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;
the descriptions in the Registration Statement and Prospectus of statutes, legal
and governmental proceedings and contracts and other documents are accurate and
fairly present the information required to be shown; and such counsel do not
know of any legal or governmental proceedings required to be described in the

10
<PAGE>

contracts or documents of a character required to be described in the
Registration Statement or Prospectus or to be filed as exhibits to the
Registration Statement which are not described and filed as required; it being
understood that such counsel need express no opinion as to the financial
statements or other financial data contained in the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus.

(e) The Representatives shall have received from Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher & Flom, counsel for the Underwriters, such opinion or
opinions, dated the Closing Date, with respect to the incorporation of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, the validity of the Securities, the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus and other related matters as they
may require, and the Company shall have furnished to such counsel such
documents as they request for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon
such matters. In rendering such opinion, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &
Flom may rely as to the incorporation of the Company and all other matters
governed by Massachusetts law upon the opinion of Goodwin, Procter & Hoar
referred to above.

(f) The Representatives shall have received a certificate, dated the
Closing Date, of the President or any Vice-President and a principal
financial or accounting officer of the Company in which such officers, to
the best of their knowledge after reasonable investigation, shall state
that the representations and warranties of the Company in this Agreement
are true and correct, that the Company has complied with all agreements
and satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied
hereunder at or prior to the Closing Date, that no stop order suspending
the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or of any part thereof has
been issued and no proceedings for that purpose have been instituted or are
contemplated by the Commission and that, subsequent to the date of the
most recent financial statements in the Prospectus, there has been no
material adverse change in the financial position or results of operation
of the Company and its Subsidiaries except as set forth in or contemplated
by the Prospectus or as described in such certificate.

11
<PAGE>

(g) The Representatives shall have received letters, dated the Closing
Date, of Ernst & Young (with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
other than McDougal, Littell) and Crowe Chizek and Company (with respect to
McDougal, Littell), which reconfirm the matters set forth in their letters
delivered pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section and, in addition to
such other matters as the Representatives may reasonably request, state in
effect that:

(i) in their opinion, any financial statements or schedules
examined by them and included in the Prospectus and not covered by
their letters delivered pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section
comply in form in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements of the Act and the related published Rules and
Regulations;

(ii) they have made a review of any unaudited financial
statements included in the Prospectus and not covered by their letters
delivered pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section in accordance
with standards established by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, as indicated in their report or reports attached
to such letters;

(iii) on the basis of the review referred to in (ii) above, a
reading of the latest available interim financial statements of the
Company or McDougal, Littell, inquiries of officials of the Company or
McDougal, Littell who have responsibility for financial and ac-
counting matters and other specified procedures, nothing came to
their attention that caused them to believe that:

(A) the unaudited financial statements, if any, included in
the Prospectus and not covered by their letters delivered
pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section do not comply in form
in all material respects with the applicable accounting
requirements of the Act and the related published Rules and
Regulations or are not

12
<PAGE>

in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles
applied on a basis substantially consistent with that of the
audited financial statements included in the Prospectus; or

(B) the unaudited capsule information, if any, included in
the Prospectus does not agree with the amounts set forth in the
unaudited consolidated financial statements from which it was
derived or was not determined on a basis substantially
consistent with that of the audited financial statements included
in the Prospectus; and

(iv) they have compared specified dollar amounts (or percentages
derived from such dollar amounts) and other financial information
included in the Prospectus and not covered by their letters delivered
pursuant to subsection (a) of this Section (in each case to the extent
that such dollar amounts, percentages and other financial information
are derived from the general accounting records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries subject to the internal controls of the Company's or
McDougal, Littell's accounting system or are derived directly from
such records by analysis or computation) with the results obtained
from inquiries, a reading of such general accounting records and other
procedures specified in such letters and have found such dollar
amounts, percentages and other financial information to be in
agreement with such results, except as otherwise specified in such
letters.

All financial statements and schedules included in material incorporated by
reference into the Prospectus shall be deemed included in the Prospectus for the
purposes of this subsection.

The Company will furnish the Representatives with such conformed copies of such
opinions, certificates, letters and documents as they reasonably request.

6. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The

13
<PAGE>

Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter against any
losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which such
Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as
such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration
Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any
related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus supplement, or
arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state
therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, and will reimburse each
Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such loss,
claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are incurred;
provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case
(i) to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises
out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
in or omission or alleged omission from any of such documents in reliance
upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company
by any Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for
use therein or (ii) if (A) any such loss, claim, damage or liability
arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission made in any of such documents,
(B) such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission is corrected in any amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement or the Prospectus, (C) the Company shall have
performed each of its obligations under Article VI in respect of such
amendment or supplement and (D) such Underwriter, having been furnished
by or on behalf of the Company with copies of the Prospectus as so
amended or supplemented, thereafter fails to deliver such amended or
supplemented Prospectus prior to or concurrently with the sale of
Securities to the person asserting such loss, claim, damage or liability
who purchased such Securities from such Underwriter.

14
<PAGE>

(b) Each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, agrees to indemnify
and hold harmless the Company against any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities to which the Company may become subject, under the Act or
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the
Registration Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement
thereto, or any related preliminary prospectus or preliminary prospectus
supplement, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or the alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in each case to
the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance upon
and in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such
Underwriter through the Representatives, if any, specifically for use
therein, and will reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably in-
curred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any
such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such expenses are
incurred.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section
6 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party
will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying
party under subsection (a) or (b) above, notify the indemnifying party of
the commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying
party will not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any
indemnified party otherwise than under subsection (a) or (b) above except
to the extent the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure
to give notice. In case any such action is brought against any indemnified
party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof,
the indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the
extent that it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel satisfacto-
ry to such indemnified party (who shall not, except

15
<PAGE>

with the consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying
party), and after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified
party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying
party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section 6(c)
for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation.

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 6 is
unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under
subsection (a) or (b) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute
to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the
losses, claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a) or (b)
above (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative
benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters on
the other from the offering of the Securities or (ii) if the allocation
provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits
referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company
on the one hand and the Underwriters on the other in connection with the
statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the
Underwriters on the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as
the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses)
received by the Company bear to the total underwriting discounts and
commissions received by the Underwriters. The relative fault shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
Company or the Underwriters and the parties' relative intent, knowledge,
access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue
statement or omission. The amount paid by an indemnified party as a result
of the losses,

16
<PAGE>

claims, damages or liabilities referred to in the first sentence of this
Section 6(d) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating or defending any action or claim which is the subject of this
Section 6(d). Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 6(d), no
Underwriter shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the
amount by which the total price at which the Securities underwritten by it
and distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount
of any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay
by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution
from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.
The Underwriters' obligations in this Section 6(d) to contribute are
several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and not
joint.

(e) The obligations of the Company under this Section shall be in
addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall
extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who
controls any Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations
of the Underwriters under this Section shall be in addition to any
liability which the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall
extend, upon the same terms and conditions, to each director of the Compa-
ny, to each officer of the Company who has signed the Registration
Statement and to each person, if any, who controls the Company within the
meaning of the Act.

(f) The information set forth in the last paragraph on the front
cover page (insofar as such information relates to the Underwriters), under
"Plan of Distribution" and "Underwriting" and the final sentence of "Use of
Proceeds" in the Prospectus constitutes the only information furnished by
the Underwriters to the Company for inclusion in the Prospectus or the
Registration Statement, and the Representatives, on behalf of the
respective Under-

17
<PAGE>

writers, represent and warrant to the Company that the statements made
therein are materially true and correct and do not omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading.

(g) The parties to this Agreement hereby acknowledge that they are
sophisticated business persons who were represented by counsel during the
negotiations regarding the provisions hereof, including without limitation
the provisions of this Section 6, and are fully informed regarding said
provisions. They further acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 6
fairly allocate the risks in light of the ability of the parties to
investigate the Company and its business in order to assure that adequate
disclosure is made in the Registration Statement and Prospectus as required
by the Act. The parties are advised that federal or state public policy,
as interpreted by the courts in certain jurisdictions, may be contrary to
certain of the provisions of this Section 6, and the parties hereto hereby
expressly waive and relinquish any right or ability to assert such public
policy as a defense to a claim under this Section 6 and further agree not
to attempt to assert any such defense.

7. Default of Underwriters. If any Underwriter or Underwriters default in
their obligations to purchase Securities under the Terms Agreement and the
aggregate principal amount of the Securities that such defaulting Underwriter or
Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase does not exceed 10% of the total
principal amount of the Securities, the Representatives may make arrangements
satisfactory to the Company for the purchase of such Securities by other
persons, including any of the Underwriters, but if no such arrangements are
made by the Closing Date, the non-defaulting Underwriters shall be obligated
severally, in proportion to their respective commitments under this Agreement
and the Terms Agreement, to purchase the Securities that such defaulting Under-
writers agreed but failed to purchase. If any Underwriter or Underwriters so
default and the aggregate principal amount of the Securities with respect to
which such default or defaults occur exceeds 10% of the total principal amount
of the Securities and arrangements satisfac-

18
<PAGE>

tory to the Representatives and the Company for the purchase of such Securities
by other persons are not made within 36 hours after such default, such Terms
Agreement will terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting
Underwriter or the Company, except as provided in Section 8. As used in this
Agreement, the term "Underwriter" includes any person substituted for an Under-
writer under this Section. Nothing herein will relieve a defaulting Underwriter
from liability for its default. The respective commitments of the several
Underwriters for the purposes of this Section shall be determined without regard
to reduction in the respective Underwriters' obligations to purchase the
principal amounts of the Securities set forth opposite their names in the Terms
Agreement as a result of Delayed Delivery Contracts entered into by the Company.

The foregoing obligations and agreements set forth in this Section will not
apply if the Terms Agreement specifies that such obligations and agreements will
not apply.

8. Survival of Certain Representations and Obligations. The respective
indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of
the Company or its officers and of the several Underwriters set forth in or made
pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of
any investigation, or statement as to the results thereof, made by or on behalf
of any Underwriter, the Company or any of their respective representatives,
officers or directors or any controlling person and will survive delivery of
and payment for the Securities. If the Terms Agreement is terminated pursuant
to Section 7 or if for any reason the purchase of the Securities by the
Underwriters under the Terms Agreement is not consummated, the Company shall
remain responsible for the expenses to be paid or reimbursed by it pursuant to
Section 4 and the respective obligations of the Company and the Underwriters
pursuant to Section 6 shall remain in effect. If the purchase of the Securi-
ties by the Underwriters is not consummated for any reason other than solely
because of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7 or the
occurrence of any event specified in clause (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) of Section
5(c), the Company will reimburse the Underwriters for all out-of-pocket expenses
(including fees and dis-

19
<PAGE>

bursements of counsel) reasonably incurred by them in connection with the
offering of the Securities.

9. Notices. All communications hereunder will be in writing and, if sent
to the Underwriters, will be mailed, delivered or telegraphed and confirmed to
them at their addresses furnished to the Company in writing for the purpose of
communications hereunder or, if sent to the Company, will be mailed, delivered
or telegraphed and confirmed to it at 222 Berkeley Street, Boston, Massachu-
setts 02116, Attention: Paul D. Weaver, General Counsel.

10. Successors. This Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the Company and such Underwriters as are identified in Terms
Agreements and their respective successors and the officers and directors and
controlling persons referred to in Section 6, and no other person will have any
right or obligation hereunder.

11. Applicable Law. This Agreement and the Terms Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York.

any provision of this Indenture, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee an
Officers' Certificate stating that all conditions precedent, if any, provided
for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action have been complied with
and an Opinion of Counsel stating that in the opinion of such counsel all such
conditions precedent, if any, have been complied with, except that in the case
of any such application or request as to which the furnishing of such documents
is specifically required by any provision of this Indenture relating to such
particular application or request, no additional certificate or opinion need be
furnished.

Every certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a condition
or covenant provided for in this Indenture except for certificates provided for
in Section 1009 shall include:

(1) a statement that each individual signing such certificate or
opinion has read such covenant or condition and the definitions herein
relating thereto;

(2) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination
or investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in such

(4) a statement as to whether, in the opinion of each such

SECTION 103. Form of Documents Delivered to Trustee.
-------------------------------------- 

In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or

such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such
Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one
such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one
or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify
or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.

Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Company may be based,
insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or
representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of
reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations
with respect to the matters upon which his certificate or opinion is based are
erroneous. Any such certificate or Opinion of Counsel may be based, insofar as
it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representa-
tions by, an officer or officers of the Company stating that the information
with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Company, unless
such counsel knows that the certificate or opinion or representations with
respect to such matters are erroneous.

Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more
applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other
instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and
form one instrument.

SECTION 104. Acts of Holders.
--------------- 

(a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or other action provided or

12
<PAGE>

permitted by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders may be embodied in
and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed
by such Holders in person or by an agent duly appointed in writing. Except as
herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become effective when
such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is
herein expressly required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments and
any such record (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are
herein sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such
instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a
writing appointing any such agent or proxy, or of the holding by any Person of a
Security, shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to
Section 601) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if made in the
manner provided in this Section.

(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such
instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such
execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer authorized by
law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the individual signing
such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where
such execution is by a signer acting in a capacity other than his individual
capacity, such certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof
of his authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or
writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be proved
in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.

(c) The principal amount and serial numbers of Registered Securities
held by any Person, and the date of holding the same, shall be proved by the
Security Register.

(d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind every future Holder
of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon the
registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof in
respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the
Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of

13
<PAGE>

such action is made upon such Security. Nothing in this Section 104(d) shall be
construed to limit the right of Holders to take action which shall bind Holders
of all Securities as expressly provided herein.

(e) With respect to the Securities of any Series all or part of which
are represented by Book-Entry Securities, the following provisions shall apply:

(1) Upon receipt by the Trustee of (i) any written notice directing
the time, method or place of conducting any proceeding or exercising any
trust or power pursuant to Section 512 with respect to Securities of such
series or (ii) any written demand, request or notice with respect to any
matter on which the Holders of Securities of such series are entitled to
act under this Indenture, in each case from Holders of less than, or
proxies representing less than, the requisite principal amount of
Outstanding Securities or such series entitled to give such demand, request
or notice, the Trustee shall establish a record date for determining
Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series entitled to join in such
demand, request or notice, which record date shall be the close of business
on the day the Trustee received such demand, request or notice. The
Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only
such Persons, shall be entitled to join in such demand, request or notice
whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record date; provid-
ed, however, that unless the Holders of the requisite principal amount of
Outstanding Securities of such series shall have joined in such demand,
request or notice prior to the day which is the 90th day after such record
date, such demand, request or notice shall automatically and without
further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect. Nothing
in this paragraph shall prevent a Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from
giving, (i) after the expiration of such 90-day period, a new demand,
request or notice identical to a demand, request or notice which has been
canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence or

14
<PAGE>

(ii) during any such 90-day period, a new demand, request or notice which
has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence or
(iii) during any such 90-day period, a new demand, request or notice
contrary to or different from such demand, request or notice, in either of
which events a new record date shall be established pursuant to the
provisions of this clause (1).

(2) The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, direct the
Trustee to establish a record date for the purpose of determining the
Persons entitled to (i) waive any past default with respect to the
Securities of such series in accordance with Section 513 of the Indenture,
(ii) consent to any supplemental indenture in accordance with Section 902
of the Indenture or (iii) waive any term, condition or provision of any
covenant in accordance with Section 1010 of the Indenture. If a record
date is fixed, the Holders on such record date, or their duly designated
proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to waive any such past
default, consent to any such supplemental indenture or waive any such term,
condition or provision, whether or not such Holder remains a Holder after
such record date; provided, however, that unless such waiver or consent is
obtained from the Holders, or duly designed proxies, of the requisite
principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series prior to the
date which is the 90th day after such record date, any such waiver or
consent previously given shall automatically and without further action by
any Holder be canceled and of no further effect.

(f) The Company may, in the circumstances permitted by the Trust
Indenture Act, set any day as the record date for the purpose of determining the
Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to give or take any
request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other
action provided or permitted by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders
of Securities of such series. With regard to any record date set pursuant to
this paragraph, the Holders

15
<PAGE>

of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on such record date (or their
duly appointed agents), and only such Persons, shall be entitled to give or take
the relevant action, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such
record date. With regard to any action that may be given or taken hereunder
only by Holders of a requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of any
series (or their duly appointed agents) and for which a record date is set
pursuant to this paragraph, the Company may, at its option, set an expiration
date after which no such action purported to be given or taken by any Holder
shall be effective hereunder unless given or taken on or prior to such
expiration date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding
Securities of such series on such record date (or their duly appointed agents).
On or prior to any expiration date set pursuant to this paragraph, the Company
may, on one or more occasions at its option, extend such date to any later date.
Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent any Holder (or any duly appointed agent
thereof) from giving or taking, after any expiration date, any action identical
to, or, at any time, contrary to or different from, any action given or taken,
or purported to have been given or taken, hereunder by a Holder on or prior to
such date, in which event the Company may set a record date in respect thereof
pursuant to this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing or the Trust Inden-
ture Act, the Company shall not set a record date for, and the provisions of
this paragraph shall not apply with respect to, any action to be given or taken
by Holders pursuant to Section 501, 502 or 512.

SECTION 105. Notices, Etc., to Trustee and Company.
------------------------------------- 

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or
Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this Indenture to be
made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,

(1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company shall be sufficient
for every purpose hereunder if made, given, furnished or filed in writing
to or with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Houghton
Mifflin Company 1992 Indenture, or

<PAGE>

(2) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient
for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided)
if in writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to the Company
addressed to it at the address of its principal office specified in the
first paragraph of this instrument, to the attention of its Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer and its Secretary and Clerk, or at
any other address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the
Company.

SECTION 106. Notice to Holders of Securities; Waiver.
--------------------------------------- 

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, where this Indenture
provides for notice to Holders of Securities of any event, such notice shall be
sufficiently given to holders of Registered Securities if in writing and mailed,
first-class postage prepaid, to each Holder of a Registered Security affected by
such event, at the address of such Holder as it appears in the Security
Register, not earlier than the earliest date, and not later than the latest
date, prescribed for the giving of such notice.

In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail service or by reason of
any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice to Holders of
Registered Securities by mail, then such notification as shall be made with the
approval of the Trustee shall constitute sufficient notice to such Holders for
every purpose hereunder. In any case where notice to Holders of Registered
Securities is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any
defect in any notice so mailed, to any particular Holder of a Registered
Security shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect to other
Holders of Registered Securities.

Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be
waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either before
or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice.
Waivers of notice by Holders of Securities shall be filed with the Trustee, but
such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action
taken in reliance upon such waiver.

ARTICLE II

SECURITY FORMS

SECTION 201. Forms Generally.
--------------- 

The Registered Securities, if any, of each series shall be in substantially
the forms set forth in Exhibits A or B to this Indenture, or in such other form
(including temporary or permanent global form) as shall be established by or
pursuant to a Board Vote or in one or more indentures supplemental hereto, in
each case with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other
variations as are required or permitted by this Indenture, and may have such
letters, numbers or other marks of identification and such legends or
endorsements placed thereon as may be required to comply with the rules of any
securities exchange or as may, consistently herewith, be determined by the
officers executing such Securities, as evidenced by their execution of the Secu-
rities. If temporary Securities of any series are issued in global form as
permitted by Section 304, the form thereof shall be established as provided in
the preceding sentence. If the forms of Securities of any series (or any such
temporary global Security) are established by action taken pursuant to a Board
Vote, a copy of an appropriate record of such action shall be certified by

19
<PAGE>

the Secretary and Clerk or by an Assistant Clerk of the Company and delivered to
the Trustee at or prior to the delivery of the Company Order contemplated by
Section 303 for the authentication and delivery of such Securities (or any such
temporary global Security).

The definitive Securities shall be printed, lithographed or engraved on
steel engraved borders or may be produced in any other manner, all as determined
by the officers executing such Securities as evidenced by their execution of
such Securities.

SECTION 202. Form of Trustee's Certificate of Authentication.
------------------------------------------------ 

The Trustee's certificates of authentication shall be in substantially the
following form:

Authorized Signatory

SECTION 203. Securities in Global Form.
------------------------- 

If Securities of a series are issuable in global form, as contemplated by
Section 301, then, notwithstanding clause (11) of Section 301 and the
provisions of Section 302, any such Security shall represent such of the
Outstanding Securities of such series as shall be specified therein and may
provide that it shall represent the aggregate amount of Outstanding Securities
from time to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate amount of Outstanding
Securities represented thereby may from time to time be reduced to reflect
exchanges. Any endorsement of a Security in global form to reflect the amount,
or any increase or decrease in the amount, of Outstanding Securities represented
thereby shall be made by the Trustee in such manner and upon instructions given
by such Person or Persons as shall be specified therein or

20
<PAGE>

in the Company Order to be delivered to the Trustee pursuant to Section 303 or
Section 304. Subject to the provisions of Section 303 and, if applicable,
Section 304, the Trustee shall deliver and redeliver any Security in permanent
global form in the manner and upon instructions given by the Person or Persons
specified therein or in the applicable Company Order. If a Company Order
pursuant to Section 303 or 304 has been, or simultaneously is, delivered, any
instructions by the Company with respect to endorsement or delivery or
redelivery of a Security in global form shall be in writing but need not comply
with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel.

The provisions of the last sentence of Section 303 shall apply to any
security represented by a Security in global form if such Security was never
issued and sold by the Company and the Company delivers to the Trustee the
Security in global form together with written instructions (which need not
comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel)
with regard to the reduction in the principal amount of Securities represented
thereby, together with the written statement contemplated by the last sentence
of Section 303.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 201 and 307, unless otherwise
specified as contemplated by Section 301, payment of principal of and any
premium and interest on any Security in permanent global form shall be made to
the Person or Persons specified therein.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 308 and except as provided in the
preceding paragraph, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company and
the Trustee shall treat a Person as the Holder of such principal amount of
Outstanding Securities represented by a permanent global Security as shall be
specified in a written statement of the Holder of such permanent global
Security.

SECTION 204. Form of Legend for Book-Entry Securities.
---------------------------------------- 

Any Book-Entry Security authenticated and delivered hereunder shall bear a
legend in substantially the following form:

21
<PAGE>

"This Security is a Book-Entry Security within the meaning of the Indenture
hereinafter referred to and is registered in the name of a Depository or a
nominee of a Depository. This Security is exchangeable for Securities
registered in the name of a Person other than the Depository or its nominee
only in the limited circumstances described in the Indenture, and no transfer of
this Security (other than a transfer of this Security as a whole by the
Depository to a nominee of the Depository or by a nominee of the Depository to
the Depository or another nominee of the Depository) may be registered except in
such limited circumstances."

SECTION 205. Additional Provisions Required in Global Security.
------------------------------------------------- 

Any Global Security issued hereunder shall, in addition to the provisions
contained in Sections 202 and 203, bear a legend in substantially the following
form:

"This Security is a Global Security within the meaning of the Indenture
hereinafter referred to and is registered in the name of a Depository or a
nominee of a Depository. This Security is exchangeable for Securities
registered in the name of a person other than the Depository or its nominee
only in the limited circumstances described in the Indenture and may not be
transferred except as a whole by the Depository to a nominee of the Depository
or by a nominee of the Depository to the Depository or another nominee of the
Depository."

(15) if either or both of the provisions of Section 403 or 1011 are

Officers' Certificate setting forth the terms of the series.

SECTION 302. Denominations.
------------- 

Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to
any series of Securities, any Registered Securities of a series shall be
issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.

SECTION 303. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
---------------------------------------------- 

The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman
of the Board and President or one of its Vice Presidents, under its corporate
seal reproduced thereon attested by its Secretary and Clerk or one of its
Assistant Clerks. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities may
be manual or facsimile.

Securities bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who
were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind the Company,
notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such
offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not
hold such offices at the date of such Securities.

At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this
Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series executed by the
Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for
the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in
accordance with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such
Securities.

If the forms or terms of the Securities of the series have been established
in or pursuant to one or more Board Votes as permitted by Sections 201 and 301,
in authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional
responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the
Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Section 601) shall be
fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating:

26
<PAGE>

(a) if the forms of such Securities have been established by or
pursuant to Board Vote as permitted by Section 201, that such forms have been
established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;

(b) if the terms of such Securities have been established by or
pursuant to Board Vote as permitted by Section 301, that such terms have been
established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and

(c) that such Securities, when authenticated and delivered by the
Trustee and issued by the Company in the manner and subject to any conditions
specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and legally binding
obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms,
subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other
laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights and to general equity principles.

If such forms or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not be
required to authenticate such Securities if the issue or such Securities
pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties or
immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner
which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the two preceding
paragraphs, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one
time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise
required pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel
otherwise required pursuant to such preceding paragraphs at or prior to the time
of authentication of each Security of such series if such documents are
delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first
Security of such series to be issued.

Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.

No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture or be
valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a
certificate of

27
<PAGE>

authentication substantially in the form provided for herein executed by the
Trustee by manual signature, and such certificate upon any Security shall be
conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly
authenticated and delivered hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any
Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued
and sold by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the
Trustee for cancellation as provided in Section 309 together with a written
statement (which need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied
by an Opinion of Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and
sold by the Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be
deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never
be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.

SECTION 304. Temporary Securities.
-------------------- 

Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series, the Company
may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver,
temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten,
mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination,
substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they
are issued, in registered form and with such appropriate insertions, omissions,
substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may
determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.

Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form (which shall be
exchanged in accordance with the provisions of the following paragraphs), if
temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive
Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the
preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of
such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon
surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of
the Company maintained pursuant to Section 1002 in a Place of Payment for such
series for the purpose of exchanges of Securities of such series, without charge
to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary
Securities of any series the Company

28
<PAGE>

shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange
therefor a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same
series and of like tenor of authorized denominations.

If temporary Securities of any series are issued in global form, any such
temporary global Security shall, unless otherwise provided therein, be delivered
to the London office of a depository or common depository (the "Common
Depository"), for the benefit of Euro-clear and CEDEL S.A., for credit to the
respective accounts of the beneficial owners of such Securities (or to such
other accounts as they may direct).

Without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the date
specified in, or determined pursuant to the terms of, any such temporary global
Security (the "Exchange Date"), the Company shall deliver to the Trustee
definitive Securities of that series, in aggregate principal amount equal to
the principal amount of such temporary global Security, executed by the
Company. On or after the Exchange Date such temporary global Security shall be
surrendered by the Common Depository to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for
such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for
definitive Securities of such series without charge and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, in exchange for each portion of such temporary global
Security, a like aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same
series of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such
temporary global Security to be exchanged; provided, however, that, unless
otherwise specified in such temporary global Security, upon such presentation by
the Common Depository, such temporary global Security is accompanied by a
certificate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by Euro-
clear as to the portion of such temporary global Security held for its account
then to be exchanged and a certificate dated the Exchange Date or a subsequent
date and signed by CEDEL S.A. as to the portion of such temporary global
Security held for its account then to be exchanged each in the form set forth in
Exhibit C.2 to this Indenture. The definitive Securities to be delivered in
exchange for any such temporary global Security shall be in registered form or
permanent global registered form, or any combination thereof, as specified as
contemplated by Section 301, and, if any combination

29
<PAGE>

thereof is so specified, as requested by the beneficial owner thereof.

Unless otherwise specified in such temporary global Security, the interest
of a beneficial owner of Securities of a series in a temporary global Security
shall be exchanged for definitive Securities of the same series and of like
tenor following the Exchange Date when the account holder instructs Euro-clear
or CEDEL S.A., as the case may be, to request such exchange on its behalf and
delivers to Euro-clear or CEDEL S.A., as the case may be, a certificate in the
form set forth in Exhibit C.1 to this Indenture, dated no earlier than 15 days
prior to the Exchange Date, copies of which certificate shall be available from
the offices of Euro-clear and CEDEL S.A., the Trustee, any Authenticating Agent
appointed for such series of Securities and each Paying Agent. Unless otherwise
specified in such temporary global Security, any such exchange shall be made
free of charge to the beneficial owners of such temporary global Security,
except that a Person receiving definitive Securities must bear the cost of
insurance, postage, transportation and the like in the event that such Person
does not take delivery of such definitive Securities in person at the offices of
Euro-clear or CEDEL S.A.

Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, the temporary Securities
of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this
Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor
authenticated and delivered hereunder, except that, unless otherwise specified
as contemplated by section 301, interest payable on a temporary global Security
on an Interest Payment Date for Securities of such series occurring prior to the
applicable Exchange Date shall be payable to Euro-clear and CEDEL S.A. on such
Interest Payment Date upon delivery by Euro-clear and CEDEL S.A. to the Trustee
of a certificate or certificates in the form set forth in Exhibit C.3 to this
Indenture, for credit without further interest on or after such Interest Payment
Date to the respective accounts of the Persons who are the beneficial owners of
such temporary global Security on such Interest Payment Date and who have each
delivered to Euro-clear or CEDEL S.A., as the case may be, a certificate in the
form set forth in Exhibit C.4 to this Indenture. Any interest so received by
Euro-clear and CEDEL S.A. and not paid as herein provided shall be

30
<PAGE>

returned to the Trustee immediately prior to the expiration of two years after
such Interest Payment Date in order to be repaid to the Company in accordance
with Section 1003.

SECTION 305. Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
--------------------------------------------------- 

The Company shall cause to be kept at an office or agency to be maintained
by the Company in accordance with Section 1002 a register (being the combined
register of the Security Registrar and all transfer agents designated pursuant
to Section 1002 for the purpose of registration of transfer of Securities and
sometimes collectively referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject
to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide
for the registration of Registered Securities and the registration of transfers
of Registered Securities. The Trustee is hereby appointed "Security
Registrar" for the purpose of registering Registered Securities and transfers of
Registered Securities as herein provided.

Upon due surrender for registration of transfer of any Registered Security
of any series at the office or agency of the Company maintained pursuant to
Section 1002 for such purpose in a Place of Payment for such series, the Company
shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of
the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Registered Securi-
ties of the same series of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate
principal amount and tenor.

At the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series may be
exchanged for other Registered Securities of the same series of any authorized
denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor, upon
surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency.
Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall
execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which
the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise specified as
contemplated by Section 301, any permanent global Security shall be exchangeable
only as provided in

31
<PAGE>

this paragraph. If the beneficial owners of interests in a permanent global
Security are entitled to exchange such interests for Securities of such series
and of like tenor and principal amount of another authorized form and
denomination, as specified as contemplated by Section 301, then without
unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the earliest date on which
such interests may be so exchanged, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee
definitive Securities of that series in aggregate principal amount equal to the
principal amount of such permanent global Security, executed by the Company. On
or after the earliest date on which such interests may be so exchanged, such
permanent global Security shall be surrendered by the Common Depository or such
other depository or Common Depository as shall be specified in the Company
Order with respect thereto to the Trustee, as the Company's agent for such
purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part, for definitive
Securities of such series without charge and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in exchange for each portion of such permanent global Security, a like
aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of
authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such permanent
global Security to be exchanged. If a Registered Security is issued in ex-
change for any portion of a permanent global Security after the close of
business at the office or agency where such exchange occurs on (i) any Regular
Record Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the
relevant Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the
opening of business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for
payment of interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, interest or
Defaulted Interest will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date or
proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of such Registered
Security, but will be payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for
payment, as the case may be, only to the Person to whom interest in respect of
such portion of such permanent global Security is payable in accordance with the
provisions of this Indenture.

All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of
Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same
debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as

32
<PAGE>

the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

Every Registered Security presented or surrendered for registration of
transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee or
any transfer agent) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument
of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar or
any transfer agent duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly
authorized in writing.

No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or
exchange of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient
to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection
with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than
exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906 or 1107 not involving any transfer.

The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer of or
exchange Securities of any series during a period beginning at the opening of
business 15 days before any selection of Securities of that series to be
redeemed and ending at the close of business on the day of the mailing of the
relevant notice of redemption or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange
any Security so selected for redemption, in whole or in part, except the
unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.

Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as otherwise specified or
contemplated by Section 301, any Book-Entry Security shall be exchangeable
pursuant to this Section 305 or Sections 304, 906 and 1107 for Securities
registered in the name of, and a transfer of a Book-Entry Security or any series
may be registered to, any Person other than the Depository for such Security or
its nominee only if (i) such Depository notifies the Company that it is
unwilling or unable to continue as Depository for such Book-Entry Security or if
at any time such Depository ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (ii) the Company executes and
delivers to the Trustee a Company Order that such Book-Entry Security shall be
so exchangeable and the transfer thereof so registerable or (iii) there shall
have occurred and be continuing an Event of

33
<PAGE>

Default, or an event which after notice or lapse of time would be an Event of
Default, with respect to the Securities of such series. Upon the occurrence
in respect of any Book-Entry Security of any series of any one or more of the
conditions specified in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) or the preceding sentence or
such other conditions as may be specified as contemplated by Section 301 for
such series, such Book-Entry Security may be exchanged for Securities registered
in the names of, and the transfer of such Book-Entry Security may be registered
to, such Persons (including Persons other than the Depository with respect to
such series and its nominees) as such Depository shall direct. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Indenture, any Security authenticated and delivered
upon registration of transfer of, or in exchange for, or in lieu of, any Book-
Entry Security shall also be a Book-Entry Security and shall bear the legend
specified in Section 204 except for any Security authenticated and delivered in
exchange for, or upon registration of transfer of, Book-Entry Security pursuant
to the preceding sentence.

SECTION 306. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
------------------------------------------------ 

If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall
execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a
new Security of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and
bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding and such mutilated Security
shall be cancelled by the Trustee in accordance with the Indenture.

If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (i) evidence to
their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii)
such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them and
any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the
Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide
purchaser, the Company shall, subject to the following paragraph, execute and
the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost
or stolen Security a new Security of the same series and of like tenor and
principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

34
<PAGE>

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become
or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may,
instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.

Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including
the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.

Every new Security of any series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of
any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional
contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or
stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and any such new
Security shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and
proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued
hereunder.

The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the
extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or
payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

SECTION 307. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved.
----------------------------------------------- 

Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect to
any series of Securities, interest on any Registered Security which is payable,
and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall
be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor
Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date
for such interest.

Any interest on any Registered Security of any series which is payable, but
is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date
(herein called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the
Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder,
and such Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each
case, as provided in Clause (1) and (2) below:

35
<PAGE>

(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted
Interest to the Persons in whose names the Registered Securities of such
series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the
close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such
Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The
Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted
Interest proposed to be paid on each Registered Security of such series and
the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall
deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount
proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make ar-
rangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date
of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for
the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this
Clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for
the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days
and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not
less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the
proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such
Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company,
shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and
the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class postage prepaid,
to each Holder of Registered Securities of such series at the address of
such Holder as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days
prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such
Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so
mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names
the Registered Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor
Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record
Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following Clause (2);
and

36
<PAGE>

(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the
Registered Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not
inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which
such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by
such exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the
proposed payment pursuant to this Clause, such manner of payment shall be
deemed practicable by the Trustee.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 305, each
Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of, transfer of or in
exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to
interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other
Security.

SECTION 308. Persons Deemed Owners.
--------------------- 

Prior to due presentment of a Registered Security for registration of
transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee
may treat the Person in whose name such Registered Security is registered as
the owner of such Registered Security for the purpose of receiving payment of
principal of (and premium, if any) and (subject to Sections 305 and 307) any
interest on such Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not
such Security shall be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any
agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

SECTION 309. Cancellation.
------------ 

All Securities surrendered for payment, redemption, registration of
transfer or exchange or for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if
surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee.
All Registered Securities so delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the
Trustee. The Company may at any time deliver to the Trustee for cancellation
any Securities previously authenticated and delivered hereunder which the
Company may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and may deliver to the
Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery to the Trustee) for cancellation
any Securities previously authenticated hereunder

37
<PAGE>

which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so delivered
shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. No Securities shall be
authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities cancelled as provided
in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this Indenture. All cancelled
Securities held by the Trustee shall be disposed of as directed by a Company
Order, or in the absence of a Company Order, may be destroyed by the Trustee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Book-Entry Security,
nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the
Company or the Trustee, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy
or other authorization furnished by a Depository or impair, as between a
Depository and holders of beneficial interests in any Book-Entry Security, the
operation of customary practices governing the exercise of the rights of the
Depository (or its nominee) as Holder of such Book-Entry Security.

SECTION 310. Computation of Interest.
----------------------- 

Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities
of any series, (i) interest on the Securities of each series that bear interest
at a fixed rate will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-
day months and will not on the 31st day of any month and (ii) interest on the
Securities of each series that bear interest at a floating rate will be
calculated on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a year of 360
days, except that interest on Securities of a series that bear interest at a
floating rate which is based upon the yield of U.S. Treasury obligations will be
calculated on the basis of the actual number of days in the year.

SECTION 311. Electronic Security Issuance.
---------------------------- 

The Securities may pursuant to a Board Vote and Officers' Certificate
complying with Section 301 hereof be issued by means of an electronic issuance
system. Any such Security issuance instructions may specify the name, address
and taxpayer identification number of the Holder, the principal amount and
Maturity of the Security, the interest rate to be borne by the Security and any
other terms not inconsistent with such Board Vote and Officers'

38
<PAGE>

Certificate. Nothing in this Section 311 shall be construed as prohibiting the
Company from issuing Securities by any means not inconsistent with the
provisions of this Indenture.

ARTICLE IV

SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE

SECTION 401. Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture.
--------------------------------------- 

This Indenture shall upon Company Request cease to be of further effect
(except as to any surviving rights of registration of transfer or exchange of
Securities herein expressly provided for, and any right to receive additional
amounts, as provided in Section 1004), and the Trustee, at the expense of the
Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging satisfaction and dis-

arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of

and the Company, in the case of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, has deposited or
caused to be deposited with the Trustee as trust funds in trust for the purpose,
an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on such
Securities not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for

the case of Securities which have become due and payable) or to the Stated
Maturity or Redemption Date, as the case may be;

(2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
payable hereunder by the Company; and

(3) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions

the obligations of the Trustee under Section 402 and the last paragraph of
Section 1003 shall survive.

SECTION 402. Application of Trust Money.
-------------------------- 

Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all money
deposited with the Trustee pursuant to Section 401 shall be held in trust and
applied by it, in accordance with the provisions of the Securities and this
Indenture, to the payment, either directly or through any Paying Agent

determine, to the Persons entitled thereto, of the principal (and premium, if
any) and any interest for whose payment such money has been deposited with the
Trustee.

SECTION 403. Satisfaction, Discharge and Defeasance of Securities of any
-----------------------------------------------------------
Series.
- ------ 

If this Section 403 is specified, as contemplated by Section 301, to be
applicable to Securities of any series, then notwithstanding Section 401: (i)
the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire indebtedness
on all the Outstanding Securities of any such series; (ii) the provisions of
this Indenture as it relates to such Outstanding Securities shall no longer be
in effect (except as to the rights of Holders of Securities to receive, from

reference to this Section 403, the Company has deposited or caused to be
deposited with the Trustee irrevocably (but subject to the provisions of
Section 402 and the last paragraph of Section 1003), as trust funds in
trust, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to, the
benefit of the Holders of the Securities of that series, (X) lawful money
of the United States in an amount, or (Y) U.S. Government Obligations which
through the payment of interest and principal in respect thereof in accor-
dance with their terms will provide not later than the opening of business
on the due dates

41
<PAGE>

of any payment referred to in Clause (i) or (ii) of this subparagraph
(1)(A) lawful money of the United States in an amount, or (z) a combination
thereof, sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of
independent public accountants expressed in a written certification
thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge (i) the principal of
(and premium, if any) and each installment of principal (and premium, if
any) and interest on the Outstanding Securities of that series on the
Stated Maturity of such principal or installment of principal or interest
and (ii) any mandatory sinking fund payments or analogous payments
applicable to Securities of such series on the day on which such payments
are due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and of
such Securities; or

to be applicable to the Securities of such series;

(2) the Company has paid or caused to be paid all other sums
payable with respect to the Outstanding Securities of such Series;

(3) such deposit will not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a default under, this Indenture or any other agreement or
instrument to which the Company is a party or by which it is bound;

(4) no Event of Default or event which with the giving of notice or
lapse of time, or both, would become an Event of Default with respect to
the Securities of that series shall have occurred and be continuing on the
date of such deposit and no Event of Default under Section 501(6) or
Section 501(7) or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time,
or both, would become an Event of Default under Section 501(6) or Section
501(7) shall have occurred and be continuing on the 91st day after such
date;

42
<PAGE>

(5) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel
to the effect that (a) the Company has received from, or there has been
published by, the Internal Revenue Service a ruling, or (b) since the date
of this Indenture there has been a change in applicable federal income tax
law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such Opinion of
Counsel shall confirm that, the Holders of Securities of such series will
not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a
result of such deposit, defeasance and discharge and will be subject to
federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the
same times as would have been the case if such deposit, defeasance and
discharge had not occurred;

(6) if the Securities of that series are then listed on any
domestic or foreign securities exchange, the Company shall have delivered
to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such deposit,
defeasance and discharge will not cause such Securities to be delisted; and

(7) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions
precedent herein provided for relating to the satisfaction and discharge of
the entire indebtedness on all Outstanding Securities of any such series
have been complied with and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that either
(i) as a result of such deposit and the related exercise of the Company's
option under this Section 403, registration is not required under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, by the Company, the trust funds
representing such deposit or the Trustee or (ii) all necessary
registrations under said Act have been effected.

Any deposits with the Trustee referred to in Section 403(1)(A) above shall

form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee. If any Outstand-

43
<PAGE>

ing Securities of such series are to be redeemed prior to their Stated Maturity,
whether pursuant to any optional redemption provisions or in accordance with any
mandatory sinking fund requirement, the applicable escrow trust agreement shall
provide therefor and the Company shall make such arrangements as are
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the
Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company.

Upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in this Section 403 with
respect to all the Outstanding Securities of any series, the terms and
conditions of such series, including the terms and conditions with respect
thereto set forth in this Indenture, shall no longer be binding upon, or
applicable to, the Company; provided that the Company shall not be discharged
-------- 
from any payment obligations in respect of Securities of such series which are
deemed to be Outstanding under clause (iii) of the definition thereof because
such obligations continue to be valid obligations of the Company under
applicable law.

Notwithstanding the cessation, termination and discharge of all
obligations, covenants and agreements (except as provided above in this Section
403) of the Company under this Indenture with respect to any series of
Securities, the obligations of the Company to the Trustee under Section 607, and
the obligations of the Trustee under Section 402 and the last paragraph of
Section 1003 shall survive with respect to such series of Securities.

they become due, or the taking of corporate action by the Company in
furtherance of any such action; or

(8) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities

SECTION 502. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
-------------------------------------------------- 

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series at the time
Outstanding occurs and is continu-

46
<PAGE>

ing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series may declare the
principal amount (or, if any of the Securities of that series are Original Issue
Discount Securities, such portion of the principal amount of such Securities as
may be specified in the terms thereof) of all of the Securities of that series
to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to
the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal
amount (or specified amount) shall become immediately due and payable.

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to
Securities of any series has been made and before adjudgment or decree for
payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this
Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the
Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if:

(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum
sufficient to pay

(A) all overdue interest on all Securities of that series,

(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Securities of
that series which have become due otherwise than by such declaration of
acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or rates prescribed
therefor in such Securities,

(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful, interest
upon overdue interest at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such
Securities, and

(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel;

and

47
<PAGE>

(2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that
series, other than the non-payment of the principal of Securities of that
series which have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration,
have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

SECTION 503. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
--------------------------------------------------------------- 

The Company covenants that if,

(1) default is made in the payment of any interest on any Security
of any series when such interest becomes due and payable and such default
continues for a period of 30 days, or

(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium,
if any, on) any Security of any series at the Maturity thereof,

the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the
Holders of such Securities of that series, the whole amount then due and payable
on such Securities of that series for principal and any premium and interest
and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable,
interest on any overdue principal and on the premium, if any, and overdue
interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in such Securities of that
series and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to
cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents
and counsel.

If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the
Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a
judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may
prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same
against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and collect the
moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner

48
<PAGE>

provided by law out of the property of the Company or any other obligor upon
such Securities, wherever situated.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce
its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series by such
appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to
protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any
covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power
granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

SECTION 504. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
-------------------------------- 

In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation,
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other
judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the
Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their
creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities
shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by declaration or
otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on
the Company for the payment of overdue principal or interest) shall be entitled
and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise,

(i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal and
any premium and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and
to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in
order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel) and of the Holders of Securities allowed
in such judicial proceeding, and

(ii) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or
deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same,

49
<PAGE>

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or
other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by
each Holder of Securities to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event
that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the
Holders of Securities to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents
and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 605.

Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to
authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a Security
any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the
Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to
vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Security in any such pro-
ceeding.

SECTION 505. Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities.
------------------------------------------------------------ 

All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities may
be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of the
Securities or the production thereof in any proceeding relating thereto, and any
such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as
trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision
for the payment of the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and
advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of
the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been
recovered.

SECTION 506. Application of Money Collected.

of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that

and

(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been
given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority
in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;

51
<PAGE>

it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall
have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any
provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any
other of such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference
over any other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture,
except in the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of
all of such Holders.

SECTION 508. Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and
----------------------------------------------------------------
Interest.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of any
Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to receive

If the Trustee or any Holder of a Security has instituted any proceeding to
enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been

determination in such proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of
Securities shall be restored severally and respectively to their former
positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and
the Holders shall continue as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

SECTION 510. Rights and Remedies Cumulative.

Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or payment of
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities in the last paragraph of Section

right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in
addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter

right or remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent
assertion or employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

SECTION 511. Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
---------------------------- 

No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Security to
exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any
such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an
acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to
the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities may be exercised from time to time,
and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders of
Securities.

SECTION 512. Control by Holders of Securities.
-------------------------------- 

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities

conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising

such series, provided that

(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or
with this Indenture, and

(2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the
Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction.

Upon receipt by the Trustee of any written notice directing the time,
method or place of conducting any such proceeding or exercising any such trust
or power, with respect to Securities of a series all or part of which is
represented by a Global Security, a record date shall be established for
determining Holders of Outstanding Securities of such series entitled to join
in such notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day
the Trustee receives such notice. The

53
<PAGE>

Holders on such record date, or their duly designated proxies, and only such
Persons, shall be entitled to join in such notice, whether or not such Holders
remain Holders after such record date; provided, that unless the Holders of a
-------- 
majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall
have joined in such notice prior to the day which is 90 days after such record
date, such notice shall automatically and without further action by any Holder
be canceled and of no further effect.

SECTION 513. Waiver of Past Defaults.
----------------------- 

The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities of
such series waive any past default hereunder with respect to the Securities of
such series and its consequences, except

(1) a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if
any) or a continuing default in the payment of any interest on any
Security of such series, or

(2) a default in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which
under Article Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of
the Holder of each Outstanding Security of such series affected.

The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the
purpose of determining the Persons entitled to waive any past default hereunder.
If a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date, or their duly
designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to waive any
default hereunder, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record
date; provided, that unless such majority in principal amount shall have waived
-------- 
such default prior to the date which is 90 days after such record date, any such
waiver previously given shall automatically and without further action by any
Holder be canceled and of no further effect.

Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of
Default arising therefrom shall

54
<PAGE>

be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose of this Indenture; but no such
waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

SECTION 514. Undertaking for Costs.
--------------------- 

All parties to this indenture agree, and each Holder of any Security by his
acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its
discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy
under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken,
suffered or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such
suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of such suit, and that such court may in
its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees,
against any party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and
good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but the
provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the
Company, to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any
Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate more than 25% in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any suit
instituted by any Holder of any Security for the enforcement of the payment of
the principal of or any premium or interest on any Security on or after the
Stated Maturity or Maturities expressed in such Security (or, in the case of
redemption, on or after the Redemption Date).

SECTION 515. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.
-------------------------------- 

The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it
will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or
take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted,
now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the
performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may
lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law
and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any
power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of
every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

<PAGE>

SECTION 606. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
------------------------------------------------- 

(a) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities
of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If the
instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee required by Section 607 shall
not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such
notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the
Securities of such series.

(b) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the
Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount
of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Trustee and to
the Company.

(c) If at any time:

(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 310(b) of the
Trust Indenture Act after written request therefor by the Company or by any
Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at
least six months, or

(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 310(a) of
the Trust Indenture Act and shall fail to resign after written request
therefor by the Company or by any such Holder, or

(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be
adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its
property shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or
control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of
rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,

then, in any such case, (i) the Company by a Board Vote may remove the Trustee
with respect to all Securities, or (ii) subject to Section 514 any Holder of a
Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least

59
<PAGE>

six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition
any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect
to all Securities and the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.

(d) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of
acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with
respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by a Board Vote,
shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the
Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor
Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more or all of
such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to
the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the applicable
requirements of Section 607. If, within one year after such resignation,
removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such vacancy, a successor Trustee
with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such
series delivered to the Company and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee
so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in
accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 607, become the suc-
cessor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent
supersede the successor Trustee appointed by the Company. If no successor
Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so
appointed by the Company or the Holders of Securities of that series and
accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 607, any Holder of a
Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at
least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor
Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.

(e) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each
removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each
appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series
in the manner provided in Section 106. Each notice shall include the name of the
successor Trustee with

60
<PAGE>

respect to the Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust
Office.

SECTION 607. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
-------------------------------------- 

(a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with
respect to all Securities every such successor Trustee so appointed shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an
instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal
of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but on the request of
the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment
of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor
Trustee all the rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly
assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money
held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.

(b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with
respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the
retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of
one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto
wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (l)
shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and
confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers,
trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of
that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates,
(2) if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities,
shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to
confirm that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee
with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring
Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and
(3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be
necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts
hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or
in such supple-

61
<PAGE>

mental indenture shall constitute such Trustees as co-trustees of the same trust
and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder
separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other
such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture
the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the
extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any further
act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts
and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or
those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but,
on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall
duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and
money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of
that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates.

(c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall
execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and
confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred
to in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section, as the case may be.

(d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the
time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible
under this Article and the Trust Indenture Act.

SECTION 608. Disqualification; Conflicting Interests.
--------------------------------------- 

If the Trustee has or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the
meaning of the Trust Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either eliminate such
interest or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to
the provisions of, the Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture.

SECTION 609. Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.
--------------------------------------- 

There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be a Person
that is eligible pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act to act as such and has a
combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If such

62
<PAGE>

Person publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to
the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then for the
purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Person shall
be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent
report of condition so published. If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be
eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, it shall resign
immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this
Article.

SECTION 610. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company.
------------------------------------------------- 

If and when the Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or
any other obligor upon the Securities), the Trustee shall be subject to the
provisions of the Trust Indenture Act regarding the collection of claims against
the Company (or any such other obligor).

SECTION 611. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.
----------------------------------------------------------- 

Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any
corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business
of the Trustee shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such
corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article,
without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of
any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities shall have been
authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor
by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt
such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same
effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities.

SECTION 612. Appointment of Authenticating Agent.
----------------------------------- 

The Trustee may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to
one or more series of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of
the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon

63
<PAGE>

original issue or upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption
thereof or pursuant to Section 306, and Securities so authenticated shall be
entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory
for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever
reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of
Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication such
reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of
the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication
executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each
Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall at all times
be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United
States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized
under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and
surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination
by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent publishes reports
of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said
supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the
combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be
its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of
condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be
eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenti-
cating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect
specified in this Section.

Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent
shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or
corporate trust business of such Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an
Authenticating Agent provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible
under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of the Trustee or such Authenticating Agent.

An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by giving written notice
thereof to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time
terminate the

64
<PAGE>

agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice thereof to such
Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving such a notice of
resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time such
Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating
Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall promptly give notice of
such appointment to all Holders of Securities pursuant to Section 106. Any
successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder
shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor
hereunder with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent.
No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the
provisions of this Section.

The Trustee agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to time
reasonable compensation for its services under this Section, and the Trustee
shall be entitled to be reimbursed for such payments, subject to the provisions
of Section 605.

If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant to
this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in
addition to the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an alternative
certificate of authentication in the following form:

This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein referred to
in the within-mentioned Indenture.

------------------------
As Trustee

By 
---------------------
Authenticating Agent

By 
---------------------
Authorized Signatory

If all of the Securities of a series may not be originally issued at one
time, and if the Company has an

65
<PAGE>

Affiliate eligible to be appointed as an Authenticating Agent hereunder or the
Trustee does not have an office capable of authenticating Securities upon
original issuance located in a Place of Payment where the Company wishes to
have Securities of such series authenticated upon original issuance, the
Trustee, if so requested by the Company in writing (which writing need not
comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel),
shall appoint in accordance with this Section an Authenticating Agent (which if
so requested by the Company, shall be such Affiliate of the Company) having an
office in a Place of Payment designated by the Company with respect to such
series of Securities.

states that the applicants desire to communicate with other Holders of Securi-
ties with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under the Securities

and of payment, or provision for the payment of the reasonable expenses of
mailing, unless within five days after such tender the Trustee shall mail to
such applicants and file with the Commission, together with a copy of the
material to be mailed, a written statement to the effect that, in the opinion of
the Trustee, such mailing would be contrary to the best interest of the Holders
of Securities or would be in violation of applicable law. Such written state-
ment shall specify the basis of such opinion. If the Commission, after
opportunity for a hearing upon the objections specified in the written statement
so filed, shall enter an order refusing to sustain any of such objections or if
after the entry of an order sustaining one or more of such objections, the
Commission shall find, after notice and opportunity for hearing that all the
objections so sustained have been met and shall enter an order so declaring, the
Trustee shall mail copies of such material to all such Holders of Securities
with reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the renewal of such
tender; otherwise the Trustee shall be relieved of any obligation or duty to
such applicants respecting their application.

(c) Every Holder of Securities, by receiving and holding the same,
agrees with the Company and the Trustee that neither the Company nor the Trustee
nor any agent of either of them shall be held accountable by reason of the
disclosure of any such information as to the names and addresses of the Holders
of Securities in accordance with Section 702(b), regardless of the source from
which such information was derived and that the Trustee shall not be held
accountable by reason of mailing any material pursuant to a request made under
Section 702(b).

A copy of each such report shall, at the time of such transmission to
Holders, be filed by the Trustee with each stock exchange upon which any

The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of each series of
Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of and any
premium and interest on the Securities of that series in accordance with the

SECTION 1002. Maintenance of Office or Agency.
------------------------------- 

The Company will maintain in each Place of Payment for such series an
office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered
for payment, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration
of transfer or exchange and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in
respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. The
Company will give prompt notice to the Trustee and to the Holders as provided in
Sections 105 and 106, respectively, of the location and any change in the

maintain any such required office or agency in respect of any series of
Securities or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such
presentations and surrenders of Securities of that series may be made and
notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the
Trustee.

The Company may also from time to time designate one or more other offices
or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or
surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such
designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission shall in
-------- ------- 
any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office or agency
in accordance with the requirements set forth above for Securities of any series
for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee
and the Holders of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the
location of any such other office or agency.

76
<PAGE>

SECTION 1003. Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust.
------------------------------------------------- 

If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with respect
to any series of Securities, it will, on or before each due date of the
principal of and any premium or interest on any of the Securities of that
series, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled
thereto a sum sufficient to pay the principal and any premium or interest so
becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise
disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of its
action or failure so to act.

Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any series of
Securities it will, prior to each due date of the principal of and any premium
or interest on any Securities of that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum
sufficient to pay the principal and any premium or interest so becoming due,
such sum to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such
principal, premium or interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee)
the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure so to act.

The Company will cause each Paying Agent for any series of Securities other
than the Trustee to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which
such Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of
this Section, that such Paying Agent will:

(1) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of
and any premium or interest on Securities of that series in trust for the
benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to
such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided;

(2) give the Trustee notice of any default by the Company (or any
other obligor upon the Securities of that series) in the making of any
payment of principal of and any premium or interest on the Securities of
that series; and

(3) at any time during the continuance of any such default, upon
the written request

77
<PAGE>

of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by
such Paying Agent.

The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction
and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or by Company
Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by
the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the
same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or such
Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such
Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such
money.

Any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by
the Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of and any premium or
interest on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two years
after such principal and any premium or interest has become due and payable
shall be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the
Company) shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security
shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for
payment thereof, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with
respect to such trust money and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof
shall thereupon cease.

SECTION 1004. Additional Amounts.
------------------ 

If the Securities of a series provide for the payment of additional
amounts, the Company will pay to the Holder of any Security of such series
additional amounts as provided therein. Whenever in this Indenture there is
mentioned, in any context, the payment of the principal of or any premium or
interest on, or in respect of any Security of any series or the net proceeds
received on the sale or exchange of any Security of any series, such mention
shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of additional amounts provided
for in this Section to the extent that, in such context additional amounts are,
were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of this
Section and express mention of the payment of additional amounts (if applicable)
in any provisions hereof shall not be construed as excluding additional amounts
in those provisions hereof where such express mention is not made.

<PAGE>

SECTION 1005. Existence.
--------- 

Subject to Article Eight, the Company will do or cause to be done all
things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence,
rights (charter and statutory) and franchises; provided, however, that the
-------- -------- 
Company shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if the
Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer
desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and that the loss
thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.

SECTION 1006. [Intentionally Omitted]

SECTION 1007. Limitation on Liens.
------------------- 

(a) The Company will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary to, issue,
assume or guarantee any indebtedness for money borrowed, including but not
limited to any Funded Debt (hereinafter in this Article Ten referred to as
"Debt"), if such Debt is secured by a mortgage, pledge, security interest or
lien (any mortgage, pledge, security interest or lien being hereinafter in this
Article Ten referred to as a "mortgage" or "mortgages") upon any assets, stock
or other indebtedness of the Company now owned or hereafter acquired, without in
any such case effectively providing, concurrently with the issuance, assumption
or guarantee of such Debt, that the Securities (together with, if the Company
shall so determine, any other indebtedness of or guaranteed by the Company or
such Subsidiary ranking equally with the Securities then outstanding and
existing or thereafter created) shall be secured equally and ratably with (or
prior to) such Debt; provided, however, that, subject to subsection (c) of this
-------- ------- 
Section 1007, the foregoing restriction shall not apply to:

(1) mortgages on any property acquired, constructed or improved by
the Company or any Subsidiary after the date of this Indenture which are
created or assumed contemporaneously with, or within one hundred and eighty
days after, such acquisition (or in the case of property constructed or
improved, after the completion and commencement of commercial operation of
such property, whichever is later) to

79
<PAGE>

secure or provide for the payment of any part of the purchase price of such
property or the cost of such construction or improvement, or mortgages on
any property existing at the time of acquisition thereof; provided that in
-------- 
the case of any such construction or improvement the mortgage shall not
apply to any property theretofore owned by the Company or any Subsidiary,
other than any theretofore unimproved real property on which the property
so constructed, or the improvement, is located;

(2) mortgages on any property acquired from a corporation which is
merged with or into the Company or a Subsidiary or mortgages outstanding
at the time any corporation becomes a Subsidiary;

(3) mortgages in favor of the Company or any Subsidiary; and

(4) any extension, renewal or replacement (or successive
extensions, renewals or replacements) in whole or in part, of any mortgage
referred to in the foregoing clauses (l) to (3), inclusive; provided,
-------- 
however, that the principal amount of Debt secured thereby shall not exceed
------- 
the principal amount of Debt so secured at the time of such extension,
renewal or replacement, and that such extension, renewal or replacement
shall be limited to all or a part of the property which secured the
mortgage so extended, renewed or replaced (plus improvements on such
property).

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section
1007, but subject to subsection (c) of this Section 1007, the Company or any
Subsidiary may issue, assume or guarantee secured Debt, which would otherwise
be subject to the foregoing restrictions, in an aggregate amount which together
with all other such Debt and all Attributable Debt in respect of Sale and Lease-
Back Transactions (as defined in Section 1008) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries existing at such time (other than Sale and Lease-Back Transactions
the proceeds of which have been applied in accordance with clause (b) of Section
1008), does not at the time exceed 10% of the

80

in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
consistent basis, as shown on the audited consolidated balance sheet contained
in the latest annual report to stockholders of the Company.

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsections (a) and (b) of this
Section 1007, the Company's Subsidiaries shall not issue, assume or otherwise
incur Funded Debt in excess of $5 million in the aggregate at any time
outstanding.

SECTION 1008. Limitation on Sale and Lease-Back Transactions.
----------------------------------------------- 

The Company will not, nor will it permit any Subsidiary to, enter into any
arrangement with any person providing for the leasing to the Company or a
Subsidiary of any real property (except for temporary leases for a term of not
more than three years), which property has been owned and, in the case of any
such Facility, has been placed in commercial operation more than one hundred and
eighty days by the Company or such Subsidiary and has been or is to be sold or
transferred by the Company or such Subsidiary to such person (herein referred to
as "Sale and Lease-Back Transactions"), unless either (a) the Company or such
Subsidiary would be entitled to incur Debt secured by a mortgage on the property
to be leased in an amount equal to the Attributable Debt with respect to such
Sale and Lease-Back Transactions without equally and ratably securing the
Securities pursuant to Section 1007 or (b) the Company shall, and in any such
case the Company covenants that it will, apply an amount equal to the fair value
(as determined by the Board of Directors) of the property so leased to the
retirement, within one hundred and eighty days of the effective date of any such
Sale and Lease-Back Transactions, of Securities or of Funded Debt of the Company
which ranks on a parity with the Securities.

SECTION 1009. Statement by Officers as to Default.
----------------------------------- 

The Company will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end of
each fiscal year of the Company ending after the date hereof, an Officers'

any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Indenture, and if the
Company shall be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and
status thereof of which they may have knowledge.

SECTION 1010. Waiver of Certain Covenants.
--------------------------- 

The Company may omit in any particular instance to comply with any term,
provision or condition set forth in Sections 1007 to 1008, inclusive, with
respect to the Securities of any series if before the time for such compliance
the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities of such series shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such
compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term,
provision or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term,
provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived, and, until
such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Company and the
duties of the Trustee in respect of any such term, provision or condition shall
remain in full force and effect.

The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the
purpose of determining the Persons entitled to waive any such term provision or
condition. If a record date is fixed, the Holders on such record date, or their
duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to waive any
such term, provision or condition hereunder, whether or not such Holders remain
Holders after such record date; provided, that unless the Holders of at least a
-------- 
majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series shall
have waived such term, provision or condition prior to the date which is 90 days
after such record date, any such waiver previously given shall automatically and
without further action by any Holder be canceled and of no further effect.

term, provision or condition set forth in Section 1007 or Section 1008 and any
such omission with respect to Sec-

trust, specifically pledged as security for and dedicated solely to the
benefit of the Holders of the Securities of that series, (A) lawful money
of the United States in an amount, or (B) U.S. Government Obligations which

(ii) of this subparagraph (l) lawful money of the United States in an
amount, or (C) a combination thereof, sufficient, in the opinion of a

Securities of that series on the Stated Maturity of such principal or
installment of principal or interest and (ii) any mandatory sinking fund
payments or analogous payments applicable to Securities of such series on
the day on which such payments are due and payable in accordance with the
terms of this Indenture and of such Securities;

Section 608 and for purposes of the Trust Indenture Act with respect to the
Securities of any Series;

501(7) shall have occurred and be continuing on the 91st day after such
date;

(5) the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel
to the effect that Holders of the Securities of such series will not
recognize income gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result
of such deposit and defeasance of certain obligations and will be subject
to federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the
same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had
not occurred;

(6) if the Securities of that series are then listed on any foreign
or domestic securities exchange, the Company has delivered to the Trustee

this Section have been complied with and an Opinion of Counsel to the

less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the
Company (unless the Trustee shall otherwise agree), notify the Trustee of such
Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Securities of such series to be
redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities (i) prior to the
expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such
Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture or (ii) pursuant to an election of the
Company which is subject to a condition specified in the terms of such
Securities, the Company shall furnish the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate
evidencing compliance with such restriction or condition.

SECTION 1103. Selection by Trustee of Securities to Be Redeemed.
------------------------------------------------- 

If less than all the Securities of any series are to be redeemed, the
particular Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days
prior to the Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of
such series not previously called for redemption, by such method as the Trustee
shall deem fair and appropriate and which may provide for the selection,

85
<PAGE>

for redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for
Securities of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal
amount of Registered Securities of such series of a denomination larger than the
minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that series. If so specified
in the Securities of a series, partial redemptions must be in an amount not
less than $ 1,000,000 principal amount of Securities.

The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company in writing of the Securities
selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial
redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.

For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires,
all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the
case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion
of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be redeemed.

SECTION 1104. Notice of Redemption.
-------------------- 

Notice of redemption shall be given in the manner provided in Section 106
to the Holders of Securities to be redeemed not less than 30 nor more than 60
days prior to the Redemption Date (unless the Trustee shall otherwise agree).

All notices of redemption shall state:

(1) the Redemption Date;

(2) the Redemption Price;

(3) if less than all the Outstanding Securities of any series are
to be redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption,
the principal amounts) of the particular Securities to be redeemed, and a
statement to the effect that on or after the Redemption Date upon
surrender of such Security a new Security in the principal amount equal to
the unredeemed portion will be issued;

86
<PAGE>

(4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price will become
due and payable upon each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable,
that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date; and

(5) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the
case.

Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the
Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the
Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company [and shall be irrevoca-
ble].

SECTION 1105. Deposit of Redemption Price.
--------------------------- 

Prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or
with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent,
segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money
sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the Redemption Date
shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities which
are to be redeemed on that date.

SECTION 1106. Securities Payable on Redemption Date.
------------------------------------- 

Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so to
be redeemed shall on the Redemption Date become due and payable at the
Redemption Price therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the
Company shall default in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued
interest) such Securities shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any
such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice such Security shall
be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price together with accrued interest
to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified as
-------- ------- 
contemplated by Section 301, installments of interest on Registered Securities
whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to
the Holders of such Securities or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered
as such at the close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their
terms and the provisions of Section 307.

87
<PAGE>

If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender
thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium shall, until paid, bear
interest from the Redemption Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the
Security.

SECTION 1107. Securities Redeemed in Part.
--------------------------- 

Any Registered Security which is to be redeemed only in part shall be
surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee
so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof
or his attorney duly authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and
the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security
without service charge, a new Registered Security or Securities of the same
series and of like tenor of any authorized denomination as requested by such
Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the
unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered. If a
global security is so surrendered, such new Security so issued shall be a new
Global Security.

ARTICLE XII

SINKING FUNDS

SECTION 1201. Applicability of Article.
------------------------ 

The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund for
the retirement of Securities of a series to the extent or except as otherwise
specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of such series.

The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of
Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking fund
payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the
terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional sinking
fund payment". If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, the
cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided
in Section 1202. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption

88
<PAGE>

of Securities of any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such
series.

SECTION 1202. Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.
----------------------------------------------------- 

The Company (1) may deliver Outstanding Securities of a series (other than
any previously called for redemption), and (2) may apply as a credit Securities
of a series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company
pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted
optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each
case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect
to the Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of
such Securities, as provided for by the terms of such series; provided that such
-------- 
Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be
received and credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the Redemption Price
specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking
fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.

SECTION 1203. Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.
----------------------------------------- 

Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for any
series of Securities, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for
that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion thereof, if any,
which is to be satisfied by payment of cash and the portion thereof, if any,
which is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series
pursuant to Section 1202 and will also deliver to the Trustee any Securities to
be so delivered. Not less than 45 days before each such sinking fund payment
date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking
fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of
the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the
Company in the manner provided in Section 1104. Such notice having been duly
given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the
manner stated in Sections 1106 and 1107.

as otherwise provided in the Indenture, any such interest not so punctually

such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this
Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of
business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest to

pursuant to Section 1002 of the Indenture, in such coin or currency of the
United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment
of public and private debts at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee or such
other office or agency of the Company as may be designated by it for such
purpose pursuant to Section 1002 of the Indenture, in such coin or currency of
the United States of America as at the time of payment shall be legal tender for
the payment of public and private debts [If applicable, insert--; provided,

however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest may be made by

check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall
appear in the Security Register] [or by wire transfer to an account maintained
by such Person with a bank in The City of New York (so long as the Company has
received proper transfer instructions in writing)].

[If Securities of the series are to be offered to United States

necessary in order that every net payment of the principal of [(and premium, if
any)] and interest on this Security, after deduction or withholding for or on
account of any present or future tax, assessment or other governmental charge
imposed by the United States (as defined below) or any political subdivision or
taxing authority thereof or therein upon or as a result of such payment, will
not be less than the amount provided for in this Security to be then due and
payable; provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay additional

amounts will not apply to any one or more of the following:

(a) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which would
not have been so imposed but for (i) the existence of any present or former
connection between such Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor,
beneficiary or member of such Holder, if such Holder is

an estate, a trust or a partnership) and the United States, including,
without limitation, such Holder (or such fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary
or member) being or having been a citizen or resident or treated as a
resident thereof, or being or having been engaged in trade or business or
present therein, or having or having had a permanent establishment
therein, or -(ii) such Holders' present or former status as a personal
holding company, a foreign personal holding company, a controlled foreign
corporation for United States tax purposes or a corporation which
accumulates earnings to avoid United States federal income tax;

(b) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge imposed on
interest received by a Person holding, actually or constructively, 10% or
more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the
Company entitled to vote;

(c) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which would
not have been imposed but for the failure to comply with any certification,
identification or other reporting requirements concerning the nationality,
residence, identity or connection with the United States of the Holder or
beneficial owner of this Security, if compliance is required by the statute
or by regulation of the United States Treasury Department as a precondition
to exemption from such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;

(d) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, transfer, personal
property or any similar tax, assessment or other governmental charge;

(e) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which is
payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from payments of
principal of [(and premium, if any)] or interest on this Security; or

(f) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge which would
not have been

so imposed but for the presentation by the Holder of this Security for
payment on a date more than 15 days after the date on which such payment
became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly
provided for, whichever occurs later;

nor will additional amounts be paid with respect to any payment of principal of
[(and premium, if any)] or interest on this Security to any United States Alien
who is a fiduciary or partnership or other than the sole beneficial owner of
any such payment to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to
such fiduciary, a member of such a partnership or the beneficial owner would not
have been entitled to the additional amounts had such beneficiary, settlor,
member or beneficial owner been the Holder of this Security. The term "United
States Alien" means any Person who, for United States federal income tax
purposes, is a foreign corporation, a non-resident alien individual, a non-

Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Security
set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes

Notice of redemption will be given by mail to Holders of Registered
Securities, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the date fixed for

the cancellation hereof.

[The Indenture contains provisions of defeasance of (a) the entire
indebtedness of this Security and (b) certain restrictive covenants upon
compliance by the Company with certain conditions set forth therein.]

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this series
shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Securities of this series
may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in
the Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided,
the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be
affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the
consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Securities at
the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also
contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal
amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of
the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the
Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under
the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder
of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all
future Holders of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration
of transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not nota-

A-8
<PAGE>

tion of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

As set forth in, and subject to, the provisions of the Indenture, no
Holder of any Security of this series will have any right to institute any
proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless
such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a
continuing Event of Default with respect to this series, the Holders of not less
than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series shall
have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to
institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall have received from
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of
this series a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to
institute such proceeding within 60 days; provided, however, that such
-------- ------- 
limitations do not apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the
enforcement of payment of the principal of [(and premium, if any)] or interest
on this Security on or after the respective due dates expressed herein.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security
or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which
is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of [(and premium, if any)]
and interest [(including additional amounts, as described on the face hereof)]
on this Security at the times, place[s] and rate, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security
Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the
office or agency of the Company in [any place where the principal of [(and
premium, if any)] and interest on this Security are payable] duly endorsed by,
or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his
attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Registered
Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for
the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated trans-
feree or transferees.

The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form,
without coupons, in denominations of

A-9
<PAGE>

$1,000 and any integral multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and
subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are
exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series
and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of
transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee
may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner
hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security is overdue, and neither
the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the
contrary.

The Indenture and the Securities shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York.

All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

not have been so imposed but for the presentation by the Holder of this
Security for payment on a date more than 15 days after the date on which
such payment became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is

extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of
such a partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to the
additional amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner
been the Holder of this Security. The term "United States Alien" means any
Person who, for United States federal income tax purposes, is a foreign
corporation, a non-resident alien individual, a non-resident alien fiduciary of
a foreign estate or trust or a foreign partnership one or more of the members of

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided,

amount of the Securities of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of
the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the
Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under
the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder
of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all

Holder of any Security of this series will have any right to institute any
proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless
such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a
continuing Event of Default with respect to this series, the Holders of not less
than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of this series shall
have made written request, and offered reasonable indemnity, to the Trustee to
institute such proceeding as trustee, and the Trustee shall not have received
from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities
of this series a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed
to institute such proceeding within 60 days; provided, however, that such
-------- ------- 
limitations do not

B-10
<PAGE>

apply to a suit instituted by the Holder hereof for the enforcement of payment
of amounts due with respect to this Security on or after the respective due
dates expressed herein.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security
or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which
is absolute and unconditional, to pay amounts due with respect to this Security
[(including any additional amounts, as described on the face hereof)] at the
times, place[s] and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security
Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the
office or agency of the Company in [any place where amounts due with respect to
this Security are payable], duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security
Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in
writing, and thereupon one or more new Registered Securities of this series and
of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal
amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered form,
without coupons, in denominations of $______ and any integral multiple thereof.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set
forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable for a like aggregate
principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different
authorized denomination, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer
or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration of
transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee
may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner
hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Secu-

B-11

rity is overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall
be affected by notice to the contrary.

The Indenture and the Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
New York.

All terms used in this Security which are defined in the Indenture
