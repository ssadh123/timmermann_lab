The Board of Directors
Bedford Property Investors, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying Historical Summary of Gross
Income and Direct Operating Expenses (the Summary) of 1000
Town Center Drive (the Property) for the year ended December
31, 1993. The Summary is the responsibility of the Property s
owner. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
Summary based on our audit. 

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the Summary is free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the Summary. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall Summary
presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

The accompanying Summary was prepared for the purpose of
complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (for inclusion in the current Report on
Form 8-K of Bedford Property Investors, Inc.) and excludes
certain expenses, described in note A, that would not be
comparable to those resulting from the proposed future operations
of the Property.

In our opinion, the Summary referred to above presents fairly, in
all material respects, the gross income and direct operating
expenses, exclusive of expenses described in note A, of 1000
Town Center Drive for the year ended December 31, 1993, in
