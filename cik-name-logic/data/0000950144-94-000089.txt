FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

UNION PLANTERS CORPORATION ANNOUNCES RECORD EARNINGS

Memphis, Tennessee -- Union Planters Corporation announced today
fourth quarter and full year 1993 earnings. For the year, net earnings were
$63.1 million compared to $41.4 million in 1992, an increase of 52%. The
increase resulted from higher earnings from Union Planters National Bank and
continued growth in earnings from the Community Bank Group. For the year the
return on average assets was 1.01%, and the return on average common equity was
15.70% compared to .87% and 13.65%, respectively, for 1992.

For 1993 fully diluted net earnings per share were $2.57 compared to
$2.02 in 1992, an increase of 27%. 1993 includes a net benefit of $.08 per
share from the cumulative effect of required FASB accounting changes partially
offset by an extraordinary loss in the fourth quarter.

At December 31, 1993, Union Planters Corporation had total assets of
$6.3 billion compared to $5.3 billion at year end 1992. Total loans were $2.9
billion versus $2.2 billion and total deposits were $5.3 billion versus $4.5

$356 million at the end of 1992. Union Planters National Bank, headquartered 
in Memphis, Tennessee with branch locations in Memphis, Chattanooga, Jackson, 
Knoxville, Murfreesboro and Nashville, earned $35.6 million for the year and 
the Community Bank Group, which ended the year with 31 banking subsidiaries, 
earned $30.2 million for the year.

Union Planters Corporation completed 12 acquisitions during 1993,
adding approximately $1.3 billion in total assets. These included Bank of East
Tennessee in Knoxville, Tennessee; SaveTrust Federal Savings Bank in Dyersburg,
Tennessee; Security Trust Savings & Loan Association in Knoxville, Tennessee;
First Federal Savings Bank in Maryville, Tennessee; First State Bancshares,
Inc. in Somerville, Tennessee; First Cumberland Bank in Madison, Tennessee;
Farmers Union Bank in Ripley, Tennessee; Garrett Bancshares, Inc. in
Goodlettsville, Tennessee; Erin Bank & Trust Company in Erin, Tennessee; Hogue
Holding Company, Inc. in Weiner, Arkansas; Central State Bancorp, Inc. in
Lexington, Tennessee; and First Financial Services, Inc. in Brownsville,
Tennessee.

Asset quality measures for the Corporation were very strong. At
December 31, 1993 nonperforming assets were $27 million, down from $45 million
at year end 1992. Nonperforming assets at December 31, 1993 represent .92% of
loans and foreclosed properties compared to 1.99% a year ago. The allowance
for losses on loans at December 31, 1993 was $80.4 million compared to $64.3
million a year ago.

For the fourth quarter of 1993, net earnings were $13.0 million
compared to $11.5 million in the fourth quarter of 1992. The final quarter
included an extraordinary loss of $3.2 million for the defeasance of the 
10 1/8% subordinated debentures issued in 1989. Earnings before this
extraordinary item were $16.2 million for the quarter. Net earnings per share
on a fully diluted basis were $.52 and earnings before the extraordinary loss
were $.65 per share. These compare to $.55 fully diluted earnings per share in
the fourth quarter of 1992.

For the quarter net interest income increased to $57.9 million from
$52.0 million in the same quarter a year ago. The net interest margin for the
quarter was 4.23% compared to 4.61% the prior year and 4.32% in the third
quarter.

The fourth quarter provision for losses on loans declined to $710,000
from $6.8 million in 1992. Noninterest income declined slightly to $20.7
million versus $21.0 million. Noninterest expense increased to $55.1 million
compared to $49.8 million with the increase primarily coming from the recently
acquired banks.

Loan volume has continued to increase along with the economic recovery
and higher consumer confidence. Average loans, excluding the impact of
acquisitions, increased 5% in the fourth quarter of 1993 compared to the same
period in 1992.

Union Planters Corporation is a multi-bank holding company with 36
banking subsidiaries (including 4 banks acquired in the acquisition of
Mid-South Bancshares, Inc. on January 1, 1994) in Tennessee, Arkansas,
Mississippi, Kentucky and Alabama.
