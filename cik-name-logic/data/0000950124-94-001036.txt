Briggs & Stratton Corporation (NYSE-BGG) announced today that its Board of
Directors approved the spin-off of Briggs & Stratton Technologies Division to

FACILITIES RELOCATION

MILWAUKEE, WI.--MAY 17, 1994--BRIGGS & STRATTON CORPORATION

The Board of Directors of Briggs & Stratton Corporation today approved
management's recommendation to expand existing facilities and establish three
new manufacturing facilities outside of Milwaukee, consistent with all relevant
legal and contractual obligations. These facilities initiatives are required
due to economic considerations and capacity requirements. While the sites for
the facilities have not as yet been selected, the Company anticipates the
facilities will be in the United States, closer to our major customer
locations. The balance of the Small Engine Division operations will be
relocated, and the Poplar Bluff and Murray plants will be expanded. In
addition, the entire Model 28 (10-14 horsepower) engine operations and the
assembly operations for Models 13, 17 and 19 (5-9 horsepower) of the Company's
Large Engine Division and ancillary operations (including some die casting)
will be moved. It is anticipated that the facilities relocation will be
implemented over a 3 to 4 year period and will involve capital expenditures of
approximately $112 million. Approximately 2,000 Milwaukee area hourly
employees will be affected by this action beginning in mid-1995 and extending
through 1997.

James A. Wier, Executive Vice President of Operations for Briggs & Stratton
said, "this decision has been the most difficult one we have had to make. We
have known that the economics of our Milwaukee operations needed to be
addressed, particularly as they relate to meeting our critical customer needs.
We intend to set down with the Union leadership so that we can discuss, and
minimize, the effects of these decisions on our employees and their families."
