ITEM OF INFORMATION

Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On November 1, 1993, GTE South Incorporated (the Company) in a
series of transactions exchanged its telephone plant in service,
materials and supplies and customers (representing 244,000 access
lines) in the state of Georgia for similar assets (including
38,000 access lines) in ALLTEL Corporation's (ALLTEL) Illinois
operations and $446 million in cash (the ALLTEL transaction).
This transaction was accounted for as a sale. The net sales
proceeds exceeded the book value of assets and liabilities sold
and therefore, a gain was recognized on the transaction.

On December 31, 1993, the Company sold its telephone plant in
service, materials and supplies and customers (representing
123,000 access lines) in the states of West Virginia and
Tennessee to Citizens Utilities Company for $291 million in cash
(the Citizens transaction). This transaction was accounted for
as a sale. The net sales proceeds exceeded book value and
therefore, a gain was recognized on the transaction.

The proceeds from these transactions were used to pay down $402
million of debt and pay $281 million of dividends to GTE
Corporation (GTE), the Company's parent. The remainder was
advanced to GTE and will bear interest until repaid.

Item 7 includes the (unaudited) Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of September 30, 1993 and Statement of Income
for the nine-month period ended September 30, 1993 and the Pro
Forma Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for the year
ended December 31, 1992. The income statements show the pro
forma effects of the ALLTEL and Citizens transactions as if the
transactions had taken place as of the beginning of the period.
The balance sheet shows the pro forma effects as if the
transactions took place at the balance sheet date.

To disclose the sale of significant assets, GTE South filed a
Form 8-K on January 13, 1994. At that time, the specific use of
the proceeds was not determined so the proceeds were shown as an
increase in cash. The Company has now determined the use of
proceeds for these transactions and has reflected them in these
pro forma financial statements.
