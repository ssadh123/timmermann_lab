ZENITH BOARD AUTHORIZES STOCK SALE

GLENVIEW, ILL., March 1, 1994 -- The Board of directors of Zenith Electronics
Corporation today authorized the sale of up to 5 million shares of Zenith
common stock pursuant to a shelf registration statement expected to be filed 
shortly with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Any net proceeds from the sale of these shares would first be used to repay
any outstanding short-term debt and then for general corporate purposes, 
including working capital.
Based on current conditions, Zenith does not anticipate the sale of 
additional common stock beyond these shares to investors in 1994.
Any offering of the 5 million shares of common stock will be made only by 
means of a prospectus.
