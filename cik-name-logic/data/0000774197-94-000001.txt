2. Strategic Plan, Dividends and Write-offs. For background and earlier 
developments related to these topics, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Notes 
3(c), 6 and 10(d) in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data", 
all in the Companies' Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the year ended December 
31, 1992 and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and 
Results of Operations" in the Companies' Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for 
the quarters ended March 31, 1993, June 30, 1993 and September 30, 1993. 

On January 4, 1994, the Board of Directors of Centerior Energy approved 
management's comprehensive new strategic plan to strengthen the Companies' 
financial and competitive position. As part of the plan, the Board of 
Directors of Centerior Energy declared a quarterly common stock dividend of 
$.20 per share payable February 15, 1994, a reduction from the $.40 per share 
declared for previous quarters. The Board believes that the new level is 
sustainable barring unforeseen circumstances and that the new plan will 
provide the opportunity to increase the dividend as the Companies' strategic 
objectives are achieved. Nevertheless, future dividend action by the Board 
of Directors will continue to be decided on a quarter-to-quarter basis after 
the evaluation of financial results, potential earnings capacity and cash 
-3-<PAGE>
flow. The Board also authorized the write-off of the Companies' investment 
in Unit 2 of the Perry Nuclear Power Plant ("Perry Unit 2") and the write-off 
of certain deferred charges related to Unit 1 of the Perry Nuclear Power 
Plant and Unit 2 of the Beaver Valley Power Station pursuant to a January 
1989 rate agreement authorized by The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio 
("PUCO") ("phase-in plan"). 

These financial actions resulted from a comprehensive strategic planning 
initiative which assessed existing strategies and developed new ones. In 
addition to the financial actions, the plan involves new strategic objectives 
to increase revenues, increase customer satisfaction, motivate employees, 
reduce power production costs, control total expenditures and provide greater 
total return to share owners over the long term. The new plan is expected to 
strengthen the Companies financially and competitively in order to ultimately 
improve financial results. 

The after-tax write-off of Perry Unit 2 is about $260 million for Cleveland 
Electric, about $170 million for Toledo Edison and about $430 million for 
Centerior Energy. The write-off was taken because the Companies determined 
that it is probable that Perry Unit 2 would not be completed or sold for the 
foreseeable future. 

The after-tax write-off of the phase-in plan deferrals is about $430 million 
for Cleveland Electric, about $160 million for Toledo Edison and about $590 
million for Centerior Energy. The phase-in plan was designed so that 
projected revenues would provide for the recovery of all nuclear-related 
deferred costs over a ten-year period. The plan required the deferral of 
costs during the first five years and amortization and recovery of such costs 
in the last five years. Current forecasts now indicate that revenues 
projected over the 1994-1998 period will not provide for the recovery of 
these deferrals as scheduled, due primarily to the effects of economic and 
competitive pressures. Accordingly, the Board concluded that it was 
necessary to write off the cumulative deferred balance.

The provisions of the Rate Stabilization Program approved by the PUCO in 1992 
are not affected by these actions. 

The write-offs will result in a loss in 1993 and a negative retained earnings 
balance for the Companies. Nevertheless, the Operating Companies expect to 
continue to pay all preferred stock dividends out of appropriated retained 
earnings and current earnings. The Operating Companies also expect to pay a 
common dividend to Centerior out of appropriated retained earnings and 
current earnings, although dividend action by the Boards of Directors of the 
Operating Companies will continue to be determined on a quarter-to-quarter 
basis after an evaluation of financial results, potential earning capacity 
and cash flow. 

As of September 30, 1993 and giving effect to these write-offs, Cleveland 
Electric would have been permitted to issue approximately $325 million of 
first mortgage bonds only on the basis of refundable bonds. Toledo Edison 
would have been permitted to issue approximately $286 million of first 
mortgage bonds only on the basis of refundable bonds. 

Certain fixed charge and capitalization covenants contained in various 
financial agreements in an aggregate amount of $473 million will not be met 
as a result of the write-offs. The Companies have entered into discussions 
with the affected creditors to seek waivers or amendments where necessary.
