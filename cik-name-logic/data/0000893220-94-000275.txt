COLUMBIA GAS LITIGATION TRANSFERRED TO FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT

WILMINGTON, DEL. -- The Columbia Gas System, Inc., (NYSE:CG)

said challenges to intercompany transactions of Columbia Gas Transmission

Corporation, its principal pipeline subsidiary, have been transferred from the

Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware to the U.S. District Court of

Delaware by Federal District Court Judge Joseph J. Farnan Jr. The transfer had

been requested on May 13, 1994, by Bankruptcy Court Judge Helen Balick and

agreed to by all parties.

A complaint was filed with the Bankruptcy Court in February

1992 by Columbia Gas Transmission's Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors

challenging the validity of secured and unsecured debt Columbia Transmission

owes the parent company, its payment of dividends and interest to the parent

company and its transfer of natural resource property to another affiliate.

The Columbia Gas System, Inc., and Columbia Gas Transmission

have been operating as debtors in possession under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy

Code since July 31, 1991.
