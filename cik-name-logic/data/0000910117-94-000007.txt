Item 5. OTHER EVENTS.

On February 18, 1994, Americold Corporation (the
"Company") received notice from the United States Attorney for the
District of Kansas that a claim would be filed on behalf of the
United States Department of Agriculture (the "U.S.D.A.") as a
result of the December 1991 fire at the Company's Kansas City,
Kansas underground warehouse facility. Although no formal
complaint has been filed, the U.S. Attorney stated that it expects
to file a claim in the approximate amount of $68 million for fire-
related damage to commodity food-stuffs stored and computer
equipment utilized at the Company's Kansas City, Kansas facility. 
The U.S. Attorney stated that it could not verify the exact amount
of the damages at this time and did not state when a complaint
would be filed.

Although the Company carries substantial property,
liability, warehouseman's legal liability and business interruption
insurance, the claim submitted by the U.S. Attorney would, together
with other pending claims, exceed the Company's insurance coverage
by a material amount if such claims were established at trial. 
While the Company disputes it has any liability with respect to the
Kansas City fire, there can be no assurance that the Company will
not be found liable for damages or that the total damages resulting
from the fire will not exceed its insurance coverage. A settlement
conference was held on February 18-19, 1994 and a second conference
is expected to be scheduled for March 8-9, 1994. In addition,
further settlement discussions are anticipated prior to that time. 
Certain of the pending cases have been assigned a trial date of
April 12, 1994.

For further information regarding the Kansas City, Kansas
fire, reference is made to Part I, Item 2, "Management's Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--
Effect of Kansas City, Kansas Warehouse Fire" and Part II, Item 1,
"Legal Proceedings" of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 1993.
