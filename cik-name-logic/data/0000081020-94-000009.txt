Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
- - ---------------------

Electric operating revenues increased $33 million and
$142 million for the three and twelve month periods ended
March 31, 1994, respectively, over the comparable periods of
1993, primarily due to rate increases granted by regulatory
bodies in 1993 and to increases in electric sales volumes of 1.3%
and 5.2%. 

Gas operating revenues increased $37 million and $78 million
for the three and twelve month periods ended March 31, 1994,
respectively, over the comparable periods of 1993, due to the
operation of adjustment clauses reflecting increases in the
average cost of gas purchased, to rate increases granted by
regulatory bodies in 1993 and to increases in total volumes sold
and transported of 8.5% and 7.1%.

Gas purchased expense increased $20 million and $43 million
for the three and twelve month periods ended March 31, 1994,
respectively, over the comparable periods of 1993, due to
increases in the average cost per Mcf purchased of 9.1% and 13.3%
and to increases in volumes purchased of 6.3% and 3.2%.

Fuel used in electric production increased $21 million for
the twelve month period ended March 31, 1994, over the comparable
period of 1993, due to a 7.8% increase in the amount of
electricity generated.

Other operation expense increased $8 million and $25 million
for the three and twelve month periods ended March 31, 1994,
respectively, over the comparable periods of 1993, due to a
number of factors, including wage increases, the adoption of an
accounting standard involving postretirement benefits and
increases in gas production expenses.

Maintenance expense increased $5 million and $16 million for
the three and twelve month periods ended March 31, 1994,
respectively, over the comparable periods of 1993, primarily due
to increased maintenance on electric generating units and
electric distribution facilities. 

Depreciation expense increased $12 million for the twelve
month period ended March 31, 1994, primarily due to an increase
in depreciable plant in service, including Woodsdale Generating
Station.

<PAGE>
Post-in-service deferred operating expenses (net) of
$3 million for the twelve month period ended March 31, 1994
reflects the deferral of depreciation, operation and maintenance
expenses (exclusive of fuel costs), and property taxes related to
the first five units of Woodsdale Station between the time the
units began commercial operation and the effective date of new
rates which reflect these costs, in accordance with a stipulation
approved by The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO) in
August 1993. CG&E is amortizing these deferred expenses, as well
as similar deferrals associated with Zimmer Station, over 10-year
periods.

Phase-in deferred depreciation was $7 million for the twelve
month period ended March 31, 1994, as a result of a PUCO ordered
phase-in plan, in which rates charged to customers in the early
years of the plan are less than that required to fully recover
the depreciation expenses related to Zimmer Station (see "Future
Outlook" herein).

Taxes other than income taxes increased $9 million for the 
twelve month period ended March 31, 1994, over the comparable
period of 1993, primarily due to increased property taxes
resulting from a greater investment in taxable property
(including Woodsdale Station) and higher property tax rates, and
to higher public utilities gross receipts taxes resulting from
increased revenues.

Allowance for funds used during construction (AFC) decreased
$7 million for the twelve month period ended March 31, 1994, from
the comparable period of 1993, primarily due to a decrease in
construction work in progress resulting from Woodsdale Station
being placed in commercial operation.

Post-in-service carrying costs decreased $4 million for the
three month period ended March 31, 1994, from the comparable
period of 1993, as a result of discontinuing the accrual of
carrying costs on the first five units of Woodsdale Station
between the time it began commercial operation in mid-1992 until
the August 1993 effective date of new rates which reflect
Woodsdale Station. Post-in-service carrying costs decreased
$14 million for the twelve month period ended March 31, 1994,
from the comparable period of 1993, as a result of discontinuing
the accrual of carrying costs on Zimmer and Woodsdale Stations
when they were reflected in rates in May 1992 and August 1993,
respectively. 

Phase-in deferred return was $8 million and $31 million for
the three and twelve month periods ended March 31, 1994,
respectively, as a result of the PUCO ordered phase-in plan, in
which rates charged to customers in the early years of the plan
will be less than that required to provide the authorized return
on investment (see "Future Outlook" herein).

<PAGE>
In November 1993, CG&E wrote off costs associated with
Zimmer Station of approximately $223 million, net of taxes. The
write-off represents amounts disallowed from rate base by the
PUCO in its May 1992 rate order. CG&E had appealed the rate
order to the Supreme Court of Ohio; however, in November 1993,
the Supreme Court upheld the PUCO on the issue of the
disallowance, ruling that the PUCO properly excluded costs
related to nuclear fuel, nuclear wind-down activities and AFC
from CG&E s rate base.

Other (net) decreased $9 million for the twelve month period
ended March 31, 1994 due to a number of factors, including costs
associated with IPALCO Enterprises, Inc. s intervention in the
proposed merger between CG&E and PSI Resources.

Interest on long-term debt decreased $4 million for the
twelve month period ended March 31, 1994, primarily due to
refinancing $270 million and $280 million of first mortgage bonds
at lower rates in October 1992 and November 1993, respectively.

FUTURE OUTLOOK
- - --------------

Merger Agreement
- - ----------------

CG&E has entered into a merger agreement with PSI Resources,
Inc. (PSI) and PSI Energy, Inc., PSI's principal subsidiary, an
Indiana electric utility (PSI Energy) with a service area
contiguous to that of CG&E. Under the merger agreement, CG&E and
PSI will become subsidiaries of a newly formed corporation named
CINergy Corp., which will be a registered holding company under
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). In order
to effect the merger, each share of CG&E common stock will be
converted into one share of CINergy common stock, and each share
of PSI common stock will be converted into that number of shares
of CINergy common stock obtained by dividing $30.69 by the
average closing price of CG&E common stock for the 15 trading
days preceding the fifth day prior to consummation of the merger,
provided that the number of shares of CINergy stock to be
exchanged for each share of PSI will be no greater than 1.023 and
no less than .909. At March 31, 1994, CG&E and PSI had
88.5 million and 57.2 million common shares outstanding,
respectively. The merger will be accounted for as a
"pooling-of-interests", and will be tax-free for shareholders.

The merger is subject to approval by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC). Shareholders of each company have already
approved the CINergy merger at special meetings held in November
1993. CG&E presently anticipates that all approvals needed for
the merger will be received by the end of the third quarter of
1994.

<PAGE>
FERC issued conditional approval of the CINergy merger in
August 1993, but several intervenors, including the PUCO and the
Kentucky Public Service Commission (KPSC), filed for rehearing of
that order. On January 12, 1994, FERC withdrew its conditional
approval of the merger and ordered the setting of FERC-sponsored
settlement procedures to be held. 

On March 4, 1994, CG&E reached a settlement agreement with
the PUCO and the Ohio Office of Consumers' Counsel (OCC) on
merger issues identified by FERC. On March 2, PSI Energy and
Indiana's consumer representatives had reached a similar
agreement. Both settlement agreements have been filed with FERC.
These documents address, among other things, the coordination of
state and federal regulation and the commitment that neither CG&E
nor PSI electric base rates, nor CG&E's gas base rates, will rise
because of the merger, except to reflect any effects that may
result from the divestiture of CG&E's gas operations if ordered
by the SEC in accordance with the requirements of PUHCA discussed
below.

CG&E also filed with FERC a unilateral offer of settlement
addressing all issues raised in the KPSC's application for
rehearing with FERC. The settlement offer commits CG&E's
Kentucky subsidiary, The Union Light, Heat and Power Company
(Union Light), among other things, to "hold harmless" its retail
gas customers from the effects of the merger on Union Light's
retail gas base rates that become effective on or after the date
of the merger and prior to January 1, 2003. However, Union
Light's offer will not apply to any effects that may result from
the divestiture of Union Light's gas operations, discussed below.
Although it is the belief of CG&E and PSI that no state utility
commissions have jurisdiction over approval of the proposed
merger, an application was filed with the KPSC to comply with the
Staff of the KPSC's position that the KPSC's authorization is
required for the indirect acquisition of control of Union Light
by CINergy. A hearing on the KPSC application was held on
May 10, 1994. In testimony filed in the hearing, CG&E and Union
Light made, in addition to other commitments, an offer to the
KPSC that Union Light would also "hold harmless" retail electric
customers and would agree to an electric rate moratorium
commencing after Union Light's next retail rate case and
extending to January 1, 2000. An order on the application is
expected in mid-May. 

Also included in the filings with FERC were settlement
agreements with the city of Hamilton, Ohio, and the Wabash Valley
Power Association in Indiana. These agreements resolve issues
related to the transmission of power in Ohio and Indiana.

<PAGE>
On April 7, 1994, CG&E and the City of Cincinnati reached
settlement in support of the merger and filed a Joint Stipulation
and Agreement with FERC. CG&E has guaranteed, among other
things, that its electric retail customer rates will not rise
because of the merger and the City has agreed to support the
merger and CG&E's efforts to retain its gas operations before the
SEC.

The 30-day period for commenting on settlements and
agreements filed with FERC ended on April 21. During that
period, the FERC trial staff filed comments with the commission 
recommending that FERC approve the settlements. However, the
merger is still being opposed by various other parties. If the
settlement agreements are not acceptable, FERC could set issues
for hearing. If a hearing is held by FERC, consummation of the
merger would likely be extended beyond the third quarter of 1994.

CG&E and PSI also submitted to FERC the operating agreement
among CINergy Services, Inc., a subsidiary of CINergy, and CG&E
and PSI Energy that provides for the coordinated planning and
operation of the electric generation and transmission and other
facilities of CG&E and PSI as an integrated utility system. It
also establishes a framework for the equitable sharing of the
benefits and costs of such coordinated operations between CG&E
and PSI. The parties to the Ohio and Indiana FERC settlements
have agreed to support or not oppose the operating agreement, and
the settlements are conditioned upon FERC approving the filed
operating agreement without material changes.

CG&E's filing with FERC also references a separate agreement
among CG&E, the Staff of the PUCO, the OCC, and other parties
settling issues raised by a November 1993 ruling of the Supreme
Court of Ohio on the phased-in electric rate increase ordered by
the PUCO in May 1992. The agreement includes a moratorium on
increases in base electric rates prior to January 1, 1999 (except
under certain circumstances), authorization for CG&E to retain
all non-fuel merger savings until 1999, and a commitment by the
PUCO that it will support CG&E's efforts to retain CG&E's gas
operations in its PUHCA filing with the SEC (see below). The
PUCO approved this separate agreement on April 14, 1994. 
Reference is made to "Rate Matters" for additional information.

<PAGE>
PUHCA imposes restrictions on the operations of registered
holding company systems. Among these are requirements that
securities issuances, sales and acquisitions of utility assets or
of securities of utility companies and acquisitions of interests
in any other business be approved by the SEC. PUHCA also limits
the ability of registered holding companies to engage in
non-utility ventures and regulates the rendering of services by
holding company affiliates to the system s utilities. PUHCA has
been interpreted to preclude the ownership of both electric and
gas utility systems. As a result, the SEC may require
divestiture of the Company s gas properties within a reasonable
time after the merger. CG&E believes good arguments exist to
allow retention of its gas assets and will request that it be
allowed to do so.

Originally, the merger agreement provided that CG&E and PSI
would be merged into CINergy as an Ohio corporation. Under this
structure CG&E and PSI would have become operating divisions of
CINergy, ceasing to exist as separate corporations, and CINergy
would not have been subject to the restrictions imposed by PUHCA.
However, The Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission (IURC)
dismissed PSI s application for approval of the transfer of its
license or property to a non-Indiana corporation. The IURC s
decision has been appealed and the original merger structure
could be reinstated if the appeal is successful.

Unless otherwise noted, the following discussion pertains
solely to CG&E and its subsidiary companies, and any projections
or estimates contained therein do not reflect the pending merger.

Liquidity and Capital Resources
- - -------------------------------

The construction expenditures for CG&E and its subsidiaries
for the first quarter of 1994 were approximately $35 million
(including $.9 million of AFC) and are expected to be
$192 million for the year 1994. Over the next five years,
1994-1998, construction expenditures are expected to be $1,343
million (including AFC of $54 million). These estimates are
under continuing review and subject to adjustment. During the
next five years, a total of $142 million will be required for the
redemption of long-term debt and cumulative preferred stock at
maturity or in compliance with mandatory redemption requirements.
Reference is made to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
herein for information regarding the refinancing of long-term
debt and cumulative preferred stock.

<PAGE>
CG&E contemplates future debt and equity financings in the
capital markets and the issuance of additional shares of common
stock through its employee stock purchase plans and Dividend
Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. Short-term indebtedness
will be used to supplement internal sources of funds for the
interim financing of the construction program. The Company may
continue to sell additional securities, from time to time, beyond
what is needed for capital requirements to allow the early
refinancing of existing securities. 

Under the terms of CG&E s first mortgage indenture, at
March 31, 1994, CG&E would have been able to issue approximately
$880 million of additional first mortgage bonds.

As a result of the write-off of a portion of Zimmer Station
in November 1993, CG&E will have inadequate coverage to meet the
requirements of its articles of incorporation for issuing
additional shares of preferred stock until late December 1994.

CG&E has a $200 million bank revolving credit agreement that
will expire in September 1996. The agreement provides a back-up
source of funds for CG&E s commercial paper program. CG&E has
not made any borrowings under this agreement.

CG&E and its subsidiaries had lines of credit at March 31,
1994, of $123 million, of which $110 million remained unused. 
CG&E and its subsidiaries are currently authorized to have a
maximum of $235 million of short-term notes outstanding.

Rate Matters
- - ------------

Over the past two years, the Company has received a number
of electric and gas rate increases that will positively impact
future earnings. The primary reasons for the electric rate
increases were recovery of CG&E s investment in Zimmer Station,
Woodsdale Station and other facilities used to serve customers. 
The gas rate increases reflect investments in new and replacement
gas mains and facilities. As part of an August 1993 stipulation,
CG&E has agreed not to increase electric or gas base rates prior
to June 1, 1995, excluding rate filings made under certain
circumstances, such as to address financial emergencies or to
reflect savings associated with the merger with PSI.

In August 1993, the PUCO approved a stipulation authorizing
CG&E to increase annual electric revenues by $41.1 million and
increase annual gas revenues by $19.1 million. In May 1992, the
PUCO authorized CG&E to increase electric revenues by $116.4
million to be phased in over a three-year period through annual
increases beginning each May of $37.8 million in 1992, $38.8
million in 1993 and $39.8 million in 1994.

<PAGE>
In response to an appeal by CG&E of the PUCO s May 1992 rate
order, the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled, in November 1993, that
the PUCO did not have authority to order the phased-in rate
increase, and remanded the case to the PUCO to set rates that
provide the gross annual revenues determined in accordance with
Ohio statutes. The Court also said the PUCO must provide a
mechanism which allows CG&E to recover costs being deferred under
the phase-in plan through the date of the order on remand. At
March 31, 1994, CG&E had deferred $79 million of costs, net of
taxes, related to the phase-in plan.

In April 1994, the PUCO approved a settlement agreement
among CG&E, the PUCO Staff, the OCC and other intervenors
addressing the November 1993 ruling by the Supreme Court of Ohio.
As part of the settlement, CG&E has agreed not to seek early
implementation of the third phase of the May 1992 rate increase,
which means the $39.8 million increase will take effect in May
1994 as originally scheduled. CG&E also agreed that it would not
seek accelerated recovery of deferrals related to the phase-in
plan. These deferrals will be recovered over the remaining seven
year period contemplated in the May 1992 PUCO order. In
addition, if the merger with PSI is consummated, CG&E has agreed
not to increase base electric rates prior to January 1, 1999,
except for increases in taxes, changes in federal or state
environmental laws, PUCO actions affecting electric utilities in
general and financial emergencies. 

The settlement agreement also permits CG&E to retain all
non-fuel savings from the merger until 1999 and calls for merger-
related transaction costs, or any other accounting deferrals, to
be amortized over a period ending by January 1, 1999.

CINergy and affiliated companies; (iii) the PUCO will support,
before the SEC, CG&E's efforts to retain its gas operations and

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The accompanying information reflects, in the opinion of the
management of the Company, all adjustments necessary to present
fairly the results for the interim periods. All such adjustments
are of a normal recurring nature. Reference should be made to
the Company's Form 10-K for the year 1993 for additional footnote
disclosure, including a summary of significant accounting
policies.

Reference is made to "Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" herein for
information regarding the Company's merger with PSI Resources,
Inc. (PSI).

In April 1994, The Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
(PUCO) approved a settlement agreement among CG&E, the PUCO
Staff, the Ohio Office of Consumers' Counsel (OCC) and other
intervenors addressing the November 1993 ruling by the Supreme
Court of Ohio. As part of the settlement, CG&E has agreed not to
seek early implementation of the third phase of the May 1992 rate
increase, which means the $39.8 million increase will take effect
in May 1994 as originally scheduled. CG&E also agreed that it
would not seek accelerated recovery of deferrals related to the
phase-in plan. These deferrals will be recovered over the
remaining seven year period contemplated in the May 1992 PUCO
order. In addition, if the merger with PSI is consummated, CG&E
has agreed not to increase base electric rates prior to
January 1, 1999, except for increases in taxes, changes in
federal or state environmental laws, PUCO actions affecting
electric utilities in general and financial emergencies. 

The settlement agreement also permits CG&E to retain all
non-fuel savings from the merger until 1999 and calls for merger-
related transaction costs, or any other accounting deferrals, to
be amortized over a period ending by January 1, 1999.

Other provisions of the agreement are: (i) if the merger is
not completed, CG&E can raise electric rates in May 1995 by $21
million to provide accelerated recovery of phase-in deferrals;
(ii) the PUCO and OCC will have access to information about
CINergy and affiliated companies; (iii) the PUCO will support,
before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), CG&E's 
efforts to retain its gas operations and the other parties will 
not oppose efforts to retain the gas properties; and (iv) 
contracts of CG&E with affiliated companies under the merger that
are to be filed with the SEC must first be filed with the PUCO 
for its review and copies provided to the OCC.

<PAGE>
In January 1994, the Company issued $94.7 million principal
amount of pollution control revenue refunding bonds at interest
rates of 5.45% and 5 1/2%, the proceeds from which were used to
refund six different series of pollution control revenue bonds
with interest rates ranging from 6.70% to 9 5/8%.

In February 1994, the Company issued $220 million principal
amount of first mortgage bonds with interest rates of 5.80% and
6.45%, the proceeds from which were used to refund $210 million
principal amount of First Mortgage Bonds, consisting of the 
8 5/8% Series due 2000, 8.55% Series due 2006 and 9 1/8% Series
due 2008.

In April 1994, the Company redeemed all 400,000 shares of
its Cumulative Preferred Stock, 9.28% Series, $100 par value,
through internally generated funds. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 5. Other Information.
- - ------- -----------------

Employee Relations
- - ------------------

A new three-year contract has been negotiated with the 
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers representing
approximately 1,600 employees. In addition to benefit
improvements, the contract provides for wage increases of 3.5% in
1994 and 3.25% in 1995 and 1996.

A wage reopener provision for the third and final year of
the existing contract with the Independent Utilities Union, which
represents approximately 1,200 clerical and technical employees,
is currently being negotiated.

A collective bargaining agreement with the United
Steelworkers of America, representing about 500 employees in gas
operations, expires on May 15, 1994, and presently is being
negotiated.

Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information:
- - -----------------------------------------------------------------

The following pro forma condensed consolidated financial
information combines the historical consolidated statements of
income and consolidated balance sheets of CG&E and PSI after
giving effect to the merger. The unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and twelve month
periods ended March 31, 1994, give effect to the merger as if it
had occurred at April 1, 1993. The unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheet at March 31, 1994, gives effect to the
merger as if it had occurred at March 31, 1994. These statements
are prepared on the basis of accounting for the merger as a
pooling of interests and are based on the assumptions set forth
in the notes thereto. In addition, the following pro forma
condensed consolidated financial information should be read in
conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements
and related notes thereto of CG&E and PSI. The following
information is not necessarily indicative of the operating
results or financial position that would have occurred had the
merger been consummated at the beginning of the periods, or on
the date, for which the merger is being given effect, nor is it
necessarily indicative of future operating results or financial
position.

Notes to Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Information:

(1) The Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income
reflect the conversion of each share of CG&E common stock
outstanding into one share of CINergy common stock and each
share of PSI common stock outstanding into (a) .909 share
and (b) 1.023 shares of CINergy common stock. The actual
PSI conversion ratio may be lower than 1.023 or higher than
.909 depending upon the closing sales price of CG&E common
stock during a period prior to the consummation of the
merger. 

(2) The pro forma "Common stock" and "Paid-in capital" amounts
reflected in the Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance
Sheet are based on the conversion of each share of CG&E
common stock outstanding into one share of CINergy common
stock ($.01 par value) and each share of PSI common stock
outstanding into 1.023 shares of CINergy common stock ($.01
par value). Any PSI conversion ratio lower than 1.023 would
result in a reallocation of amounts between "Common stock"
and "Paid-in capital". However, any such reallocation would
have no effect on "Total common stock equity".

(3) Intercompany transactions (including purchased and exchanged
power transactions) between CG&E and PSI during the periods
presented were not material and accordingly no pro forma
adjustments were made to eliminate such transactions.

(4) Transaction costs, estimated to be approximately $47
million, are being deferred by CG&E and PSI. In a 
settlement agreement approved by the PUCO, CG&E has agreed
to, among other things, amortize its portion of merger-
related transaction costs over a period ending by January 1,
1999. CG&E will also be permitted to retain all of its non-
fuel savings from the merger until 1999. For additional
information on the settlement agreement, see Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. PSI's portion of the 
costs are being deferred for post-merger recovery through
customer rates.
