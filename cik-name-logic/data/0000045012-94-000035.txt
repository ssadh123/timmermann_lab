HALLIBURTON AND TIDEWATER SIGN DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

DALLAS, Texas -- Halliburton Company announced today that it
has entered into a definitive agreement with Tidewater Inc. for
the sale of Halliburton's natural gas compression business for
$205 million cash. In 1993 this business unit had revenues of
about $50 million from operations in the United States and
Canada. Closing of the sale, which is subject to receipt of
certain regulatory approvals, is expected to be completed by the
end of 1994.

Thomas H. Cruikshank, chairman of the board and chief
executive officer of Halliburton Company, said, "This sale will
complete another step in the strategic planning process we
started last year to focus our resources on the core capabilities
of our energy services business segment."

Halliburton Company is one of the world's largest
diversified energy services, engineering, maintenance, and
construction companies. Founded in 1919, Halliburton provides a
broad range of energy services and products, industrial and
marine engineering and construction services, and property and
casualty insurance services.
