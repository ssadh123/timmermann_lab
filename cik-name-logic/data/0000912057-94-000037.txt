PROSPECTUS SUMMARY

THIS SUMMARY IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY THE DETAILED INFORMATION AND
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING THE NOTES THERETO, APPEARING ELSEWHERE OR
INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT AND IN THE ACCOMPANYING
PROSPECTUS. PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FACTORS SET
FORTH HEREIN UNDER THE CAPTION "RISK FACTORS." CERTAIN CAPITALIZED TERMS USED
HEREIN ARE DEFINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT OR IN THE PROSPECTUS.
AS USED HEREIN, THE TERM "COMPANY" INCLUDES STONE CONTAINER CORPORATION, ITS
SUBSIDIARIES AND ITS AFFILIATES, EXCEPT AS THE CONTEXT OTHERWISE MAY REQUIRE.

THE COMPANY

GENERAL

The Company is a major international pulp and paper company engaged
principally in the production and sale of paper, packaging products, and
commodity pulp. The Company believes that it is the world's largest producer of
unbleached containerboard and kraft paper and the world's largest converter of
those products. The Company also believes that it is one of the largest paper
companies in terms of annual tonnage produced. The Company produced 5.0 million
tons and 4.9 million tons of unbleached containerboard and kraft paper in 1992
and 1991, respectively, which accounted for approximately 66% of its total
tonnage produced for both 1992 and 1991. The Company had net sales of
approximately $5.5 billion and $5.4 billion in 1992 and 1991, respectively.

The Company has increased dramatically in size over the past ten years,
primarily through four major acquisitions, including the 1989 acquisition of
Consolidated-Bathurst Inc. (a Canadian corporation, now renamed Stone Container
(Canada) Inc. ("Stone Canada")), and several smaller acquisitions. The
acquisition of Stone Canada increased the Company's market share in its core
business operations and provided the Company with the opportunity to pursue its
strategy to expand its production capacity and sales in international markets.
The Company owns or has an interest in 136 manufacturing facilities in the
United States, 27 in Canada, 15 in Germany, five in France, two in Belgium and
one in each of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The facilities include 24
mills. The Company also maintains sales offices in the United States, Canada,
the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, France, China and Japan.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

PROGRESS OF FINANCIAL PLAN

In 1993, the Company adopted a financial plan designed to enhance the
Company's liquidity, reduce amortization under certain bank credit agreements of
the Company and Stone Canada (the "Credit Agreements") and improve financial
flexibility. The Company completed a major portion of its financial plan during
1993 resulting in net proceeds to the Company and Stone Canada of approximately
$1.0 billion which the Company and Stone Canada used to repay indebtedness under
the Credit Agreements and fund operating losses and working capital needs. These
repayments satisfied the remaining September 1993 amortization of approximately
$118 million, the full 1994 amortization of approximately $409 million and
approximately $21 million of the March 1995 amortization under the Credit
Agreements. The Company had as of January 5, 1994 $60.0 million available for
borrowing out of a total revolving credit commitment of $315.8 million.

The transactions completed in 1993 were as follows:

- the sale in June, 1993 of $150 million of the Company's 12 5/8%
Senior Notes due 1998 and a concurrent private sale of $250
million principal amount of 8 7/8% Convertible Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2000.

- the public offerings in December 1993 by Stone-Consolidated
Corporation, a newly created Canadian subsidiary
("Stone-Consolidated"), of Cdn. $231 million of its common stock
(representing 25.4% of its outstanding common stock), Cdn. $231
million of its 8% Convertible Unsecured Subordinated Debentures
due 2003 and $225 million of its 10.25% Senior Secured Notes due
2000 (the "Stone-Consolidated Transaction"). Stone-Consolidated
now owns all of the Canadian and U.K. newsprint and groundwood
papers assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. The net
proceeds paid by Stone-Consolidated to the Company and Stone
Canada in connection with these offerings approximated $490
million.

S-3
<PAGE>
- the sale of the Company's 49% equity interest in Empaques de
Carton Titan, S.A., a Mexican corrugated container company
("Titan"), two of the Company's short line railroads and a
specialty packaging plant in Sheridan, Arkansas. The proceeds of
these three transactions approximated $125 million.

In connection with the completion of the Stone-Consolidated Transaction, the
Company also received approval from its bank group to extend the maturity date
of its revolving credit facilities from March 1, 1994 to March 1, 1997.

The final stages of the Company's current financial plan are as follows:

- the Offerings, from which the Company expects to use the net
proceeds to (i) prepay approximately $403 million of the remaining
1995 and March 1996 required amortization under the Credit
Agreements (including amortization payments under the Company's
revolving credit facilities reducing the total commitments
thereunder to approximately $224 million); (ii) redeem at par
approximately $98 million plus accrued interest of the Company's
13 5/8% Subordinated Notes due 1995; and (iii) repay
approximately $200 million of the borrowings under the Company's
revolving credit facilities without reducing the commitments
thereunder (or to the extent no borrowings are outstanding, the
Company may retain the balance in cash).

- the completion of a transaction involving a favorable energy
supply agreement relating to the Company's mill in Florence, South
Carolina. The proceeds of this transaction are subject to the
execution of definitive documentation and regulatory approval.
The gross proceeds of this transaction, which are currently
expected to be approximately $100 million, would be utilized to
repay borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities
without reducing commitments thereunder (or to the extent no
borrowings are outstanding, the Company may retain the balance in
cash). There can be no assurance, however, that this transaction
will be consummated or that the expected amount of proceeds from
such transaction will be received.

The completion of the Offerings will provide the Company with the following
benefits:

- repayment of all major amortization through the end of 1995
(except for revolving credit facilities relating to receivables
financings which the Company intends to extend or refinance).

- improvement of the Company's liquidity by repaying borrowings
under the revolving credit facility by $200 million (or to the
extent no borrowings are outstanding, the Company may retain the
balance in cash). As of January 5, 1994, the Company had $60.0
million available for borrowing out of a total revolving credit
commitment of $315.8 million.)

- improvement of the Company's financial flexibility through
amendments to the Credit Agreements (see "-- Amendments to Credit
Agreements").

PRODUCTS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS

The markets for products sold by the Company are highly competitive and are
also sensitive to cyclical changes in industry capacity and in the economy, both
of which can significantly influence selling prices and thereby the Company's
profitability. Although the Company has experienced declining product pricing in
all of its product lines over the last several years, the Company believes that
market conditions are present which should permit the Company to realize
improved product pricing in most of its product lines.

The Company implemented a $25 per ton price increase for linerboard
effective October 1, 1993, which raised the transaction price for the base grade
of linerboard to $325 per ton. This increase will not, however, restore prices
for linerboard to the levels present at the beginning of 1993. In addition, the
Company is in the process of final implementation of a corrugated container
price increase. The Company currently expects final implementation to occur in
the first quarter of 1994. As a result of strengthening demand, the Company
announced a further price increase of $30 per ton for linerboard effective in
January 1994. While the Company currently believes that it will implement this
price increase in the early part of 1994, there is little likelihood of
achieving the increase in January

S-4
<PAGE>
1994. There can be no assurance that prices will continue to increase or even be
maintained at present levels, but the Company believes the demand for linerboard
and the converted products produced from linerboard are increasing.

Pricing conditions for newsprint and groundwood paper have been volatile in
recent years. While the industry successfully implemented a price increase in
1992, efforts to maintain an additional price increase in 1993 were
unsuccessful. In 1993, Stone-Consolidated and other industry participants
attempted to balance supply and demand by taking downtime at selected production
facilities. Stone-Consolidated announced a $47.50 per metric ton price increase
for newsprint effective March 1, 1994 in light of recent industry improvements
in supply and demand characteristics. Other major North American producers have
announced similar price increases. There is no assurance, however, that such
price increases will be achieved as scheduled or at all.

Market pulp has also experienced volatile pricing in recent years. The
Company announced a price increase of $40 to $80 per ton in the various grades
of market pulp effective January 1, 1994 in light of improved supply and demand
characteristics in the industry. There is, however, significant world-wide
competition in this product line and no assurances can be given that such price
increases will be realized or maintained.

OPERATING PERFORMANCE

The Company will report a net loss for the full year 1993, which loss will
be greater than the loss incurred for 1992. The Company anticipates that the net
loss for the fourth quarter of 1993 will be within the expectations of paper
industry analysts. The losses incurred in 1993 and in the previous two years had
a severe negative impact on the Company's liquidity. The Company believes,
however, that the implementation of its financial plan significantly improves
the Company's liquidity. As of January 5, 1994, available borrowings under the
Company's revolving credit facilities were $60.0 million and upon consummation
of the Offerings, the Company's cash and available borrowings under such
facilities are expected to increase by approximately $200 million.

The Company believes that demand for its products has recently increased.
Production of linerboard for October and November 1993 versus the similar period
in 1992 increased 9%. The Company also increased its sales of corrugated
products (measured in terms of footage sold) by 4.5% for October and November
1993 versus the similar period in 1992. The production of newsprint and
groundwood papers increased by 2.6% for October and November 1993 versus the
similar periods in 1992. Production of market pulp, however, declined 5.1% for
the comparable period.

AMENDMENTS TO CREDIT AGREEMENTS

In connection with the Offerings, the Company is seeking amendments to the
Credit Agreements. The amendments, which are conditional upon the consummation
of the Offerings and the prepayment of a minimum of $385 million under the
Credit Agreements, contain the following provisions:

- Permit the repayment of borrowings under the revolving credit
facilities without reducing the commitments thereunder (or to
the extent no borrowings are outstanding, the Company may retain
the balance in cash) of up to $200 million with a portion of the
net proceeds from the Offerings.

- Permit the redemption of the Company's 13 5/8% Subordinated
Notes due 1995 with a portion of the net proceeds from the
Common Stock Offering.

S-5
<PAGE>
- Amend the EBITDA (as defined under the Credit Agreements)
covenant to require the Company to meet the following minimum
EBITDA levels:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
For the quarter ended 3/31/94................. $ 20 million
For the two quarters ended 6/30/94............ $ 55 million
For the three quarters ended 9/30/94.......... $111 million
For the four quarters ended 12/31/94.......... $180 million
For the four quarters ended 3/31/95........... $226 million
For the four quarters ended 6/30/95........... $300 million
For the four quarters ended 9/30/95........... $380 million
For the four quarters ended 12/31/95.......... $457 million
For the four quarters ended 3/31/96........... $567 million
For the four quarters ended 6/30/96........... $657 million
For the four quarters ended 9/30/96........... $735 million
and each four quarter period thereafter....... $822 million
</TABLE>

- Replace the existing cross-default provisions relating to
obligations of $10 million or more
of the Company's separately financed subsidiaries, Seminole Kraft
Corporation ("Seminole Kraft") and Stone Savannah River Pulp &
Paper Corporation ("Stone Savannah"), with cross-acceleration
provisions.

- Reset to zero as of January 1, 1994 the "dividend basket" under
the Credit Agreements which permits payment of dividends on the
Company's capital stock. The dividend basket under the Credit
Agreements as of September 30, 1993 had a deficit amount of
$334.1 million. On an ongoing basis, the dividend basket would be
increased by (a) 100% (rather than the current 50%) of the cash
proceeds of sales of Common Stock (other than proceeds of the
Common Stock Offering, for which no dividend credit would be
received) and permitted preferred stock and (b) 75% (rather than
the current 50%) of Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the
Credit Agreements) from January 1, 1994 and would be decreased by
100% of Consolidated Net Losses (as defined) from January 1,
1994. Additionally, restrictions with respect to dividends on the
Series E Preferred Stock would be modified to mirror the dividend
restrictions in the Company's Senior Subordinated Indenture dated
as of March 15, 1992. This should permit a higher dividend basket
for payment of dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock. See
"Description of Debt Securities -- Additional Terms of the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities -- Dividend Restrictions" in the
accompanying Prospectus.

- Replace the current prohibition of investments in Stone Venepal
(Celgar) Pulp Inc. with restrictions substantially similar to the
restrictions applicable to the Company's subsidiaries, Stone
Savannah and Seminole Kraft.

For a more complete description of the Credit Agreements, see "Credit
Agreements" in the accompanying Prospectus.

RISK FACTORS

BEFORE INVESTING, PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF THE NOTES SHOULD CAREFULLY
CONSIDER THE RISK FACTORS SET FORTH BELOW AND THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH
AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT AND THE ACCOMPANYING
PROSPECTUS.

SIGNIFICANT LEVERAGE AND DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS; LIMITED LIQUIDITY

The Company is significantly leveraged and will continue to be so after
completion of the Offerings. The Company's long-term debt to total
capitalization ratio was 74.3% at September 30, 1993. On a pro forma basis,
after giving effect to the Stone-Consolidated Transaction, the sale of the
Company's 49% equity interest in Titan, and the sale by the Company of its
interest in two short line railroads (the "1993 Fourth Quarter Transactions")
and the Offerings, and the use of the estimated net proceeds therefrom, such
ratio at September 30, 1993 would have been approximately 71.8%. Capitalization,
for purposes of this ratio, includes long-term debt, deferred income taxes,
redeemable preferred stock, minority interests and stockholders' equity. Giving
effect to the 1993 Fourth Quarter Transactions and the Offerings, the amounts of
long-term debt (excluding capitalized lease obligations) outstanding at
September 30, 1993 maturing during the next five years and thereafter are as
follows:

(1) Includes indebtedness of Stone Savannah, Seminole Kraft and
Stone-Consolidated. See "-- Credit Agreement Restrictions."
(2) The 1995 maturities include $261.3 million outstanding under Stone
Financial Corporation's and Stone Fin II Receivables Corporation's
revolving credit facilities, which the Company intends to extend or
refinance.
</TABLE>

The Company's income before interest expense and income taxes was
insufficient to cover interest expense for the nine months ended September 30,
1993 and 1992 and for the year ended December 31, 1992 by $346.8 million, $135.9
million and $229.3 million, respectively, and will continue to be insufficient
for at least 1994.

The Company's liquidity and financial flexibility is adversely affected by
continued losses which have resulted in utilization of a significant portion of
its revolving credit facilities (for which the borrowing availability was $60.0
million as of January 5, 1994). The net proceeds from the Offerings will be used
to (i) prepay approximately $403 million of the remaining 1995 and March 1996
required amortization under the Credit Agreements; (ii) redeem at par
approximately $98 million plus accrued interest of the Company's 13 5/8%
Subordinated Notes due 1995; and (iii) repay approximately $200 million of the
borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities without reducing the
commitments thereunder (or to the extent no borrowings are outstanding, the
Company may retain the balance in cash). See "Use of Proceeds." The Company is
also expecting to improve its liquidity and financial flexibility through a
transaction involving a favorable energy supply agreement relating to its mill
in Florence, South Carolina, the net proceeds of which would be applied to repay
borrowings under the revolving credit facilities without reducing commitments
thereunder (or to the extent no borrowings are outstanding, the Company may
retain the balance in cash). There can be no assurance, however, that this
transaction will be consummated or that the expected amount of proceeds from
such transaction will be received.

Notwithstanding the improvements in the Company's liquidity and financial
flexibility which will result from the Offerings and which would result from the
proposed energy supply contract transaction, unless the Company achieves
sustained price increases beyond current levels (including announced price
increases which have not yet been fully implemented as described under
"Prospectus Summary -- Recent Developments -- Products and Industry Trends"),
the Company will continue to incur net losses and a deficit in net cash provided
by operating

S-9
<PAGE>
activities. Without such sustained price increases, the Company may exhaust all
or substantially all of its cash resources and borrowing availability under the
revolving credit facilities. In such event, the Company would be required to
pursue other alternatives to improve liquidity, including further cost
reductions, sales of assets, the deferral of postponable capital expenditures,
obtaining additional sources of funds or pursuing the possible restructuring of
its indebtedness. There can be no assurance that such measures, if required,
would generate the liquidity required by the Company to operate its business and
service its indebtedness.

Beginning in 1996 and continuing thereafter, the Company will be required to
make significant amortization payments on its indebtedness which will require
the Company to raise sufficient funds from operations or other sources or
refinance or restructure maturing indebtedness. No assurance can be given that
the Company will be successful in doing so.

ADVERSE INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND CYCLICAL PRODUCT PRICING

The markets for paper, packaging products and commodity pulp sold by the
Company are highly competitive, and are sensitive to changes in industry
capacity and cyclical changes in the economy, both of which can significantly
impact selling prices and the Company's profitability. The markets for
containerboard and corrugated containers, which represent a substantial portion
of the Company's net sales, generally experienced price declines during the
period since 1990. The Company has, however, successfully implemented a $25 per
ton price increase for containerboard and is in the process of implementing a
price increase in corrugated containers. The Company expects to realize the
benefits of such price increase in the first quarter of 1994. Newsprint and
market pulp prices have also fallen substantially since 1990 due to
supply/demand imbalances. While newsprint prices generally increased in 1992, an
additional price increase announced in 1993 was unsuccessful. The Company has
announced a price increase for newsprint effective March 1, 1994 in light of
strengthening demand for newsprint. Market pulp prices, which had improved
modestly during 1992 from the low prices of 1991, began deteriorating in the
fourth quarter of 1992 and weakened further in 1993. The Company is also in the
process of implementing price increases effective January 1, 1994 for market
pulp of $40 to $80 per ton. There also can be no assurance that announced price
increases for the Company's products can be implemented, that prices for the
Company's products will not decline from current levels or that the Company will
not elect to take further economic downtime.

RECENT LOSSES; NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES

The Company incurred losses of $233.5 million (before taking into account
the cumulative effect of an accounting change) and $273.0 million (taking into
account such change) for the nine months ended September 30, 1993, $169.9
million (before taking into account the cumulative effect of an accounting
change) and $269.4 million (taking into account such change) in 1992 and $49.1
million in 1991. Net cash used in operating activities totalled $115.6 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 1993, while net cash provided by
operating activities totalled $46.5 million for the nine months ended September
30, 1992. The Company expects the fourth quarter of 1993 will have a deficit in
net cash provided by operating activities. The Company expects to incur a net
loss for the quarter ending December 31, 1993 that will be less than the loss
reported for the third quarter of 1993. See "Selected Consolidated Financial
Data." As a result of the net losses, it has been necessary for the Company to
obtain various amendments and waivers of certain covenants in the Credit
Agreements. See "Credit Agreements" in the accompanying Prospectus. If current
pricing levels for the Company's products do not significantly improve, the
Company will continue to incur losses. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Outlook" in the accompanying
Prospectus.

CREDIT AGREEMENT RESTRICTIONS

All indebtedness under the Credit Agreements is secured by a substantial
portion of the assets of the Company. The Credit Agreements contain certain
restrictions on the Company, including requirements that the Company achieve and
maintain certain financial ratios (including a minimum current ratio, an
indebtedness ratio, minimum "EBITDA" (as defined in the Credit Agreements) and a
tangible net worth test). The restrictions also include, among other things,
limitations on the ability of the Company to incur additional indebtedness, to
create, incur or permit the existence of certain liens, to make guarantees, to
make certain investments, to make aggregate capital expenditures above certain
levels, to make certain payments with respect to its outstanding stock, and to

S-10
<PAGE>
enter into certain types of transactions. In particular, the Credit Agreements
currently prohibit investments in Stone Venepal (Celgar) Pulp Inc., and
Stone-Consolidated. A default by Stone-Consolidated of any of its obligations in
excess of $10 million constitutes a default under the Credit Agreements.

The Credit Agreements also limit in certain specific circumstances any
further investments by the Company in two of its subsidiaries, Seminole Kraft
and Stone Savannah. Stone Savannah and Seminole Kraft have incurred substantial
indebtedness in connection with project financings and are significantly
leveraged. As of September 30, 1993, Stone Savannah had $413.8 million in
outstanding indebtedness (including $280.1 million in secured indebtedness owed
to bank lenders) and Seminole Kraft had $179.8 million in outstanding
indebtedness (including $117.5 million in secured indebtedness owed to bank
lenders). The Company has entered into separate output purchase agreements with
each subsidiary which require the Company to purchase the output of the mills
operated by each subsidiary at rates which are above current market rates until
September 30, 1994 for Seminole Kraft, until December 20, 1994 for linerboard
production at Stone Savannah and until November 14, 1995 for market pulp
production at Stone Savannah. After such dates, the Company is required to
purchase the respective productions at market prices for the remaining terms of
these agreements. At the time that the fixed price provisions of the output
purchase agreements terminate, such subsidiaries may need to undertake
additional measures to meet their debt service requirements, including obtaining
additional sources of funds, postponing or restructuring of debt service
payments or refinancing of the indebtedness. In the event that such measures are
required and are not successful, and such indebtedness is accelerated by the
respective lenders to Stone Savannah or Seminole Kraft, the lenders to the
Company under various of its debt instruments will be entitled to accelerate the
indebtedness owed by the Company. The cross-acceleration provisions in the
Credit Agreements are effective upon the completion of the Offerings. Prior to
the completion of the Offerings, the Credit Agreements contained cross-default
provisions similar to the cross-default provisions mentioned above for
Stone-Consolidated Corporation.

There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve and
maintain compliance with the prescribed financial ratio tests or other
requirements of the Credit Agreements. Failure to achieve or maintain compliance
with such financial ratio tests or other requirements under the Credit
Agreements, in the absence of a waiver or amendment, would result in an event of
default and could lead to the acceleration of the obligations under the Credit
Agreements. The Company has successfully sought and received waivers and
amendments to its Credit Agreements on various occasions since entering into the
Credit Agreements. Most recently, the Credit Agreements were modified to permit
the earnings from the sale of the Company's interest in Titan to be included in
EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreements), solely for purposes of satisfying
the minimum EBITDA requirement for the quarter ended December 31, 1993. On
December 17, 1993, the Company obtained approval of amendments to the Credit
Agreements in connection with the Stone-Consolidated Transaction which
permitted, among other things, Stone-Consolidated to grant liens on its property
to the holders of its 10.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2000 and the lenders under
its revolving credit facilities, and restricted Stone-Consolidated's ability to
pay dividends on its capital stock.

In connection with the Offerings, the Company is seeking further amendments
to the Credit Agreements which will, upon the effective date of the Offerings,
amend the Credit Agreements including to change certain financial covenants to
allow the Company to remain in compliance with the Credit Agreements. See
"Recent Developments -- Amendments to Credit Agreements." If further waivers or
amendments are requested by the Company, there can be no assurance that the
Company's bank lenders will again grant such requests. The failure to obtain any
such waivers or amendments would reduce the Company's flexibility to respond to
adverse industry conditions and could have a material adverse effect on the
Company. See "Credit Agreements -- Covenants" in the accompanying Prospectus.

FUTURE ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS

Giving effect to the Offerings, the Company will have sold securities on a
number of occasions in the last two years for total proceeds in excess of $2.0
billion. The recent issuance of a substantial amount of securities may make it
difficult, at least in the near future, for the Company to access the capital
markets for further financings and therefore may limit the Company's sources for
future liquidity.

S-11
<PAGE>
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The Company's operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation
by federal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatory
authorities with jurisdiction over its foreign operations. Such regulation
requires significant capital expenditures. On December 17, 1993, the
Environmental Protection Agency proposed regulations under the Clean Air Act and
the Clean Water Act for the pulp and paper industry which when implemented would
affect directly many of the Company's facilities. Since the regulations have
only recently been proposed, the Company is currently unable to estimate the
nature or level of future expenditures that may be required to comply. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations -- Financial Condition and Liquidity -- Environmental Issues" in the
accompanying Prospectus. In addition, the Company is from time to time subject
to litigation and governmental proceedings regarding environmental matters in
which injunctive and/or monetary relief is sought. The Company has been named as
a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at a number of sites which are the
subject of remedial activity under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA" or "Superfund") or comparable state
laws. Although the Company is subject to joint and several liability imposed
under Superfund, at most of the multi-PRP sites there are organized groups of
PRPs and costs are being shared among PRPs. The Company currently believes that
adequate provisions have been established for these sites and that such costs
will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on
its financial position or future operating results.

DIVIDEND SUSPENSION; LIMITATIONS ON PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS

Due to limitations and restrictions imposed on the Company under the Credit
Agreements, certain indentures and the Company's recent net losses, the Company
was unable to declare a cash dividend on its Common Stock in the third and
fourth quarters of 1992 and all four quarters of 1993. Whether the Board of
Directors declares any future cash dividends on the Common Stock will depend
upon the Company's future earnings, financial condition and capital needs and
other factors deemed pertinent by the Board of Directors. In addition, the
payment of dividends on the Common Stock will be subject to restrictions and
limitations contained in the Credit Agreements, other credit facilities and
indentures and the Certificate of Incorporation.

The Company is also currently prohibited from paying dividends under the
indenture dated as of March 15, 1992 between the Company and The Bank of New
York, as trustee, relating to senior subordinated indebtedness. At September 30,
1993, the dividend pool under the Company's Senior Subordinated Indenture dated
March 15, 1992 had a deficit of $136.1 million. Such dividend pool will be
reduced by 100% of the net losses for the fourth quarter of 1993 and any
subsequent periods and increased by the aggregate net proceeds received by the
Company from the issuance of Common Stock, including the Common Stock Offering.
At September 30, 1993, the dividend pool under the Credit Agreements had a
deficit of approximately $334.1 million. The dividend pool under the Credit
Agreements will be reset to zero as of January 1, 1994 pursuant to the amendment
to the Credit Agreements which will be effected at the completion of this
offering of Common Stock. See "Recent Developments -- Amendments to Credit
Agreements."

The Company is also prohibited from paying dividends on its Series E
Preferred Stock and has not paid dividends on its Series E Preferred Stock since
May 15, 1993. As of December 31, 1993, accrued and unpaid dividends on the
Series E Preferred Stock aggregated $4.0 million. Unless full cumulative
dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock have been paid or provided for, no
dividends may be paid on the Common Stock. If the Company fails to pay any six
quarterly dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock, then the holders of the
Series E Preferred Stock, voting together as a class, shall have the right to
elect two directors to be added to the Company's board of directors. The
limitations contained in the Credit Agreements pertaining to the payment of
future Series E Preferred Dividends will be based upon the limitation contained
in the Company's Senior Subordinated Indenture dated March 15, 1992. See "Credit
Agreements," "Price Range of Common Stock and Dividend Policy" and "Description
of Capital Stock -- Series E Preferred Stock."

The Company does not intend to pay any dividends on its Common Stock until
such dividends are permitted by the Credit Agreements, the applicable indentures
and the terms of the Series E Preferred Stock and at such time as the Board of
Directors believes that any such payment will not impair the Company's cash
availability for operations and debt service.

DILUTION; CONVERSION OF CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES

The 8 7/8% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2000 (the "8 7/8%
Notes") are convertible into Common Stock at a conversion price of $11.55 per
shares, subject to adjustment in certain events. If all of the 8 7/8% Notes were
converted into Common Stock, an additional 21,645,022 shares of Common Stock
would be issued. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that the
conversion of the 8 7/8% Notes into Common Stock or the fact that the 8 7/8%
Notes are outstanding and unconverted will have on the market price of the
Common Stock prevailing from time to time. The conversion of 8 7/8% Notes into
Common Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of the Common
Stock. Certain other securities of the Company are convertible at much higher
conversion prices. The 4,600,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock are
convertible at the option of the holder into up to 3,388,332 shares of Common
Stock at a conversion price of $33.94, subject to adjustment under certain
conditions. The Company's $115,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6 3/4%
Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2007 are convertible at the option of
the holder into up to 3,388,332 shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of
$33.94 per share, subject to adjustment under certain conditions. See
"Description of Capital Stock."

Assuming no conversion of convertible securities, the net tangible book
value per share at September 30, 1993 after giving effect to the 1993 Fourth
Quarter Transactions and prior to giving effect to the Common Stock Offering was
approximately $(9.00) and the net tangible book value per share at September 30,
1993 after giving effect to the estimated net proceeds of the Common Stock
Offering at an assumed offering price of $11.25 per share and the receipt by the
Company of the estimated proceeds therefrom, is approximately $(4.54). The
amount of the increase in net tangible book value per share attributable to the
estimated cash payments to be made by purchasers of the Common Stock is
approximately $4.46 and the amount of the immediate dilution from the public
offering price which will be absorbed by such purchasers is equivalent to the
public offering price since the net tangible book value after giving effect to
the Common Stock Offering is negative.

In December 1993, Stone-Consolidated issued Cdn. $231 million of 8%
Convertible Unsecured Subordinated Debentures due 2003. If all of the 8%
Convertible Unsecured Subordinated Debentures due 2003 are converted to common
shares of Stone-Consolidated, the Company's ownership of the common shares of
Stone-Consolidated would be reduced from 74.6% to 61.1% of the outstanding
shares.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS

The Company's Certificate of Incorporation and the Series D Rights (as
defined) issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement (as defined) contain certain
provisions that could make more difficult or discourage a change in control of
the Company. These provisions are designed to discourage situations in which the
Company is forced to accept a proposal for the takeover of the Company without
ample time to evaluate the proposal and appropriate alternatives and to
encourage anyone contemplating a business combination with the Company to
negotiate directly with the Company on a fair and equitable basis. See
"Description of Capital Stock." However, these provisions may discourage certain
takeover proposals that would permit stockholders to sell or exchange their
equity securities of the Company for an amount that includes a premium over the
then market price for such securities.

USE OF PROCEEDS

The net proceeds to the Company from the Offerings are estimated to
aggregate $ million ($ million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option
with respect to the Common Stock Offering is exercised in full). Such proceeds
will be used to repay indebtedness of the Company and for general corporate
purposes, as set forth below. For further information on the interest rate,
maturity and other terms with respect to the Company's indebtedness, see
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations -- Financial Condition and Liquidity" and "Credit Agreements" in the

(1) On September 15, 1992, the Company paid a 2% stock dividend (approximately
1.4 million shares) to record holders of its Common Stock as of August 25,
1992. The amounts set forth in the table for the periods prior to August 15,
1992 have not been restated to reflect such stock dividend.
</TABLE>

On January 5, 1994, the reported closing price for the Common Stock on the
NYSE Composite Tape was $11.25 per share.

Due to limitations and restrictions imposed on the Company under the Credit
Agreements (including those described below) and the Company's recent net
losses, the Company was unable to declare a cash dividend on its Common Stock in
the third and fourth quarters of 1992 and all four quarters of 1993. Whether the
Board of Directors declares any future cash dividends will depend upon the
Company's future earnings, financial condition and capital needs and other
factors deemed pertinent by the Board of Directors, and will be subject to
restrictions and limitations contained in the Company's Credit Agreements and
other credit facilities and indentures. See "Credit Agreements." The Company
does not intend to pay any dividends on its Common Stock until such dividends
are permitted by the Credit Agreements and at such time as it believes that any
such payment will not impair the Company's cash availability for operations and
debt service.

The most restrictive limitation on the payment of cash dividends is
currently contained in the Credit Agreements. The Credit Agreements provide that
the Company's dividend payments, distributions or purchases of any class of
capital stock of the Company or its subsidiaries cannot exceed the sum of $50
million, plus (i) 50% of the consolidated net income (as defined in the Credit
Agreements) of the Company from April 1, 1991 to the date of payment of such
dividends, minus (ii) 100% of the consolidated net loss (as defined in the
Credit Agreements) of the Company from April 1, 1991 to the date of payment of
such dividends, plus (iii) 50% of the net cash proceeds from

S-18
<PAGE>
sales of Common Stock or certain preferred stock of the Company from April 1,
1991 to any date of payment of such dividends. The Credit Agreements also
provide that, with respect to the first cash dividend to be declared after
September 1, 1992, such declaration cannot be made unless the unused portion of
the revolving credit facilities (net of any unused portion required to be
reserved for capital expenditures) is at least equal to $96 million plus the
amount of such cash dividend. At September 30, 1993, the dividend pool under the
Credit Agreements had a deficit of approximately $334.1 million. See "Credit
Agreements."

Following consummation of the Offerings, the dividend pool will be reset to
zero as of January 1, 1994 and other restrictions will be liberalized. See
"Recent Developments -- Amendments to Credit Agreements."

The Company is also currently prohibited from paying dividends under the
Indenture dated as of March 15, 1992 between the Company and The Bank of New
York, as trustee relating to senior subordinated indebtedness. At September 30,
1993, the dividend pool under such indenture was negative $136.1 million. Such
dividend pool will be reduced by 100% of the net losses for the fourth quarter
of 1993 and any subsequent periods and increased by the aggregate net proceeds
received by the Company from the issuance of Common Stock, including the Common
Stock offering. In addition, the indentures relating to the Company's
outstanding senior indebtedness, other senior subordinated indebtedness and the
13 5/8% Notes contain restrictions on the Company's ability to pay dividends.
The 13 5/8% Subordinated Notes due 1995 will be redeemed from the proceeds of
the Common Stock Offering. See "Description of Debt Securities -- Particular
Terms of the Senior Debt Securities -- Certain Covenants -- Dividend
Restrictions" and "-- Additional Terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities -- Dividend Restrictions" in the accompanying Prospectus.

UNDERWRITING

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the U.S. Underwriting
Agreement among the Company and Salomon Brothers Inc, Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc.
and BT Securities Corporation, as representatives of the several U.S.
Underwriters, (the "U.S. Representatives") the Company has agreed to sell to the
U.S. Underwriters, and the U.S. Underwriters have severally agreed to purchase,
the respective number of shares of Common Stock set forth opposite their names

</TABLE>

The U.S. Underwriting Agreement provides that the obligations of the U.S.
Underwriters are subject to certain conditions precedent and that the U.S.
Underwriters will be obligated to purchase all of the Common Stock offered in
the U.S. Offering if any is purchased. It is a condition precedent to the U.S.
Underwriters' obligations to purchase the Common Stock offered in the U.S.
Offering pursuant to the U.S. Underwriting Agreement that the sale of the Notes
by the Company occur simultaneously.

The U.S. Representatives have advised the Company that they propose
initially to offer the Common Stock directly to the public at the public
offering price set forth on the cover page of this Prospectus Supplement and to
certain dealers at such price less a concession not in excess of $. per share.
The U.S. Underwriters may allow, and such dealers may reallow, a concession not
in excess of $. per share on sales to certain other dealers. After the initial
offering, the public offering price and concessions to dealers may be changed.

The Company has granted to the U.S. Underwriters and the international
managers of the International Offering ("International Managers") options to
purchase up to an additional 2,625,000 shares and 525,000 shares of Common
Stock, respectively, at the initial offering price less the aggregate
underwriting discounts and commissions. Either or both options may be exercised
at any time up to 30 days after the date of this Prospectus Supplement. The
Company has entered into an International Underwriting Agreement with the
International Managers providing for the concurrent offer and sale of 3,500,000
shares of Common Stock in Europe. The offering price and aggregate underwriting
discounts and commissions per share for the two Common Stock Offerings are
identical. The closing of the U.S. Offering is a condition to the closing of the
International Offering, and vice versa. The representatives of the International
Managers are Salomon Brothers International Limited, Bear Stearns International
Limited, and Bankers Trust International PLC.

The U.S. Underwriters and the International Managers have entered into an
Agreement Between Underwriters and Managers pursuant to which each U.S.
Underwriter has agreed that, as part of the distribution of the shares of Common
Stock offered in the U.S. Offering and subject to certain exceptions, (a) it is
not purchasing any such shares for the account of an International Person (as
defined below), (b) it has not offered or sold, and will not offer, sell, resell
or deliver, directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock or distribute any
prospectus relating to the Common Stock to anyone other than a U.S. or Canadian
Person (as defined below) and (c) any dealer to whom it may sell any of the
shares of Common Stock will represent and agree that it will comply with the
restrictions set forth in (a) and (b) and will not offer, sell, resell or
deliver, directly or indirectly, any of the shares or distribute any prospectus
relating to the Common Stock to any other dealer who does not so represent and
agree. In addition, pursuant to the Agreement Between Underwriters and Managers,
each International Manager has agreed that, as part of the distribution of the
shares of Common Stock offered in the International Offering and subject to
certain exceptions, (a) it is not purchasing any such shares for the account of
anyone other than an International Person, (b) it has not offered or sold, and
will not offer, sell, resell or deliver, directly or indirectly, any shares of
Common Stock or distribute any prospectus relating to the Common Stock to anyone
other than an International Person and (c) any dealer to whom it may sell any of
the shares of Common Stock will represent and agree that it will comply

S-22
<PAGE>
with the restrictions set forth in (a) and (b) and will not offer sell, resell
or deliver, directly or indirectly, any of the shares or distribute any
prospectus relating to the Common Stock to any other dealer who does not so
represent and agree.

The foregoing limitations do not apply to stabilization transactions or to
transactions among the U.S. Underwriters and the International Managers pursuant
to the Agreement Between Underwriters and Managers. As used herein, "United
States" means the United States of America (including the District of Columbia)
and its territories, its possessions and other areas subject to its
jurisdiction, "Canada" means Canada, its provinces, territories, possessions and
other areas subject to its jurisdiction, and "U.S. or Canadian Person" means a
citizen or resident of the United States or Canada, a corporation, partnership
or other entity created or organized in or under the laws of the United States
or Canada or any political subdivision thereof, or any estate or trust the
income of which is subject to United States or Canadian income taxation,
regardless of its source (other than a foreign branch of such entity) and
includes any United States or Canadian branch of a person other than a U.S. or
Canadian Person. As used herein, the term "International Person" means any
person, corporation, partnership or other entity which is not a U.S. or Canadian
Person.

Pursuant to the Agreement Between Underwriters and Managers, sales may be
made between the U.S. Underwriters and the International Managers of such number
of shares of Common Stock as may be mutually agreed. The price of any shares so
sold shall be the initial public offering price, less an amount not greater than
the selling concession. To the extent that these are sales between the U.S.
Underwriters and the International Managers, pursuant to the Agreement Between
Underwriters and Managers; the number of shares initially available for sale by
the U.S. Underwriters or by the International Managers may be more or less than
the amount specified on the cover page of this Prospectus Supplement.

The Company has agreed to indemnify the Underwriters against certain civil

THE COMPANY

GENERAL
The Company is a major international pulp and paper company engaged
principally in the production and sale of paper, packaging products and
commodity pulp. The Company believes that it is the world's largest producer of
unbleached containerboard and kraft paper and the world's largest converter of
those products. The Company also believes that it is one of the largest paper
companies in terms of annual tonnage produced. The Company produced 5.0 million
tons and 4.9 million tons of unbleached containerboard and kraft paper in 1992
and 1991, respectively, which accounted for approximately 66% of its total
tonnage produced for both 1992 and 1991. The Company had net sales of
approximately $5.5 billion and $5.4 billion in 1992 and 1991, respectively. As
used herein, the term "Company" includes Stone Container Corporation, its
subsidiaries and its affiliates, except as the context otherwise may require.

The Company has increased dramatically in size over the past ten years,
primarily through four major acquisitions, including the 1989 acquisition of
Consolidated-Bathurst Inc. (a Canadian corporation, now renamed Stone Container
(Canada) Inc. ("Stone Canada")), and several smaller acquisitions. The
acquisition of Stone Canada increased the Company's market share in its core
business operations and provided the Company with the opportunity to pursue its
strategy to expand its production capacity and sales in international markets.

OPERATIONS
The following table presents actual annual mill production capacity of the
Company at December 31, 1992 and at December 31, 1991:

(a) Includes 25% of production capacity of the Celgar mill, 49% of the
facilities of Empaques de Carton Titan, S.A. and 100% of Seminole Kraft and
Stone Savannah River mills.
</TABLE>

The paperboard and paper packaging segment of the Company's business
includes the manufacture of linerboard, corrugating medium and kraft paper,
among other products. Linerboard and corrugating medium are the basic materials
used in the manufacture of corrugated containers. Kraft paper is primarily used
to produce paper bags and sacks. The Company's principal customers for
linerboard, corrugating medium and kraft paper are its corrugated container
division and its bag divisions. In 1992 and 1991, those divisions consumed
approximately 88% and 87%, respectively, of the Company's aggregate production
of linerboard, corrugating medium and kraft paper.

The Company has more than 100 board converting operations, which produced
and shipped approximately 51.7 billion square feet and 49.2 billion square feet
of corrugated containers in 1992 and 1991, respectively. Corrugated shipments by
U.S. facilities were approximately 12% of the total U.S. industry shipments in
both 1992 and 1991. Corrugated containers are sold in a broad range of markets.

The Company operates 19 kraft paper converting facilities, which shipped
approximately 689 thousand tons and 735 thousand tons of paper bags and sacks
nationwide in 1992 and 1991, respectively. These shipments represented
approximately 34% and 35% of the total U.S. industry shipments for 1992 and
1991, respectively. The Company believes that it is the leading North American
producer of paper bags and sacks. Kraft paper is converted at the Company's
plants into grocery bags and sacks, merchandise bags and multiwall shipping
sacks. Grocery

3
<PAGE>
bags and sacks are sold primarily to supermarket chains; merchandise bags are
sold primarily to retailers of consumer products; and multiwall shipping sacks
are sold to the agricultural, chemical and cement industries, among others.

Wood fiber, particularly from wood chips, and waste paper constitute the
basic raw materials for linerboard, corrugating medium, unbleached kraft paper,
newsprint, groundwood paper and market pulp. Wood fiber resources are available
within economic proximity of the mills and the Company has not experienced any
significant difficulty in obtaining such resources, although environmental
concerns in the Pacific Northwest (including the designation of the spotted owl
as a threatened species) have reduced the supply of wood in that region.
Consistent with its strategy to obtain long-term wood fiber sources without the
costs associated with land ownership, the Company sold approximately 329
thousand acres of timberland during the years 1988 through 1992. This acreage
had been owned by Southwest Forest Industries, Inc., now named Stone Southwest,
Inc., which was acquired by the Company in 1987. At December 31, 1992, the
Company had approximately 14 thousand and 343 thousand acres of private fee
timberland in the United States and Canada, respectively. The Company assists
certain landowners in the Southeastern United States in managing approximately
2.0 million acres of timberland.

Recycled fiber, one of the Company's principal raw material components along
with wood fiber, must be purchased in a price sensitive market. The Company
believes that the demand for recycled fiber will increase and expects that the
cost of purchasing recycled fiber will also increase as a result of increased
demand and market conditions. As a result of the recognition of greater recycled
fiber utilization in the United States, the Company and WMX (formerly Waste
Management of North America) have formed a joint venture, Paper Recycling
International, L.P., which will assist the Company in the procurement of waste
fiber.

The Company's business is not dependent upon a single customer or upon a
small number of major customers. The loss of any one customer would not have a
material adverse effect on the Company.

The Company's products and the raw materials needed to manufacture those
products have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. Cyclical
economic factors such as growth in the economy generally, interest rates,
unemployment levels and fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had a
significant impact on prices and sales of the Company's products. The
availability and cost of wood fiber, including wood chips, and waste paper may
be subject to substantial variation, depending upon economic, political and
conservation considerations.

As of December 31, 1992, the Company had approximately 31,200 employees, of
whom approximately 21,900 were employees of U.S. operations and the remainder
were employees of foreign operations. Of those in the United States,
approximately 13,900 are union employees.

At March 1, 1993, the Company's founders and individual members of their
families, in the aggregate but not as a group, owned approximately 13.5 million
shares of the Company's Common Stock, constituting approximately 19% of the
approximately 71 million then-outstanding shares of Common Stock.

The Company is incorporated in Delaware and its Common Stock is listed on
the New York Stock Exchange. The Company's executive offices are located at 150
North Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60601; telephone number (312) 346-6600.

USE OF PROCEEDS

Unless otherwise specified in the Prospectus Supplement, the net proceeds to
be received by the Company from the sale of the Securities will be used to repay
indebtedness outstanding under the Company's Credit Agreements or to refinance
certain indebtedness as permitted thereunder. The terms of the Credit Agreements
require, except in certain circumstances, the application of proceeds resulting
from an offering of the Securities to be applied against indebtedness then
outstanding thereunder. See "Credit Agreements." Pending use for these purposes,
the Company may invest proceeds from the sale of the Securities in short-term
marketable securities.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE
SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA AND THE HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (AND RELATED NOTES) OF THE COMPANY INCLUDED OR INCORPORATED BY
REFERENCE IN THIS PROSPECTUS.

GENERAL

The Company's major products are containerboard and corrugated containers,
newsprint and market pulp. The markets for paper, packaging products and
commodity pulp sold by the Company are highly competitive and sensitive to
industry capacity and cyclical changes in the economy that can significantly
impact selling prices and the Company's profitability. The Company's sales and
operating results have, in recent years, been more sensitive to price changes
than to changes in sales volume.

The markets for containerboard and corrugated containers, which represent a
substantial portion of the Company's net sales, generally experienced price
declines in the period 1990 through the third quarter of 1993 (except for one
increase in August 1991), and, despite increasing industry-wide capacity
utilization (which is now at approximately the same level as 1989), the Company
was unable to implement announced price increases for these products in 1992 or
for the first nine months of 1993. In prior periods, comparable levels of
capacity utilization supported higher product pricing.

Additions to industry-wide capacity for newsprint and market pulp and
declines in demand for such products during the past three years have led to
supply/demand imbalances that have contributed to depressed prices for these
products. The newsprint industry, which began discounting sales prices in 1990,
was adversely affected by progressively increasing price discounts throughout
1991 and most of 1992, although such discounts were partially reversed in the
fourth quarter of 1992 and the first quarter of 1993 when discounts were
reduced. During this time, new production capacity in the industry came on line,
approximating two million tons annually, representing an approximate 12%
increase in capacity. At the same time, U.S. consumption of newsprint fell, due
to declines in readership and ad linage. As prices fell, certain high cost paper
machines, representing approximately 1.2 million tons and located mostly in
Canada, were shut down. Market pulp prices, which had improved modestly during
1992 from the low prices of 1991, began deteriorating in the fourth quarter of
1992 and have weakened further in 1993.

If current pricing levels for the Company's products do not significantly
improve, the Company will continue to incur net losses.

Due to the industry conditions described above and the Company's highly
leveraged capital structure and related interest expense associated with
indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition of Stone Canada, the Company
has incurred net losses in each of the last two years and the first nine months
of 1993 and expects to incur a net loss for the full year 1993. In 1992, the
Company suspended payment of cash dividends on its Common Stock. The Company is
pursuing a financial plan that is intended to enhance the Company's liquidity
and increase its financial flexibility. See "-- Financial Condition and
Liquidity -- Outlook."

</TABLE>

NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1993 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER
30, 1992

The net loss for the third quarter of 1993 was $99.2 million, or $1.42 per
share of common stock, compared to the net loss of $43.2 million, or $.64 per
share of common stock for the third quarter of 1992.

For the nine months ended September 30, 1993, the loss before the cumulative
effect of a change in the accounting for postretirement benefits other than
pensions was $233.5 million, or $3.36 per share of common stock. The adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 "Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions" ("SFAS 106"), effective January 1,
1993, resulted in a one-time, non-cash cumulative effect charge of $39.5 million
net of income taxes or $.56 per share of common stock, resulting in a net loss
of $273.0 million or $3.92 per share of common stock. For the nine months ended
September 30, 1992, the restated loss before the cumulative effect of a change
in the accounting for income taxes was $93.2 million, or $1.38 per share of
common stock. The adoption of SFAS 109, which the Company adopted retroactive to
January 1, 1992, resulted in a one-time, non-cash cumulative effect charge of
$99.5 million, or $1.40 per share of common stock, resulting in a restated net
loss of $192.7 million, or $2.78 per share of common stock. The Company's income
tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 1993 includes a third
quarter adjustment for the retroactive increase in the U.S. federal income tax
rate and an enacted decrease in German tax rates, the effects of which
substantially offset each other, and a second quarter favorable adjustment of
approximately $5 million which reflects the effect of a reduction in the
Canadian statutory income tax rate.

The increases in the losses before the cumulative effects of the accounting
changes were primarily due to lower average selling prices for most of the
Company's products. Additionally, the Company's operating results for the 1993
third quarter were negatively impacted by market-related production downtime.
The mills involved have all resumed production and are currently operating at
normal levels.

PAPERBOARD AND PAPER PACKAGING:

Net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 1993 for the
paperboard and paper packaging segment decreased 14.4 percent and 9.7 percent,
respectively over the comparable prior year periods. This

7
<PAGE>
decrease was due in part to the exclusion of sales for the Company's European
folding carton operations which earlier this year were merged into a joint
venture and accordingly is now accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. Sales from these operations were approximately $48 million and $136
million for the third quarter and first nine months of 1992, respectively. Sales
for 1993 were approximately $60 million prior to the merger in May. Excluding
the effect of the joint venture, sales for the third quarter and first nine
months decreased 10.6 percent and 7.6 percent from the year ago periods
reflecting lower sales of paperboard, corrugated containers, kraft paper and
paper bags and sacks. The sales decreases for paperboard reflect both reduced
sales volume and lower average selling prices while the sales decreases for
kraft paper and paper bags and sacks were mainly attributable to lower sales
volume. Sales of corrugated containers for the third quarter and nine months
ended September 30, 1993, as compared to the prior year periods, decreased as
sales volume increases were offset by lower average selling prices, particularly
during the third quarter.

Shipments of corrugated containers, including the Company's proportional
share of the shipments by its foreign affiliates, were 13.6 billion square feet
in the third quarter of 1993, compared with 13.3 billion square feet for the
comparable prior year period. For the first nine months of 1993, the Company
shipped 39.8 billion square feet of corrugated containers, compared with 39.3
billion square feet shipped during the first nine months of 1992. Shipments of
paper bags and sacks were 156 thousand tons and 459 thousand tons for the three
and nine month periods ended September 30, 1993, respectively, compared with 177
thousand tons and 522 thousand tons shipped during the comparable 1992 periods.

Production of containerboard and kraft paper for the three and nine month
periods ended September 30, 1993, including 100 percent of the production at
Seminole Kraft Corporation ("Seminole") and Stone Savannah River Pulp & Paper
Corporation ("Stone Savannah River"), was 1.17 million tons and 3.58 million
tons, respectively, compared to 1.23 million tons and 3.75 million tons produced
during the comparable prior year periods.

Operating income for the paperboard and paper packaging segment decreased
70.8 percent and 49.0 percent for the three months and nine months ended
September 30, 1993, respectively, as compared to the corresponding 1992 periods.
The decreases were mainly attributable to reduced operating margins primarily
resulting from lower average selling prices for containerboard and corrugated
containers.

WHITE PAPER AND PULP:

Net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 1993 for the white
paper and pulp segment decreased 24.1 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively,
from the prior year periods, primarily due to significant declines in sales of
market pulp. Additionally, decreases in newsprint sales, particularly during the
1993 third quarter, contributed to the lower sales. Partially offsetting the
sales decreases for market pulp and newsprint were increases for sales of
groundwood paper. The sales declines for market pulp were primarily attributable
to significantly lower average selling prices. Reduced sales volume during the
1993 periods also contributed to the lower market pulp sales. The decrease in
newsprint sales for the third quarter of 1993, as compared with the
corresponding prior year period, resulted primarily from reduced sales volume
and unfavorable foreign exchange translation effects attributable to the
stronger U.S. dollar, which more than offset the impact of higher average
selling prices. For the nine months ended September 30, 1993, sales of newsprint
decreased slightly from the year ago period as foreign exchange translation
effects more than offset the impact of higher average selling prices and a
slight volume increase. The 1993 sales increases for groundwood paper over the
comparable 1992 periods were primarily due to significant volume increases which
more than offset the effects of lower average selling prices.

Production of newsprint, market pulp and groundwood paper for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 1993, including 25 percent of the production at
the Company's affiliated market pulp mill in British Columbia, was 610 thousand
tons and 1.86 million tons, compared with 633 thousand tons and 1.79 million
tons produced during the comparable prior year periods.

Operating losses for the third quarter and first nine months of 1993 for the
white paper and pulp segment increased 59.6 percent and 74.3 percent,
respectively, from the previous year periods due to the reduced operating
margins primarily resulting from the significantly lower average selling prices
for market pulp. Lower average selling prices for groundwood paper also
contributed to the reduced earnings. While average selling prices for newsprint

8
<PAGE>
improved over the prior year periods and certain cost reductions have been
implemented, the margins associated with such improvements have only partially
offset the effects of the lower average selling prices for market pulp and
groundwood paper.

OTHER:

Net sales and operating income for the third quarter and first nine months
of 1993 increased over the comparable 1992 periods mainly as a result of
improved demand and a tighter supply of timber available to the U.S. building
industry. This resulted in increased sales volume and the realization of higher
average selling prices for certain of the Company's lumber and wood products.

1992 COMPARED WITH 1991

Net sales for 1992 were $5.5 billion, an increase of 2.5% over 1991 net
sales of $5.4 billion. Net sales rose primarily as a result of increased sales
volume, most of which was offset by reduced average selling prices for certain
of the Company's products. In 1992, the Company incurred a loss before the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes of $170 million, or
$2.49 per common share, compared to a net loss of $49 million, or $.78 per
common share, for 1991. The Company adopted SFAS 109 effective January 1, 1992
and recorded a one-time, non-cash cumulative effect charge of $99.5 million or
$1.40 per common share. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect a 2%
Common Stock dividend issued September 15, 1992. The increase in the loss before
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes primarily
resulted from lower average selling prices for newsprint and groundwood paper in
1992 as compared with 1991. Additionally, continued low average selling prices
for the majority of the Company's other products contributed to the net loss for
1992.

The 1992 results include foreign currency transaction losses of $15.0
million and a $7.9 million pretax charge relating to the write-down of an
investment. The 1991 results included non-recurring pretax gains of $59.3
million and foreign currency transaction gains of $4.9 million. The Company
recorded an income tax benefit of $59.4 million in 1992 as compared with a $31.1
million income tax expense in 1991. This change primarily reflects the tax
effect associated with the increased pretax loss for 1992 over 1991 and the
adoption of SFAS 109 effective January 1, 1992. The Company's effective income
tax rates for both years reflect the impact of non-deductible depreciation and
amortization, together with taxes payable by certain foreign subsidiaries at
rates in excess of the U.S. statutory rate.

PAPERBOARD AND PAPER PACKAGING:

The 1992 net sales for the paperboard and paper packaging segment increased
3.7% as sales increases for corrugated containers, paperboard and folding
cartons more than offset sales declines for kraft paper and paper bags and
sacks.

Net sales of corrugated containers increased 6.7% over 1991, primarily as a
result of increased sales volume. Additionally, slightly higher average selling
prices in 1992 contributed to this increase. However, such selling prices
continued to remain at unsatisfactory levels.

10
<PAGE>
Net sales of paperboard increased over 1991 mainly as a result of modestly
higher average selling prices. Such 1992 average paperboard selling prices were
still, however, at unsatisfactory levels. Slight volume increases also
contributed to the improved paperboard sales for 1992. Net sales of kraft paper
decreased 9.3% from 1991, primarily due to reduced sales volume.

Net sales of paper bags and sacks decreased from 1991 primarily due to lower
sales volume and a decrease in average selling prices for retail paper bags.

Operating income for the paperboard and paper packaging segment for 1992
decreased 9.5%, primarily as a result of the inclusion, in 1991, of a
non-recurring pretax gain of $17.5 million from an involuntary conversion
relating to a boiler explosion at the Company's Missoula, Montana linerboard
mill. Excluding this 1991 non-recurring item, 1992 operating income for this
segment would have decreased by 4.8%. This decrease is mainly attributable to
reduced operating margins resulting from continued low average selling prices
for the Company's paperboard and paper packaging products. See also "--
Financial Condition and Liquidity -- Outlook."

WHITE PAPER AND PULP:

The 1992 net sales for the white paper and pulp segment decreased 3.4%, as
significant sales decreases for newsprint more than offset a significant sales
increase for market pulp. Net sales for groundwood paper decreased slightly as
lower average selling prices more than offset volume increases for this product.
The significant decrease in newsprint sales resulted primarily from lower
average selling prices. Additionally, reduced volume associated with
market-related downtime contributed to the lower sales of newsprint. The
increase in 1992 market pulp sales mainly resulted from volume increases
associated with sales generated from the Stone Savannah River mill, which
commenced market pulp operations in the fourth quarter of 1991. Furthermore,
while market pulp selling prices declined significantly in the fourth quarter of
1992, the Company realized modestly higher average selling prices for this
product in 1992, as compared with the even more depressed average selling prices
of 1991.

Operating income for the white paper and pulp segment for 1992 decreased
significantly from 1991, primarily due to reduced operating margins resulting
from the significantly lower average selling prices for newsprint and groundwood
paper. The 1991 results included a non-recurring pretax gain of $41.8 million
resulting from the settlement and termination of a Canadian supply contract. See
also "-- Financial Condition and Liquidity -- Outlook."

OTHER:

Net sales and operating income for the other segment increased over 1991
mainly due to improved demand and a tighter supply of timber available to the
U.S. building industry. This resulted in increased sales volume and the
realization of higher average selling prices for certain of the Company's lumber
and wood products. However, shortages of timber due to environmental concerns in
the Pacific Northwest continue to keep raw material costs high.

1991 Compared with 1990

Net sales for 1991 were $5.4 billion, a decrease of 6.5% from a record $5.8
billion for 1990. The Company recorded a net loss for 1991 of $49 million, or
$.78 per common share, compared to net income of $95 million, or $1.56 per
common share for 1990. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect a 2%
Common Stock dividend issued September 15, 1992. Lower average selling prices
for most of the Company's products was the major factor contributing to the
sales decrease and the net loss for 1991. Additionally, reduced sales volume for
certain products had an unfavorable effect on 1991 net sales and results of
operations.

The 1991 results included a $41.8 million pretax gain resulting from the
settlement and termination of a Canadian supply contract and a $17.5 million
pretax gain from an involuntary conversion relating to a boiler explosion at the
Company's Missoula, Montana linerboard mill. Partially offsetting these gains
was a $6 million pretax charge for reorganization costs at the Company's
Canadian subsidiary and a $4 million write-down on certain de-commissioned
assets at the Company's Jacksonville, Florida mill. Also contributing to the
1991 net loss was a $31 million income tax provision, which resulted primarily
from non-deductible depreciation and amortization, together with taxes payable
by certain foreign subsidiaries at rates in excess of the U.S. statutory rate.

11
<PAGE>
PAPERBOARD AND PAPER PACKAGING:

The 1991 net sales for the paperboard and paper packaging segment decreased
3.9% as sales declines for paperboard, paper bags and sacks, kraft paper and
corrugated containers more than offset a sales increase for folding cartons.

Net sales of corrugated containers decreased slightly from 1990 as an
overall decrease in average selling prices of corrugated containers more than
offset sales volume increases.

Net sales of paper bags and sacks decreased primarily due to volume
decreases resulting from the effects of increased competition.

Net sales of paperboard and kraft paper decreased from 1990 primarily due to
lower average selling prices. Additionally, a reduction in sales volume
contributed to the sales decrease for these products.

Operating income for the paperboard and paper packaging segment decreased
28.1% from 1990 due primarily to reduced operating margins resulting from lower
average selling prices of linerboard and corrugating medium. Additionally,
average selling prices of most converted products declined. 1991 operating
income for this segment included the $17.5 million pretax gain from the
involuntary conversion relating to the boiler explosion at the Company's
Missoula, Montana linerboard mill and the $4 million write-down on certain
de-commissioned assets at the Company's Jacksonville, Florida mill. Operating
income for 1990 reflected a $5.3 million gain from the sale of timberlands.

WHITE PAPER AND PULP:

The 1991 net sales for the white paper and pulp segment decreased 12.5%,
primarily as a result of declines in newsprint and market pulp sales. The
decrease in newsprint sales resulted primarily from lower sales volume, which
was partially due to significant down-time taken by the Company in an effort to
improve the short-term balance of supply and demand. Lower average selling
prices also contributed to the decrease in newsprint sales. The decrease in
market pulp sales resulted mainly from significantly lower average selling
prices.

Operating income for the white paper and pulp segment for 1991 decreased
45.8% as compared with 1990, primarily due to reduced operating margins
resulting from the previously mentioned declines in average selling prices for
market pulp and newsprint. Operating income for this segment included the $41.8
million pretax gain resulting from the settlement and termination of a Canadian
supply contract and a $4.2 million pretax charge, which represents an allocation
of the previously mentioned $6 million provision for reorganization costs at the
Company's Canadian subsidiary.

OTHER:

Net sales and operating income for the other segment decreased from 1990,
mainly due to the general economic downturn in the U.S. building market during
1991, which resulted in less demand for the Company's U.S. lumber and wood
products. Additionally, environmental concerns in the Pacific Northwest kept raw
material costs high for this segment.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

The Company's working capital ratio was 1.1 to 1 at September 30, 1993 and
1.8 to 1 at December 31, 1992, as restated to reflect the adoption of SFAS 109.
The decrease was mainly due to an increase in current maturities of $573 million
which, in accordance with the terms of the respective debt instruments, are
payable on or before September 30, 1994. A significant portion of the increase
in current maturities was attributable to $271 million ($309 million at November
9, 1993) of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facilities which,
prior to the December 17, 1993 amendment to the U.S. Credit Agreement which
extended the expiration of such revolving credit facilities to March 1, 1997,
were originally scheduled to mature March 1, 1994. The Company's consolidated
long-term debt to total capitalization ratio was 74.3 percent at September 30,
1993 and 69.2 percent at December 31, 1992, as restated to reflect the adoption
of SFAS 109. Capitalization, for purposes of this ratio, includes long-term debt
(which includes debt of certain consolidated affiliates which is non-recourse to
the Company), deferred income taxes, redeemable preferred stock, minority
interest and stockholders' equity. The indebtedness ratio, as defined in the
Credit Agreement, was 79.6 percent at September 30, 1993.

The Company and Stone Canada have entered into bank credit agreements
(collectively, the "Credit Agreements") consisting of (i) two term-loan
facilities with outstanding borrowings in the aggregate of $1.11 billion as of

12
<PAGE>
September 30, 1993, (ii) an additional term loan (the "Additional Term Loan")
with outstanding borrowings at September 30, 1993 of $371 million and (iii) two
revolving credit facilities with aggregate commitments of $400 million (less
amounts outstanding, if any, under Canadian lines of credit) and total
outstanding borrowings thereunder of $271 million at September 30, 1993. The
Company is the borrower under one of the term loans, the Additional Term Loan
and one of the revolving credit facilities (collectively, the "U.S. Credit
Agreement") and Stone Canada is the borrower under the other term loan and
revolving credit facility. At September 30, 1993, the Company had unused
borrowing availability of $128 million under the revolving credit facilities. At
November 9, 1993, the Company had borrowing availability under its revolving
credit facilities of approximately $88 million. The term loans (other than the
Additional Term Loan) and the revolving credit facilities had weighted average
interest rates for the nine months ended September 30, 1993 of 8.37 percent and
5.62 percent, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the Additional
Term Loan for the nine months ended September 30, 1993 was 6.30 percent.

In October 1993, the Company sold, prior to their expiration date, certain
of its U.S. dollar denominated cross currency swaps associated with the Credit
Agreement borrowings of Stone Canada. The net proceeds totalled approximately
$26 million, the substantial portion of which was used to repay borrowings under
the Company's revolving credit facilities, thereby restoring borrowing
availability thereunder.

On July 6, 1993 the Company sold $150 million principal amount of 12 5/8
percent Senior Notes due 1998 ("the 12 5/8 percent Senior Notes") and sold $250
million principal amount of 8 7/8 percent Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes
due 2000 ("the 8 7/8 percent Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes"). The net
proceeds of approximately $386 million from the sale of the 12 5/8 percent
Senior Notes and the concurrent sale of the 8 7/8 percent Convertible Senior
Subordinated Notes were used to repay borrowings under the Company's revolving
credit facilities, thereby restoring borrowing availability thereunder.

The Credit Agreements contain covenants that include, among other things,
requirements to maintain certain financial tests and ratios and certain
restrictions and limitations, including those on capital expenditures and
dividend payments. The Credit Agreements also contain cross default provisions
relating to the non-recourse debt of the consolidated affiliates. Additionally,
the Company's Credit Agreements limit the application of the proceeds from
certain financings and asset sales to amortization payments, except in specified
circumstances. See "Credit Agreements."

OPERATING ACTIVITIES:

Net cash used in operating activities was $115.6 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 1993 compared to net cash provided by operating activities
of $46.5 for the comparable period of 1992. The 1992 period included $43 million
of cash received from the settlement and termination of a Canadian supply
contract. Excluding the receipt of such cash, the Company's cash flow from
operations for the first nine months of 1993 decreased $119.1 million over the
prior year period. This decrease primarily resulted from the increase in the
1993 loss before the non-cash, cumulative effects of accounting changes as
compared with the prior year period along with decreases in accounts payable and
other current liabilities. These decreases in cash flow were partially offset by
favorable effects of changes in accounts and notes receivable and inventories.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES:

During the first nine months of 1993, outstanding borrowings under the
Company's revolving credit facilities increased approximately $14 million. The
net increase in borrowings takes into account the July 6, 1993 repayment of $386
million of revolving credit borrowings and subsequent reborrowing under the
credit facility. Such excess borrowings were primarily used to repay $110
million of the September 1993 bank term amortization and to provide cash for
operations and general corporate purposes.

On July 26, 1993, due to a restrictive provision in the indenture relating
to the Company's 10 3/4 percent Senior Subordinated Notes due June 15, 1997, its
11 percent Senior Subordinated Notes due August 15, 1999 and its 10 3/4 percent
Senior Subordinated Debentures due April 1, 2002, the Board of Directors did not
declare the scheduled August 15, 1993 quarterly dividend of .4375 per share on
the Series E Cumulative Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock (the "Series E
Cumulative Preferred Stock"), nor will it pay future dividends on the Series E
Cumulative Preferred Stock until the Company generates income, or effects
certain sales of capital stock, to replenish the dividend "pool" under various
of its debt instruments. As of September 30, 1993, accumulated dividends on the
Series E Cumulative Preferred Stock amounted to $2.0 million. In the event the
Company does not

13
<PAGE>
pay a dividend on the Series E Cumulative Preferred Stock for six quarters, the
Series E Cumulative Preferred Stock holders would have a right to elect two
members to the Company's Board of Directors until the full dividends accumulated
on such Series E Cumulative Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or set
apart for payment.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES:

Capital expenditures for the nine month period ended September 30, 1993,
(including capitalized interest of $8.1 million), totalled approximately $100.7
million, of which approximately $12.4 million was funded from existing project
financing facilities related to the major reconfiguration and paper machine
rebuild at Seminole.

Also during the nine months ended September 30, 1993, the Company purchased
an additional 6,152 shares of common stock of Stone Savannah River. The
Company's ownership in the common stock of Stone Savannah River is now 91.0
percent.

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES:

The Company's operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation
by federal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatory
authorities with jurisdiction over its foreign operations. The Company has in
the past made significant capital expenditures to comply with water, air and
solid and hazardous waste regulations and expects to make significant
expenditures in the future. Capital expenditures for environmental control
equipment and facilities were approximately $24 million in 1992 and the Company
anticipates that 1993 and 1994 environmental capital expenditures will
approximate $44 million and $74 million, respectively. Although capital
expenditures for environmental control equipment and facilities and compliance
costs in future years will depend on legislative and technological developments
which cannot be predicted at this time, the Company anticipates that these costs
are likely to increase as environmental regulations become more stringent.
Environmental control expenditures include projects which, in addition to
meeting environmental concerns, yield certain benefits to the Company in the
form of increased capacity and production cost savings. In addition to capital
expenditures for environmental control equipment and facilities, other
expenditures incurred to maintain environmental regulatory compliance (including
any remediation) represent ongoing costs to the Company. Future environmental
regulations may have an unpredictable adverse effect on the Company's operations
and earnings, but they are not expected to adversely affect the Company's
competitive position.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CHANGES

In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits" ("SFAS 112"), which requires accrual accounting for the
estimated costs of providing certain benefits to former or inactive employees
and the employees' beneficiaries and dependents after employment but before
retirement. SFAS 112 is required to be adopted no later than the first quarter
of 1994. Upon adoption of this standard, any catch-up obligation is to be
reported as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the Statements of
Operations. While the effect of this standard has yet to be determined, it is
currently anticipated that SFAS 112 will not have a material impact upon the
Company's financial statements.

CREDIT AGREEMENTS

THE FOLLOWING IS SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF CERTAIN
BANK CREDIT AGREEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AND STONE CANADA AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS
ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS AND INSTRUMENTS GOVERNING
SUCH INDEBTEDNESS, COPIES OF WHICH CONSTITUTE EXHIBITS TO THE REGISTRATION
STATEMENT OF WHICH THIS PROSPECTUS IS A PART OR ARE EXHIBITS TO THE COMPANY'S
REPORTS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, AND ARE INCORPORATED
BY REFERENCE INTO THIS PROSPECTUS.

GENERAL

The Credit Agreements consist of (i) two term-loan facilities with
outstanding borrowings in the aggregate amount of $877.7 million as of December
21, 1993, (ii) an additional term loan (the "Additional Term Loan") (previously
a multiple-draw facility) with outstanding borrowings at December 21, 1993 of
$292.9 million and (iii) two revolving credit facilities with aggregate
commitments of $315.8 million (less amounts outstanding, if any, under Canadian
lines of credit). The Company is the borrower under one of the term loans, the
Additional Term Loan and one of the revolving credit facilities (collectively,
the "U.S. Credit Agreement") and Stone Canada is the borrower under the other
term loan and revolving credit facility. Proceeds of the Additional Term Loan
borrowings were used solely to repay regularly scheduled amortization of term
loans under the U.S. Credit Agreement. The term loans (other than the Additional
Term Loan) and the revolving credit facilities had weighted average interest
rates for the nine months ended September 30, 1993 of 8.37% and 5.62%,
respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the Additional Term Loan was
6.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 1993.

The Company as of September 30, 1993 also had $261.3 million of borrowings
outstanding with certain lenders pursuant to two receivables financing programs
permitted by the Credit Agreements.

Effective December 17, 1993, the Credit Agreements were amended and restated
(the "Third Restated Agreement"), with the unanimous consent of the bank group,
to, among other things, extend the maturity of the revolving credit facilities
until March 1, 1997 and reduce over a three year period the revolving loan
commitments, revise various financial covenants to provide greater flexibility
to the Company, increase interest rate margins, mortgage or pledge additional
collateral, permit the Company to retain 25 percent of the net proceeds from
future sales of equity securities, permit the Company to retain 50 percent
(maximum $100 million in the aggregate) of the net proceeds from any sale or
disposition of certain designated investments, and various other changes.

The Credit Agreements generally include terms, conditions, representations
and warranties, covenants, indemnities and events of default and other
provisions which are customary in such agreements. The following is a summary of
certain of the principal terms of the Credit Agreements, as restated.

MATURITIES AND MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS

The term loans under the Credit Agreements and the Additional Term Loan are
scheduled to be paid in installments due March 31 and September 30 of each year.
Each installment of $204.5 million is applied ratably to the aggregate principal
amount of the term loans, the Additional Term Loan, the aggregate commitment
amounts (in the case of the revolving credit facilities) and the aggregate
amount of net letter of credit obligations relating to a letter of credit
providing credit support for industrial revenue bonds issued by Florence County,
South Carolina. The amount applied to the net letter of credit obligations is
required to be used to fund a cash collateral account in favor of the banks
participating in the letter of credit.

A portion of the amortization payments required by the Credit Agreements
will be ratably applied to reduce outstanding borrowings under the revolving
credit facilities and permanently reduce the commitments thereunder. The
revolving credit facilities under the Credit Agreements terminate on March 1,
1997, unless extended by agreement of the lenders, at which time all outstanding
indebtedness under such revolving credit facilities would have to be repaid or
refinanced.

Mandatory prepayments under the Credit Agreements are required in the event
that the Company has excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Agreements) or
receives proceeds from the issuance of certain debt or equity securities or from
the sale of certain material assets. By reason of an amendment contained in the
Third Restated Agreement, 75 percent of the net proceeds from the offering of
equity securities by the Company must be applied in

15
<PAGE>
chronological order to the next regularly scheduled amortization payments except
that the Additional Term Loan does not receive any amortization payments from
sales of equity securities. Twenty-five percent of the net proceeds of an equity
offering may be retained by the Company.

Through prepayments in 1993, the Company has satisfied its March and
September, 1994 amortization requirements under the Credit Agreements.

INTEREST RATES

The Credit Agreements permit the Company to choose among various interest
rate options, to specify the portion of the borrowings to be covered by specific
interest rate options and to specify the interest rate period to which the
interest rate options are to apply, subject to certain parameters. At December
17, 1993, the interest rate options available to the Company and Stone Canada
under term loan and revolving credit borrowings were (i) U.S. or Canadian prime
rate plus a borrowing margin of 2%, (ii) CD rate plus a borrowing margin of
3 1/8%, and (iii) Eurodollar rate plus a borrowing margin of 3%. In the case of
Stone Canada, there is also an option of selecting a banker's acceptance rate
plus a borrowing margin of 3%. Upon achievement of specified indebtedness ratios
and interest coverage ratios, the borrowing margins will be reduced.
Additionally, the Company pays a 3/8% commitment fee on the unused portions of
the revolving credit facilities.

The Company has also paid to the banks amendment fees of 100 basis points
calculated on the aggregate term loan and commitment amounts in connection with
the execution of the Third Restated Agreement.

HEDGING REQUIREMENTS

The Credit Agreements required that the Company hedge a portion of the U.S.
dollar-based borrowings to protect against increases in market interest rates.
At September 30, 1993, the Company was a party to an interest rate swap contract
related to $150 million of such borrowings. The effect of this contract is to
fix the interest rate at approximately 12.9% on $150 million. The swap is
scheduled to expire no later than March 22, 1994. Upon the expiration of this
contract, the interest rate on these borrowings will be the rates described
above unless a new hedging arrangement is entered into.

SECURITY

Loans under the Credit Agreements are secured by a mortgage on the Company's
mill in Florence, South Carolina, and a pledge of the stock of various
subsidiaries of the Company, including Stone Southwest, Inc. and Stone Mill
Operating Corporation. Stone Southwest, Inc. owns mills in Snowflake, Arizona
and Panama City, Florida, and Stone Mill Operating Corporation owns mills in
Coshocton, Ohio, Missoula, Montana, Ontonagon, Michigan, and York, Pennsylvania.
The Company has also pledged to the lenders all of the common stock of Stone
Financial Corporation and Stone Fin II Receivables Corporation and certain
subordinated notes payable to the Company. All of the stock of Stone Canada has
also been pledged to the lenders under the Credit Agreements. The Company has
guaranteed the obligations of Stone Canada as a borrower under the Credit
Agreements. The Company and its subsidiary, Stone Bag Corporation, have granted
mortgages and security interests on approximately 47 box or bag plants owned or
leased by the Company or Stone Bag Corporation in the United States, together
with all fixed assets located at such plants and have granted a security
interest in inventories owned by the Company and Stone Bag Corporation.

Pursuant to the Third Restated Agreement effective December 17, 1993, the
bank group obtained mortgages on the Uncasville, Connecticut mill owned by Stone
Connecticut Paperboard Corporation, the Coshocton, Ohio mill owned by Stone Mill
Operating Corporation and the Pontiac mill owned by Stone Canada. Stone Canada
also pledged 100% of the shares of Stone-Consolidated Corporation owned by Stone
Canada and executed a limited recourse guaranty of the Company's indebtedness
under the Credit Agreements. Stone Bag and Stone Connecticut have also executed
limited recourse guarantees of the Company's indebtedness under the Credit
Agreements. Certain other security interests were also granted to the bank
group.

COVENANTS

The Credit Agreements contain covenants that include, among other things,
requirements to maintain certain financial tests and ratios (including a minimum
current ratio, an indebtedness ratio, an EBITDA test, and a tangible

16
<PAGE>
net worth test) and certain restrictions and limitations, including those on
capital expenditures, changes in control, payments of dividends, sales of
assets, lease payments, investments, additional borrowings, mergers and
purchases of stock and assets.

CONSOLIDATED TANGIBLE NET WORTH

The Third Restated Agreement requires that the Company have a consolidated
tangible net worth at the end of each calendar quarter, less certain excluded
investments, at least equal to the greater of 50% of (a) the consolidated
tangible net worth of the Company as of March 1, 1989 and (b) the highest
consolidated tangible net worth of the Company as of the end of any calendar
quarter ending after March 1, 1989.

EBITDA REQUIREMENT

The Third Restated Agreement requires that the Company have earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as defined in the Third Restated
Agreement) equal to or greater than

On December 29, 1993, the banks amended the Third Restated Agreement to
permit the earnings from the sale of the Company's interest in Empaques de
Carton Titan, S.A., a Mexican corrugated container company, to be counted for
purposes of satisfying the minimum EBITDA requirement solely for the quarter
ended December 31, 1993.

INDEBTEDNESS RATIO

The Company is currently required to have an indebtedness ratio (ratio of
total consolidated indebtedness to consolidated tangible net worth plus total
consolidated indebtedness, as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreements)
not exceeding (i) 81% at the end of each calendar month ending on or after
September 30, 1993 and ending prior to December 31, 1993; (ii) 81.5% at the end
of each calendar month ending on or after December 31, 1993 and ending prior to
March 31, 1995; (iii) 81.0% at the end of each calendar month ending on and
after March 31, 1995 and ending prior to June 30, 1995; (iv) 80.0% at the end of
each calendar month ending on and after June 30, 1995 and ending prior to
September 30, 1995; (v) 79.0% at the end of each calendar month ending on or
after September 30, 1995 and ending prior to December 31, 1995; (vi) 78.0% at
the end of each calendar month ending on or after December 31, 1995 and ending
prior to March 31, 1996; (vii) 76.0% at the end of each calendar month ending on
and after March 31, 1996 and ending prior to June 30, 1996; (viii) 74.0% at the
end of each calendar month ending on or after June 30, 1996 and ending prior to
September 30, 1996; (ix) 72.0% at the end of each calendar month ending on or
after September 30, 1996 and ending prior to December 31, 1996; and (x) 68% at
the end of each calendar month ending on or after December 31, 1996.

At September 30, 1993, the Company's actual indebtedness ratio (as defined)
was 79.6%.

RESTRICTIONS ON INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND GUARANTEES; CROSS-DEFAULTS

The U.S. Credit Agreement contains prohibitions on investments in Stone
Venepal (Celgar) Pulp, Inc., a Canadian federal corporation, and the Company's
subsidiary, Stone-Consolidated Corporation. The Credit Agreements also restrict
further investments in two of the Company's subsidiaries, Seminole Kraft
Corporation and Stone Savannah River Pulp & Paper Corporation. The Company is
also not permitted to guarantee the indebtedness of Stone-Consolidated
Corporation and there are restrictions on other guarantees. There are also
restrictions on

17
<PAGE>
transactions with affiliates which are wholly-owned subsidiaries. Any event of
default or default with respect to a Subsidiary's indebtedness for money
borrowed having an aggregate principal amount of $10 million or more constitutes
an event of default under the Credit Agreements.

RESTRICTIONS ON DIVIDENDS

The U.S. Credit Agreement provides that the Company's dividend payments,
distributions or purchases of any class of capital stock of the Company and its
subsidiaries cannot exceed the sum of $50 million plus (i) 50% of the
consolidated net income (as defined by the Credit Agreements) of the Company
from April 1, 1991 to the date of payment of such dividends, minus (ii) 100% of
the consolidated net loss (as defined by the Credit Agreements) of the Company
from April 1, 1991 to the date of payment of such dividend plus (iii) 50% of any
net cash proceeds from sales of Common Stock or certain preferred stock of the
Company from April 1, 1991 to the date of payment of such dividends. The Credit
Agreements also provide that, with respect to the first cash dividend to be
declared after September 1, 1992, such declaration cannot be made unless the
unused portion of the revolving credit facilities (net of any unused portion
required to be reserved for capital expenditures only) is at least equal to $96
million plus the amount of such cash dividend.

At September 30, 1993, the dividend pool under the U.S. Credit Agreement had
a deficit of approximately $334.1 million. The dividend pool will be further
reduced by 100% of the consolidated net loss of the Company that will be
reported for the fourth quarter of 1993. The dividend pool will be increased by
50% of any net cash proceeds from the sale of Common Stock or certain preferred
stock of the Company.

In addition, the indentures relating to the Debt Securities and indentures
relating to the Company's outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness and the
13 5/8% Subordinated Notes due 1995 also restrict the payment of dividends and
distributions. See "Description of Debt Securities -- Particular Terms of the
Senior Debt Securities -- Certain Covenants -- Dividend Restrictions" and "--
Additional Terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities -- Dividend
Restrictions."

RESTRICTIONS ON INCURRENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS

The Credit Agreements restrict the incurrence of additional indebtedness,
subject to certain exceptions. The U.S. Credit Agreement permits the Company to
undertake accounts receivable securitization financings of up to $500 million,
the initial net proceeds of which are required to be used to reduce outstanding
term loans. The Company has instituted two accounts receivable securitization
financings of $365 million of which balances of $261.3 million were outstanding
as of September 30, 1993. The Company may incur an additional $135 million in
securitization financings under the Credit Agreements although no new program is
currently contemplated.

In addition, the Company's indentures relating to the Debt Securities also
restricts the incurrence of additional indebtedness, subject to certain
exceptions. See "Description of Debt Securities -- Particular Terms of the
Senior Debt Securities -- Certain Covenants -- Limitation on Future Incurrence
of Indebtedness."

DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES

The following description sets forth certain general terms and provisions of
the Debt Securities to which any Prospectus Supplement may relate. The
particular terms of the Debt Securities offered by any Prospectus Supplement and
the extent, if any, to which such general provisions may apply to the Debt
Securities so offered will be described in the Prospectus Supplement relating to
such Debt Securities.

The Debt Securities may be issued from time to time in one or more series
and will constitute either Senior Debt Securities, Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities. Senior Debt Securities will be
issued under an Indenture dated as of November 1, 1991, as supplemented by the
First Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 23, 1993 (the "Senior Debt
Securities Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee
(the "Senior Debt Securities Trustee"). The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
will be issued under an Indenture (the "Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
Indenture") to be entered into by the Company and Norwest Bank Minnesota,
National Association, as Trustee (the "Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
Trustee"). The Subordinated Debt Securities will be issued under an Indenture
(the "Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture") dated as of March 15, 1992
between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Subordinated Debt
Securities Trustee"). The Senior Debt Securities Indenture, the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture and the Subordinated Debt Securities
Indenture are referred to herein individually as an "Indenture" and,
collectively, as the "Indentures," and the Senior Debt Securities Trustee, the
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Trustee and the Subordinated Debt Securities
Trustee are referred to herein individually as to the "Trustee" and collectively
as the "Trustees." A copy of each Indenture is filed or incorporated by
reference as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.

The following summaries of certain provisions of the Debt Securities and the
Indentures do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and are qualified
in their entirety by express reference to, all the provisions of the Indentures,
including the definitions therein of certain terms. Certain capitalized terms
herein are defined in the Indentures.

GENERAL

The Debt Securities will be unsecured obligations of the Company.

The Indentures do not limit the aggregate principal amount of Debt
Securities which may be issued thereunder and provide that Debt Securities may
be issued thereunder from time to time in one or more series.

Reference is made to the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Debt
Securities being offered (the "Offered Debt Securities") for, among other
things, the following terms thereof: (1) the title of the Offered Debt
Securities; (2) the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Debt Securities;
(3) the date or dates on which the Offered Debt Securities will mature; (4) the
rate or rates (which may be fixed or variable) per annum at which the Offered
Debt Securities will bear interest and the date from which such interest will
accrue; (5) the dates on which such interest will be payable and the Regular
Record Dates for such Interest Payment Dates; (6) the dates, if any, on which,
and the price or prices at which, the Offered Debt Securities may, pursuant to
any mandatory or optional sinking fund provisions, be redeemed by the Company
and other detailed terms and provisions of such sinking funds; (7) the terms and
conditions, if any, pursuant to which the Offered Debt Securities are
convertible into Common Stock; and (8) the date, if any, after which, and the
price or prices at which, the Offered Debt Securities may, pursuant to any
optional redemption provisions, be redeemed at the option of the Company or of
the Holder thereof and other detailed terms and provisions of such optional
redemption. For a description of the terms of the Offered Debt Securities,
reference must be made to both the Prospectus Supplement relating thereto and to
the description of Debt Securities set forth herein.

Debt Securities which are convertible into Common Stock may only be issued
under the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture.

Unless otherwise indicated in the Prospectus Supplement relating thereto,
the principal of, and any premium or interest on, the Offered Debt Securities
will be payable, and the Offered Debt Securities will be exchangeable and
transfers thereof will be registrable, at the Place of Payment, provided that,
at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to
the address of the person entitled thereto as it appears in the Security
Register.

19
<PAGE>
Unless otherwise indicated in the Prospectus Supplement relating thereto,
the Offered Debt Securities will be issued in United States dollars in fully
registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 or any integral
multiple thereof. No service charge will be made for any transfer or exchange of
the Offered Debt Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection
therewith.

RANKING

The Senior Debt Securities will rank PARI PASSU in right of payment with all
other Senior Indebtedness (as defined) of the Company. The Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities will (i) be subordinate in right of payment to all existing and
future Senior Indebtedness of the Company, (ii) be senior in right of payment to
all existing and future Junior Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined) and (iii)
rank PARI PASSU in right of payment with all existing and future Senior
Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined). The Subordinated Debt Securities will
(i) be subordinate in right of payment to all existing and future Senior
Indebtedness and Senior Subordinated Indebtedness and (ii) rank PARI PASSU upon
liquidation with all existing and future Junior Subordinated Indebtedness.

A substantial portion of the Company's assets currently secure the
borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreements, which are a component of
Senior Indebtedness. At July 29, 1993, the Company, together with Stone Canada,
had $1.601 billion of term-loan borrowings outstanding under the Credit
Agreements plus approximately $101 million in borrowings outstanding under the
revolving credit facilities available under the Credit Agreements.

The Debt Securities are obligations exclusively of the Company. Because the
operations of the Company are currently conducted primarily by subsidiaries, the
Company's cash flow and consequent ability to service debt, including the Debt
Securities, are dependent, in part, upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and
the distribution of those earnings or upon loans or other payments of funds by
those subsidiaries to the Company. The subsidiaries of the Company are separate
and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to
pay any amount due pursuant to the Debt Securities or to make any funds
available therefor, whether by dividends, loans or other payments. In addition,
the payment of dividends and the making of loans and advances to the Company by
its subsidiaries may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions (as
well as potential foreign tax withholding under certain circumstances), are
contingent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and are subject to various
business considerations.

Any right of the Company to receive assets of any of its subsidiaries upon
their liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the Holders to
participate in the distribution of or proceeds from those assets) will be
effectively subordinated to the claims of such subsidiary's creditors (including
trade creditors and holders of debt issued by such subsidiary), except to the
extent that the Company is itself recognized as a creditor of such subsidiary,
in which case the claims of the Company would still be subordinate to any
security interests in the assets of such subsidiary and any indebtedness of such
subsidiary senior to that held by the Company. The 12 1/8% Subordinated
Debentures due September 15, 2001 of Stone Southwest, Inc., a significant
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, have been guaranteed on a subordinated
basis by the Company. At September 30, 1993, approximately $92.1 million
principal amount of such 12 1/8% Subordinated Debentures due September 15, 2001
was outstanding.

BOOK-ENTRY DEBT SECURITIES

The Debt Securities of a series may be issued in whole or in part in the
form of one or more Global Securities that will be deposited with, or on behalf
of, a Depositary ("Depositary") or its nominee identified in the applicable
Prospectus Supplement. In such a case, one or more Global Securities will be
issued in a denomination or aggregate denomination equal to the portion of the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Debt Securities of the series to be
represented by such Global Security or Global Securities. Unless and until it is
exchanged in whole or in part for Debt Securities in registered form, a Global
Security may not be registered for transfer or exchange except as a whole by the
Depositary for such Global Security to a nominee of such Depositary or by a
nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such
Depositary or by such Depositary or any nominee to a successor Depositary or a
nominee of such successor Depositary and except in the circumstances described
in the applicable Prospectus Supplement.

The specific terms of the depositary arrangement with respect to any portion
of a series of Debt Securities to be represented by a Global Security will be
described in the applicable Prospectus Supplement. The Company expects that the
following provisions will apply to depositary arrangements.

Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, Debt
Securities which are to be represented by a Global Security to be deposited with
or on behalf of a Depositary will be represented by a Global Security registered
in the name of such Depositary or its nominee. Upon the issuance of such Global
Security, and the deposit of such Global Security with or on behalf of the
Depositary for such Global Security, the Depositary will credit, on its
book-entry registration and transfer system, the respective principal amounts of
the Debt Securities represented by such Global Security to the accounts of
institutions that have accounts with such Depositary or its nominee
("participants"). The accounts to be credited will be designated by the
underwriters or agents of such Debt Securities or, if such Debt Securities are
offered and sold directly by the Company, by the Company. Ownership of
beneficial interests in such Global Security will be limited to participants or
Persons that may hold interests through participants. Ownership of beneficial
interests by participants in such Global Security will be shown on, and the
transfer of that ownership interest will be effected only through, records
maintained by the Depositary or its nominee for such Global Security. Ownership
of beneficial interests in such Global Security by Persons that hold through
participants will be shown on, and the transfer of that ownership interest
within such participant will be effected only through, records maintained by
such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers
of securities take physical delivery of such securities in certificated form.
The foregoing limitations and such laws may impair the ability to transfer
beneficial interests in such Global Securities.

So long as the Depositary for a Global Security, or its nominee, is the
registered owner of such Global Security, such Depositary or such nominee, as
the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or Holder of the Securities
represented by such Global Security for all purposes under the applicable
Indenture. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement,
owners of beneficial interests in such Global Security will not be entitled to
have Debt Securities of the series represented by such Global Security
registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical
delivery of Debt Securities of such series in certificated form and will not be
considered the Holders thereof for any purposes under the applicable Indenture.
Accordingly, each Person owning a beneficial interest in such Global Security
must rely on the procedures of the Depositary and, if such Person is not a
participant, on the procedures of the participant through which such Person owns
its interest, to exercise any rights of a Holder under the applicable Indenture.
The Company understands that under existing industry practices, if the Company
requests any action of Holders or an owner of a beneficial interest in such
Global Security desires to give any notice or take any action a Holder is
entitled to give or take under the applicable Indenture, the Depositary would
authorize the participants to give such notice or take such action, and
participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through such participants
to give such notice or take such action or would otherwise act upon the
instructions of beneficial owners owning through them.

Principal of and any premium and interest on a Global Security will be
payable in the manner described in the applicable Prospectus Supplement.

PARTICULAR TERMS OF THE SENIOR DEBT SECURITIES

The following description of the Senior Debt Securities sets forth certain
general terms and provisions of the Senior Debt Securities to which any
Prospectus Supplement may relate. The particular terms of the Senior Debt
Securities offered by any Prospectus Supplement and the extent, if any, to which
such general provisions may apply to the Senior Debt Securities so offered will
be described in the Prospectus Supplement relating to such Senior Debt
Securities.

CERTAIN COVENANTS

MAINTENANCE OF SUBORDINATED CAPITAL BASE

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that, subject to the exception
described in the third following paragraph, in the event that the Company's
Subordinated Capital Base is less than $1 billion (the "Minimum Subordinated
Capital Base") as at the end of each of any two consecutive fiscal quarters (the
last day of the second such fiscal quarter, a "Deficiency Date"), then, with
respect to Senior Debt Securities of each series, the Company shall, no later
than 60 days after the Deficiency Date (105 days if a Deficiency Date is also
the end of the Company's

21
<PAGE>
fiscal year), make an offer to all Holders of Senior Debt Securities of each
such series to purchase (a "Deficiency Offer") 10% of the principal amount of
Senior Debt Securities of each such series originally issued, or such lesser
amount as may be Outstanding at the time such Deficiency Offer is made (the
"Deficiency Offer Amount"), at a purchase price equal to 100% of principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Deficiency Payment Date (as
defined below). Thereafter, semiannually the Company shall make like Deficiency
Offers for the then applicable Deficiency Offer Amount of Senior Debt Securities
of each such series until the Company's Subordinated Capital Base as at the end
of any subsequent fiscal quarter shall be equal to or greater than the Minimum
Subordinated Capital Base. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after any specified
Deficiency Date, the last day of any subsequent fiscal quarter shall not
constitute a Deficiency Date (giving rise to an additional obligation under the
first sentence of this paragraph) unless the Company's Subordinated Capital Base
was equal to or greater than the Minimum Subordinated Capital Base as at the end
of a fiscal quarter that followed such specified Deficiency Date and preceded
such subsequent quarter.

Within 60 days (105 days if the Deficiency Date is also the end of the
Company's fiscal year) following a Deficiency Date, the Company shall mail a
notice to each Holder of Senior Debt Securities of the applicable series in
respect of the Deficiency Offer (which notice shall contain all instructions and
materials necessary to enable such Holders to tender Senior Debt Securities).
Senior Debt Securities tendered pursuant to a Deficiency Offer will be accepted
for payment, in amounts as set forth below, on the date which shall be 20
Business Days from the date such notice is mailed or, if acceptance for payment
and payment is not then lawful, on the earliest subsequent Business Day on which
acceptance for payment and payment is then lawful (a "Deficiency Payment Date").

On a Deficiency Payment Date, the Company shall accept for payment Senior
Debt Securities of each applicable series or portions thereof tendered pursuant
to the Deficiency Offer in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Deficiency
Offer Amount or such lesser principal amount of such Senior Debt Securities as
shall have been tendered, and deposit with the Paying Agent money sufficient to
pay the purchase price of all such Senior Debt Securities or portions thereof so
accepted. If the aggregate principal amount of such Senior Debt Securities
tendered exceeds the Deficiency Offer Amount, the Company shall select the
Senior Debt Securities to be purchased on a pro rata basis to the nearest $1,000
of principal amount. The Paying Agent shall promptly mail or deliver to Holders
of Senior Debt Securities so accepted payment in amounts equal to the purchase
prices therefor, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall promptly
authenticate and mail or make available for delivery to such Holders new Senior
Debt Securities of the same series as, and equal in principal amounts to, any
unpurchased portion of the Senior Debt Securities surrendered. The Company will
publicly announce the results of the Deficiency Offer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (1) the making of a
Deficiency Offer by the Company or (2) the purchase of Senior Debt Securities by
the Company in respect of a Deficiency Offer would constitute a default (with
the giving of notice, the passage of time or both) with respect to any Specified
Bank Debt at the time outstanding in an aggregate principal amount greater than
$25 million, then, in lieu of the making of a Deficiency Offer in the
circumstances set forth above, (i) the interest rate on the Senior Debt
Securities of each applicable series shall be reset as of the first day of the
second fiscal quarter following the Deficiency Date (the "Reset Date") to a rate
per annum (the "Reset Rate") equal to the greater of (x) the initial interest
rate as set forth on the face of the Senior Debt Security (the "Initial Interest
Rate") and (y) the sum of (A) the basis points specified in the applicable Board
Resolution or supplemental indenture for purposes of this reset provision and
(B) the highest of the treasury rates specified in the applicable Board
Resolution or supplemental indenture for purposes of this reset provision, (ii)
on the first Interest Payment Date following the Reset Date, the interest rate
on the Senior Debt Securities of each such series, as reset on the Reset Date,
shall increase by 50 basis points, and (iii) the interest rate on the Senior
Debt Securities of each such series shall further increase by an additional 50
basis points on each succeeding Interest Payment Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the interest rate on the Senior Debt Securities of
any such series at any time exceed the Initial Interest Rate by more than 200
basis points. If the Company's Subordinated Capital Base falls below $1 billion,
the Company would be in default of certain covenants in the Credit Agreements as
in effect on the date hereof.

Once the interest rate on the Senior Debt Securities of any series has been
reset as set forth above, if the Company's Subordinated Capital Base is equal to
or greater than the Minimum Subordinated Capital Base as of the last day of any
fiscal quarter subsequent to the Deficiency Date, interest on the Senior Debt
Securities of each such

22
<PAGE>
series shall return to the Initial Interest Rate effective as of the first day
of the second following fiscal quarter; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the interest
rate on the Senior Debt Securities of each such series shall again be adjusted
as set forth above if the Company's Subordinated Capital Base shall thereafter
be less than the Minimum Subordinated Capital Base as at the last day of each of
any two consecutive subsequent fiscal quarters and if the making of a Deficiency
Offer or the purchase of Senior Debt Securities by the Company in respect of a
Deficiency Offer would, at such time, constitute a default (with the giving of
notice, passage of time or both) with respect to any Specified Bank Debt at the
time outstanding in an aggregate principal amount greater than $25 million.

The Company shall notify the Trustee of the Reset Rate not later than two
Business Days after the Reset Date in the circumstances set forth in the second
preceding paragraph. Not later than five Business Days after the Trustee has
received such notice from the Company, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder of
Senior Debt Securities of the applicable series such notice setting forth the
Reset Rate. The Company shall notify the Trustee and the Holders of such Senior
Debt Securities promptly when the interest rate on such Debt Securities returns
to the Initial Interest Rate as set forth above.

With respect to any Deficiency Offer, the Company intends to comply with the
requirements of Section 14(e) and Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, if then
applicable.

LIMITATION ON FUTURE INCURRENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that the Company will not, and
will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, incur, create, assume, guarantee
or in any other manner become directly or indirectly liable with respect to or
responsible for the payment of, any Indebtedness, except: (1) Permitted
Indebtedness; and (2) Indebtedness of the Company if at the time thereof and
after giving effect thereto the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of the
Company, on a pro forma basis for the four most recent quarters, taken as a
whole (giving effect to (i) such Indebtedness and (ii) the effect on the
Consolidated Cash Flow Available for Fixed Charges of the Company for the then
four most recent full fiscal quarters, taken as a whole, as a result of any
acquisition of a Person acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
with the proceeds of such Indebtedness), would be greater than 1.75 to 1.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, guarantee, or in any other manner become directly or
indirectly liable with respect to or responsible for the payment of,
Indebtedness of any Unrestricted Subsidiary in an amount greater than, for all
guaranties and undertakings of responsibility by the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, 20% of the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of such Unrestricted
Subsidiary.

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that the Company will not, and
will not permit any Subsidiary of the Company to, directly or indirectly, (1)
declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution, in cash or otherwise, in
respect of any shares of Capital Stock of the Company or to the holders of
Capital Stock of the Company as such (other than dividends or distributions
payable in shares of Capital Stock of the Company, other than Redeemable Stock)
or (2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value any of the
Capital Stock of the Company or options, warrants or other rights to acquire any
such Capital Stock, other than acquisitions of Capital Stock or such options,
warrants or other rights by any Subsidiary of the Company from the Company (any
such transaction included in clause (1) or (2), a "Restricted Payment") if (i)
at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving effect thereto, (a) an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to any
series of the Senior Debt Securities or (b) the Consolidated Net Worth of the
Company shall be less than $750 million; or if (ii) after giving effect to such
Restricted Payment, the aggregate amount expended subsequent to the date of the
Senior Debt Securities Indenture for all such Restricted Payments (the amount of
any Restricted Payment, if other than cash, to be the fair market value of such
payment as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose reasonable
determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a Board Resolution) exceed
the algebraic sum of (w) a number calculated as follows: (A) if the aggregate
Consolidated Net Income of the Company earned on a cumulative basis during the
period subsequent to September 30, 1991 through the end of the last fiscal
quarter that is prior to the declaration of any such dividend or distribution or
the giving of notice of such purchase, redemption or other acquisition or
retirement and for which such financial information is then available, is a
positive number, then 100% of such positive number, and (B) if the aggregate
Consolidated Net Income of the Company earned on a cumulative basis during the
period subsequent to September 30, 1991 through the end of the last fiscal
quarter that

23
<PAGE>
is prior to the declaration of any such dividend or distribution or the giving
of notice of such purchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement and
for which such financial information is then available, is a negative number,
then 100% of such negative number, (x) the aggregate net cash proceeds received
by the Company from the issuance and sale, other than to a Subsidiary of the
Company, subsequent to the date of the Senior Debt Securities Indenture, of
Capital Stock (including Capital Stock issued upon the conversion of, or in
exchange for, securities other than Capital Stock and options, warrants or other
rights to acquire Capital Stock, but excluding Redeemable Stock, (y) the
aggregate net cash proceeds received by the Company from the issuance and sale,
other than to a Subsidiary of the Company, of Indebtedness of the Company that
is converted into Capital Stock of the Company subsequent to the date of the
Senior Debt Securities Indenture, and (z) $300 million; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the retirement of any shares of the Company's Capital Stock by exchange for, or
out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of, other shares of
Capital Stock of the Company other than Redeemable Stock shall not constitute a
Restricted Payment. If all of the conditions to the declaration of a dividend or
distribution that are described above are satisfied at the time such dividend or
distribution is declared, then such dividend or distribution may be paid or made
within sixty days after such declaration even if the payment of such dividend,
the making of such distribution or the declaration thereof would not have been
permitted at any time after such declaration.

LIMITATION ON FUTURE LIENS AND GUARANTIES

Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Debt Securities Indenture, if the
Company or any Subsidiary shall create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any
Lien upon any of the assets of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company
(whether such assets are owned at the date of the Senior Debt Securities
Indenture or thereafter acquired) as a security for (1) any Indebtedness or
other obligation (whether unconditional or contingent) of the Company that ranks
PARI PASSU with the Senior Debt Securities or any Indebtedness or other
obligation (whether unconditional or contingent) of a Subsidiary of the Company,
the Company will secure or will cause such Subsidiary to guarantee and secure
the Outstanding Senior Debt Securities equally and ratably with (or, at the
option of the Company, prior to) such Indebtedness or other obligation, so long
as such Indebtedness or other obligation shall be so secured, or (2) any
Subordinated Indebtedness, the Company will secure the Outstanding Senior Debt
Securities prior to such Subordinated Indebtedness, so long as such Subordinated
Indebtedness shall be so secured; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this covenant does not
apply in the case of Permitted Liens or Liens granted by any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to secure Indebtedness or other obligations of itself or of any
Person other than the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Senior Debt Securities Indenture,
the Company will not guarantee the Indebtedness of any Subsidiary and will not
permit any Subsidiary (including Stone Savannah River Pulp & Paper Corporation
and Seminole Kraft Corporation) to guarantee (i) any Indebtedness of the Company
that ranks PARI PASSU with the Senior Debt Securities, (ii) any Indebtedness of
a Subsidiary of the Company or (iii) any Subordinated Indebtedness; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that this paragraph does not apply to (1) any guaranty by a Subsidiary
if such Subsidiary also guarantees the Senior Debt Securities on a PARI PASSU
basis with respect to guaranties of Indebtedness described in clauses (i) and
(ii) and on a senior basis with respect to guaranties of Indebtedness described
in clause (iii); (2) any guaranty existing on the date of the Senior Debt
Securities Indenture or any extension or renewal of such guaranty to the extent
such extension or renewal is for the same or a lesser amount; (3) any guaranty
which constitutes Indebtedness permitted by clause (v) or (vi) of the definition
of Permitted Indebtedness granted by a Person permitted to incur such
Indebtedness; (4) any guaranty by the Company of Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary, PROVIDED that (A) incurrence of such Indebtedness of the Restricted
Subsidiary is not prohibited by the Senior Debt Securities Indenture and (B) (x)
such guaranty constitutes Indebtedness of the Company incurred as Permitted
Indebtedness pursuant to clause (vii) or (viii) of the definition of Permitted
Indebtedness (it being understood that, for purposes of determining Permitted
Indebtedness, any such guaranty shall be deemed to constitute Indebtedness
separate from, and, in addition to, Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary
which is so guaranteed) or (y) immediately prior to and (on a pro forma basis)
after granting such guaranty, the Company would be permitted to incur an
additional dollar of Indebtedness (not constituting Permitted Indebtedness)
under the restrictions described in "Limitation on Future Incurrence of
Indebtedness" above; (5) any guaranty by an Unrestricted Subsidiary of
Indebtedness or other obligations of any Person other than the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries; (6) any guaranty by the Company or any Subsidiary
(including Stone Savannah River Pulp & Paper Corporation and Seminole Kraft
Corporation) of Indebtedness or other

24
<PAGE>
obligations constituting Indebtedness permitted by clause (i)(a) of the
definition of Permitted Indebtedness in a principal amount not exceeding the
principal amount outstanding or committed under the Credit Agreements (including
any letter of credit facility, but without duplication with respect to
commitments for loans the use of proceeds of which is restricted to repayment of
other Indebtedness under the Credit Agreements) as of the date of the Senior
Debt Securities Indenture, plus $250 million and less the proceeds from the sale
of all Senior Debt Securities issued from time to time that are applied to repay
Indebtedness under the Credit Agreements); (7) any guaranty by the Company of
Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the date of the Senior
Debt Securities Indenture which is not subordinated to any Indebtedness of such
Restricted Subsidiary, and any renewal extension or refinancing of such
Indebtedness permitted by the Senior Debt Securities Indenture; (8) any guaranty
by the Company of Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is organized
under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States or any subdivision
thereof, PROVIDED that the incurrence of such Indebtedness of such Restricted
Subsidiary is not prohibited by the Senior Debt Securities Indenture; (9) any
guaranty by a Restricted Subsidiary that is organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction other than the United States or any subdivision thereof of the
Indebtedness of any of its Subsidiaries that is a Restricted Subsidiary and that
is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States or
any subdivision thereof, PROVIDED that incurrence of such Indebtedness of such
Restricted Subsidiary is not prohibited by the Senior Debt Securities Indenture;
(10) any guaranty by the Company or a Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other
obligations in a principal amount not exceeding $250,000; (11) any guaranty in
the form of an endorsement of negotiable instruments for deposit or collection
and similar transactions; (12) any guaranty arising under or in connection with

becoming a Subsidiary and not created in contemplation thereof; or (14) any
guaranty by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of any Interest Swap
Obligation, Currency Agreement or Commodities Agreement relating to Indebtedness
that is guaranteed pursuant to another clause of this paragraph.

LIMITATION ON ASSET DISPOSITIONS

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that so long as any of the
Senior Debt Securities are Outstanding, (i) the Company will not, and will not
permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any Asset Disposition unless the
Company (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives
consideration at the time of such Asset Disposition at least equal to the fair
market value for the assets sold or otherwise disposed of (which shall be
determined in good faith (x) in the case of dispositions of assets having a fair
market value of $10 million or more, by the Board of Directors of the Company,
whose reasonable determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a Board
Resolution, or (y) in the case of dispositions of assets having a fair market
value of less than $10 million but not less than $5 million, an officer of the
Company, whose reasonable determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a
certificate of such officer) and (ii) the Company will apply the aggregate net
proceeds in excess of $300 million received by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary from all Asset Dispositions occurring subsequent to the date of the
Senior Debt Securities Indenture (but excluding for purposes of this clause
(ii), whether before or after the receipt of net proceeds in excess of $300
million, (1) the net proceeds of any Asset Disposition or series of related
Asset Dispositions where the net proceeds are less than $5 million and (2) the
first $25 million of net proceeds in each fiscal year without taking into
account any amount excluded pursuant to (1)) as follows: (a) to the payment or
prepayment of any Senior Indebtedness within six months of such Asset
Disposition, or (b) to investment in the business of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, by acquiring equity,
other than Redeemable Stock, of the transferee of such Asset Disposition) within
six months of such Asset Disposition or, if such investment is with respect to a
project to be completed within a period greater than six months from such Asset
Disposition, then within the period of time necessary to complete such project;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (x) in the case of applications contemplated by clause
(b), the Board of Directors has, within such six-month period, adopted in good
faith a resolution committing such excess proceeds to such investment, (y)
except as provided in the next sentence, none of such excess proceeds shall be
used to make any Restricted Payment or any payment in respect of Subordinated
Indebtedness and (z) to the extent not applied in accordance with clauses (a) or
(b) above, or if after being so applied there remain excess net proceeds in an
amount greater than $10 million, the Company shall make a pro rata offer to all
Holders to purchase Senior Debt Securities at 100% of principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the Asset Disposition Payment Date (as defined
below), up to an aggregate principal amount equal to such excess net proceeds
(the "Asset Disposition Offer Amount"). If after

25
<PAGE>
being applied in accordance with clauses (a), (b) and (z) above there remain
excess net proceeds, the Company will apply such excess net proceeds to the
general corporate purposes of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. An
offer to purchase Senior Debt Securities required to be made pursuant to this
covenant is an "Asset Disposition Offer" and the date on which the purchase of
Debt Securities relating to any such Asset Disposition Offer is to be made is an
"Asset Disposition Payment Date."

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries receives securities or other non-cash property or assets
as proceeds of an Asset Disposition (other than equity in the transferee not
constituting Redeemable Stock), the Company shall not be required to make any
application required by the preceding paragraph until it receives cash proceeds
from a sale, repayment, exchange, redemption or retirement of or extraordinary
dividend or return of capital on such non-cash property, except that if and to
the extent the sum of all cash proceeds plus the fair market value of equity
(other than Redeemable Stock) in the transferee of such Asset Disposition
received at the time of such Asset Disposition is less than 70% of the fair
market value of the total proceeds of such Asset Disposition (with such fair
market value determined and evidenced in the same manner as stated in clause (i)
of the preceding paragraph), the amount of such deficiency (the "Deficiency
Amount") shall be applied as required by the preceding paragraph as if received
at the time of the Asset Disposition. Any amounts deferred pursuant to the
preceding sentence shall be applied in accordance with the preceding paragraph
when cash proceeds are thereafter received from a sale, repayment, exchange,
redemption or retirement of or extraordinary dividend or return of capital on
such non-cash property; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be
required to apply with respect to any equity interest in a transferee an amount
exceeding the fair market value attributable to such equity interest at the time
of the Asset Disposition; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if a Deficiency Amount was
applied pursuant to the exception contained in the preceding sentence, then once
the cumulative amount of applications made pursuant to the preceding paragraph
and this paragraph (including any Deficiency Amount) equals 100% of the fair
market value of the total proceeds of the Asset Disposition at the time of such
Asset Disposition, cash proceeds thereafter received from a sale, repayment,
exchange, redemption or retirement of or extraordinary dividend or return of
capital on such non-cash property shall not be required to be applied in
accordance with the preceding paragraph except to the extent such cash proceeds
exceed the Deficiency Amount.

Notice of an Asset Disposition Offer shall be mailed on behalf of the
Company by the Trustee to all Holders of Senior Debt Securities at their last
registered addresses not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days before the
Asset Disposition Payment Date, which shall be a date not more than 210 days
after the Asset Disposition giving rise to such Asset Disposition Offer. The
Asset Disposition Offer shall remain open from the time of the mailing of such
notice until not more than 5 Business Days before the Asset Disposition Payment
Date.

On the Asset Disposition Payment Date, the Company shall accept for payment
Senior Debt Securities or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Asset
Disposition Offer in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Asset
Disposition Offer Amount or such lesser amount of Senior Debt Securities as
shall have been tendered, and deposit with the Paying Agent money sufficient to
pay the purchase price of all Senior Debt Securities or portions thereof so
accepted. If the aggregate principal amount of Senior Debt Securities tendered
exceeds the Asset Disposition Offer Amount, the Company shall select the Senior
Debt Securities to be purchased on a pro rata basis to the nearest $1,000 of
principal amount. The Paying Agent shall promptly mail or deliver to Holders of
Senior Debt Securities so accepted payment in an amount equal to the purchase
price, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate
and mail or make available for delivery to such Holders a new Senior Debt
Security of the applicable series and equal in principal amount to any
unpurchased portion of the Senior Debt Security surrendered. The Company will
publicly announce the results of the Asset Disposition Offer.

With respect to any Asset Disposition Offer, the Company intends to comply
with the requirements of Section 14(e) and Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, if
applicable.

RESTRICTIONS ON MERGERS AND CONSOLIDATIONS AND SALES OF ASSETS

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that the Company shall not
consolidate with, merge with or into any other corporation (whether or not the
Company shall be the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer or lease
all or substantially all of its properties and assets as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety to any Person or group of affiliated Persons, in
one transaction or a series of related transactions, unless: (1) either the
Company

26
<PAGE>
shall be the continuing Person or the Person (if other than the Company) formed
by such consolidation or with which or into which the Company is merged or the
Person (or group of affiliated Persons) to which all or substantially all the
properties and assets of the Company are sold, assigned, transferred or leased
is a corporation (or constitute corporations) organized under the laws of the
United States or any State thereof or the District of Columbia and expressly
assumes, by an indenture supplemental to the Senior Debt Securities Indenture,
all the obligations of the Company under the Senior Debt Securities and the
Senior Debt Securities Indenture; (2) immediately before and after giving effect
to such transaction, no Event of Default, and no Default, with respect to the
Senior Debt Securities shall have occurred and be continuing; (3) immediately
after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis, but prior to any
purchase accounting adjustments resulting from the transaction, the Consolidated
Net Worth of the Company (or of the surviving, consolidated or transferee entity
if the Company is not continuing, treating such entity as the Company for
purposes of determining Consolidated Net Worth) shall be at least equal to the
Consolidated Net Worth of the Company immediately before such transaction; (4)
immediately after giving effect to such transaction the Company (or the
surviving, consolidated or transferee entity if the Company is not continuing,
but treating such entity as the Company for purposes of making such
determination) would be permitted to incur an additional dollar of Indebtedness
(not constituting Permitted Indebtedness) immediately prior to such transaction
under the covenant contained in the Senior Debt Securities Indenture restricting
the incurrence of Indebtedness; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this clause (4) shall be
inapplicable if (a) such transaction would result in the occurrence of a Change
of Control or (b) immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction, the
Company would not be permitted to incur an additional dollar of Indebtedness
(not constituting Permitted Indebtedness) under such covenant, and immediately
after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis (but prior to any
purchase accounting adjustments resulting from the transaction), the
Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of the Company (or the surviving,
consolidated or transferee entity if the Company is not continuing, treating
such entity as the Company for purposes of determining the Consolidated Interest
Coverage Ratio) shall be at least equal to the Consolidated Interest Coverage
Ratio of the Company immediately before such transaction; and (5) the Company
shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such
supplemental indenture comply with the Senior Debt Securities Indenture.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if clause (4) of the preceding sentence is
inapplicable by reason of clause (b) of the proviso thereto, and at the date
three months after the consummation of such transaction the rating ascribed to
the Senior Debt Securities of any series by Standard and Poor's Corporation or
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. shall be lower than the rating ascribed to the
Senior Debt Securities of any series prior to the public announcement of such
transaction, then the Company shall make an offer for the Senior Debt Securities
of each series at the same price and following the same procedures and
obligations as required with respect to a Change of Control (as if such date
three months after the giving effect to such transaction were the "Change of
Control Date"). See "Limitation on Future Incurrence of Indebtedness" above and
"Change of Control" below.

If, upon any consolidation or merger, or upon any sale, assignment, transfer
or lease, as provided in the preceding paragraph, any material property of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or any shares of Capital Stock or
Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary, owned immediately prior thereto,
would thereupon become subject to any Lien securing any indebtedness for
borrowed money of, or guaranteed by, such other corporation or Person (other
than any Permitted Lien), the Company, prior to such consolidation, merger,
sale, assignment, transfer or lease, will secure the due and punctual payment of
the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Debt
Securities of each series then Outstanding (together with, if the Company shall
so determine, any other indebtedness of, or guaranteed by, the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary and then existing or thereafter created) equally and
ratably with (or, at the option of the Company, prior to) the Indebtedness
secured by such Lien.

CHANGE OF CONTROL

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (the "Change of Control Date")
and subject to the requirements of the next succeeding sentence, each Holder
shall have the right to require that the Company repurchase such Holder's Senior
Debt Securities pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control
Offer") at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of
such Senior Debt Securities plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
date of such repurchase. If such repurchase would constitute an event of default
under Specified Bank Debt, then, prior to giving the notice to Holders provided
below, the Senior Debt Securities

27
<PAGE>
Indenture requires the Company to (1) repay in full in cash such Specified Bank
Debt or (2) obtain the requisite consent of holders of such Specified Bank Debt
to permit the repurchase of Senior Debt Securities without giving rise to an
event of default under such Specified Bank Debt.

As of September 30, 1993, approximately $1.7 billion of Specified Bank Debt
was outstanding.

Promptly upon satisfaction of either one of the obligations described above,
the Company shall mail a notice to each Holder of Senior Debt Securities of each
applicable series in respect of the Change of Control Offer (which notice shall
contain all instructions and materials necessary to enable such Holders to
tender Senior Debt Securities). All Senior Debt Securities of each applicable
series tendered will be accepted for payment on a date (the "Change of Control
Payment Date") which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 40 days
from the date such notice is mailed, but in any event prior to the date on which
any Subordinated Indebtedness is paid pursuant to the terms of a provision
similar to the Change of Control Offer covenant.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall accept for payment
Senior Debt Securities of each applicable series or portions thereof tendered
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, and deposit with the Paying Agent money
sufficient to pay the purchase price of all Senior Debt Securities of each
applicable series or portions thereof so accepted. The Paying Agent shall
promptly mail or deliver to the Holder of Senior Debt Securities of each
applicable series so accepted payment in an amount equal to the purchase price,
and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail or make available for
delivery to such Holder a new Senior Debt Security of the same series as, and
equal in principal amount to, any unpurchased portion of the Senior Debt
Security surrendered. The Company will publicly announce the results of the
Change of Control Offer.

Whether a Change of Control has occurred depends entirely on the
accumulation of Common Stock of the Company and on certain changes in the
composition of the Company's Board of Directors. As a result, the Company can
enter into certain highly leveraged transactions, including certain
recapitalizations, mergers or stock repurchases, that would not result in the
application of the Change of Control provisions. Because the definitions of
"Change of Control" and "Acquiring Person" exclude the Company, any Subsidiary
of the Company and certain members of the Stone family, certain transactions in
which such entities and persons participate as beneficial owners of Common Stock
(including, among others, a leveraged buyout or recapitalization) would not
constitute a Change of Control. With respect to any Change of Control Offer, the
Company intends to comply with the requirements of Section 14(e) and Rule 14e-1
under the Exchange Act, if then applicable.

RANKING OF SENIOR DEBT SECURITIES

The payment of the principal of, interest on and any other amounts due on
Subordinated Indebtedness will be subordinated in right of payment to the prior
payment in full of the Senior Debt Securities. The Senior Debt Securities are
senior to the Company's $150 million aggregate principal amount of 10 3/4%
Senior Subordinated Notes due June 15, 1997, $125 million aggregate principal
amount of 11% Senior Subordinated Notes due August 15, 1999, $230 million
aggregate principal amount of 11 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due September 1,
1999, $200 million aggregate principal amount of 10 3/4% Senior Subordinated
Debentures due April 1, 2002, $250 million aggregate principal amount of 8 7/8%
Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due July 15, 2000, $98 million aggregate
principal amount of 13 5/8% Subordinated Notes due June 1, 1995, and $115
million aggregate principal amount of 6 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures
due February 15, 2007.

EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND NOTICE THEREOF

The following are Events of Default under the Senior Debt Securities
Indenture with respect to Senior Debt Securities of any series: (1) failure to
pay interest on any Senior Debt Security of that series when due, continued for
30 days; (2) failure to pay the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Senior
Debt Securities of that series when due and payable at Maturity, upon
redemption, upon repurchase pursuant to a Deficiency Offer as described under
"Maintenance of Subordinated Capital Base" above, pursuant to an Asset
Disposition Offer as described under "Change of Control" above or otherwise; (3)
failure to observe or perform any other covenant, warranty or agreement
contained in the Senior Debt Securities of that series or in the Senior Debt
Securities Indenture (other than a covenant, agreement or warranty included in
the Senior Debt Securities Indenture solely for the benefit of Senior Debt
Securities other than that series), continued for a period of 60 days after
notice has been given to the Company by the Trustee or Holders of at least 25%
in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Debt

28
<PAGE>
Securities of that series; (4) failure to pay at final maturity, or acceleration
of, Indebtedness of the Company having an aggregate principal amount of not less
than $25 million (or, if less, the least amount contained in any similar
provision of an instrument governing any outstanding Subordinated Indebtedness
of the Company, but in no event less than $10 million), unless cured within 15
days after notice has been given to the Company by the Trustee or Holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Debt
Securities of that series; (5) the entering against the Company of one or more
judgments or decrees involving an aggregate liability of $25 million or more
unless vacated, discharged, satisfied or stayed within 30 days of the entering
of such judgments or decrees; (6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization relating to the Company; and (7) any other Event of Default with
respect to Senior Debt Securities of that series specified in the Prospectus
Supplement relating thereto.

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that the Trustee shall, within
30 days after the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default with respect to
Senior Debt Securities of any series, give the Holders of Senior Debt Securities
of that series notice of all uncured Defaults or Events of Default known to it
(the term "Default" to include the events specified above without grace or
notice); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, except in the case of an Event of Default or a
Default in payment on any Senior Debt Securities of any series, the Trustee
shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of
directors, the executive committee or directors or responsible officers of the
Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the
interest of the Holders of Senior Debt Securities of that series.

If an Event of Default with respect to Senior Debt Securities of any series
(other than due to event of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization) occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the Outstanding Senior Debt Securities of that series, by notice in
writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders of at least
25% in aggregate amount of Senior Debt Securities of that series), may declare
the unpaid principal of and accrued interest to the date of acceleration on all
the Outstanding Senior Debt Securities of that series to be due and payable
immediately and, upon any such declaration, the Senior Debt Securities of that
series shall become immediately due and payable.

If an Event of Default occurs due to bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization, all unpaid principal (without premium) of and accrued interest
on the Outstanding Senior Debt Securities of any series ipso facto becomes
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of
the Trustee or any Holder of any Senior Debt Security of that series.

Any such declaration with respect to Senior Debt Securities of any series
may be annulled and past Events of Default and Defaults (except, unless
theretofore cured, an Event of Default or a Default, in payment of principal of
or interest on the Senior Debt Securities of that series) may be waived by the
Holders of a majority of the principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Debt
Securities, upon the conditions provided in the Senior Debt Securities
Indenture.

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that the Company will
periodically file statements with the Trustee regarding compliance by the
Company with certain of the covenants thereof and specifying any Event of
Default or Defaults with respect to Senior Debt Securities of any series in
performing such covenants of which the signers may have knowledge.

MODIFICATION OF SENIOR DEBT SECURITIES INDENTURE; WAIVER

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture may be modified by the Company and the
Trustee without the consent of any Holders with respect to certain matters,
including (i) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or to correct or
supplement any provision which may be inconsistent with any other provision of
the Senior Debt Securities Indenture and (ii) to make any change that does not
materially adversely affect the interests of any Holder of Senior Debt
Securities of any series. In addition, under the Senior Debt Securities
Indenture, certain rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of
Holders of the Senior Debt Securities may be modified by the Company and the
Trustee with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in
principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Debt Securities of each series
affected thereby; but no extension of the maturity of any Senior Debt Securities
of any series, reduction in the interest rate or extension of the time for
payment of interest, change in the optional redemption or repurchase provisions
in a manner adverse to any Holder of Senior Debt Securities of any series,

29
<PAGE>
other modification in the terms of payment of the principal of or interest on
any Senior Debt Securities of any series, or reduction of the percentage
required for modification, will be effective against any Holder of any
Outstanding Senior Debt Security of any series affected thereby without his
consent. The Senior Debt Securities Indenture does not limit the aggregate
amount of Senior Debt Securities of the Company which may be issued thereunder.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Debt
Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all Senior Debt
Securities of that series waive, insofar as that series is concerned, compliance
by the Company with certain restrictive covenants of the Senior Debt Securities
Indenture. The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Senior Debt Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of
all Senior Debt Securities of that series waive any past Event of Default or
Default under the Senior Debt Securities Indenture with respect to that series,
except an Event of Default or a Default in the payment of the principal of or
premium, if any, or any interest on any Senior Debt Security of that series or
in respect of a provision which under the Senior Debt Securities Indenture
cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each
Outstanding Senior Debt Security of that series affected.

SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF SENIOR DEBT SECURITIES INDENTURE; DEFEASANCE

The Company may terminate its substantive obligations in respect of Senior
Debt Securities of any series by delivering all Outstanding Senior Debt
Securities of that series to the Trustee for cancellation and paying all sums

CERTAIN DEFINITIONS

For purposes of the Senior Debt Securities Indenture, certain defined terms

"ACQUIRING PERSON" means any Person or group (as defined in Section
13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) who or which, together with all affiliates and
associates (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act), becomes the

the number of shares outstanding, increases the proportionate number of shares
beneficially owned by such Person to more than 50% or more of the Common Stock
of the Company then outstanding; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if a Person shall

Indebtedness of the Company, whether outstanding on the dates of the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture or the Subordinated Debt Securities
Indenture or thereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed by the Company
in compliance with the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture or the
Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, which is not Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness or Junior Subordinated Indebtedness; and (iii) Indebtedness of the
Company under interest rate swaps, caps or similar hedging agreements and
foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps or similar agreements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, Senior Indebtedness
shall not include: (a) Indebtedness of or amounts owed by the Company for
compensation to employees, or for goods or materials purchased in the ordinary
course of business, or for services, or (b) Indebtedness of the Company to a
subsidiary of the Company.

"INDEBTEDNESS" means, with respect to any person, (i) any obligation of such
person to pay the principal of, premium, if any, interest on (including interest
accruing on or after the filing of any petition in bankruptcy or for
reorganization relating to the Company, whether or not a claim for such
post-petition interest is allowed in such proceeding), penalties, reimbursement
or indemnification amounts, fees, expenses or other amounts relating to any
indebtedness and any other liability, contingent or otherwise, of such person
(A) for borrowed money (whether or not the recourse of the lender is to the
whole of the assets of such person or only to a portion thereof), (B) evidenced
by a note, debenture or similar instrument (including a purchase money
obligation) given in connection with the acquisition of any property or assets
(other than inventory or similar property acquired in the ordinary course of
business), including securities, (C) for goods, materials or services purchased
in the ordinary

41
<PAGE>
course of business, (D) for any letter of credit or performance bond in favor of
such person, or (E) for the payment of money relating to a Capitalized Lease
Obligation; (ii) any liability of others of the kind described in the preceding
clause (i), which the person has guaranteed or which is otherwise its legal
liability; (iii) any obligation secured by a Lien to which the property or
assets of such person are subject, whether or not the obligations secured
thereby shall have been assumed by or shall otherwise be such person's legal
liability; and (iv) any and all deferrals, renewals, extensions and refunding
of, or amendments, modifications or supplements to, any liability of the kind
described in any of the preceding clauses (i), (ii) or (iii). The amount of
Indebtedness of any person at any date shall be the outstanding balance at such
date of all unconditional obligations as described above, plus the maximum
amount of any contingent obligations as described above, in each case at such
date.

"SENIOR SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS" means Indebtedness of the Company
(whether outstanding on the dates of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
Indenture or the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture or thereafter created,
incurred, assumed or guaranteed by the Company) which, pursuant to the terms of
the instrument creating or evidencing the same, is subordinate in right of
payment to the Senior Indebtedness and senior in right of payment to the Junior
Subordinated Indebtedness.

"JUNIOR SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS" means Indebtedness of the Company
(whether outstanding on the dates of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
Indenture or the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture or thereafter created,
incurred, assumed or guaranteed by the Company) which, pursuant to the terms of
the instrument creating or evidencing the same, is subordinate in right of
payment to the Senior Indebtedness and the Senior Subordinated Indebtedness.

CHANGE IN CONTROL

Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (the "Change in Control Date")
and subject to the requirements of the next succeeding sentence, each Holder of
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities shall have
the right, at the Holder's option, to require the Company to purchase all or any
part (provided that the principal amount must be $1,000 or an integral multiple
thereof) of such Holder's Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated
Debt Securities pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change in Control
Offer") at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to the date of such purchase. It shall be a condition
precedent to such right of any Holder to require the purchase of any such Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities that prior thereto,
and prior to giving the notice to Holders provided below, the Company shall have
first (1) repaid in full in cash all Specified Bank Debt or (2) obtained the
requisite consent of holders of such Specified Bank Debt to permit the purchase
of such Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities.

Promptly upon satisfaction of either one of the conditions precedent
described above, the Company shall mail a notice (which notice shall contain all
instructions and materials necessary to enable Holders to tender Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities) to each Holder of
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of each
applicable series. All Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt
Securities of each applicable series tendered will be accepted for payment on a
date which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 40 days from the date
such notice is mailed (the "Change in Control Payment Date").

On the Change in Control Payment Date, the Company shall accept for payment
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of each
applicable series or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Change in Control
Offer, and deposit with the applicable Paying Agent money sufficient to pay the
purchase price of all Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt
Securities of each applicable series or portions thereof so accepted. The
applicable Paying Agent shall promptly mail or deliver to the Holder of Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of each applicable
series so accepted payment in an amount equal to the purchase price, and the
applicable Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail or make available for
delivery to such Holder a new Senior Subordinated Debt Security or Subordinated
Debt Security of the same series as, and equal in principal amount to, any
unpurchased portion of the Senior Subordinated Debt Security or Subordinated
Debt Security surrendered. The Company will publicly announce the results of the
Change in Control Offer.

42
<PAGE>
Whether a Change in Control has occurred depends entirely on the
accumulation of Common Stock of the Company and on certain changes in the
composition of the Company's Board of Directors. As a result, the Company can
enter into certain highly leveraged transactions, including certain
recapitalizations, mergers or stock repurchases, that would not result in the
application of the Change in Control provisions. With respect to any Change in
Control Offer, the Company intends to comply with the requirements of Section
14(e), Rule 14e-1 and Rule 13e-4 under the Exchange Act, if then applicable.

The Change in Control purchase feature of the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities and the Subordinated Debt Securities may in certain circumstances
make more difficult or discourage a takeover of the Company and, thus, the
removal of incumbent management. The Change in Control purchase feature,
however, is not the result of management's knowledge of any specific effort to
accumulate shares of Common Stock or to obtain control of the Company by means
of a merger, tender offer, solicitation or otherwise, or part of a plan by
management to adopt a series of anti-takeover provisions. Instead, the Change in
Control purchase feature is a standard term contained in other similar debt
offerings. Change in control provisions are also contained in the Credit
Agreements and other indentures.

If a Change in Control were to occur, there can be no assurance that the
required condition precedent to a Holder's right to require the purchase of the
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities will be
satisfied. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company would have
sufficient funds to pay the required purchase price for all the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities tendered by the
Holders thereof. The Company's ability to purchase the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities tendered upon a Change in Control may
be limited by the terms of its then-existing borrowing and other agreements. The
subordination provisions of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture
and the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture may limit the ability of the
Company to purchase the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt
Securities if an event of default has occurred with respect to the Senior
Indebtedness. See "-- Additional Terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities -- Subordination" and "-- Additional Terms of the Subordinated Debt
Securities -- Subordination."

As of September 30, 1993, approximately $1.7 billion of Specified Bank Debt
was outstanding.

Because the definitions of "Change in Control" and "Acquiring Person"
exclude the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company and certain members of the
Stone family, certain transactions in which such entities and persons
participate as beneficial owners of Common Stock (including, among others, a
leveraged buyout or recapitalization) would not constitute a Change in Control.

Other provisions of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture or the
Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture may be applicable in the event of a
highly leveraged transaction by the Company. See "Description of Debt Securities
- -- Particular Terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities and Subordinated
Debt Securities -- Restrictions on Mergers and Consolidations and Sales of
Assets" and "-- Additional Terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities --
Minimum Net Worth Interest Rate Adjustment." The Board of Directors of the
Company may not unilaterally waive these provisions.

For purposes of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture and the
Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, the definitions of "Change in Control,"
"Acquiring Person," "Continuing Director" and "Specified Bank Debt" have
identical meanings as the definitions used in the Senior Debt Securities
Indenture except for references to the specific Debt Securities being issued and
the applicable Indenture. See "Description of Debt Securities -- Particular
Terms of the Senior Debt Securities -- Certain Definitions."

RESTRICTIONS ON MERGERS AND CONSOLIDATIONS AND SALES OF ASSETS

The Company shall not consolidate with, merge with or into any other
corporation (whether or not the Company shall be the surviving corporation), or
sell, assign, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its properties and
assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to any Person or group of
affiliated Persons, in one transaction or a series of related transactions,
unless: (1) either the Company shall be the continuing Person or the Person (if
other than the Company) formed by such consolidation or with which or into which
the Company is merged or the Person (or group of affiliated Persons) to which
all or substantially all the properties and assets of the Company are sold,
assigned, transferred or leased is a corporation (or constitute corporations)
organized under

43
<PAGE>
the laws of the United States or any State thereof or the District of Columbia
and expressly assumes, by indentures supplemental to the Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities Indenture or the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, as the
case may be, all the obligations of the Company under the Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities, as the case may be, and the
respective Indentures; (2) immediately before and after giving effect to such
transaction or series of related transactions, no Event of Default, and no
Default, with respect to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated
Debt Securities, as the case may be, shall have occurred and be continuing; (3)
immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of related
transactions on a pro forma basis, but prior to any purchase accounting
adjustments resulting from the transaction or series of related transactions,
the Net Worth of the Company (or of the surviving, consolidated or transferee
entity if the Company is not continuing) shall be at least equal to the Net
Worth of the Company immediately before such transaction or series of related
transactions; and (4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such
consolidation, merger or sale, assignment, transfer or lease and such
supplemental indentures comply with the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
Indenture or the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, as the case may be.

EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND NOTICE THEREOF

The following are Events of Default under the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities Indenture or the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, as the case
may be, with respect to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated
Debt Securities of any series: (1) failure to pay interest on any Debt
Securities of that series when due, continued for 30 days; (2) failure to pay
the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Debt Securities of that series
when due and payable at Maturity, upon redemption or otherwise; (3) failure to
observe or perform any other covenant, warranty or agreement contained in the
Debt Securities of that series or in the applicable Indenture (other than a
covenant, agreement or warranty included in the applicable Indenture solely for
the benefit of Debt Securities of a series other than that series), continued
for a period of 60 days after notice has been given to the Company by the
applicable Trustee or Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of
the Outstanding Debt Securities of that series; (4) failure to pay at final
maturity, or acceleration of, Indebtedness of the Company having an aggregate
principal amount of not less than $25 million, unless cured within 15 days after
notice has been given to the Company by the applicable Trustee or Holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of
that series; (5) the entering against the Company of one or more judgments or
decrees involving an aggregate liability of $25 million or more unless vacated,
discharged, satisfied or stayed within 30 days of the entering of such judgments
or decrees; (6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization
relating to the Company; and (7) any other Event of Default with respect to Debt
Securities of that series specified in the Prospectus Supplement relating
thereto.

Both of the applicable Indentures provides that the applicable Trustee
shall, within 30 days after the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
with respect to Debt Securities of any series issued under such Indenture, give
the Holders of Debt Securities of that series notice of all uncured Defaults or
Events of Default known to it (the term "Default" to include the events
specified above without grace or notice); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, EXCEPT in the
case of an Event of Default or a Default in payment on any Debt Securities of
any series, the applicable Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice
if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee or directors
or responsible officers of the applicable Trustee in good faith determine that
the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders of the Debt
Securities of that series.

If an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any series (other than due to
events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization) occurs and is continuing,
the applicable Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of that series, by notice in writing
to the Company (and to the applicable Trustee if given by the Holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of that series),
may declare the unpaid principal of and accrued interest to the date of
acceleration on all the Outstanding Debt Securities of that series to be due and
payable immediately and, upon any such declaration, the Debt Securities of that
series shall become immediately due and payable.

If an Event of Default occurs due to bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization, all unpaid principal (without premium) of and accrued interest
on the Outstanding Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt

44
<PAGE>
Securities of any series IPSO FACTO becomes immediately due and payable without
any declaration or other act on the part of the applicable Trustee or any Holder
of any Senior Subordinated Debt Security or Subordinated Debt Security of that
series.

Any such declaration with respect to Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or
Subordinated Debt Securities of any series may be annulled and past Events of
Default and Defaults (except, unless theretofore cured, an Event of Default or a
Default, in payment of principal of or interest on the Debt Securities of that
series) may be waived by the Holders of a majority of the principal amount of
the Outstanding Debt Securities of that series, upon the conditions provided in
the applicable Indenture.

The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture and the Subordinated Debt
Securities Indenture provide that the Company shall periodically file statements
with the Trustees regarding compliance by the Company with certain of the
respective covenants thereof and shall specify any Event of Default or Defaults
with respect to Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt
Securities of any series, in performing such covenants, of which the signers may
have knowledge.

MODIFICATION OF THE INDENTURES; WAIVER

The Indentures applicable to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities and the
Subordinated Debt Securities may be modified by the Company and the applicable
Trustee without the consent of any Holders with respect to certain matters,
including (i) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or to correct or
supplement any provision which may be inconsistent with any other provision of
the applicable Indenture and (ii) to make any change that does not materially
adversely affect the interests of any Holder of Debt Securities of any series
issued under such Indenture. In addition, under both of the Indentures, certain
rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of Holders of the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities may be modified by
the Company and the applicable Trustee with the written consent of the Holders
of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of each series
affected thereby; but no extension of the maturity of any Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any series, reduction in the
interest rate or extension of the time for payment of interest, change in the
optional redemption or repurchase provisions in a manner adverse to any Holder
of Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any
series issued under the applicable Indenture, other modification in the terms of
payment of the principal of, or interest on, any Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any series, or reduction of the
percentage required for modification, will be effective against any Holder of
any Outstanding Senior Subordinated Debt Security or Subordinated Debt Security
of any series issued under the applicable Indenture and affected thereby without
his consent. Neither of the Indentures limits the aggregate amount of Debt
Securities of the Company which may be issued thereunder.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any
series may on behalf of the Holders of all Debt Securities of that series waive,
insofar as that series is concerned, compliance by the Company with certain
restrictive covenants of the applicable Indenture. The Holders of not less than
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any series may on behalf of
the Holders of all Debt Securities of that series waive any past Event of
Default or Default under the applicable Indenture with respect to that series,
except an Event of Default or a Default in the payment of the principal of, or
premium, if any, or any interest on any Debt Securities of that series or in
respect of a provision which under the applicable Indenture cannot be modified
or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Debt Security
of that series affected.

DEFEASANCE

The Company may terminate its substantive obligations in respect of Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any series
(except for its obligations to pay the principal of (and premium, if any, on)
and the interest on the Debt Securities of that series) by (i) depositing with
the applicable Trustee, under the terms of an irrevocable trust agreement, money
or United States Government Obligations sufficient to pay all remaining
indebtedness on the Debt Securities of that series, (ii) delivering to the
applicable Trustee either an Opinion of Counsel or a ruling directed to the
applicable Trustee from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the
Holders of the Debt Securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or
loss for federal income tax

45
<PAGE>
purposes as a result of such deposit and termination of obligations, and (iii)
complying with certain other requirements set forth in the applicable Indenture.
In addition, the Company may terminate all of its substantive obligations in
respect of Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or the Subordinated Debt
Securities of any series (including its obligations to pay the principal of (and
premium, if any, on) and interest on the Debt Securities of that series) by (i)
depositing with the applicable Trustee, under the terms of an irrevocable trust
agreement, money or United States Government Obligations sufficient to pay all
remaining indebtedness on the Debt Securities of that series, (ii) delivering to
the applicable Trustee either a ruling directed to the applicable Trustee from
the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the Holders of the Debt
Securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal
income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and termination of obligations
or an Opinion of Counsel, based upon such a ruling or a change in the applicable
federal tax law since the date of the applicable Indenture, to such effect, and
(iii) complying with certain other requirements set forth in the applicable
Indenture.

THE TRUSTEES

Norwest Bank Minnesota, National Association, is the Trustee under the
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, and The Bank of New York is the
Trustee under the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture.

The Company maintains normal commercial banking relations with The Bank of
New York, which is also a lender under the Credit Agreements and the Trustee
under the Senior Debt Securities Indenture and other indentures of the Company.
In addition, Norwest Bank Minnesota, National Association, is the trustee of the
indenture relating to the 8 7/8% Convertible Notes.

ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE SENIOR SUBORDINATED
DEBT SECURITIES

The following terms apply solely to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities.
See "Description of Debt Securities -- Particular Terms of the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities and Subordinated Debt Securities" for other terms
which are also applicable to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities. The
particular terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities offered by any
Prospectus Supplement and the extent, if any, to which such general provisions
may apply to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities so offered will be
described in the Prospectus Supplement relating to such Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities.

SUBORDINATION

The payment of the principal of, interest on or any other amounts due on the
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities will be subordinated in right of payment to
the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company. No payment
on account of principal of, redemption of, interest on or any other amounts due
on the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities and no redemption, purchase or other
acquisition of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities may be made unless (i)
full payment of amounts then due for principal, sinking funds, interest
(including interest accruing on or after the filing of any petition in
bankruptcy or for reorganization relating to the Company, whether or not a claim
for such post-petition interest is allowed in such proceeding), penalties,
reimbursement or indemnification amounts, fees and expenses, and of all other
amounts then due on all Senior Indebtedness have been made or duly provided for
pursuant to the terms of the instrument governing such Senior Indebtedness, and
(ii) at the time for, or immediately after giving effect to, any such payment,
redemption, purchase or other acquisition, there shall not exist under any
Senior Indebtedness or any agreement pursuant to which any Senior Indebtedness
has been issued, any default which shall not have been cured or waived and which
shall have resulted in the full amount of such Senior Indebtedness being
declared due and payable. In addition, the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
Indenture provides that if the holders of any Senior Indebtedness notify the
Company and the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Trustee that a default has
occurred giving the holders of such Senior Indebtedness the right to accelerate
the maturity thereof, no payment on account of principal, sinking fund or other
redemption, interest or any other amounts due on the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities and no purchase, redemption or other acquisition of the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities will be made for the period (the "Payment Blockage
Period") commencing on the date notice is received and ending on the earlier of
(A) the date on which such event of default shall have been cured or waived or
(B) 180 days from the date notice is received. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
only one payment blockage notice with respect to the same event of default or
any other events of default existing and known to the person giving such notice
at the time of such notice on the same

46
<PAGE>
issue of Senior Indebtedness may be given during any period of 360 consecutive
days. No new Payment Blockage Period may be commenced by the holders of Senior
Indebtedness during any period of 360 consecutive days unless all events of
default which triggered the preceding Payment Blockage Period have been cured or
waived. The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture provisions described
in this paragraph, however, do not prevent the Company from making a mandatory
redemption payment, if any, with Senior Subordinated Debt Securities acquired
prior to the happening of such a default as described in this paragraph. Upon
any distribution of its assets in connection with any dissolution, winding-up,
liquidation or reorganization of the Company or acceleration of the principal
amount due on the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities because of an Event of
Default, all Senior Indebtedness must be paid in full before the Holders of the
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities are entitled to any payments whatsoever.

The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture does not restrict the
amount of Senior Indebtedness or other indebtedness of the Company or any
subsidiary of the Company, except that the Company may not incur any
Indebtedness which is senior to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities but
subordinate to Senior Indebtedness. As of July 12, 1993, the Company's Senior
Indebtedness aggregated approximately $2.6 billion.

As a result of these subordination provisions, in the event of the Company's
insolvency, holders of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities may recover
ratably less than general creditors of the Company.

The payment of the principal of, interest on or any other amounts due on
Junior Subordinated Indebtedness will be subordinated in right of payment to the
prior payment in full of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities.

The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities are subordinate to the indebtedness
under the Credit Agreements, the Company's 11 7/8% Senior Notes due December 1,
1998 and the 12 5/8% Senior Notes due July 15, 1998 and are senior to the
Company's 13 5/8% Subordinated Notes due June 1, 1995 and its 6 3/4% Convertible
Subordinated Debentures due February 15, 2007. The Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities will rank PARI PASSU in right of payment to all existing and future
Senior Subordinated Indebtedness, including with the Company's outstanding
10 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due June 15, 1997, its 11% Senior Subordinated
Notes due August 15, 1999, the 11 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due September
1, 1999, the 8 7/8% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due July 15, 2000, and
its 10 3/4% Senior Subordinated Debentures due April 1, 2002.

MINIMUM NET WORTH INTEREST RATE ADJUSTMENT

The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture requires that if a series
of Senior Subordinated Debt Securities so provides and if the Company's Net
Worth is below $500 million (the "Minimum Net Worth") as at the end of any two
consecutive fiscal quarters (the last day of the second such fiscal quarter, the
"Failure Date"), then (i) the interest rate on the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities shall be reset as of the first day of the second fiscal quarter
following the Failure Date (the "Reset Date") to a rate per annum (the "Reset
Rate") equal to the greater of (x) the initial interest rate as set forth on the
cover page of the respective Prospectus Supplement (the "Initial Interest Rate")
or (y) the sum of (A) the basis points specified in the respective Prospectus
Supplement for purposes of this reset provision, and (B) the highest of the
treasury rates specified in the respective Prospectus Supplement for purposes of
this reset provision, (ii) on the first Interest Payment Date following the
Reset Date, the interest rate on the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities, as
reset on the Reset Date, shall increase by 50 basis points, and (iii) the
interest rate on the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities shall further increase
by an additional 50 basis points on each succeeding Interest Payment Date.
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing, in no event shall the interest rate
on the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities at any time exceed the Initial
Interest Rate by more than 200 basis points. However, if the Company's Net Worth
is equal to or above the Minimum Net Worth as of the last day of any fiscal
quarter subsequent to the Failure Date, then the interest rate on the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities shall return to the Initial Interest Rate as of the
first day of the second following fiscal quarter. If the Company's Net Worth
shall thereafter be less than the Minimum Net Worth as of the last day of any
two consecutive subsequent fiscal quarters, then the interest rate on the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities shall again be adjusted as provided in this
paragraph.

"NET WORTH" means the amount which, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") consistently applied, would be set forth under
the caption "stockholders' equity" (or any like caption) on the consolidated
balance sheet of the Company, exclusive of amounts attributable to Redeemable
Stock. If the

47
<PAGE>
Company has changed one or more of the accounting principles used in the
preparation of its financial statements, because of a change mandated by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, then Net Worth shall mean the Net Worth
the Company would have had if the Company had continued to use those generally
accepted accounting principles employed at December 31, 1991.

If a Reset Rate has been established for a series of Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities, it will be described in the Prospectus Supplement relating to
such Senior Subordinated Debt Securities.

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture provides that the Company
will not, and will not permit any subsidiary of the Company to, directly or
indirectly, (1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution, in cash or
otherwise, in respect of any shares of capital stock of the Company or to the
holders of capital stock of the Company as such (other than dividends or
distributions payable in shares of capital stock of the Company, other than
Redeemable Stock) or (2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for
value any of the capital stock of the Company or options, warrants or other
rights to acquire any such capital stock, other than acquisitions of capital
stock or such options, warrants or other rights by any Subsidiary of the Company
from the Company (any such transaction included in clause (1) or (2) a
"Restricted Payment") if (i) at the time of such Restricted Payment and after
giving effect thereto, (a) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing with respect to any series of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
or (b) the Net Worth of the Company shall be less than $750 million; or if (ii)
after giving effect to such Restricted Payment, the aggregate amount expended
subsequent to the date of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture for
all such Restricted Payments (the amount of any Restricted Payment, if other
than cash, to be the fair market value of such payment as determined by the
Board of Directors of the Company, whose reasonable determination shall be
conclusive and evidenced by a Board Resolution) exceeds the algebraic sum of (w)
a number calculated as follows: (A) if the aggregate Consolidated Net Income of
the Company earned on a cumulative basis during the period subsequent to June
30, 1993 through the end of the last fiscal quarter that is prior to the
declaration of any such dividend or distribution or the giving of notice of such
purchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement and for which such
financial information is then available, is a positive number, then 100% of such
positive number, and (B) if the aggregate Consolidated Net Income of the Company
earned on a cumulative basis during the period subsequent to June 30, 1993
through the end of the last fiscal quarter that is prior to the declaration of
any such dividend or distribution or the giving of notice of such purchase,
redemption or other acquisition or retirement and for which such financial
information is then available, is a negative number, then 100% of such negative
number, (x) the aggregate net cash proceeds received by the Company from the
issuance and sale, other than to a subsidiary of the Company, subsequent to the
date of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, of capital stock
(including capital stock issued upon the conversion of, or in exchange for,
securities other than capital stock and options, warrants or other rights to
acquire capital stock, but excluding Redeemable Stock), (y) the aggregate net
cash proceeds received by the Company from the issuance and sale, other than to
a subsidiary of the Company, of Indebtedness of the Company that is converted
into capital stock of the Company subsequent to the date of the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, and (z) $300 million; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that the retirement of any shares of the Company's capital stock by exchange
for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of, other
shares of capital stock of the Company other than Redeemable Stock shall not
constitute a Restricted Payment. If all of the conditions to the declaration of
a dividend or distribution that are described above are satisfied at the time
such dividend or distribution is declared, then such dividend or distribution
may be paid or made within sixty days after such declaration even if the payment
of such dividend, the making of such distribution or the declaration thereof
would not have been permitted at any time after such declaration.

"CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME" of the Company means, for any period for which the
determination thereof is to be made, the net income (or loss) of the Company and
its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for such period taken as a single
accounting period, determined in accordance with GAAP; PROVIDED that there shall
be excluded therefrom (i) the net income (or loss) of any person (a "joint
venture") in which any other person (other than the Company or any of its
subsidiaries) has a joint equity interest, except to the extent of the amount of
dividends or other distributions actually paid to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries by such joint venture during such period, (ii) except to the extent
includable pursuant to the foregoing clause (i), the net income (or loss) of any
person accrued prior to the date it becomes a subsidiary of the Company or is
merged into or consolidated with the

48
<PAGE>
Company or any of its subsidiaries or that person's assets are acquired by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) the net income of any subsidiary of
the Company to the extent that the declaration or payment of dividends or
similar distributions by that subsidiary of that income is not at the time
permitted by operation of the terms of its charter or any agreement, instrument,
judgment, decree, order, statute, rule or governmental regulation applicable to
that subsidiary, and (iv) the excess (but not the deficit), if any, of (x) any
gain which must be treated as an extraordinary item under GAAP or any gain
realized upon the sale or other disposition of any asset that is not sold in the
ordinary course of business or of any capital stock of the Company or a
subsidiary of the Company over (y) any loss which must be treated as an
extraordinary item under GAAP or any loss realized upon the sale or other
disposition of any asset that is not sold in the ordinary course of business or
of any capital stock of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company.

ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES

The following terms apply solely to the Subordinated Debt Securities. See
"Description of Debt Securities -- Particular Terms of the Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities and Subordinated Debt Securities" for other terms which are also
applicable to the Subordinated Debt Securities. The particular terms of the
Subordinated Debt Securities offered by any Prospectus Supplement and the
extent, if any, to which such general provisions may apply to the Subordinated
Debt Securities so offered will be described in the Prospectus Supplement
relating to such Subordinated Debt Securities.

SUBORDINATION

The payment of the principal of, interest on or any other amounts due on the
Subordinated Debt Securities will be subordinated in right of payment to the
prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness and Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Company. No payment on account of principal of, redemption
of, interest on or any other amounts due on the Subordinated Debt Securities and
no redemption, purchase or other acquisition of the Subordinated Debt Securities
may be made unless (i) full payment of amounts then due for principal, sinking
funds, interest (including interest accruing on or after the filing of any
petition in bankruptcy or for reorganization relating to the Company, whether or
not a claim for such post-petition interest is allowed in such proceeding),
penalties, reimbursement or indemnification amounts, fees and expenses, and of
all other amounts then due on all Senior Indebtedness and Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness have been made or duly provided for pursuant to the terms of the
instrument governing such Senior Indebtedness or Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness, and (ii) at the time for, or immediately after giving effect to,
any such payment, redemption, purchase or other acquisition, there shall not
exist under any Senior Indebtedness, Senior Subordinated Indebtedness or any
agreements pursuant to which any Senior Indebtedness or Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness has been issued, any default which shall not have been cured or
waived and which shall have resulted in the full amount of such Senior
Indebtedness or Senior Subordinated Indebtedness being declared due and payable.
In addition, the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture provides that if the
Holders of any Senior Indebtedness or Senior Subordinated Indebtedness notify
the Company and the Subordinated Debt Securities Trustee that a default has
occurred giving the holders of such Senior Indebtedness or Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness the right to accelerate the maturity thereof, no payment on account
of principal, sinking fund or other redemption, interest or any other amounts
due on the Subordinated Debt Securities and no purchase, redemption or other
acquisition of the Subordinated Debt Securities will be made for the period (the
"Subordinated Payment Blockage Period") commencing on the date notice is
received and ending on the earlier of (A) the date on which such event of
default shall have been cured or waived or (B) 270 days from the date notice is
received. Notwithstanding the foregoing, only one payment blockage notice with
respect to the same event of default or any other events of default existing and
known to the person giving such notice at the time of such notice on the same
issue of Senior Indebtedness or Senior Subordinated Indebtedness may be given
during any period of 360 consecutive days. No new Subordinated Payment Blockage
Period may be commenced by the holders of Senior Indebtedness or Senior
Subordinated Indebtedness during any period of 360 consecutive days unless all
events of default which triggered the preceding Subordinated Payment Blockage
Period have been cured or waived. The Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture
provisions described in this paragraph, however, do not prevent the Company from
making a mandatory redemption payment, if any, with Subordinated Debt Securities
acquired prior to the happening of such a default as described in this
paragraph. Upon any distribution of its assets in connection with any
dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization of the Company or
acceleration of the

49
<PAGE>
principal amount due on the Subordinated Debt Securities because of an Event of
Default, all Senior Indebtedness and Senior Subordinated Indebtedness must be
paid in full before the Holders of the Subordinated Debt Securities are entitled
to any payments whatsoever.

As a result of these subordination provisions, in the event of the Company's
insolvency, holders of the Subordinated Debt Securities may recover ratably less
than general creditors of the Company.

The Subordinated Debt Securities are subordinate in right of payment to all
existing and future Senior Indebtedness and Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of
the Company, including the indebtedness under the Credit Agreements, the
Company's 11 7/8% Senior Notes due December 1, 1998, its 12 5/8% Senior Notes
due July 15, 1998, its 10 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due June 15, 1997, its
11% Senior Subordinated Notes due August 15, 1999, its 11 1/2% Senior
Subordinated Notes due September 1, 1999, its 8 7/8% Convertible Senior
Subordinated Notes due July 15, 2000 and its 10 3/4% Senior Subordinated
Debentures due April 1, 2002. The Subordinated Debt Securities will rank PARI
PASSU upon liquidation with the Company's 13 5/8% Subordinated Notes due June 1,
1995 and its 6 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due February 15, 2007.

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK

THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY
ARE SUBJECT TO THE DETAILED PROVISIONS OF THE COMPANY'S CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION, AS AMENDED (THE "CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION"), INCLUDING THE
CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS FOR EACH OF THE SERIES E CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE
EXCHANGEABLE PREFERRED STOCK (THE "SERIES E PREFERRED STOCK") AND THE SERIES F
CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE EXCHANGEABLE PREFERRED STOCK (THE "SERIES F PREFERRED
STOCK") AND BY-LAWS, AS AMENDED (THE "BY-LAWS"). THESE STATEMENTS DO NOT PURPORT
TO BE COMPLETE, OR TO GIVE FULL EFFECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF STATUTORY OR COMMON
LAW, AND ARE SUBJECT TO, AND ARE QUALIFIED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO,
THE TERMS OF THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, THE CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS
OF EACH OF THE SERIES E AND SERIES F PREFERRED STOCK AND THE BY-LAWS.

GENERAL

The Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of a total of 210
million shares of all classes of stock, of which 10 million may be shares of
preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, and 200 million may be shares of the
Common Stock, par value $.01 per share. At July 13, 1993, approximately 71.2
million shares of Common Stock were outstanding. The Certificate of
Incorporation authorizes the Company's Board of Directors, without first
obtaining approval of the holders of Common Stock or any series of preferred
stock, to provide for the issuance of any or all shares of the preferred stock
in one or more series, and to fix the voting powers, full or limited, and the
designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special
rights, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, applicable
to the shares to be included in any such series as may be permitted by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. As of the date hereof, 4.6
million shares of Series E Preferred Stock are outstanding. In addition, 2
million shares of Series D Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.01
per share, of the Company (the "Series D Preferred Stock") have been authorized
and reserved for issuance in connection with the Series D Rights described below
and up to 400,000 shares of Series F Preferred Stock have been authorized and
reserved for issuance upon the occurrence of certain specified events described
in "Series F Preferred Stock" below.

COMMON STOCK

DIVIDEND RIGHTS

Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of the Company's
preferred stock which may at the time be outstanding, holders of the Common
Stock are entitled to receive, to the extent permitted by law, such dividends as
may be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors out of funds legally
available therefor.

VOTING RIGHTS

Each holder of Common Stock is entitled to one vote for each share of Common
Stock registered in such holder's name on the books of the Company on all
matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Except as otherwise provided by
law, the holders of shares of the Common Stock vote as one class. The holders of
shares of the Common Stock have cumulative voting rights under the Certificate
of Incorporation such that in all elections for directors, each holder entitled
to vote thereat is entitled to as many votes as is equal to the number of votes
which

50
<PAGE>
such holder would be entitled to cast for the election of directors with respect
to such holder's shares multiplied by the number of directors to be elected, and
such holder may cast all of such votes for a single director or may distribute
them among any two or more of them as such holder may see fit.

LIQUIDATION RIGHTS AND OTHER PROVISIONS

The Company has granted its lenders security interests in a substantial
portion of the Company's assets under the Credit Agreements and other debt
agreements. See "Credit Agreements." Subject to the prior rights of creditors
and the holders of any preferred stock which may be outstanding from time to
time, the holders of the Common Stock are entitled to share PRO RATA in the
distribution of any remaining assets in the event of liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company. The shares of Common Stock are not liable to any
calls or assessments and have no conversion rights or redemption or sinking fund
provisions. The Transfer Agent and Registrar for the Common Stock is The First
National Bank of Chicago.

CHANGE IN CONTROL

The Certificate of Incorporation and the Rights Agreement dated July 25,
1988, as amended (the "Rights Agreement"), between the Company and First Chicago
Trust Company of New York, as Rights Agent, contain certain provisions
(described below) that could make more difficult or discourage a change in
control of the Company. Such provisions are designed to discourage situations in
which the Company is forced to accept a proposal for the takeover of the Company
without ample time to evaluate the proposal and appropriate alternatives and to
encourage anyone contemplating a business combination with the Company to
negotiate directly with the Company on a fair and equitable basis.

SERIES D RIGHTS

Each share of Common Stock has associated with it one preferred share
purchase right (the "Series D Right") permitting the holder to purchase
approximately one-hundredth of a share of the Company's Series D Preferred Stock
at an exercise price of $130 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The
terms of the Series D Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement dated as of
July 25, 1988, as amended, between the Company and The First National Bank of
Chicago, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement").

The Series D Rights are not exercisable and are transferable only with the
related Common Stock certificates. The Series D Rights become exercisable and
separately transferable ten days after a person or group (excluding certain
entities including members of the Stone family) acquires 15% or more of the
outstanding shares of the Common Stock or ten business days after a person or
group (excluding certain entities including members of the Stone family)
announces a tender offer or exchange offer that would, if completed, result in
ownership by such person or group of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of
the Common Stock. Thereafter, the Series D Rights will trade separately from the
Common Stock.

After the Series D Rights become exercisable, if a person or group
(excluding certain entities including members of the Stone family) acquires 15%
or more of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock and the Company is
acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction, each Series D
Right will entitle its holder (other than the acquiring person or group) to
purchase, at the Series D Right's then-current exercise price, a number of the
acquiring company's shares of common stock having a market value at that time of
twice the Series D Right's then-current exercise price. In addition, in the
event that a person or group (excluding certain entities including members of
the Stone family) acquires 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the Common
Stock, each holder of a Series D Right (other than the acquiring person or
group) will be entitled to purchase the number of shares of the Common Stock
having a market value of twice the then-current exercise price of the Series D
Right.

Under certain circumstances, the Series D Rights may be redeemed at a price
of $.01 per Series D Right. The Series D Rights will expire in August 1998,
unless earlier redeemed by the Company.

The Rights Agreement generally provides that a Series D Right will be issued
in connection with each share of Common Stock (i) issued prior to the earliest
of the Distribution Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement) or the redemption,
exchange or expiration of the Series D Rights or (ii) issued at certain other
times pursuant to certain options, warrants or convertible securities.

51
<PAGE>
SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENTS

The Certificate of Incorporation provides that the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors (the "Voting Stock") is required to authorize (a) any merger or
consolidation of the Company with or into any other corporation (other than a
Subsidiary of the Company) or (b) the sale (other than to the Company or its
Subsidiaries) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. For purposes of the foregoing paragraph, a
"Subsidiary" is any corporation more than 50% of the voting securities of which
are owned by the Company.

SERIES E PREFERRED STOCK

There are 4.6 million shares of Series E Preferred Stock authorized and
outstanding on the date hereof. The Series E Preferred Stock is entitled to
cumulative cash preferential dividends of $1.75 per share, per annum, payable
quarterly, and has a liquidation preference of $25 per share plus accrued and
unpaid dividends. Unless full cumulative dividends on the Series E Preferred
Stock have been paid or payment has been provided for, no dividends (other than
dividends in shares of Common Stock or other capital stock ranking junior to the
Series E Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends) shall be paid or declared
and set aside for payment or other distribution made upon the Common Stock or
any other capital stock of the Company ranking junior or on a parity with the
Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends.

The Series E Preferred Stock is exchangeable, in whole but not in part, at
the option of the Company, on any dividend date commencing February 15, 1994,
for the Company's 7% Convertible Subordinated Exchange Debentures due February
15, 2007 (the "Exchange Debentures") at an exchange rate of $25 principal amount
of Exchange Debentures for each share of Series E Preferred Stock so exchanged.
The Exchange Debentures entitle the holders thereof to convert the Exchange
Debentures into shares of Common Stock.

The Series E Preferred Stock is redeemable by the Company, in whole but not
in part, on and after February 16, 1996, at $26.50 per share, if redeemed during
the 12 month period commencing February 15, 1996, and thereafter at prices
declining to $25 per share on and after February 15, 2002, together with accrued
and unpaid dividends to the date of redemption. The Series E Preferred Stock,
unless previously exchanged or redeemed by the Company, is convertible at the
option of the holder thereof at any time into shares of Common Stock at a
conversion price of $33.94 per share (as of the date hereof), subject to
adjustment under certain conditions.

If the Company fails to pay any six quarterly dividends on the Series E
Preferred Stock, then the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock, voting
together as a class with all other outstanding classes or series of preferred
stock ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock and
entitled to vote thereon, have the right to elect two directors to be added to
the Company's Board of Directors. Such voting rights continue until all
dividends in arrears on such stock have been paid or provided for. Without the
approval of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred
Stock, the Company may not issue any capital stock ranking senior to the Series
E Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends or in distribution of assets upon
liquidation or make any change which adversely affects the preferences, rights
or powers of the Series E Preferred Stock.

SERIES F PREFERRED STOCK

The Company has authorized 400,000 shares of Series F Preferred Stock, no
shares of which have been issued or are outstanding on the date hereof. The
terms of the Series F Preferred Stock are identical to the terms of the Series E
Preferred Stock, except with respect to the amount of dividend and dividend
payment dates, the liquidation preference, the optional redemption schedule and
redemption prices, the conversion rate at which Series F Preferred Stock may be
converted into shares of Common Stock and the exchange rate at which Series F
Preferred Stock may be exchanged by the Company for Exchange Debentures.

The Series F Preferred Stock, if issued, will be entitled to cumulative cash
preferential dividends of $7 per share, per annum, payable quarterly, will have
a liquidation preference of $100 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends,
will rank on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock with respect to rights
to receive dividends and distributions upon liquidation and has identical voting
rights as the Series E Preferred Stock. The Series F Preferred Stock is
exchangeable for the Company's Exchange Debentures which in turn are convertible
into shares of Common Stock.

52
<PAGE>
The Series F Preferred Stock will be redeemable by the Company, in whole but
not in part, on and after 48 months from the date of issuance, at $104.20 per
share, if redeemed during the 12 month period commencing on such date, and
thereafter at prices declining to $100 per share on and after the 120th month
from issuance, together with accrued and unpaid dividends to the date of
redemption. The Series F Preferred Stock will be convertible at the option of
the holder thereof at any time into shares of Common Stock at a conversion rate
of 5.4283 shares of Common Stock per share of Series F Preferred Stock (as of
the date hereof), subject to adjustment under certain conditions.

The Company has entered into an agreement with Venezolana de Pulpa y Papel
("Venepal"), a Venezuelan pulp and paper company, whereby Venepal's investment
in the Celgar pulp mill represented by 50% of the outstanding common stock of
Stone Venepal (Celgar) Pulp Inc. ("SVCPI") can be exchanged for shares of Series
F Preferred Stock. The exchange would occur at Venepal's option as a result of
certain specific conditions relating to operations of the Celgar pulp mill,
which is 50% owned by SVCPI. The Company may at its option elect to honor the
exchange obligation with a cash payment to Venepal. Based upon Venepal's initial
investment in SVCPI, 212,903 shares of Series F Preferred Stock would be
issuable in the event Venepal was eligible to exercise, and did exercise, its
option. The number of shares issuable to Venepal upon exchange is to be
determined based upon (i) the value of Venepal's investment in SVCPI at the time
of such exchange and (ii) the market price of the Common Stock at the time of
such exchange.

THE COMPANY

GENERAL

The Company is a major international pulp and paper company engaged
principally in the production and sale of paper, packaging products, and
commodity pulp. The Company believes that it is the world's largest producer of
unbleached containerboard and kraft paper and the world's largest converter of
those products. The Company also believes that it is one of the largest paper
companies in terms of annual tonnage produced. The Company produced 5.0 million
tons and 4.9 million tons of unbleached containerboard and kraft paper in 1992
and 1991, respectively, which accounted for approximately 66% of its total
tonnage produced for both 1992 and 1991. The Company had net sales of
approximately $5.5 billion and $5.4 billion in 1992 and 1991, respectively.

The Company has increased dramatically in size over the past ten years,
primarily through four major acquisitions, including the 1989 acquisition of
Consolidated-Bathurst Inc. (a Canadian corporation, now renamed Stone Container
(Canada) Inc. ("Stone Canada")), and several smaller acquisitions. The
acquisition of Stone Canada increased the Company's market share in its core
business operations and provided the Company with the opportunity to pursue its
strategy to expand its production capacity and sales in international markets.
The Company owns or has an interest in 136 manufacturing facilities in the
United States, 27 in Canada, 15 in Germany, five in France, two in Belgium and
one in each of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The facilities include 24
mills. The Company also maintains sales offices in the United States, Canada,
the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, France, China and Japan.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

PROGRESS OF FINANCIAL PLAN

In 1993, the Company adopted a financial plan designed to enhance the
Company's liquidity, reduce amortization under certain bank credit agreements of
the Company and Stone Canada (the "Credit Agreements") and improve financial
flexibility. The Company completed a major portion of its financial plan during
1993 resulting in net proceeds to the Company and Stone Canada of approximately
$1.0 billion which the Company and Stone Canada used to repay indebtedness under
the Credit Agreements and fund operating losses and working capital needs. These
repayments satisfied the remaining September 1993 amortization of approximately
$118 million, the full 1994 amortization of approximately $409 million and
approximately $21 million of the March 1995 amortization under the Credit
Agreements. The Company had as of January 5, 1994 $60.0 million available for
borrowing out of a total revolving credit commitment of $315.8 million.

The transactions completed in 1993 were as follows:

- the sale in June, 1993 of $150 million of the Company's 12 5/8%
Senior Notes due 1998 and a concurrent private sale of $250
million principal amount of 8 7/8% Convertible Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2000.

- the public offerings in December 1993 by Stone-Consolidated
Corporation, a newly created Canadian subsidiary
("Stone-Consolidated"), of Cdn. $231 million of its common
stock (representing 25.4% of its outstanding common stock),
Cdn. $231 million of its 8% Convertible Unsecured Subordinated
Debentures due 2003 and $225 million of its 10.25% Senior
Secured Notes due 2000 (the "Stone-Consolidated Transaction").
Stone-Consolidated now owns all of the Canadian and U.K.
newsprint and groundwood papers assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries. The net proceeds paid by Stone-Consolidated to
the Company and Stone Canada in connection with these offerings
approximated $490 million.

S-3
<PAGE>
- the sale of the Company's 49% equity interest in Empaques de
Carton Titan, S.A., a Mexican corrugated container company
("Titan"), two of the Company's short line railroads and a
specialty packaging plant in Sheridan, Arkansas. The proceeds
of these three transactions approximated $125 million.

In connection with the completion of the Stone-Consolidated Transaction, the
Company also received approval from its bank group to extend the maturity date
of its revolving credit facilities from March 1, 1994 to March 1, 1997.

The final stages of the Company's current financial plan are as follows:

- the Offerings, from which the Company expects to use the net
proceeds to (i) prepay approximately $403 million of the
remaining 1995 and March 1996 required amortization under the
Credit Agreements (including amortization payments under the
Company's revolving credit facilities reducing the total
commitments thereunder to approximately $224 million); (ii)
redeem at par approximately $98 million plus accrued interest
of the Company's 13 5/8% Subordinated Notes due 1995; and (iii)
repay approximately $200 million of the borrowings under the
Company's revolving credit facilities without reducing the
commitments thereunder (or to the extent no borrowings are
outstanding, the Company may retain the balance in cash).

- the completion of a transaction involving a favorable energy
supply agreement relating to the Company's mill in Florence,
South Carolina. The proceeds of this transaction are subject to
the execution of definitive documentation and regulatory
approval. The gross proceeds of this transaction, which are
currently expected to be approximately $100 million, would be
utilized to repay borrowings under the Company's revolving
credit facilities without reducing commitments thereunder (or
to the extent no borrowings are outstanding, the Company may
retain the balance in cash). There can be no assurance,
however, that this transaction will be consummated or that the
expected amount of proceeds from such transaction will be
received.

The completion of the Offerings will provide the Company with the following
benefits:

-repayment of all major amortization through the end of 1995
(except for revolving credit facilities relating to receivables
financings which the Company intends to extend or refinance).

- improvement of the Company's liquidity by repaying borrowings
under the revolving credit facility by $200 million (or to the
extent no borrowings are outstanding, the Company may retain
the balance in cash). As of January 5, 1994, the Company had
$60.0 million available for borrowing out of a total revolving
credit commitment of $315.8 million.)

- improvement of the Company's financial flexibility through
amendments to the Credit Agreements (see "-- Amendments to
Credit Agreements").

PRODUCTS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS

The markets for products sold by the Company are highly competitive and are
also sensitive to cyclical changes in industry capacity and in the economy, both
of which can significantly influence selling prices and thereby the Company's
profitability. Although the Company has experienced declining product pricing in
all of its product lines over the last several years, the Company believes that
market conditions are present which should permit the Company to realize
improved product pricing in most of its product lines.

The Company implemented a $25 per ton price increase for linerboard
effective October 1, 1993, which raised the transaction price for the base grade
of linerboard to $325 per ton. This increase will not, however, restore prices
for linerboard to the levels present at the beginning of 1993. In addition, the
Company is in the process of final implementation of a corrugated container
price increase. The Company currently expects final implementation to occur in
the first quarter of 1994. As a result of strengthening demand, the Company
announced a further price increase of $30 per ton for linerboard effective in
January 1994. While the Company currently believes that it will implement this
price increase in the early part of 1994, there is little likelihood of
achieving the increase in January

S-4
<PAGE>
1994. There can be no assurance that prices will continue to increase or even be
maintained at present levels, but the Company believes the demand for linerboard
and the converted products produced from linerboard are increasing.

Pricing conditions for newsprint and groundwood paper have been volatile in
recent years. While the industry successfully implemented a price increase in
1992, efforts to maintain an additional price increase in 1993 were
unsuccessful. In 1993, Stone-Consolidated and other industry participants
attempted to balance supply and demand by taking downtime at selected production
facilities. Stone-Consolidated announced a $47.50 per metric ton price increase
for newsprint effective March 1, 1994 in light of recent industry improvements
in supply and demand characteristics. Other major North American producers have
announced similar price increases. There is no assurance, however, that such
price increases will be achieved as scheduled or at all.

Market pulp has also experienced volatile pricing in recent years. The
Company announced a price increase of $40 to $80 per ton in the various grades
of market pulp effective January 1, 1994 in light of improved supply and demand
characteristics in the industry. There is, however, significant world-wide
competition in this product line and no assurances can be given that such price
increases will be realized or maintained.

OPERATING PERFORMANCE

The Company will report a net loss for the full year 1993, which loss will
be greater than the loss incurred for 1992. The Company anticipates that the net
loss for the fourth quarter of 1993 will be within the expectations of paper
industry analysts. The losses incurred in 1993 and in the previous two years had
a severe negative impact on the Company's liquidity. The Company believes,
however, that the implementation of its financial plan significantly improves
the Company's liquidity. As of January 5, 1994, available borrowings under the
Company's revolving credit facilities were $60.0 million and upon consummation
of the Offerings, the Company's cash and available borrowings under such
facilities are expected to increase by approximately $200 million.

The Company believes that demand for its products has recently increased.
Production of linerboard for October and November 1993 versus the similar period
in 1992 increased 9%. The Company also increased its sales of corrugated
products (measured in terms of footage sold) by 4.5% for October and November
1993 versus the similar period in 1992. The production of newsprint and
groundwood papers increased by 2.6% for October and November 1993 versus the
similar periods in 1992. Production of market pulp, however, declined 5.1% for
the comparable period.

AMENDMENTS TO CREDIT AGREEMENTS

In connection with the Offerings, the Company is seeking amendments to the
Credit Agreements. The amendments, which are conditional upon the consummation
of the Offerings and the prepayment of a minimum of $385 million under the
Credit Agreements, contain the following provisions:

-Permit the repayment of borrowings under the revolving credit
facilities without reducing the commitments thereunder (or to
the extent no borrowings are outstanding, the Company may retain
the balance in cash) of up to $200 million with a portion of the
net proceeds from the Offerings.

-Permit the redemption of the Company's 13 5/8% Subordinated
Notes due 1995 with a portion of the net proceeds from the
Common Stock Offering.

S-5
<PAGE>
- Amend the EBITDA (as defined under the Credit Agreements)
covenant to require the Company to meet the following minimum
EBITDA levels:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
For the quarter ended 3/31/94................. $ 20 million
For the two quarters ended 6/30/94............ $ 55 million
For the three quarters ended 9/30/94.......... $111 million
For the four quarters ended 12/31/94.......... $180 million
For the four quarters ended 3/31/95........... $226 million
For the four quarters ended 6/30/95........... $300 million
For the four quarters ended 9/30/95........... $380 million
For the four quarters ended 12/31/95.......... $457 million
For the four quarters ended 3/31/96........... $567 million
For the four quarters ended 6/30/96........... $657 million
For the four quarters ended 9/30/96........... $735 million
and each four quarter period thereafter....... $822 million
</TABLE>

- Replace the existing cross-default provisions relating to
obligations of $10 million or more
of the Company's separately financed subsidiaries, Seminole Kraft
Corporation ("Seminole Kraft") and Stone Savannah River Pulp & Paper
Corporation ("Stone Savannah"), with cross-acceleration
provisions.

- Reset to zero as of January 1, 1994 the "dividend basket" under
the Credit Agreements which permits payment of dividends on the
Company's capital stock. The dividend basket under the Credit
Agreements as of September 30, 1993 had a deficit amount of
$334.1 million. On an ongoing basis, the dividend basket would
be increased by (a) 100% (rather than the current 50%) of the
cash proceeds of sales of Common Stock (other than proceeds of
the Common Stock Offering, for which no dividend credit would
be received) and permitted preferred stock and (b) 75% (rather
than the current 50%) of Consolidated Net Income (as defined in
the Credit Agreements) from January 1, 1994 and would be
decreased by 100% of Consolidated Net Losses (as defined) from
January 1, 1994. Additionally, restrictions with respect to
dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock would be modified to
mirror the dividend restrictions in the Company's Senior
Subordinated Indenture dated as of March 15, 1992. This should
permit a higher dividend basket for payment of dividends on the
Series E Preferred Stock. See "Description of Debt Securities
-- Additional Terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
-- Dividend Restrictions" in the accompanying Prospectus.

- Replace the current prohibition of investments in Stone Venepal
(Celgar) Pulp Inc. with restrictions substantially similar to
the restrictions applicable to the Company's subsidiaries,
Stone Savannah and Seminole Kraft.

For a more complete description of the Credit Agreements, see "Credit
Agreements" in the accompanying Prospectus.

RISK FACTORS

BEFORE INVESTING, PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF THE NOTES SHOULD CAREFULLY
CONSIDER THE RISK FACTORS SET FORTH BELOW AND THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH
AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT AND THE ACCOMPANYING
PROSPECTUS.

SIGNIFICANT LEVERAGE AND DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS; LIMITED LIQUIDITY

The Company is significantly leveraged and will continue to be so after
completion of the Offerings. The Company's long-term debt to total
capitalization ratio was 74.3% at September 30, 1993. On a pro forma basis,
after giving effect to the Stone-Consolidated Transaction, the sale of the
Company's 49% equity interest in Titan, and the sale by the Company of its
interest in two short line railroads (the "1993 Fourth Quarter Transactions")
and the Offerings, and the use of the estimated net proceeds therefrom, such
ratio at September 30, 1993 would have been approximately 71.8%. Capitalization,
for purposes of this ratio, includes long-term debt, deferred income taxes,
redeemable preferred stock, minority interests and stockholders' equity. Giving
effect to the 1993 Fourth Quarter Transactions and the Offerings, the amounts of
long-term debt (excluding capitalized lease obligations) outstanding at
September 30, 1993 maturing during the next five years and thereafter are as
follows:

Financial Corporation's and Stone Fin II Receivables Corporation's
revolving credit facilities, which the Company intends to extend or
refinance.
</TABLE>

The Company's income before interest expense and income taxes was
insufficient to cover interest expense for the nine months ended September 30,
1993 and 1992 and for the year ended December 31, 1992 by $346.8 million, $135.9
million and $229.3 million, respectively, and will continue to be insufficient
for at least 1994.

The Company's liquidity and financial flexibility is adversely affected by
continued losses which have resulted in utilization of a significant portion of
its revolving credit facilities (for which the borrowing availability was $60.0
million as of January 5, 1994). The net proceeds from the Offerings will be used
to (i) prepay approximately $403 million of the remaining 1995 and March 1996
required amortization under the Credit Agreements; (ii) redeem at par
approximately $98 million plus accrued interest of the Company's 13 5/8%
Subordinated Notes due 1995; and (iii) repay approximately $200 million of the
borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities without reducing the
commitments thereunder (or to the extent no borrowings are outstanding, the
Company may retain the balance in cash). See "Use of Proceeds." The Company is
also expecting to improve its liquidity and financial flexibility through a
transaction involving a favorable energy supply agreement relating to its mill
in Florence, South Carolina, the net proceeds of which would be applied to repay
borrowings under the revolving credit facilities without reducing commitments
thereunder (or to the extent no borrowings are outstanding, the Company may
retain the balance in cash). There can be no assurance, however, that this
transaction will be consummated or that the expected amount of proceeds from
such transaction will be received.

Notwithstanding the improvements in the Company's liquidity and financial
flexibility which will result from the Offerings and which would result from the
proposed energy supply contract transaction, unless the Company achieves
sustained price increases beyond current levels (including announced price
increases which have not yet been fully implemented as described under
"Prospectus Summary -- Recent Developments -- Products and Industry Trends"),
the Company will continue to incur net losses and a deficit in net cash provided
by operating

S-9
<PAGE>
activities. Without such sustained price increases, the Company may exhaust all
or substantially all of its cash resources and borrowing availability under the
revolving credit facilities. In such event, the Company would be required to
pursue other alternatives to improve liquidity, including further cost
reductions, sales of assets, the deferral of postponable capital expenditures,
obtaining additional sources of funds or pursuing the possible restructuring of
its indebtedness. There can be no assurance that such measures, if required,
would generate the liquidity required by the Company to operate its business and
service its indebtedness.

Beginning in 1996 and continuing thereafter, the Company will be required to
make significant amortization payments on its indebtedness which will require
the Company to raise sufficient funds from operations or other sources or
refinance or restructure maturing indebtedness. No assurance can be given that
the Company will be successful in doing so.

ADVERSE INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND CYCLICAL PRODUCT PRICING

The markets for paper, packaging products and commodity pulp sold by the
Company are highly competitive, and are sensitive to changes in industry
capacity and cyclical changes in the economy, both of which can significantly
impact selling prices and the Company's profitability. The markets for
containerboard and corrugated containers, which represent a substantial portion
of the Company's net sales, generally experienced price declines during the
period since 1990. The Company has, however, successfully implemented a $25 per
ton price increase for containerboard and is in the process of implementing a
price increase in corrugated containers. The Company expects to realize the
benefits of such price increase in the first quarter of 1994. Newsprint and
market pulp prices have also fallen substantially since 1990 due to
supply/demand imbalances. While newsprint prices generally increased in 1992, an
additional price increase announced in 1993 was unsuccessful. The Company has
announced a price increase for newsprint effective March 1, 1994 in light of
strengthening demand for newsprint. Market pulp prices, which had improved
modestly during 1992 from the low prices of 1991, began deteriorating in the
fourth quarter of 1992 and weakened further in 1993. The Company is also in the
process of implementing price increases effective January 1, 1994 for market
pulp of $40 to $80 per ton. There also can be no assurance that announced price
increases for the Company's products can be implemented, that prices for the
Company's products will not decline from current levels or that the Company will
not elect to take further economic downtime.

RECENT LOSSES; NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES

The Company incurred losses of $233.5 million (before taking into account
the cumulative effect of an accounting change) and $273.0 million (taking into
account such change) for the nine months ended September 30, 1993, $169.9
million (before taking into account the cumulative effect of an accounting
change) and $269.4 million (taking into account such change) in 1992 and $49.1
million in 1991. Net cash used in operating activities totalled $115.6 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 1993, while net cash provided by
operating activities totalled $46.5 million for the nine months ended September
30, 1992. The Company expects the fourth quarter of 1993 will have a deficit in
net cash provided by operating activities. The Company expects to incur a net
loss for the quarter ending December 31, 1993 that will be less than the loss
reported for the third quarter of 1993. See "Selected Consolidated Financial
Data." As a result of the net losses, it has been necessary for the Company to
obtain various amendments and waivers of certain covenants in the Credit
Agreements. See "Credit Agreements" in the accompanying Prospectus. If current
pricing levels for the Company's products do not significantly improve, the
Company will continue to incur losses. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Outlook" in the accompanying
Prospectus.

CREDIT AGREEMENT RESTRICTIONS

All indebtedness under the Credit Agreements is secured by a substantial
portion of the assets of the Company. The Credit Agreements contain certain
restrictions on the Company, including requirements that the Company achieve and
maintain certain financial ratios (including a minimum current ratio, an
indebtedness ratio, minimum "EBITDA" (as defined in the Credit Agreements) and a
tangible net worth test). The restrictions also include, among other things,
limitations on the ability of the Company to incur additional indebtedness, to
create, incur or permit the existence of certain liens, to make guarantees, to
make certain investments, to make aggregate capital expenditures above certain
levels, to make certain payments with respect to its outstanding stock, and to

S-10
<PAGE>
enter into certain types of transactions. In particular, the Credit Agreements
currently prohibit investments in Stone Venepal (Celgar) Pulp Inc., and
Stone-Consolidated. A default by Stone-Consolidated of any of its obligations in
excess of $10 million constitutes a default under the Credit Agreements.

The Credit Agreements also limit in certain specific circumstances any
further investments by the Company in two of its subsidiaries, Seminole Kraft
and Stone Savannah. Stone Savannah and Seminole Kraft have incurred substantial
indebtedness in connection with project financings and are significantly
leveraged. As of September 30, 1993, Stone Savannah had $413.8 million in
outstanding indebtedness (including $280.1 million in secured indebtedness owed
to bank lenders) and Seminole Kraft had $179.8 million in outstanding
indebtedness (including $117.5 million in secured indebtedness owed to bank
lenders). The Company has entered into separate output purchase agreements with
each subsidiary which require the Company to purchase the output of the mills
operated by each subsidiary at rates which are above current market rates until
September 30, 1994 for Seminole Kraft, until December 20, 1994 for linerboard
production at Stone Savannah and until November 14, 1995 for market pulp
production at Stone Savannah. After such dates, the Company is required to
purchase the respective productions at market prices for the remaining terms of
these agreements. At the time that the fixed price provisions of the output
purchase agreements terminate, such subsidiaries may need to undertake
additional measures to meet their debt service requirements, including obtaining
additional sources of funds, postponing or restructuring of debt service
payments or refinancing of the indebtedness. In the event that such measures are
required and are not successful, and such indebtedness is accelerated by the
respective lenders to Stone Savannah or Seminole Kraft, the lenders to the
Company under various of its debt instruments will be entitled to accelerate the
indebtedness owed by the Company. The cross-acceleration provisions in the
Credit Agreements are effective upon the completion of the Offerings. Prior to
the completion of the Offerings, the Credit Agreements contained cross-default
provisions similar to the cross-default provisions mentioned above for
Stone-Consolidated Corporation.

There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve and
maintain compliance with the prescribed financial ratio tests or other
requirements of the Credit Agreements. Failure to achieve or maintain compliance
with such financial ratio tests or other requirements under the Credit
Agreements, in the absence of a waiver or amendment, would result in an event of
default and could lead to the acceleration of the obligations under the Credit
Agreements. The Company has successfully sought and received waivers and
amendments to its Credit Agreements on various occasions since entering into the
Credit Agreements. Most recently, the Credit Agreements were modified to permit
the earnings from the sale of the Company's interest in Titan to be included in
EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreements), solely for purposes of satisfying
the minimum EBITDA requirement for the quarter ended December 31, 1993. On
December 17, 1993, the Company obtained approval of amendments to the Credit
Agreements in connection with the Stone-Consolidated Transaction which
permitted, among other things, Stone-Consolidated to grant liens on its property
to the holders of its 10.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2000 and the lenders under
its revolving credit facilities, and restricted Stone-Consolidated's ability to
pay dividends on its capital stock.

In connection with the Offerings, the Company is seeking further amendments
to the Credit Agreements which will, upon the effective date of the Offerings,
amend the Credit Agreements including to change certain financial covenants to
allow the Company to remain in compliance with the Credit Agreements. See
"Recent Developments -- Amendments to Credit Agreements." If further waivers or
amendments are requested by the Company, there can be no assurance that the
Company's bank lenders will again grant such requests. The failure to obtain any
such waivers or amendments would reduce the Company's flexibility to respond to
adverse industry conditions and could have a material adverse effect on the
Company. See "Credit Agreements -- Covenants" in the accompanying Prospectus.

FUTURE ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS

Giving effect to the Offerings, the Company will have sold securities on a
number of occasions in the last two years for total proceeds in excess of $2.0
billion. The recent issuance of a substantial amount of securities may make it
difficult, at least in the near future, for the Company to access the capital
markets for further financings and therefore may limit the Company's sources for
future liquidity.

S-11
<PAGE>
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The Company's operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation
by federal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatory
authorities with jurisdiction over its foreign operations. Such regulation
requires significant capital expenditures. On December 17, 1993, the
Environmental Protection Agency proposed regulations under the Clean Air Act and
the Clean Water Act for the pulp and paper industry which when implemented would
affect directly many of the Company's facilities. Since the regulations have
only recently been proposed, the Company is currently unable to estimate the
nature or level of future expenditures that may be required to comply. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations -- Financial Condition and Liquidity -- Environmental Issues" in the
accompanying Prospectus. In addition, the Company is from time to time subject
to litigation and governmental proceedings regarding environmental matters in
which injunctive and/or monetary relief is sought. The Company has been named as
a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at a number of sites which are the
subject of remedial activity under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA" or "Superfund") or comparable state
laws. Although the Company is subject to joint and several liability imposed
under Superfund, at most of the multi-PRP sites there are organized groups of
PRPs and costs are being shared among PRPs. The Company currently believes that
adequate provisions have been established for these sites and that such costs
will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on
its financial position or future operating results.

DIVIDEND SUSPENSION; LIMITATIONS ON PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS

Due to limitations and restrictions imposed on the Company under the Credit
Agreements, certain indentures and the Company's recent net losses, the Company
was unable to declare a cash dividend on its Common Stock in the third and
fourth quarters of 1992 and all four quarters of 1993. Whether the Board of
Directors declares any future cash dividends on the Common Stock will depend
upon the Company's future earnings, financial condition and capital needs and
other factors deemed pertinent by the Board of Directors. In addition, the
payment of dividends on the Common Stock will be subject to restrictions and
limitations contained in the Credit Agreements, other credit facilities and
indentures and the Certificate of Incorporation.

The Company is also currently prohibited from paying dividends under the
indenture dated as of March 15, 1992 between the Company and The Bank of New
York, as trustee, relating to senior subordinated indebtedness. At September 30,
1993, the dividend pool under the Company's Senior Subordinated Indenture dated
March 15, 1992 had a deficit of $136.1 million. Such dividend pool will be
reduced by 100% of the net losses for the fourth quarter of 1993 and any
subsequent periods and increased by the aggregate net proceeds received by the
Company from the issuance of Common Stock, including the Common Stock Offering.
At September 30, 1993, the dividend pool under the Credit Agreements had a
deficit of approximately $334.1 million. The dividend pool under the Credit
Agreements will be reset to zero as of January 1, 1994 pursuant to the amendment
to the Credit Agreements which will be effected at the completion of this
offering of Common Stock. See "Recent Developments -- Amendments to Credit
Agreements."

The Company is also prohibited from paying dividends on its Series E
Preferred Stock and has not paid dividends on its Series E Preferred Stock since
May 15, 1993. As of December 31, 1993, accrued and unpaid dividends on the
Series E Preferred Stock aggregated $4.0 million. Unless full cumulative
dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock have been paid or provided for, no
dividends may be paid on the Common Stock. If the Company fails to pay any six
quarterly dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock, then the holders of the
Series E Preferred Stock, voting together as a class, shall have the right to
elect two directors to be added to the Company's board of directors. The
limitations contained in the Credit Agreements pertaining to the payment of
future Series E Preferred Dividends will be based upon the limitation contained
in the Company's Senior Subordinated Indenture dated March 15, 1992. See "Credit
Agreements," "Price Range of Common Stock and Dividend Policy" and "Description
of Capital Stock -- Series E Preferred Stock."

The Company does not intend to pay any dividends on its Common Stock until
such dividends are permitted by the Credit Agreements, the applicable indentures
and the terms of the Series E Preferred Stock and at such time as the Board of
Directors believes that any such payment will not impair the Company's cash
availability for operations and debt service.

DILUTION; CONVERSION OF CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES

The 8 7/8% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due 2000 (the "8 7/8%
Notes") are convertible into Common Stock at a conversion price of $11.55 per
shares, subject to adjustment in certain events. If all of the 8 7/8% Notes were
converted into Common Stock, an additional 21,645,022 shares of Common Stock
would be issued. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that the
conversion of the 8 7/8% Notes into Common Stock or the fact that the 8 7/8%
Notes are outstanding and unconverted will have on the market price of the
Common Stock prevailing from time to time. The conversion of 8 7/8% Notes into
Common Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of the Common
Stock. Certain other securities of the Company are convertible at much higher
conversion prices. The 4,600,000 shares of Series E Preferred Stock are
convertible at the option of the holder into up to 3,388,332 shares of Common
Stock at a conversion price of $33.94, subject to adjustment under certain
conditions. The Company's $115,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6 3/4%
Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2007 are convertible at the option of
the holder into up to 3,388,332 shares of Common Stock at a conversion price of
$33.94 per share, subject to adjustment under certain conditions. See
"Description of Capital Stock."

Assuming no conversion of convertible securities, the net tangible book
value per share at September 30, 1993 after giving effect to the 1993 Fourth
Quarter Transactions and prior to giving effect to the Common Stock Offering was
approximately $(9.00) and the net tangible book value per share at September 30,
1993 after giving effect to the estimated net proceeds of the Common Stock
Offering at an assumed offering price of $11.25 per share and the receipt by the
Company of the estimated proceeds therefrom, is approximately $(4.54). The
amount of the increase in net tangible book value per share attributable to the
estimated cash payments to be made by purchasers of the Common Stock is
approximately $4.46 and the amount of the immediate dilution from the public
offering price which will be absorbed by such purchasers is equivalent to the
public offering price since the net tangible book value after giving effect to
the Common Stock Offering is negative.

In December 1993, Stone-Consolidated issued Cdn. $231 million of 8%
Convertible Unsecured Subordinated Debentures due 2003. If all of the 8%
Convertible Unsecured Subordinated Debentures due 2003 are converted to common
shares of Stone-Consolidated, the Company's ownership of the common shares of
Stone-Consolidated would be reduced from 74.6% to 61.1% of the outstanding
shares.

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS

The Company's Certificate of Incorporation and the Series D Rights (as
defined) issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement (as defined) contain certain
provisions that could make more difficult or discourage a change in control of
the Company. These provisions are designed to discourage situations in which the
Company is forced to accept a proposal for the takeover of the Company without
ample time to evaluate the proposal and appropriate alternatives and to
encourage anyone contemplating a business combination with the Company to
negotiate directly with the Company on a fair and equitable basis. See
"Description of Capital Stock." However, these provisions may discourage certain
takeover proposals that would permit stockholders to sell or exchange their
equity securities of the Company for an amount that includes a premium over the
then market price for such securities.

USE OF PROCEEDS

The net proceeds to the Company from the Offerings are estimated to
aggregate $ million ($ million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option
with respect to the Common Stock Offering is exercised in full). Such proceeds
will be used to repay indebtedness of the Company and for general corporate
purposes, as set forth below. For further information on the interest rate,
maturity and other terms with respect to the Company's indebtedness, see
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations -- Financial Condition and Liquidity" and "Credit Agreements" in the

(1) On September 15, 1992, the Company paid a 2% stock dividend (approximately
1.4 million shares) to record holders of its Common Stock as of August 25,
1992. The amounts set forth in the table for the periods prior to August 15,
1992 have not been restated to reflect such stock dividend.
</TABLE>

On January 5, 1994, the reported closing price for the Common Stock on the
NYSE Composite Tape was $11.25 per share.

Due to limitations and restrictions imposed on the Company under the Credit
Agreements (including those described below) and the Company's recent net
losses, the Company was unable to declare a cash dividend on its Common Stock in
the third and fourth quarters of 1992 and all four quarters of 1993. Whether the
Board of Directors declares any future cash dividends will depend upon the
Company's future earnings, financial condition and capital needs and other
factors deemed pertinent by the Board of Directors, and will be subject to
restrictions and limitations contained in the Company's Credit Agreements and
other credit facilities and indentures. See "Credit Agreements." The Company
does not intend to pay any dividends on its Common Stock until such dividends
are permitted by the Credit Agreements and at such time as it believes that any
such payment will not impair the Company's cash availability for operations and
debt service.

The most restrictive limitation on the payment of cash dividends is
currently contained in the Credit Agreements. The Credit Agreements provide that
the Company's dividend payments, distributions or purchases of any class of
capital stock of the Company or its subsidiaries cannot exceed the sum of $50
million, plus (i) 50% of the consolidated net income (as defined in the Credit
Agreements) of the Company from April 1, 1991 to the date of payment of such
dividends, minus (ii) 100% of the consolidated net loss (as defined in the
Credit Agreements) of the Company from April 1, 1991 to the date of payment of
such dividends, plus (iii) 50% of the net cash proceeds from

S-18
<PAGE>
sales of Common Stock or certain preferred stock of the Company from April 1,
1991 to any date of payment of such dividends. The Credit Agreements also
provide that, with respect to the first cash dividend to be declared after
September 1, 1992, such declaration cannot be made unless the unused portion of
the revolving credit facilities (net of any unused portion required to be
reserved for capital expenditures) is at least equal to $96 million plus the
amount of such cash dividend. At September 30, 1993, the dividend pool under the
Credit Agreements had a deficit of approximately $334.1 million. See "Credit
Agreements."

Following consummation of the Offerings, the dividend pool will be reset to
zero as of January 1, 1994 and other restrictions will be liberalized. See
"Recent Developments -- Amendments to Credit Agreements."

The Company is also currently prohibited from paying dividends under the
Indenture dated as of March 15, 1992 between the Company and The Bank of New
York, as trustee relating to senior subordinated indebtedness. At September 30,
1993, the dividend pool under such indenture was negative $136.1 million. Such
dividend pool will be reduced by 100% of the net losses for the fourth quarter
of 1993 and any subsequent periods and increased by the aggregate net proceeds
received by the Company from the issuance of Common Stock, including the Common
Stock offering. In addition, the indentures relating to the Company's
outstanding senior indebtedness, other senior subordinated indebtedness and the
13 5/8% Notes contain restrictions on the Company's ability to pay dividends.
The 13 5/8% Subordinated Notes due 1995 will be redeemed from the proceeds of
the Common Stock Offering. See "Description of Debt Securities -- Particular
Terms of the Senior Debt Securities -- Certain Covenants -- Dividend
Restrictions" and "-- Additional Terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities -- Dividend Restrictions" in the accompanying Prospectus.

UNDERWRITING

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the International
Underwriting Agreement among the Company and Salomon Brothers International
Limited, Bear, Stearns International Limited and Bankers Trust International
PLC, as representatives (the "International Representatives") of the several
International Managers, the Company has agreed to sell to the International
Managers, and the International Managers have severally agreed to purchase, the
respective amounts of the Common Stock set forth opposite their names below.

</TABLE>

The International Underwriting Agreement provides that the obligations of
the International Managers are subject to certain conditions precedent and that
the International Managers will be obligated to purchase all of the Common Stock
offered in the International Offering if any is purchased. It is a condition
precedent to the International Managers' obligations to purchase the Common
Stock offered in the International Offering pursuant to the International
Underwriting Agreement that the sale of the Notes by the Company occur
simultaneously.

The International Representatives have advised the Company that the
International Managers propose initially to offer the Common Stock directly to
the public at the public offering price set forth on the cover page of this
Prospectus Supplement and to certain dealers at such price less a concession not
in excess of $. per share. The International Managers may allow, and such
dealers may reallow, a concession not in excess of $. per share on sales to
certain other dealers. After the initial offering, the public offering price and
concessions to dealers may be changed.

The Company has granted to the International Managers and U.S. Underwriters
options to purchase up to an additional 525,000 shares and 2,625,000 shares of
Common Stock, respectively, solely to cover over-allotments, if any. Either or
both options may be exercised at any time up to 30 days after the date of this
Prospectus Supplement.

The Company has entered into a U.S. Underwriting Agreement with the
underwriters of the U.S. Offering ("U.S. Underwriters") providing for the
concurrent offer and sale of 17,500,000 shares of Common Stock in the U.S.
Offering. The offering price and aggregate underwriting discounts and
commissions per share for the two Offerings are identical. The closing of the
International Offering is a condition to the closing of the U.S. Offering, and
vice versa. The representatives of the U.S. Underwriters are Salomon Brothers
Inc, Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., and BT Securities Corporation.

The International Managers and the U.S. Underwriters have entered into an
Agreement Between Underwriters and Managers pursuant to which each International
Manager has agreed that, as part of the distribution of the shares of Common
Stock offered in the International Offering and subject to certain exceptions,
(a) it is not purchasing any such shares for the account of a U.S. or Canadian
Person (as defined below), (b) it has not offered or sold, and will not offer,
sell, resell or deliver, directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock or
distribute any prospectus relating to the Common Stock to anyone other than an
International Person (as defined below) and (c) any dealer to whom it may sell
any of the shares of Common Stock will represent and agree that it will comply
with the restrictions set forth in (a) and (b) and will not offer, sell, resell
or deliver, directly or indirectly, any of the shares or distribute any
prospectus relating to the Common Stock to any other dealer who does not so
represent and agree. In addition, pursuant to the Agreement Between Underwriters
and Managers, each U.S. Underwriter has

S-22
<PAGE>
agreed that, as part of the distribution of the shares of Common Stock offered
in the U.S. Offering and subject to certain exceptions, (a) it is not purchasing
any such shares for the account of anyone other than a U.S. or Canadian Person,
(b) it has not offered or sold, and will not offer, sell, resell or deliver,
directly or indirectly, any shares of Common Stock or distribute any prospectus
relating to the Common Stock to anyone other than a U.S. or Canadian Person and
(c) any dealer to whom it may sell any of the shares of Common Stock will
represent and agree that it will comply with the restrictions set forth in (a)
and (b) and will not offer, sell, resell or deliver, directly or indirectly, any
of the shares or distribute any prospectus relating to the Common Stock to any
other dealer who does not so represent and agree. The foregoing limitations do
not apply to stabilization transactions or to transactions among the U.S.
Underwriters and the International Managers pursuant to the Agreement Between
Underwriters and Managers. As used herein, "United States" means the United
States of America (including the District of Columbia) and its territories, its
possessions and other areas subject to its jurisdiction, "Canada" means Canada,
its provinces, territories, possessions and other areas subject to its
jurisdiction, and "U.S. or Canadian Person" means a citizen or resident of the
United States or Canada, a corporation, partnership or other entity created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States or Canada or any political
subdivision thereof, or any estate or trust the income of which is subject to
United States or Canadian income taxation, regardless of its source (other than
a foreign branch of such entity) and includes any United States or Canadian
branch of a person other than a U.S. or Canadian Person. As used herein, the
term "International Person" means any person, corporation, partnership or other
entity which is not a U.S. or Canadian Person.

Pursuant to the Agreement Between Underwriters and Managers, sales may be
made between the U.S. Underwriters and the International Managers of such number
of shares of Common Stock as may be mutually agreed. The price of any shares so
sold shall be the public offering price, less an amount not greater than the
selling concession. To the extent that there are sales between the U.S.
Underwriters and the International Managers, pursuant to the Agreement Between
Underwriters and Managers, the number of shares initially available for sale by
the U.S. Underwriters or the International Managers may be more or less than the
amount specified on the cover page of the Prospectus Supplement.

The Company has agreed to indemnify the Underwriters against certain civil
liabilities, including certain liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Act").

The Company has agreed that, for a period of 180 days from the date of the
issuance of the Common Stock, without the consent of Salomon Brothers Inc,
acting on behalf of the Underwriters, neither the Company nor any subsidiary of
the Company (except in limited circumstances) will (i) file with the Securities
and Exchange Commission or publicly announce its intent to file any registration
statement under the Act, or pre-effective amendment to any registration
statement under the Act relating to Common Stock (other than the Common Stock
offered hereby) or (ii) enter into any agreement for or consummate the sale of,
or publicly announce its intent to sell, any Common Stock (other than the Common
Stock offered hereby).

Each of the International Representatives and their affiliates from time to
time perform investment banking and other financial advisory services for the
Company for which they receive customary compensation.

Bankers Trust Company ("Bankers Trust"), an affiliate of Bankers Trust
International PLC, is the agent and a lender under the Credit Agreements. As a
lender under the Company's credit facilities, Bankers Trust will receive its pro
rata share of the net proceeds of the sale of the Notes used to repay
indebtedness under the Credit Agreements. See "Use of Proceeds." Bankers Trust
is also the indenture trustee for the Company's 11 1/2% Senior Subordinated
Notes due 1999.

CERTAIN UNITED STATES TAX CONSEQUENCES
TO NON-UNITED STATES HOLDERS

The following is a discussion of the material United States federal income
and estate tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of Common Stock
applicable to Non-U.S. Holders of such Common Stock. In general, a "Non-U.S.
Holder" is a person other than (i) a citizen or resident (as specifically
defined for United States federal income and estate tax purposes) of the United
States; (ii) a corporation or partnership created or organized in the United
States or under the laws of the United States or of any State; or (iii) an
estate or trust whose income is includable in gross income for United States
federal income tax purposes regardless of its source. The discussion is based on
current law and is for general information only. The discussion does not address
aspects of federal taxation other than income and estate taxation and does not
address all aspects of federal income and estate taxation. The discussion does
not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to a particular
Non-U.S. Holder and does not address all aspects of United States federal income
tax law that may be relevant to Non-U.S. Holders that may be subject to special
treatment under such law (for example, insurance companies, tax-exempt
organizations, financial institutions or broker-dealers). Accordingly,
prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the
United States federal, state, local and non-U.S. current and possible future
income and other tax consequences of holding and disposing of shares of Common
Stock.

DIVIDENDS. In general, dividends paid to a Non-U.S. Holder will be subject
to United States withholding tax at a 30 percent rate (or any lower rate
prescribed by an applicable tax treaty) unless the dividends are effectively
connected with a trade or business carried on by the Non-U.S. Holder within the
United States. Dividends effectively connected with such trade or business will
generally not be subject to withholding (if the Non-U.S. Holder files Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS") Form 4224 with the payor of the dividend) and will
generally be subject to United States federal income tax at ordinary federal
income tax rates. In the case of a Non-U.S. Holder which is a corporation, such
effectively connected income may be subject to the branch profits tax (which is
generally imposed on a foreign corporation on the repatriation from the United
States of effectively connected earnings and profits except to the extent that
an applicable tax treaty provides otherwise). Effectively connected dividends
may be subject to different treatment under an applicable tax treaty depending
on whether such dividends are attributable to a permanent establishment of the
Non-U.S. Holder in the United States. To determine the applicability of a tax
treaty providing for a lower rate of withholding, dividends paid to an address
in a foreign country are generally presumed under current IRS regulations to be
paid to a resident of that country. Treasury regulations proposed in 1984 which
have not been finally adopted, however, would require Non-U.S. Holders to file
certain forms to obtain the benefit of any applicable tax treaty providing for a
lower rate of withholding tax on dividends. Such forms would contain the
holder's name and address and an official statement by the competent authority
in the foreign country (as designated in the applicable tax treaty) attesting to
the holder's status as a resident thereof.

SALE OF COMMON STOCK. Generally, a Non-U.S. Holder will not be subject to
United States federal income tax on any gain realized upon the disposition of
his Common Stock unless (i) the Company is or has been during certain periods a
"U.S. real property holding corporation" for federal income tax purposes (which
the Company does not believe that it is or is likely to become) and the Non-U.S.
Holder held, directly or indirectly at any time during the five year period
ending on the date of disposition (or such shorter period that such shares were
held), more than 5 percent of the Common Stock; (ii) the gain is effectively
connected with a trade or business carried on by the Non-U.S. Holder within the
United States; (iii) the Common Stock is disposed of by an individual Non-U.S.
Holder who holds the Common Stock as a capital asset and is present in the
United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition and
either the gain is attributable to an office or other fixed place of business
maintained by him in the United States or he has a "tax home" in the United
States; or (iv) the Non-U.S. Holder is subject to tax pursuant to the provisions
of United States tax law applicable to certain United States expatriates.
Non-U.S. Holders should consult applicable treaties, which may exempt from
United States taxation gains realized upon the disposition of Common Stock.

S-24
<PAGE>
ESTATE TAX. Common Stock owned or treated as owned by an individual at the
time of death will be includable in the individual's gross estate for United
States federal estate tax purposes, unless an applicable treaty provides
otherwise, and may be subject to the United States federal estate tax.

BACK-UP WITHHOLDING AND INFORMATION REPORTING. The Company must report
annually to the IRS and to each Non-U.S. Holder the amount of dividends paid to,
and the tax withheld with respect to, each Non-U.S. Holder. These information
reporting requirements apply regardless of whether withholding was reduced by an
applicable tax treaty. Copies of these information returns may also be made
available under the provisions of a specific treaty or agreement to the tax
authorities in the country in which the Non-U.S. Holder resides or is
established. United States backup withholding tax (which generally is a
withholding tax imposed at the rate of 31 percent on certain payments to persons
that fail to furnish the information required under the United States
information reporting requirements) will generally not apply to dividends paid
on Common Stock to a Non-U.S. Holder at an address outside the United States
absent actual knowledge by the payor than the payee is not a Non-U.S. Holder.

The payment of the proceeds from the disposition of Common Stock to or
through the United States office of a broker will be subject to information
reporting and backup withholding unless the owner, under penalties of perjury,
certifies, among other things, its status as a Non-U.S. Holder, or otherwise
establishes an exemption. The payment of the proceeds from the disposition of
Common Stock to or through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker will
generally, except as noted below, not be subject to backup withholding and
information reporting. In the case of the payment of proceeds from the
disposition of Common Stock through a non-U.S. office of a broker that is a
United States person or a "U.S. related person," existing regulations require
information reporting on the payment unless the broker has documentary evidence
in its files that the owner is a Non-U.S. Holder and the broker has no actual
knowledge to the contrary. For this purpose, a "U.S. related person" is (i) a
"controlled foreign corporation" for United States federal income tax purposes,
or (ii) a foreign person 50% or more of whose gross income from all sources for
the three-year period ending with the close of its taxable year preceding the
payment (or for such part of the period that the broker has been in existence)
is derived from activities that are effectively connected with the conduct of a
United States trade or business. Proposed regulations contain a similar rule
with respect to information reporting by a non-U.S. office of a broker that is a
United States person or a U.S. related person. The existing regulations provide
that, although the issue is still under consideration, reportable payments made
through foreign offices of a broker that is a United States person or a U.S.
related person will not be subject to backup withholding until otherwise
provided. Proposed regulations state that backup withholding will not apply to
such payments absent actual knowledge that the payee is a United States person.
Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a
Non-U.S. Holder will be refunded (or credited against that Non-U.S. Holder's
United States federal income tax liability, if any), provided that the required
information is furnished to the IRS.

The backup withholding and information reporting rules are currently under
review by the Treasury Department and their application to the Common Stock is
subject to change.

The validity of the Notes offered hereby will be passed upon for the Company
by Leslie T. Lederer, Vice President, Secretary and Counsel of the Company (who
owns approximately 15,900 shares of Common Stock) and by Sidley & Austin,
Chicago, Illinois. Certain legal matters will be passed upon for the
Underwriters by Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, New York, New York.

THE COMPANY

GENERAL
The Company is a major international pulp and paper company engaged
principally in the production and sale of paper, packaging products and
commodity pulp. The Company believes that it is the world's largest producer of
unbleached containerboard and kraft paper and the world's largest converter of
those products. The Company also believes that it is one of the largest paper
companies in terms of annual tonnage produced. The Company produced 5.0 million
tons and 4.9 million tons of unbleached containerboard and kraft paper in 1992
and 1991, respectively, which accounted for approximately 66% of its total
tonnage produced for both 1992 and 1991. The Company had net sales of
approximately $5.5 billion and $5.4 billion in 1992 and 1991, respectively. As
used herein, the term "Company" includes Stone Container Corporation, its
subsidiaries and its affiliates, except as the context otherwise may require.

The Company has increased dramatically in size over the past ten years,
primarily through four major acquisitions, including the 1989 acquisition of
Consolidated-Bathurst Inc. (a Canadian corporation, now renamed Stone Container
(Canada) Inc. ("Stone Canada")), and several smaller acquisitions. The
acquisition of Stone Canada increased the Company's market share in its core
business operations and provided the Company with the opportunity to pursue its
strategy to expand its production capacity and sales in international markets.

OPERATIONS
The following table presents actual annual mill production capacity of the
Company at December 31, 1992 and at December 31, 1991:

(a) Includes 25% of production capacity of the Celgar mill, 49% of the
facilities of Empaques de Carton Titan, S.A. and 100% of Seminole Kraft and
Stone Savannah River mills.
</TABLE>

The paperboard and paper packaging segment of the Company's business
includes the manufacture of linerboard, corrugating medium and kraft paper,
among other products. Linerboard and corrugating medium are the basic materials
used in the manufacture of corrugated containers. Kraft paper is primarily used
to produce paper bags and sacks. The Company's principal customers for
linerboard, corrugating medium and kraft paper are its corrugated container
division and its bag divisions. In 1992 and 1991, those divisions consumed
approximately 88% and 87%, respectively, of the Company's aggregate production
of linerboard, corrugating medium and kraft paper.

The Company has more than 100 board converting operations, which produced
and shipped approximately 51.7 billion square feet and 49.2 billion square feet
of corrugated containers in 1992 and 1991, respectively. Corrugated shipments by
U.S. facilities were approximately 12% of the total U.S. industry shipments in
both 1992 and 1991. Corrugated containers are sold in a broad range of markets.

The Company operates 19 kraft paper converting facilities, which shipped
approximately 689 thousand tons and 735 thousand tons of paper bags and sacks
nationwide in 1992 and 1991, respectively. These shipments represented
approximately 34% and 35% of the total U.S. industry shipments for 1992 and
1991, respectively. The Company believes that it is the leading North American
producer of paper bags and sacks. Kraft paper is converted at the Company's
plants into grocery bags and sacks, merchandise bags and multiwall shipping
sacks. Grocery

3
<PAGE>
bags and sacks are sold primarily to supermarket chains; merchandise bags are
sold primarily to retailers of consumer products; and multiwall shipping sacks
are sold to the agricultural, chemical and cement industries, among others.

Wood fiber, particularly from wood chips, and waste paper constitute the
basic raw materials for linerboard, corrugating medium, unbleached kraft paper,
newsprint, groundwood paper and market pulp. Wood fiber resources are available
within economic proximity of the mills and the Company has not experienced any
significant difficulty in obtaining such resources, although environmental
concerns in the Pacific Northwest (including the designation of the spotted owl
as a threatened species) have reduced the supply of wood in that region.
Consistent with its strategy to obtain long-term wood fiber sources without the
costs associated with land ownership, the Company sold approximately 329
thousand acres of timberland during the years 1988 through 1992. This acreage
had been owned by Southwest Forest Industries, Inc., now named Stone Southwest,
Inc., which was acquired by the Company in 1987. At December 31, 1992, the
Company had approximately 14 thousand and 343 thousand acres of private fee
timberland in the United States and Canada, respectively. The Company assists
certain landowners in the Southeastern United States in managing approximately
2.0 million acres of timberland.

Recycled fiber, one of the Company's principal raw material components along
with wood fiber, must be purchased in a price sensitive market. The Company
believes that the demand for recycled fiber will increase and expects that the
cost of purchasing recycled fiber will also increase as a result of increased
demand and market conditions. As a result of the recognition of greater recycled
fiber utilization in the United States, the Company and WMX (formerly Waste
Management of North America) have formed a joint venture, Paper Recycling
International, L.P., which will assist the Company in the procurement of waste
fiber.

The Company's business is not dependent upon a single customer or upon a
small number of major customers. The loss of any one customer would not have a
material adverse effect on the Company.

The Company's products and the raw materials needed to manufacture those
products have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. Cyclical
economic factors such as growth in the economy generally, interest rates,
unemployment levels and fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had a
significant impact on prices and sales of the Company's products. The
availability and cost of wood fiber, including wood chips, and waste paper may
be subject to substantial variation, depending upon economic, political and
conservation considerations.

As of December 31, 1992, the Company had approximately 31,200 employees, of
whom approximately 21,900 were employees of U.S. operations and the remainder
were employees of foreign operations. Of those in the United States,
approximately 13,900 are union employees.

At March 1, 1993, the Company's founders and individual members of their
families, in the aggregate but not as a group, owned approximately 13.5 million
shares of the Company's Common Stock, constituting approximately 19% of the
approximately 71 million then-outstanding shares of Common Stock.

The Company is incorporated in Delaware and its Common Stock is listed on
the New York Stock Exchange. The Company's executive offices are located at 150
North Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60601; telephone number (312) 346-6600.

USE OF PROCEEDS

Unless otherwise specified in the Prospectus Supplement, the net proceeds to
be received by the Company from the sale of the Securities will be used to repay
indebtedness outstanding under the Company's Credit Agreements or to refinance
certain indebtedness as permitted thereunder. The terms of the Credit Agreements
require, except in certain circumstances, the application of proceeds resulting
from an offering of the Securities to be applied against indebtedness then
outstanding thereunder. See "Credit Agreements." Pending use for these purposes,
the Company may invest proceeds from the sale of the Securities in short-term
marketable securities.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE
SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA AND THE HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (AND RELATED NOTES) OF THE COMPANY INCLUDED OR INCORPORATED BY
REFERENCE IN THIS PROSPECTUS.

GENERAL

The Company's major products are containerboard and corrugated containers,
newsprint and market pulp. The markets for paper, packaging products and
commodity pulp sold by the Company are highly competitive and sensitive to
industry capacity and cyclical changes in the economy that can significantly
impact selling prices and the Company's profitability. The Company's sales and
operating results have, in recent years, been more sensitive to price changes
than to changes in sales volume.

The markets for containerboard and corrugated containers, which represent a
substantial portion of the Company's net sales, generally experienced price
declines in the period 1990 through the third quarter of 1993 (except for one
increase in August 1991), and, despite increasing industry-wide capacity
utilization (which is now at approximately the same level as 1989), the Company
was unable to implement announced price increases for these products in 1992 or
for the first nine months of 1993. In prior periods, comparable levels of
capacity utilization supported higher product pricing.

Additions to industry-wide capacity for newsprint and market pulp and
declines in demand for such products during the past three years have led to
supply/demand imbalances that have contributed to depressed prices for these
products. The newsprint industry, which began discounting sales prices in 1990,
was adversely affected by progressively increasing price discounts throughout
1991 and most of 1992, although such discounts were partially reversed in the
fourth quarter of 1992 and the first quarter of 1993 when discounts were
reduced. During this time, new production capacity in the industry came on line,
approximating two million tons annually, representing an approximate 12%
increase in capacity. At the same time, U.S. consumption of newsprint fell, due
to declines in readership and ad linage. As prices fell, certain high cost paper
machines, representing approximately 1.2 million tons and located mostly in
Canada, were shut down. Market pulp prices, which had improved modestly during
1992 from the low prices of 1991, began deteriorating in the fourth quarter of
1992 and have weakened further in 1993.

If current pricing levels for the Company's products do not significantly
improve, the Company will continue to incur net losses.

Due to the industry conditions described above and the Company's highly
leveraged capital structure and related interest expense associated with
indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition of Stone Canada, the Company
has incurred net losses in each of the last two years and the first nine months
of 1993 and expects to incur a net loss for the full year 1993. In 1992, the
Company suspended payment of cash dividends on its Common Stock. The Company is
pursuing a financial plan that is intended to enhance the Company's liquidity
and increase its financial flexibility. See "-- Financial Condition and
Liquidity -- Outlook."

*Restated to reflect adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS 109") retroactive to January 1, 1992.
</TABLE>

NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1993 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER
30, 1992

The net loss for the third quarter of 1993 was $99.2 million, or $1.42 per
share of common stock, compared to the net loss of $43.2 million, or $.64 per
share of common stock for the third quarter of 1992.

For the nine months ended September 30, 1993, the loss before the cumulative
effect of a change in the accounting for postretirement benefits other than
pensions was $233.5 million, or $3.36 per share of common stock. The adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 "Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions" ("SFAS 106"), effective January 1,
1993, resulted in a one-time, non-cash cumulative effect charge of $39.5 million
net of income taxes or $.56 per share of common stock, resulting in a net loss
of $273.0 million or $3.92 per share of common stock. For the nine months ended
September 30, 1992, the restated loss before the cumulative effect of a change
in the accounting for income taxes was $93.2 million, or $1.38 per share of
common stock. The adoption of SFAS 109, which the Company adopted retroactive to
January 1, 1992, resulted in a one-time, non-cash cumulative effect charge of
$99.5 million, or $1.40 per share of common stock, resulting in a restated net
loss of $192.7 million, or $2.78 per share of common stock. The Company's income
tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 1993 includes a third
quarter adjustment for the retroactive increase in the U.S. federal income tax
rate and an enacted decrease in German tax rates, the effects of which
substantially offset each other, and a second quarter favorable adjustment of
approximately $5 million which reflects the effect of a reduction in the
Canadian statutory income tax rate.

The increases in the losses before the cumulative effects of the accounting
changes were primarily due to lower average selling prices for most of the
Company's products. Additionally, the Company's operating results for the 1993
third quarter were negatively impacted by market-related production downtime.
The mills involved have all resumed production and are currently operating at
normal levels.

PAPERBOARD AND PAPER PACKAGING:

Net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 1993 for the
paperboard and paper packaging segment decreased 14.4 percent and 9.7 percent,
respectively over the comparable prior year periods. This

7
<PAGE>
decrease was due in part to the exclusion of sales for the Company's European
folding carton operations which earlier this year were merged into a joint
venture and accordingly is now accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. Sales from these operations were approximately $48 million and $136
million for the third quarter and first nine months of 1992, respectively. Sales
for 1993 were approximately $60 million prior to the merger in May. Excluding
the effect of the joint venture, sales for the third quarter and first nine
months decreased 10.6 percent and 7.6 percent from the year ago periods
reflecting lower sales of paperboard, corrugated containers, kraft paper and
paper bags and sacks. The sales decreases for paperboard reflect both reduced
sales volume and lower average selling prices while the sales decreases for
kraft paper and paper bags and sacks were mainly attributable to lower sales
volume. Sales of corrugated containers for the third quarter and nine months
ended September 30, 1993, as compared to the prior year periods, decreased as
sales volume increases were offset by lower average selling prices, particularly
during the third quarter.

Shipments of corrugated containers, including the Company's proportional
share of the shipments by its foreign affiliates, were 13.6 billion square feet
in the third quarter of 1993, compared with 13.3 billion square feet for the
comparable prior year period. For the first nine months of 1993, the Company
shipped 39.8 billion square feet of corrugated containers, compared with 39.3
billion square feet shipped during the first nine months of 1992. Shipments of
paper bags and sacks were 156 thousand tons and 459 thousand tons for the three
and nine month periods ended September 30, 1993, respectively, compared with 177
thousand tons and 522 thousand tons shipped during the comparable 1992 periods.

Production of containerboard and kraft paper for the three and nine month
periods ended September 30, 1993, including 100 percent of the production at
Seminole Kraft Corporation ("Seminole") and Stone Savannah River Pulp & Paper
Corporation ("Stone Savannah River"), was 1.17 million tons and 3.58 million
tons, respectively, compared to 1.23 million tons and 3.75 million tons produced
during the comparable prior year periods.

Operating income for the paperboard and paper packaging segment decreased
70.8 percent and 49.0 percent for the three months and nine months ended
September 30, 1993, respectively, as compared to the corresponding 1992 periods.
The decreases were mainly attributable to reduced operating margins primarily
resulting from lower average selling prices for containerboard and corrugated
containers.

WHITE PAPER AND PULP:

Net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 1993 for the white
paper and pulp segment decreased 24.1 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively,
from the prior year periods, primarily due to significant declines in sales of
market pulp. Additionally, decreases in newsprint sales, particularly during the
1993 third quarter, contributed to the lower sales. Partially offsetting the
sales decreases for market pulp and newsprint were increases for sales of
groundwood paper. The sales declines for market pulp were primarily attributable
to significantly lower average selling prices. Reduced sales volume during the
1993 periods also contributed to the lower market pulp sales. The decrease in
newsprint sales for the third quarter of 1993, as compared with the
corresponding prior year period, resulted primarily from reduced sales volume
and unfavorable foreign exchange translation effects attributable to the
stronger U.S. dollar, which more than offset the impact of higher average
selling prices. For the nine months ended September 30, 1993, sales of newsprint
decreased slightly from the year ago period as foreign exchange translation
effects more than offset the impact of higher average selling prices and a
slight volume increase. The 1993 sales increases for groundwood paper over the
comparable 1992 periods were primarily due to significant volume increases which
more than offset the effects of lower average selling prices.

Production of newsprint, market pulp and groundwood paper for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 1993, including 25 percent of the production at
the Company's affiliated market pulp mill in British Columbia, was 610 thousand
tons and 1.86 million tons, compared with 633 thousand tons and 1.79 million
tons produced during the comparable prior year periods.

Operating losses for the third quarter and first nine months of 1993 for the
white paper and pulp segment increased 59.6 percent and 74.3 percent,
respectively, from the previous year periods due to the reduced operating
margins primarily resulting from the significantly lower average selling prices
for market pulp. Lower average selling prices for groundwood paper also
contributed to the reduced earnings. While average selling prices for newsprint

8
<PAGE>
improved over the prior year periods and certain cost reductions have been
implemented, the margins associated with such improvements have only partially
offset the effects of the lower average selling prices for market pulp and
groundwood paper.

OTHER:

Net sales and operating income for the third quarter and first nine months
of 1993 increased over the comparable 1992 periods mainly as a result of
improved demand and a tighter supply of timber available to the U.S. building
industry. This resulted in increased sales volume and the realization of higher
average selling prices for certain of the Company's lumber and wood products.

1992 COMPARED WITH 1991

Net sales for 1992 were $5.5 billion, an increase of 2.5% over 1991 net
sales of $5.4 billion. Net sales rose primarily as a result of increased sales
volume, most of which was offset by reduced average selling prices for certain
of the Company's products. In 1992, the Company incurred a loss before the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes of $170 million, or
$2.49 per common share, compared to a net loss of $49 million, or $.78 per
common share, for 1991. The Company adopted SFAS 109 effective January 1, 1992
and recorded a one-time, non-cash cumulative effect charge of $99.5 million or
$1.40 per common share. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect a 2%
Common Stock dividend issued September 15, 1992. The increase in the loss before
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes primarily
resulted from lower average selling prices for newsprint and groundwood paper in
1992 as compared with 1991. Additionally, continued low average selling prices
for the majority of the Company's other products contributed to the net loss for
1992.

The 1992 results include foreign currency transaction losses of $15.0
million and a $7.9 million pretax charge relating to the write-down of an
investment. The 1991 results included non-recurring pretax gains of $59.3
million and foreign currency transaction gains of $4.9 million. The Company
recorded an income tax benefit of $59.4 million in 1992 as compared with a $31.1
million income tax expense in 1991. This change primarily reflects the tax
effect associated with the increased pretax loss for 1992 over 1991 and the
adoption of SFAS 109 effective January 1, 1992. The Company's effective income
tax rates for both years reflect the impact of non-deductible depreciation and
amortization, together with taxes payable by certain foreign subsidiaries at
rates in excess of the U.S. statutory rate.

PAPERBOARD AND PAPER PACKAGING:

The 1992 net sales for the paperboard and paper packaging segment increased
3.7% as sales increases for corrugated containers, paperboard and folding
cartons more than offset sales declines for kraft paper and paper bags and
sacks.

Net sales of corrugated containers increased 6.7% over 1991, primarily as a
result of increased sales volume. Additionally, slightly higher average selling
prices in 1992 contributed to this increase. However, such selling prices
continued to remain at unsatisfactory levels.

10
<PAGE>
Net sales of paperboard increased over 1991 mainly as a result of modestly
higher average selling prices. Such 1992 average paperboard selling prices were
still, however, at unsatisfactory levels. Slight volume increases also
contributed to the improved paperboard sales for 1992. Net sales of kraft paper
decreased 9.3% from 1991, primarily due to reduced sales volume.

Net sales of paper bags and sacks decreased from 1991 primarily due to lower
sales volume and a decrease in average selling prices for retail paper bags.

Operating income for the paperboard and paper packaging segment for 1992
decreased 9.5%, primarily as a result of the inclusion, in 1991, of a
non-recurring pretax gain of $17.5 million from an involuntary conversion
relating to a boiler explosion at the Company's Missoula, Montana linerboard
mill. Excluding this 1991 non-recurring item, 1992 operating income for this
segment would have decreased by 4.8%. This decrease is mainly attributable to
reduced operating margins resulting from continued low average selling prices
for the Company's paperboard and paper packaging products. See also "--
Financial Condition and Liquidity -- Outlook."

WHITE PAPER AND PULP:

The 1992 net sales for the white paper and pulp segment decreased 3.4%, as
significant sales decreases for newsprint more than offset a significant sales
increase for market pulp. Net sales for groundwood paper decreased slightly as
lower average selling prices more than offset volume increases for this product.
The significant decrease in newsprint sales resulted primarily from lower
average selling prices. Additionally, reduced volume associated with
market-related downtime contributed to the lower sales of newsprint. The
increase in 1992 market pulp sales mainly resulted from volume increases
associated with sales generated from the Stone Savannah River mill, which
commenced market pulp operations in the fourth quarter of 1991. Furthermore,
while market pulp selling prices declined significantly in the fourth quarter of
1992, the Company realized modestly higher average selling prices for this
product in 1992, as compared with the even more depressed average selling prices
of 1991.

Operating income for the white paper and pulp segment for 1992 decreased
significantly from 1991, primarily due to reduced operating margins resulting
from the significantly lower average selling prices for newsprint and groundwood
paper. The 1991 results included a non-recurring pretax gain of $41.8 million
resulting from the settlement and termination of a Canadian supply contract. See
also "-- Financial Condition and Liquidity -- Outlook."

OTHER:

Net sales and operating income for the other segment increased over 1991
mainly due to improved demand and a tighter supply of timber available to the
U.S. building industry. This resulted in increased sales volume and the
realization of higher average selling prices for certain of the Company's lumber
and wood products. However, shortages of timber due to environmental concerns in
the Pacific Northwest continue to keep raw material costs high.

1991 Compared with 1990

Net sales for 1991 were $5.4 billion, a decrease of 6.5% from a record $5.8
billion for 1990. The Company recorded a net loss for 1991 of $49 million, or
$.78 per common share, compared to net income of $95 million, or $1.56 per
common share for 1990. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect a 2%
Common Stock dividend issued September 15, 1992. Lower average selling prices
for most of the Company's products was the major factor contributing to the
sales decrease and the net loss for 1991. Additionally, reduced sales volume for
certain products had an unfavorable effect on 1991 net sales and results of
operations.

The 1991 results included a $41.8 million pretax gain resulting from the
settlement and termination of a Canadian supply contract and a $17.5 million
pretax gain from an involuntary conversion relating to a boiler explosion at the
Company's Missoula, Montana linerboard mill. Partially offsetting these gains
was a $6 million pretax charge for reorganization costs at the Company's
Canadian subsidiary and a $4 million write-down on certain de-commissioned
assets at the Company's Jacksonville, Florida mill. Also contributing to the
1991 net loss was a $31 million income tax provision, which resulted primarily
from non-deductible depreciation and amortization, together with taxes payable
by certain foreign subsidiaries at rates in excess of the U.S. statutory rate.

11
<PAGE>
PAPERBOARD AND PAPER PACKAGING:

The 1991 net sales for the paperboard and paper packaging segment decreased
3.9% as sales declines for paperboard, paper bags and sacks, kraft paper and
corrugated containers more than offset a sales increase for folding cartons.

Net sales of corrugated containers decreased slightly from 1990 as an
overall decrease in average selling prices of corrugated containers more than
offset sales volume increases.

Net sales of paper bags and sacks decreased primarily due to volume
decreases resulting from the effects of increased competition.

Net sales of paperboard and kraft paper decreased from 1990 primarily due to
lower average selling prices. Additionally, a reduction in sales volume
contributed to the sales decrease for these products.

Operating income for the paperboard and paper packaging segment decreased
28.1% from 1990 due primarily to reduced operating margins resulting from lower
average selling prices of linerboard and corrugating medium. Additionally,
average selling prices of most converted products declined. 1991 operating
income for this segment included the $17.5 million pretax gain from the
involuntary conversion relating to the boiler explosion at the Company's
Missoula, Montana linerboard mill and the $4 million write-down on certain
de-commissioned assets at the Company's Jacksonville, Florida mill. Operating
income for 1990 reflected a $5.3 million gain from the sale of timberlands.

WHITE PAPER AND PULP:

The 1991 net sales for the white paper and pulp segment decreased 12.5%,
primarily as a result of declines in newsprint and market pulp sales. The
decrease in newsprint sales resulted primarily from lower sales volume, which
was partially due to significant down-time taken by the Company in an effort to
improve the short-term balance of supply and demand. Lower average selling
prices also contributed to the decrease in newsprint sales. The decrease in
market pulp sales resulted mainly from significantly lower average selling
prices.

Operating income for the white paper and pulp segment for 1991 decreased
45.8% as compared with 1990, primarily due to reduced operating margins
resulting from the previously mentioned declines in average selling prices for
market pulp and newsprint. Operating income for this segment included the $41.8
million pretax gain resulting from the settlement and termination of a Canadian
supply contract and a $4.2 million pretax charge, which represents an allocation
of the previously mentioned $6 million provision for reorganization costs at the
Company's Canadian subsidiary.

OTHER:

Net sales and operating income for the other segment decreased from 1990,
mainly due to the general economic downturn in the U.S. building market during
1991, which resulted in less demand for the Company's U.S. lumber and wood
products. Additionally, environmental concerns in the Pacific Northwest kept raw
material costs high for this segment.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

The Company's working capital ratio was 1.1 to 1 at September 30, 1993 and
1.8 to 1 at December 31, 1992, as restated to reflect the adoption of SFAS 109.
The decrease was mainly due to an increase in current maturities of $573 million
which, in accordance with the terms of the respective debt instruments, are
payable on or before September 30, 1994. A significant portion of the increase
in current maturities was attributable to $271 million ($309 million at November
9, 1993) of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facilities which,
prior to the December 17, 1993 amendment to the U.S. Credit Agreement which
extended the expiration of such revolving credit facilities to March 1, 1997,
were originally scheduled to mature March 1, 1994. The Company's consolidated
long-term debt to total capitalization ratio was 74.3 percent at September 30,
1993 and 69.2 percent at December 31, 1992, as restated to reflect the adoption
of SFAS 109. Capitalization, for purposes of this ratio, includes long-term debt
(which includes debt of certain consolidated affiliates which is non-recourse to
the Company), deferred income taxes, redeemable preferred stock, minority
interest and stockholders' equity. The indebtedness ratio, as defined in the
Credit Agreement, was 79.6 percent at September 30, 1993.

The Company and Stone Canada have entered into bank credit agreements
(collectively, the "Credit Agreements") consisting of (i) two term-loan
facilities with outstanding borrowings in the aggregate of $1.11 billion as of

12
<PAGE>
September 30, 1993, (ii) an additional term loan (the "Additional Term Loan")
with outstanding borrowings at September 30, 1993 of $371 million and (iii) two
revolving credit facilities with aggregate commitments of $400 million (less
amounts outstanding, if any, under Canadian lines of credit) and total
outstanding borrowings thereunder of $271 million at September 30, 1993. The
Company is the borrower under one of the term loans, the Additional Term Loan
and one of the revolving credit facilities (collectively, the "U.S. Credit
Agreement") and Stone Canada is the borrower under the other term loan and
revolving credit facility. At September 30, 1993, the Company had unused
borrowing availability of $128 million under the revolving credit facilities. At
November 9, 1993, the Company had borrowing availability under its revolving
credit facilities of approximately $88 million. The term loans (other than the
Additional Term Loan) and the revolving credit facilities had weighted average
interest rates for the nine months ended September 30, 1993 of 8.37 percent and
5.62 percent, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the Additional
Term Loan for the nine months ended September 30, 1993 was 6.30 percent.

In October 1993, the Company sold, prior to their expiration date, certain
of its U.S. dollar denominated cross currency swaps associated with the Credit
Agreement borrowings of Stone Canada. The net proceeds totalled approximately
$26 million, the substantial portion of which was used to repay borrowings under
the Company's revolving credit facilities, thereby restoring borrowing
availability thereunder.

On July 6, 1993 the Company sold $150 million principal amount of 12 5/8
percent Senior Notes due 1998 ("the 12 5/8 percent Senior Notes") and sold $250
million principal amount of 8 7/8 percent Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes
due 2000 ("the 8 7/8 percent Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes"). The net
proceeds of approximately $386 million from the sale of the 12 5/8 percent
Senior Notes and the concurrent sale of the 8 7/8 percent Convertible Senior
Subordinated Notes were used to repay borrowings under the Company's revolving
credit facilities, thereby restoring borrowing availability thereunder.

The Credit Agreements contain covenants that include, among other things,
requirements to maintain certain financial tests and ratios and certain
restrictions and limitations, including those on capital expenditures and
dividend payments. The Credit Agreements also contain cross default provisions
relating to the non-recourse debt of the consolidated affiliates. Additionally,
the Company's Credit Agreements limit the application of the proceeds from
certain financings and asset sales to amortization payments, except in specified
circumstances. See "Credit Agreements."

OPERATING ACTIVITIES:

Net cash used in operating activities was $115.6 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 1993 compared to net cash provided by operating activities
of $46.5 for the comparable period of 1992. The 1992 period included $43 million
of cash received from the settlement and termination of a Canadian supply
contract. Excluding the receipt of such cash, the Company's cash flow from
operations for the first nine months of 1993 decreased $119.1 million over the
prior year period. This decrease primarily resulted from the increase in the
1993 loss before the non-cash, cumulative effects of accounting changes as
compared with the prior year period along with decreases in accounts payable and
other current liabilities. These decreases in cash flow were partially offset by
favorable effects of changes in accounts and notes receivable and inventories.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES:

During the first nine months of 1993, outstanding borrowings under the
Company's revolving credit facilities increased approximately $14 million. The
net increase in borrowings takes into account the July 6, 1993 repayment of $386
million of revolving credit borrowings and subsequent reborrowing under the
credit facility. Such excess borrowings were primarily used to repay $110
million of the September 1993 bank term amortization and to provide cash for
operations and general corporate purposes.

On July 26, 1993, due to a restrictive provision in the indenture relating
to the Company's 10 3/4 percent Senior Subordinated Notes due June 15, 1997, its
11 percent Senior Subordinated Notes due August 15, 1999 and its 10 3/4 percent
Senior Subordinated Debentures due April 1, 2002, the Board of Directors did not
declare the scheduled August 15, 1993 quarterly dividend of .4375 per share on
the Series E Cumulative Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock (the "Series E
Cumulative Preferred Stock"), nor will it pay future dividends on the Series E
Cumulative Preferred Stock until the Company generates income, or effects
certain sales of capital stock, to replenish the dividend "pool" under various
of its debt instruments. As of September 30, 1993, accumulated dividends on the
Series E Cumulative Preferred Stock amounted to $2.0 million. In the event the
Company does not

13
<PAGE>
pay a dividend on the Series E Cumulative Preferred Stock for six quarters, the
Series E Cumulative Preferred Stock holders would have a right to elect two
members to the Company's Board of Directors until the full dividends accumulated
on such Series E Cumulative Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or set
apart for payment.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES:

Capital expenditures for the nine month period ended September 30, 1993,
(including capitalized interest of $8.1 million), totalled approximately $100.7
million, of which approximately $12.4 million was funded from existing project
financing facilities related to the major reconfiguration and paper machine
rebuild at Seminole.

Also during the nine months ended September 30, 1993, the Company purchased
an additional 6,152 shares of common stock of Stone Savannah River. The
Company's ownership in the common stock of Stone Savannah River is now 91.0
percent.

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES:

The Company's operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation
by federal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatory
authorities with jurisdiction over its foreign operations. The Company has in
the past made significant capital expenditures to comply with water, air and
solid and hazardous waste regulations and expects to make significant
expenditures in the future. Capital expenditures for environmental control
equipment and facilities were approximately $24 million in 1992 and the Company
anticipates that 1993 and 1994 environmental capital expenditures will
approximate $44 million and $74 million, respectively. Although capital
expenditures for environmental control equipment and facilities and compliance
costs in future years will depend on legislative and technological developments
which cannot be predicted at this time, the Company anticipates that these costs
are likely to increase as environmental regulations become more stringent.
Environmental control expenditures include projects which, in addition to
meeting environmental concerns, yield certain benefits to the Company in the
form of increased capacity and production cost savings. In addition to capital
expenditures for environmental control equipment and facilities, other
expenditures incurred to maintain environmental regulatory compliance (including
any remediation) represent ongoing costs to the Company. Future environmental
regulations may have an unpredictable adverse effect on the Company's operations
and earnings, but they are not expected to adversely affect the Company's
competitive position.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CHANGES

In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits" ("SFAS 112"), which requires accrual accounting for the
estimated costs of providing certain benefits to former or inactive employees
and the employees' beneficiaries and dependents after employment but before
retirement. SFAS 112 is required to be adopted no later than the first quarter
of 1994. Upon adoption of this standard, any catch-up obligation is to be

CREDIT AGREEMENTS

THE FOLLOWING IS SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF CERTAIN
BANK CREDIT AGREEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AND STONE CANADA AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS
ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS AND INSTRUMENTS GOVERNING
SUCH INDEBTEDNESS, COPIES OF WHICH CONSTITUTE EXHIBITS TO THE REGISTRATION
STATEMENT OF WHICH THIS PROSPECTUS IS A PART OR ARE EXHIBITS TO THE COMPANY'S
REPORTS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, AND ARE INCORPORATED
BY REFERENCE INTO THIS PROSPECTUS.

GENERAL

The Credit Agreements consist of (i) two term-loan facilities with
outstanding borrowings in the aggregate amount of $877.7 million as of December
21, 1993, (ii) an additional term loan (the "Additional Term Loan") (previously
a multiple-draw facility) with outstanding borrowings at December 21, 1993 of
$292.9 million and (iii) two revolving credit facilities with aggregate
commitments of $315.8 million (less amounts outstanding, if any, under Canadian
lines of credit). The Company is the borrower under one of the term loans, the
Additional Term Loan and one of the revolving credit facilities (collectively,
the "U.S. Credit Agreement") and Stone Canada is the borrower under the other
term loan and revolving credit facility. Proceeds of the Additional Term Loan
borrowings were used solely to repay regularly scheduled amortization of term
loans under the U.S. Credit Agreement. The term loans (other than the Additional
Term Loan) and the revolving credit facilities had weighted average interest
rates for the nine months ended September 30, 1993 of 8.37% and 5.62%,
respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the Additional Term Loan was
6.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 1993.

The Company as of September 30, 1993 also had $261.3 million of borrowings
outstanding with certain lenders pursuant to two receivables financing programs
permitted by the Credit Agreements.

Effective December 17, 1993, the Credit Agreements were amended and restated
(the "Third Restated Agreement"), with the unanimous consent of the bank group,
to, among other things, extend the maturity of the revolving credit facilities
until March 1, 1997 and reduce over a three year period the revolving loan
commitments, revise various financial covenants to provide greater flexibility
to the Company, increase interest rate margins, mortgage or pledge additional
collateral, permit the Company to retain 25 percent of the net proceeds from
future sales of equity securities, permit the Company to retain 50 percent
(maximum $100 million in the aggregate) of the net proceeds from any sale or
disposition of certain designated investments, and various other changes.

The Credit Agreements generally include terms, conditions, representations
and warranties, covenants, indemnities and events of default and other
provisions which are customary in such agreements. The following is a summary of
certain of the principal terms of the Credit Agreements, as restated.

MATURITIES AND MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS

The term loans under the Credit Agreements and the Additional Term Loan are
scheduled to be paid in installments due March 31 and September 30 of each year.
Each installment of $204.5 million is applied ratably to the aggregate principal
amount of the term loans, the Additional Term Loan, the aggregate commitment
amounts (in the case of the revolving credit facilities) and the aggregate
amount of net letter of credit obligations relating to a letter of credit
providing credit support for industrial revenue bonds issued by Florence County,
South Carolina. The amount applied to the net letter of credit obligations is
required to be used to fund a cash collateral account in favor of the banks
participating in the letter of credit.

A portion of the amortization payments required by the Credit Agreements
will be ratably applied to reduce outstanding borrowings under the revolving
credit facilities and permanently reduce the commitments thereunder. The
revolving credit facilities under the Credit Agreements terminate on March 1,
1997, unless extended by agreement of the lenders, at which time all outstanding
indebtedness under such revolving credit facilities would have to be repaid or
refinanced.

Mandatory prepayments under the Credit Agreements are required in the event
that the Company has excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Agreements) or
receives proceeds from the issuance of certain debt or equity securities or from
the sale of certain material assets. By reason of an amendment contained in the
Third Restated Agreement, 75 percent of the net proceeds from the offering of
equity securities by the Company must be applied in

15
<PAGE>
chronological order to the next regularly scheduled amortization payments except
that the Additional Term Loan does not receive any amortization payments from
sales of equity securities. Twenty-five percent of the net proceeds of an equity
offering may be retained by the Company.

Through prepayments in 1993, the Company has satisfied its March and
September, 1994 amortization requirements under the Credit Agreements.

INTEREST RATES

The Credit Agreements permit the Company to choose among various interest
rate options, to specify the portion of the borrowings to be covered by specific
interest rate options and to specify the interest rate period to which the
interest rate options are to apply, subject to certain parameters. At December
17, 1993, the interest rate options available to the Company and Stone Canada
under term loan and revolving credit borrowings were (i) U.S. or Canadian prime
rate plus a borrowing margin of 2%, (ii) CD rate plus a borrowing margin of
3 1/8%, and (iii) Eurodollar rate plus a borrowing margin of 3%. In the case of
Stone Canada, there is also an option of selecting a banker's acceptance rate
plus a borrowing margin of 3%. Upon achievement of specified indebtedness ratios
and interest coverage ratios, the borrowing margins will be reduced.
Additionally, the Company pays a 3/8% commitment fee on the unused portions of
the revolving credit facilities.

The Company has also paid to the banks amendment fees of 100 basis points
calculated on the aggregate term loan and commitment amounts in connection with
the execution of the Third Restated Agreement.

HEDGING REQUIREMENTS

The Credit Agreements required that the Company hedge a portion of the U.S.
dollar-based borrowings to protect against increases in market interest rates.
At September 30, 1993, the Company was a party to an interest rate swap contract
related to $150 million of such borrowings. The effect of this contract is to
fix the interest rate at approximately 12.9% on $150 million. The swap is
scheduled to expire no later than March 22, 1994. Upon the expiration of this
contract, the interest rate on these borrowings will be the rates described
above unless a new hedging arrangement is entered into.

SECURITY

Loans under the Credit Agreements are secured by a mortgage on the Company's
mill in Florence, South Carolina, and a pledge of the stock of various
subsidiaries of the Company, including Stone Southwest, Inc. and Stone Mill
Operating Corporation. Stone Southwest, Inc. owns mills in Snowflake, Arizona
and Panama City, Florida, and Stone Mill Operating Corporation owns mills in
Coshocton, Ohio, Missoula, Montana, Ontonagon, Michigan, and York, Pennsylvania.
The Company has also pledged to the lenders all of the common stock of Stone
Financial Corporation and Stone Fin II Receivables Corporation and certain
subordinated notes payable to the Company. All of the stock of Stone Canada has
also been pledged to the lenders under the Credit Agreements. The Company has
guaranteed the obligations of Stone Canada as a borrower under the Credit
Agreements. The Company and its subsidiary, Stone Bag Corporation, have granted
mortgages and security interests on approximately 47 box or bag plants owned or
leased by the Company or Stone Bag Corporation in the United States, together
with all fixed assets located at such plants and have granted a security
interest in inventories owned by the Company and Stone Bag Corporation.

Pursuant to the Third Restated Agreement effective December 17, 1993, the
bank group obtained mortgages on the Uncasville, Connecticut mill owned by Stone
Connecticut Paperboard Corporation, the Coshocton, Ohio mill owned by Stone Mill
Operating Corporation and the Pontiac mill owned by Stone Canada. Stone Canada
also pledged 100% of the shares of Stone-Consolidated Corporation owned by Stone
Canada and executed a limited recourse guaranty of the Company's indebtedness
under the Credit Agreements. Stone Bag and Stone Connecticut have also executed
limited recourse guarantees of the Company's indebtedness under the Credit
Agreements. Certain other security interests were also granted to the bank
group.

COVENANTS

The Credit Agreements contain covenants that include, among other things,
requirements to maintain certain financial tests and ratios (including a minimum
current ratio, an indebtedness ratio, an EBITDA test, and a tangible

16
<PAGE>
net worth test) and certain restrictions and limitations, including those on
capital expenditures, changes in control, payments of dividends, sales of
assets, lease payments, investments, additional borrowings, mergers and
purchases of stock and assets.

CONSOLIDATED TANGIBLE NET WORTH

The Third Restated Agreement requires that the Company have a consolidated
tangible net worth at the end of each calendar quarter, less certain excluded
investments, at least equal to the greater of 50% of (a) the consolidated
tangible net worth of the Company as of March 1, 1989 and (b) the highest
consolidated tangible net worth of the Company as of the end of any calendar
quarter ending after March 1, 1989.

EBITDA REQUIREMENT

The Third Restated Agreement requires that the Company have earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as defined in the Third Restated
Agreement) equal to or greater than

On December 29, 1993, the banks amended the Third Restated Agreement to
permit the earnings from the sale of the Company's interest in Empaques de
Carton Titan, S.A., a Mexican corrugated container company, to be counted for
purposes of satisfying the minimum EBITDA requirement solely for the quarter
ended December 31, 1993.

INDEBTEDNESS RATIO

The Company is currently required to have an indebtedness ratio (ratio of
total consolidated indebtedness to consolidated tangible net worth plus total
consolidated indebtedness, as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreements)
not exceeding (i) 81% at the end of each calendar month ending on or after
September 30, 1993 and ending prior to December 31, 1993; (ii) 81.5% at the end
of each calendar month ending on or after December 31, 1993 and ending prior to
March 31, 1995; (iii) 81.0% at the end of each calendar month ending on and
after March 31, 1995 and ending prior to June 30, 1995; (iv) 80.0% at the end of
each calendar month ending on and after June 30, 1995 and ending prior to
September 30, 1995; (v) 79.0% at the end of each calendar month ending on or
after September 30, 1995 and ending prior to December 31, 1995; (vi) 78.0% at

and after March 31, 1996 and ending prior to June 30, 1996; (viii) 74.0% at the
end of each calendar month ending on or after June 30, 1996 and ending prior to
September 30, 1996; (ix) 72.0% at the end of each calendar month ending on or
after September 30, 1996 and ending prior to December 31, 1996; and (x) 68% at
the end of each calendar month ending on or after December 31, 1996.

At September 30, 1993, the Company's actual indebtedness ratio (as defined)
was 79.6%.

RESTRICTIONS ON INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND GUARANTEES; CROSS-DEFAULTS

The U.S. Credit Agreement contains prohibitions on investments in Stone
Venepal (Celgar) Pulp, Inc., a Canadian federal corporation, and the Company's
subsidiary, Stone-Consolidated Corporation. The Credit Agreements also restrict
further investments in two of the Company's subsidiaries, Seminole Kraft
Corporation and Stone Savannah River Pulp & Paper Corporation. The Company is
also not permitted to guarantee the indebtedness of Stone-Consolidated
Corporation and there are restrictions on other guarantees. There are also
restrictions on

17
<PAGE>
transactions with affiliates which are wholly-owned subsidiaries. Any event of
default or default with respect to a Subsidiary's indebtedness for money
borrowed having an aggregate principal amount of $10 million or more constitutes
an event of default under the Credit Agreements.

RESTRICTIONS ON DIVIDENDS

The U.S. Credit Agreement provides that the Company's dividend payments,
distributions or purchases of any class of capital stock of the Company and its
subsidiaries cannot exceed the sum of $50 million plus (i) 50% of the
consolidated net income (as defined by the Credit Agreements) of the Company
from April 1, 1991 to the date of payment of such dividends, minus (ii) 100% of
the consolidated net loss (as defined by the Credit Agreements) of the Company
from April 1, 1991 to the date of payment of such dividend plus (iii) 50% of any
net cash proceeds from sales of Common Stock or certain preferred stock of the
Company from April 1, 1991 to the date of payment of such dividends. The Credit
Agreements also provide that, with respect to the first cash dividend to be
declared after September 1, 1992, such declaration cannot be made unless the
unused portion of the revolving credit facilities (net of any unused portion
required to be reserved for capital expenditures only) is at least equal to $96
million plus the amount of such cash dividend.

At September 30, 1993, the dividend pool under the U.S. Credit Agreement had
a deficit of approximately $334.1 million. The dividend pool will be further
reduced by 100% of the consolidated net loss of the Company that will be
reported for the fourth quarter of 1993. The dividend pool will be increased by
50% of any net cash proceeds from the sale of Common Stock or certain preferred
stock of the Company.

In addition, the indentures relating to the Debt Securities and indentures
relating to the Company's outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness and the
13 5/8% Subordinated Notes due 1995 also restrict the payment of dividends and
distributions. See "Description of Debt Securities -- Particular Terms of the
Senior Debt Securities -- Certain Covenants -- Dividend Restrictions" and "--
Additional Terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities -- Dividend
Restrictions."

RESTRICTIONS ON INCURRENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS

The Credit Agreements restrict the incurrence of additional indebtedness,
subject to certain exceptions. The U.S. Credit Agreement permits the Company to
undertake accounts receivable securitization financings of up to $500 million,
the initial net proceeds of which are required to be used to reduce outstanding
term loans. The Company has instituted two accounts receivable securitization
financings of $365 million of which balances of $261.3 million were outstanding
as of September 30, 1993. The Company may incur an additional $135 million in
securitization financings under the Credit Agreements although no new program is
currently contemplated.

In addition, the Company's indentures relating to the Debt Securities also
restricts the incurrence of additional indebtedness, subject to certain
exceptions. See "Description of Debt Securities -- Particular Terms of the
Senior Debt Securities -- Certain Covenants -- Limitation on Future Incurrence
of Indebtedness."

DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES

The following description sets forth certain general terms and provisions of
the Debt Securities to which any Prospectus Supplement may relate. The
particular terms of the Debt Securities offered by any Prospectus Supplement and
the extent, if any, to which such general provisions may apply to the Debt
Securities so offered will be described in the Prospectus Supplement relating to
such Debt Securities.

The Debt Securities may be issued from time to time in one or more series
and will constitute either Senior Debt Securities, Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities. Senior Debt Securities will be
issued under an Indenture dated as of November 1, 1991, as supplemented by the
First Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 23, 1993 (the "Senior Debt
Securities Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee
(the "Senior Debt Securities Trustee"). The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
will be issued under an Indenture (the "Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
Indenture") to be entered into by the Company and Norwest Bank Minnesota,
National Association, as Trustee (the "Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
Trustee"). The Subordinated Debt Securities will be issued under an Indenture
(the "Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture") dated as of March 15, 1992
between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (the "Subordinated Debt
Securities Trustee"). The Senior Debt Securities Indenture, the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture and the Subordinated Debt Securities
Indenture are referred to herein individually as an "Indenture" and,
collectively, as the "Indentures," and the Senior Debt Securities Trustee, the
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Trustee and the Subordinated Debt Securities
Trustee are referred to herein individually as to the "Trustee" and collectively
as the "Trustees." A copy of each Indenture is filed or incorporated by
reference as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.

The following summaries of certain provisions of the Debt Securities and the
Indentures do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and are qualified
in their entirety by express reference to, all the provisions of the Indentures,
including the definitions therein of certain terms. Certain capitalized terms
herein are defined in the Indentures.

GENERAL

The Debt Securities will be unsecured obligations of the Company.

The Indentures do not limit the aggregate principal amount of Debt
Securities which may be issued thereunder and provide that Debt Securities may
be issued thereunder from time to time in one or more series.

Reference is made to the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Debt
Securities being offered (the "Offered Debt Securities") for, among other
things, the following terms thereof: (1) the title of the Offered Debt
Securities; (2) the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Debt Securities;
(3) the date or dates on which the Offered Debt Securities will mature; (4) the
rate or rates (which may be fixed or variable) per annum at which the Offered
Debt Securities will bear interest and the date from which such interest will
accrue; (5) the dates on which such interest will be payable and the Regular
Record Dates for such Interest Payment Dates; (6) the dates, if any, on which,
and the price or prices at which, the Offered Debt Securities may, pursuant to
any mandatory or optional sinking fund provisions, be redeemed by the Company
and other detailed terms and provisions of such sinking funds; (7) the terms and
conditions, if any, pursuant to which the Offered Debt Securities are
convertible into Common Stock; and (8) the date, if any, after which, and the
price or prices at which, the Offered Debt Securities may, pursuant to any
optional redemption provisions, be redeemed at the option of the Company or of
the Holder thereof and other detailed terms and provisions of such optional
redemption. For a description of the terms of the Offered Debt Securities,
reference must be made to both the Prospectus Supplement relating thereto and to
the description of Debt Securities set forth herein.

Debt Securities which are convertible into Common Stock may only be issued
under the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture.

Unless otherwise indicated in the Prospectus Supplement relating thereto,
the principal of, and any premium or interest on, the Offered Debt Securities
will be payable, and the Offered Debt Securities will be exchangeable and
transfers thereof will be registrable, at the Place of Payment, provided that,
at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to
the address of the person entitled thereto as it appears in the Security
Register.

19
<PAGE>
Unless otherwise indicated in the Prospectus Supplement relating thereto,
the Offered Debt Securities will be issued in United States dollars in fully
registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 or any integral
multiple thereof. No service charge will be made for any transfer or exchange of
the Offered Debt Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection
therewith.

RANKING

The Senior Debt Securities will rank PARI PASSU in right of payment with all
other Senior Indebtedness (as defined) of the Company. The Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities will (i) be subordinate in right of payment to all existing and
future Senior Indebtedness of the Company, (ii) be senior in right of payment to
all existing and future Junior Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined) and (iii)
rank PARI PASSU in right of payment with all existing and future Senior
Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined). The Subordinated Debt Securities will
(i) be subordinate in right of payment to all existing and future Senior
Indebtedness and Senior Subordinated Indebtedness and (ii) rank PARI PASSU upon
liquidation with all existing and future Junior Subordinated Indebtedness.

A substantial portion of the Company's assets currently secure the
borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreements, which are a component of
Senior Indebtedness. At July 29, 1993, the Company, together with Stone Canada,
had $1.601 billion of term-loan borrowings outstanding under the Credit
Agreements plus approximately $101 million in borrowings outstanding under the
revolving credit facilities available under the Credit Agreements.

The Debt Securities are obligations exclusively of the Company. Because the
operations of the Company are currently conducted primarily by subsidiaries, the
Company's cash flow and consequent ability to service debt, including the Debt
Securities, are dependent, in part, upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and
the distribution of those earnings or upon loans or other payments of funds by
those subsidiaries to the Company. The subsidiaries of the Company are separate
and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to
pay any amount due pursuant to the Debt Securities or to make any funds
available therefor, whether by dividends, loans or other payments. In addition,
the payment of dividends and the making of loans and advances to the Company by
its subsidiaries may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions (as
well as potential foreign tax withholding under certain circumstances), are
contingent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and are subject to various
business considerations.

Any right of the Company to receive assets of any of its subsidiaries upon
their liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the Holders to
participate in the distribution of or proceeds from those assets) will be
effectively subordinated to the claims of such subsidiary's creditors (including
trade creditors and holders of debt issued by such subsidiary), except to the
extent that the Company is itself recognized as a creditor of such subsidiary,
in which case the claims of the Company would still be subordinate to any
security interests in the assets of such subsidiary and any indebtedness of such
subsidiary senior to that held by the Company. The 12 1/8% Subordinated
Debentures due September 15, 2001 of Stone Southwest, Inc., a significant
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, have been guaranteed on a subordinated
basis by the Company. At September 30, 1993, approximately $92.1 million
principal amount of such 12 1/8% Subordinated Debentures due September 15, 2001
was outstanding.

BOOK-ENTRY DEBT SECURITIES

The Debt Securities of a series may be issued in whole or in part in the
form of one or more Global Securities that will be deposited with, or on behalf
of, a Depositary ("Depositary") or its nominee identified in the applicable
Prospectus Supplement. In such a case, one or more Global Securities will be
issued in a denomination or aggregate denomination equal to the portion of the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Debt Securities of the series to be
represented by such Global Security or Global Securities. Unless and until it is
exchanged in whole or in part for Debt Securities in registered form, a Global
Security may not be registered for transfer or exchange except as a whole by the
Depositary for such Global Security to a nominee of such Depositary or by a
nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such
Depositary or by such Depositary or any nominee to a successor Depositary or a
nominee of such successor Depositary and except in the circumstances described
in the applicable Prospectus Supplement.

20
<PAGE>
The specific terms of the depositary arrangement with respect to any portion
of a series of Debt Securities to be represented by a Global Security will be
described in the applicable Prospectus Supplement. The Company expects that the
following provisions will apply to depositary arrangements.

Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, Debt
Securities which are to be represented by a Global Security to be deposited with
or on behalf of a Depositary will be represented by a Global Security registered
in the name of such Depositary or its nominee. Upon the issuance of such Global
Security, and the deposit of such Global Security with or on behalf of the
Depositary for such Global Security, the Depositary will credit, on its
book-entry registration and transfer system, the respective principal amounts of
the Debt Securities represented by such Global Security to the accounts of
institutions that have accounts with such Depositary or its nominee
("participants"). The accounts to be credited will be designated by the
underwriters or agents of such Debt Securities or, if such Debt Securities are
offered and sold directly by the Company, by the Company. Ownership of
beneficial interests in such Global Security will be limited to participants or
Persons that may hold interests through participants. Ownership of beneficial
interests by participants in such Global Security will be shown on, and the
transfer of that ownership interest will be effected only through, records
maintained by the Depositary or its nominee for such Global Security. Ownership
of beneficial interests in such Global Security by Persons that hold through
participants will be shown on, and the transfer of that ownership interest
within such participant will be effected only through, records maintained by
such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers
of securities take physical delivery of such securities in certificated form.
The foregoing limitations and such laws may impair the ability to transfer
beneficial interests in such Global Securities.

So long as the Depositary for a Global Security, or its nominee, is the
registered owner of such Global Security, such Depositary or such nominee, as
the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or Holder of the Securities
represented by such Global Security for all purposes under the applicable
Indenture. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement,
owners of beneficial interests in such Global Security will not be entitled to
have Debt Securities of the series represented by such Global Security
registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical
delivery of Debt Securities of such series in certificated form and will not be
considered the Holders thereof for any purposes under the applicable Indenture.
Accordingly, each Person owning a beneficial interest in such Global Security
must rely on the procedures of the Depositary and, if such Person is not a
participant, on the procedures of the participant through which such Person owns
its interest, to exercise any rights of a Holder under the applicable Indenture.
The Company understands that under existing industry practices, if the Company
requests any action of Holders or an owner of a beneficial interest in such
Global Security desires to give any notice or take any action a Holder is
entitled to give or take under the applicable Indenture, the Depositary would
authorize the participants to give such notice or take such action, and
participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through such participants
to give such notice or take such action or would otherwise act upon the
instructions of beneficial owners owning through them.

Principal of and any premium and interest on a Global Security will be
payable in the manner described in the applicable Prospectus Supplement.

PARTICULAR TERMS OF THE SENIOR DEBT SECURITIES

The following description of the Senior Debt Securities sets forth certain
general terms and provisions of the Senior Debt Securities to which any
Prospectus Supplement may relate. The particular terms of the Senior Debt
Securities offered by any Prospectus Supplement and the extent, if any, to which
such general provisions may apply to the Senior Debt Securities so offered will
be described in the Prospectus Supplement relating to such Senior Debt
Securities.

CERTAIN COVENANTS

MAINTENANCE OF SUBORDINATED CAPITAL BASE

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that, subject to the exception
described in the third following paragraph, in the event that the Company's
Subordinated Capital Base is less than $1 billion (the "Minimum Subordinated
Capital Base") as at the end of each of any two consecutive fiscal quarters (the
last day of the second such fiscal quarter, a "Deficiency Date"), then, with
respect to Senior Debt Securities of each series, the Company shall, no later
than 60 days after the Deficiency Date (105 days if a Deficiency Date is also
the end of the Company's

21
<PAGE>
fiscal year), make an offer to all Holders of Senior Debt Securities of each
such series to purchase (a "Deficiency Offer") 10% of the principal amount of
Senior Debt Securities of each such series originally issued, or such lesser
amount as may be Outstanding at the time such Deficiency Offer is made (the
"Deficiency Offer Amount"), at a purchase price equal to 100% of principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Deficiency Payment Date (as
defined below). Thereafter, semiannually the Company shall make like Deficiency
Offers for the then applicable Deficiency Offer Amount of Senior Debt Securities
of each such series until the Company's Subordinated Capital Base as at the end
of any subsequent fiscal quarter shall be equal to or greater than the Minimum
Subordinated Capital Base. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after any specified
Deficiency Date, the last day of any subsequent fiscal quarter shall not
constitute a Deficiency Date (giving rise to an additional obligation under the
first sentence of this paragraph) unless the Company's Subordinated Capital Base
was equal to or greater than the Minimum Subordinated Capital Base as at the end
of a fiscal quarter that followed such specified Deficiency Date and preceded
such subsequent quarter.

Within 60 days (105 days if the Deficiency Date is also the end of the
Company's fiscal year) following a Deficiency Date, the Company shall mail a
notice to each Holder of Senior Debt Securities of the applicable series in
respect of the Deficiency Offer (which notice shall contain all instructions and
materials necessary to enable such Holders to tender Senior Debt Securities).
Senior Debt Securities tendered pursuant to a Deficiency Offer will be accepted
for payment, in amounts as set forth below, on the date which shall be 20
Business Days from the date such notice is mailed or, if acceptance for payment
and payment is not then lawful, on the earliest subsequent Business Day on which
acceptance for payment and payment is then lawful (a "Deficiency Payment Date").

On a Deficiency Payment Date, the Company shall accept for payment Senior
Debt Securities of each applicable series or portions thereof tendered pursuant
to the Deficiency Offer in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Deficiency
Offer Amount or such lesser principal amount of such Senior Debt Securities as
shall have been tendered, and deposit with the Paying Agent money sufficient to
pay the purchase price of all such Senior Debt Securities or portions thereof so
accepted. If the aggregate principal amount of such Senior Debt Securities
tendered exceeds the Deficiency Offer Amount, the Company shall select the
Senior Debt Securities to be purchased on a pro rata basis to the nearest $1,000
of principal amount. The Paying Agent shall promptly mail or deliver to Holders
of Senior Debt Securities so accepted payment in amounts equal to the purchase
prices therefor, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall promptly
authenticate and mail or make available for delivery to such Holders new Senior
Debt Securities of the same series as, and equal in principal amounts to, any
unpurchased portion of the Senior Debt Securities surrendered. The Company will
publicly announce the results of the Deficiency Offer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (1) the making of a
Deficiency Offer by the Company or (2) the purchase of Senior Debt Securities by
the Company in respect of a Deficiency Offer would constitute a default (with
the giving of notice, the passage of time or both) with respect to any Specified
Bank Debt at the time outstanding in an aggregate principal amount greater than
$25 million, then, in lieu of the making of a Deficiency Offer in the
circumstances set forth above, (i) the interest rate on the Senior Debt
Securities of each applicable series shall be reset as of the first day of the
second fiscal quarter following the Deficiency Date (the "Reset Date") to a rate
per annum (the "Reset Rate") equal to the greater of (x) the initial interest
rate as set forth on the face of the Senior Debt Security (the "Initial Interest
Rate") and (y) the sum of (A) the basis points specified in the applicable Board
Resolution or supplemental indenture for purposes of this reset provision and
(B) the highest of the treasury rates specified in the applicable Board
Resolution or supplemental indenture for purposes of this reset provision, (ii)
on the first Interest Payment Date following the Reset Date, the interest rate
on the Senior Debt Securities of each such series, as reset on the Reset Date,
shall increase by 50 basis points, and (iii) the interest rate on the Senior
Debt Securities of each such series shall further increase by an additional 50
basis points on each succeeding Interest Payment Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the interest rate on the Senior Debt Securities of
any such series at any time exceed the Initial Interest Rate by more than 200
basis points. If the Company's Subordinated Capital Base falls below $1 billion,
the Company would be in default of certain covenants in the Credit Agreements as
in effect on the date hereof.

Once the interest rate on the Senior Debt Securities of any series has been
reset as set forth above, if the Company's Subordinated Capital Base is equal to
or greater than the Minimum Subordinated Capital Base as of the last day of any
fiscal quarter subsequent to the Deficiency Date, interest on the Senior Debt
Securities of each such

22
<PAGE>
series shall return to the Initial Interest Rate effective as of the first day
of the second following fiscal quarter; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the interest
rate on the Senior Debt Securities of each such series shall again be adjusted
as set forth above if the Company's Subordinated Capital Base shall thereafter
be less than the Minimum Subordinated Capital Base as at the last day of each of
any two consecutive subsequent fiscal quarters and if the making of a Deficiency
Offer or the purchase of Senior Debt Securities by the Company in respect of a
Deficiency Offer would, at such time, constitute a default (with the giving of
notice, passage of time or both) with respect to any Specified Bank Debt at the
time outstanding in an aggregate principal amount greater than $25 million.

The Company shall notify the Trustee of the Reset Rate not later than two
Business Days after the Reset Date in the circumstances set forth in the second
preceding paragraph. Not later than five Business Days after the Trustee has
received such notice from the Company, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder of
Senior Debt Securities of the applicable series such notice setting forth the
Reset Rate. The Company shall notify the Trustee and the Holders of such Senior
Debt Securities promptly when the interest rate on such Debt Securities returns
to the Initial Interest Rate as set forth above.

With respect to any Deficiency Offer, the Company intends to comply with the
requirements of Section 14(e) and Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, if then
applicable.

LIMITATION ON FUTURE INCURRENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that the Company will not, and
will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, incur, create, assume, guarantee
or in any other manner become directly or indirectly liable with respect to or
responsible for the payment of, any Indebtedness, except: (1) Permitted
Indebtedness; and (2) Indebtedness of the Company if at the time thereof and
after giving effect thereto the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of the
Company, on a pro forma basis for the four most recent quarters, taken as a
whole (giving effect to (i) such Indebtedness and (ii) the effect on the
Consolidated Cash Flow Available for Fixed Charges of the Company for the then
four most recent full fiscal quarters, taken as a whole, as a result of any
acquisition of a Person acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
with the proceeds of such Indebtedness), would be greater than 1.75 to 1.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, guarantee, or in any other manner become directly or
indirectly liable with respect to or responsible for the payment of,
Indebtedness of any Unrestricted Subsidiary in an amount greater than, for all
guaranties and undertakings of responsibility by the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, 20% of the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of such Unrestricted
Subsidiary.

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that the Company will not, and
will not permit any Subsidiary of the Company to, directly or indirectly, (1)
declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution, in cash or otherwise, in
respect of any shares of Capital Stock of the Company or to the holders of
Capital Stock of the Company as such (other than dividends or distributions
payable in shares of Capital Stock of the Company, other than Redeemable Stock)
or (2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value any of the
Capital Stock of the Company or options, warrants or other rights to acquire any
such Capital Stock, other than acquisitions of Capital Stock or such options,
warrants or other rights by any Subsidiary of the Company from the Company (any
such transaction included in clause (1) or (2), a "Restricted Payment") if (i)
at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving effect thereto, (a) an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to any
series of the Senior Debt Securities or (b) the Consolidated Net Worth of the
Company shall be less than $750 million; or if (ii) after giving effect to such
Restricted Payment, the aggregate amount expended subsequent to the date of the
Senior Debt Securities Indenture for all such Restricted Payments (the amount of
any Restricted Payment, if other than cash, to be the fair market value of such
payment as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose reasonable
determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a Board Resolution) exceed
the algebraic sum of (w) a number calculated as follows: (A) if the aggregate
Consolidated Net Income of the Company earned on a cumulative basis during the
period subsequent to September 30, 1991 through the end of the last fiscal
quarter that is prior to the declaration of any such dividend or distribution or
the giving of notice of such purchase, redemption or other acquisition or
retirement and for which such financial information is then available, is a
positive number, then 100% of such positive number, and (B) if the aggregate
Consolidated Net Income of the Company earned on a cumulative basis during the
period subsequent to September 30, 1991 through the end of the last fiscal
quarter that

23
<PAGE>
is prior to the declaration of any such dividend or distribution or the giving
of notice of such purchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement and
for which such financial information is then available, is a negative number,
then 100% of such negative number, (x) the aggregate net cash proceeds received
by the Company from the issuance and sale, other than to a Subsidiary of the
Company, subsequent to the date of the Senior Debt Securities Indenture, of
Capital Stock (including Capital Stock issued upon the conversion of, or in
exchange for, securities other than Capital Stock and options, warrants or other
rights to acquire Capital Stock, but excluding Redeemable Stock, (y) the
aggregate net cash proceeds received by the Company from the issuance and sale,
other than to a Subsidiary of the Company, of Indebtedness of the Company that
is converted into Capital Stock of the Company subsequent to the date of the
Senior Debt Securities Indenture, and (z) $300 million; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the retirement of any shares of the Company's Capital Stock by exchange for, or
out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of, other shares of
Capital Stock of the Company other than Redeemable Stock shall not constitute a
Restricted Payment. If all of the conditions to the declaration of a dividend or
distribution that are described above are satisfied at the time such dividend or
distribution is declared, then such dividend or distribution may be paid or made
within sixty days after such declaration even if the payment of such dividend,
the making of such distribution or the declaration thereof would not have been
permitted at any time after such declaration.

LIMITATION ON FUTURE LIENS AND GUARANTIES

Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Debt Securities Indenture, if the
Company or any Subsidiary shall create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any
Lien upon any of the assets of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company
(whether such assets are owned at the date of the Senior Debt Securities
Indenture or thereafter acquired) as a security for (1) any Indebtedness or
other obligation (whether unconditional or contingent) of the Company that ranks
PARI PASSU with the Senior Debt Securities or any Indebtedness or other
obligation (whether unconditional or contingent) of a Subsidiary of the Company,
the Company will secure or will cause such Subsidiary to guarantee and secure
the Outstanding Senior Debt Securities equally and ratably with (or, at the
option of the Company, prior to) such Indebtedness or other obligation, so long
as such Indebtedness or other obligation shall be so secured, or (2) any
Subordinated Indebtedness, the Company will secure the Outstanding Senior Debt
Securities prior to such Subordinated Indebtedness, so long as such Subordinated
Indebtedness shall be so secured; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this covenant does not
apply in the case of Permitted Liens or Liens granted by any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to secure Indebtedness or other obligations of itself or of any
Person other than the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Senior Debt Securities Indenture,
the Company will not guarantee the Indebtedness of any Subsidiary and will not
permit any Subsidiary (including Stone Savannah River Pulp & Paper Corporation
and Seminole Kraft Corporation) to guarantee (i) any Indebtedness of the Company
that ranks PARI PASSU with the Senior Debt Securities, (ii) any Indebtedness of
a Subsidiary of the Company or (iii) any Subordinated Indebtedness; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that this paragraph does not apply to (1) any guaranty by a Subsidiary
if such Subsidiary also guarantees the Senior Debt Securities on a PARI PASSU
basis with respect to guaranties of Indebtedness described in clauses (i) and
(ii) and on a senior basis with respect to guaranties of Indebtedness described
in clause (iii); (2) any guaranty existing on the date of the Senior Debt
Securities Indenture or any extension or renewal of such guaranty to the extent
such extension or renewal is for the same or a lesser amount; (3) any guaranty
which constitutes Indebtedness permitted by clause (v) or (vi) of the definition
of Permitted Indebtedness granted by a Person permitted to incur such
Indebtedness; (4) any guaranty by the Company of Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary, PROVIDED that (A) incurrence of such Indebtedness of the Restricted
Subsidiary is not prohibited by the Senior Debt Securities Indenture and (B) (x)
such guaranty constitutes Indebtedness of the Company incurred as Permitted
Indebtedness pursuant to clause (vii) or (viii) of the definition of Permitted
Indebtedness (it being understood that, for purposes of determining Permitted
Indebtedness, any such guaranty shall be deemed to constitute Indebtedness
separate from, and, in addition to, Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary
which is so guaranteed) or (y) immediately prior to and (on a pro forma basis)
after granting such guaranty, the Company would be permitted to incur an
additional dollar of Indebtedness (not constituting Permitted Indebtedness)
under the restrictions described in "Limitation on Future Incurrence of
Indebtedness" above; (5) any guaranty by an Unrestricted Subsidiary of
Indebtedness or other obligations of any Person other than the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries; (6) any guaranty by the Company or any Subsidiary
(including Stone Savannah River Pulp & Paper Corporation and Seminole Kraft
Corporation) of Indebtedness or other

24
<PAGE>
obligations constituting Indebtedness permitted by clause (i)(a) of the
definition of Permitted Indebtedness in a principal amount not exceeding the
principal amount outstanding or committed under the Credit Agreements (including
any letter of credit facility, but without duplication with respect to
commitments for loans the use of proceeds of which is restricted to repayment of
other Indebtedness under the Credit Agreements) as of the date of the Senior
Debt Securities Indenture, plus $250 million and less the proceeds from the sale
of all Senior Debt Securities issued from time to time that are applied to repay
Indebtedness under the Credit Agreements); (7) any guaranty by the Company of
Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the date of the Senior
Debt Securities Indenture which is not subordinated to any Indebtedness of such
Restricted Subsidiary, and any renewal extension or refinancing of such
Indebtedness permitted by the Senior Debt Securities Indenture; (8) any guaranty
by the Company of Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is organized
under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States or any subdivision
thereof, PROVIDED that the incurrence of such Indebtedness of such Restricted
Subsidiary is not prohibited by the Senior Debt Securities Indenture; (9) any
guaranty by a Restricted Subsidiary that is organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction other than the United States or any subdivision thereof of the
Indebtedness of any of its Subsidiaries that is a Restricted Subsidiary and that
is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States or
any subdivision thereof, PROVIDED that incurrence of such Indebtedness of such
Restricted Subsidiary is not prohibited by the Senior Debt Securities Indenture;
(10) any guaranty by the Company or a Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other
obligations in a principal amount not exceeding $250,000; (11) any guaranty in
the form of an endorsement of negotiable instruments for deposit or collection
and similar transactions; (12) any guaranty arising under or in connection with
performance bonds, indemnity bonds, surety bonds or commercial letters of credit
not exceeding $25 million in aggregate principal amount from time to time
outstanding; (13) any guaranty by a Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other
obligations of another Subsidiary in effect at the time of such guarantor
becoming a Subsidiary and not created in contemplation thereof; or (14) any
guaranty by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of any Interest Swap
Obligation, Currency Agreement or Commodities Agreement relating to Indebtedness
that is guaranteed pursuant to another clause of this paragraph.

LIMITATION ON ASSET DISPOSITIONS

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that so long as any of the
Senior Debt Securities are Outstanding, (i) the Company will not, and will not
permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any Asset Disposition unless the
Company (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives
consideration at the time of such Asset Disposition at least equal to the fair
market value for the assets sold or otherwise disposed of (which shall be
determined in good faith (x) in the case of dispositions of assets having a fair
market value of $10 million or more, by the Board of Directors of the Company,
whose reasonable determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a Board
Resolution, or (y) in the case of dispositions of assets having a fair market
value of less than $10 million but not less than $5 million, an officer of the
Company, whose reasonable determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a
certificate of such officer) and (ii) the Company will apply the aggregate net
proceeds in excess of $300 million received by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary from all Asset Dispositions occurring subsequent to the date of the
Senior Debt Securities Indenture (but excluding for purposes of this clause
(ii), whether before or after the receipt of net proceeds in excess of $300
million, (1) the net proceeds of any Asset Disposition or series of related
Asset Dispositions where the net proceeds are less than $5 million and (2) the
first $25 million of net proceeds in each fiscal year without taking into
account any amount excluded pursuant to (1)) as follows: (a) to the payment or
prepayment of any Senior Indebtedness within six months of such Asset
Disposition, or (b) to investment in the business of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, by acquiring equity,
other than Redeemable Stock, of the transferee of such Asset Disposition) within
six months of such Asset Disposition or, if such investment is with respect to a
project to be completed within a period greater than six months from such Asset
Disposition, then within the period of time necessary to complete such project;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (x) in the case of applications contemplated by clause
(b), the Board of Directors has, within such six-month period, adopted in good
faith a resolution committing such excess proceeds to such investment, (y)
except as provided in the next sentence, none of such excess proceeds shall be
used to make any Restricted Payment or any payment in respect of Subordinated
Indebtedness and (z) to the extent not applied in accordance with clauses (a) or
(b) above, or if after being so applied there remain excess net proceeds in an
amount greater than $10 million, the Company shall make a pro rata offer to all
Holders to purchase Senior Debt Securities at 100% of principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the Asset Disposition Payment Date (as defined
below), up to an aggregate principal amount equal to such excess net proceeds
(the "Asset Disposition Offer Amount"). If after

25
<PAGE>
being applied in accordance with clauses (a), (b) and (z) above there remain
excess net proceeds, the Company will apply such excess net proceeds to the
general corporate purposes of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. An
offer to purchase Senior Debt Securities required to be made pursuant to this
covenant is an "Asset Disposition Offer" and the date on which the purchase of
Debt Securities relating to any such Asset Disposition Offer is to be made is an
"Asset Disposition Payment Date."

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries receives securities or other non-cash property or assets
as proceeds of an Asset Disposition (other than equity in the transferee not
constituting Redeemable Stock), the Company shall not be required to make any
application required by the preceding paragraph until it receives cash proceeds
from a sale, repayment, exchange, redemption or retirement of or extraordinary
dividend or return of capital on such non-cash property, except that if and to
the extent the sum of all cash proceeds plus the fair market value of equity
(other than Redeemable Stock) in the transferee of such Asset Disposition
received at the time of such Asset Disposition is less than 70% of the fair
market value of the total proceeds of such Asset Disposition (with such fair
market value determined and evidenced in the same manner as stated in clause (i)
of the preceding paragraph), the amount of such deficiency (the "Deficiency
Amount") shall be applied as required by the preceding paragraph as if received
at the time of the Asset Disposition. Any amounts deferred pursuant to the
preceding sentence shall be applied in accordance with the preceding paragraph
when cash proceeds are thereafter received from a sale, repayment, exchange,
redemption or retirement of or extraordinary dividend or return of capital on
such non-cash property; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be
required to apply with respect to any equity interest in a transferee an amount
exceeding the fair market value attributable to such equity interest at the time
of the Asset Disposition; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if a Deficiency Amount was
applied pursuant to the exception contained in the preceding sentence, then once
the cumulative amount of applications made pursuant to the preceding paragraph
and this paragraph (including any Deficiency Amount) equals 100% of the fair
market value of the total proceeds of the Asset Disposition at the time of such
Asset Disposition, cash proceeds thereafter received from a sale, repayment,
exchange, redemption or retirement of or extraordinary dividend or return of
capital on such non-cash property shall not be required to be applied in
accordance with the preceding paragraph except to the extent such cash proceeds
exceed the Deficiency Amount.

Notice of an Asset Disposition Offer shall be mailed on behalf of the
Company by the Trustee to all Holders of Senior Debt Securities at their last
registered addresses not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days before the
Asset Disposition Payment Date, which shall be a date not more than 210 days
after the Asset Disposition giving rise to such Asset Disposition Offer. The
Asset Disposition Offer shall remain open from the time of the mailing of such
notice until not more than 5 Business Days before the Asset Disposition Payment
Date.

On the Asset Disposition Payment Date, the Company shall accept for payment
Senior Debt Securities or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Asset
Disposition Offer in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Asset
Disposition Offer Amount or such lesser amount of Senior Debt Securities as
shall have been tendered, and deposit with the Paying Agent money sufficient to
pay the purchase price of all Senior Debt Securities or portions thereof so
accepted. If the aggregate principal amount of Senior Debt Securities tendered
exceeds the Asset Disposition Offer Amount, the Company shall select the Senior
Debt Securities to be purchased on a pro rata basis to the nearest $1,000 of
principal amount. The Paying Agent shall promptly mail or deliver to Holders of
Senior Debt Securities so accepted payment in an amount equal to the purchase
price, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate
and mail or make available for delivery to such Holders a new Senior Debt
Security of the applicable series and equal in principal amount to any
unpurchased portion of the Senior Debt Security surrendered. The Company will
publicly announce the results of the Asset Disposition Offer.

With respect to any Asset Disposition Offer, the Company intends to comply
with the requirements of Section 14(e) and Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, if
applicable.

RESTRICTIONS ON MERGERS AND CONSOLIDATIONS AND SALES OF ASSETS

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that the Company shall not
consolidate with, merge with or into any other corporation (whether or not the
Company shall be the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer or lease
all or substantially all of its properties and assets as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety to any Person or group of affiliated Persons, in
one transaction or a series of related transactions, unless: (1) either the
Company

26
<PAGE>
shall be the continuing Person or the Person (if other than the Company) formed
by such consolidation or with which or into which the Company is merged or the
Person (or group of affiliated Persons) to which all or substantially all the
properties and assets of the Company are sold, assigned, transferred or leased
is a corporation (or constitute corporations) organized under the laws of the
United States or any State thereof or the District of Columbia and expressly
assumes, by an indenture supplemental to the Senior Debt Securities Indenture,
all the obligations of the Company under the Senior Debt Securities and the
Senior Debt Securities Indenture; (2) immediately before and after giving effect
to such transaction, no Event of Default, and no Default, with respect to the
Senior Debt Securities shall have occurred and be continuing; (3) immediately
after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis, but prior to any
purchase accounting adjustments resulting from the transaction, the Consolidated
Net Worth of the Company (or of the surviving, consolidated or transferee entity
if the Company is not continuing, treating such entity as the Company for
purposes of determining Consolidated Net Worth) shall be at least equal to the
Consolidated Net Worth of the Company immediately before such transaction; (4)
immediately after giving effect to such transaction the Company (or the
surviving, consolidated or transferee entity if the Company is not continuing,
but treating such entity as the Company for purposes of making such
determination) would be permitted to incur an additional dollar of Indebtedness
(not constituting Permitted Indebtedness) immediately prior to such transaction
under the covenant contained in the Senior Debt Securities Indenture restricting
the incurrence of Indebtedness; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this clause (4) shall be
inapplicable if (a) such transaction would result in the occurrence of a Change
of Control or (b) immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction, the
Company would not be permitted to incur an additional dollar of Indebtedness
(not constituting Permitted Indebtedness) under such covenant, and immediately
after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis (but prior to any
purchase accounting adjustments resulting from the transaction), the
Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of the Company (or the surviving,
consolidated or transferee entity if the Company is not continuing, treating
such entity as the Company for purposes of determining the Consolidated Interest
Coverage Ratio) shall be at least equal to the Consolidated Interest Coverage
Ratio of the Company immediately before such transaction; and (5) the Company
shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such
supplemental indenture comply with the Senior Debt Securities Indenture.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if clause (4) of the preceding sentence is
inapplicable by reason of clause (b) of the proviso thereto, and at the date
three months after the consummation of such transaction the rating ascribed to
the Senior Debt Securities of any series by Standard and Poor's Corporation or
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. shall be lower than the rating ascribed to the
Senior Debt Securities of any series prior to the public announcement of such
transaction, then the Company shall make an offer for the Senior Debt Securities
of each series at the same price and following the same procedures and
obligations as required with respect to a Change of Control (as if such date
three months after the giving effect to such transaction were the "Change of
Control Date"). See "Limitation on Future Incurrence of Indebtedness" above and
"Change of Control" below.

If, upon any consolidation or merger, or upon any sale, assignment, transfer
or lease, as provided in the preceding paragraph, any material property of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or any shares of Capital Stock or
Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary, owned immediately prior thereto,
would thereupon become subject to any Lien securing any indebtedness for
borrowed money of, or guaranteed by, such other corporation or Person (other
than any Permitted Lien), the Company, prior to such consolidation, merger,
sale, assignment, transfer or lease, will secure the due and punctual payment of
the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Debt
Securities of each series then Outstanding (together with, if the Company shall
so determine, any other indebtedness of, or guaranteed by, the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary and then existing or thereafter created) equally and
ratably with (or, at the option of the Company, prior to) the Indebtedness
secured by such Lien.

CHANGE OF CONTROL

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (the "Change of Control Date")
and subject to the requirements of the next succeeding sentence, each Holder
shall have the right to require that the Company repurchase such Holder's Senior
Debt Securities pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control
Offer") at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of
such Senior Debt Securities plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
date of such repurchase. If such repurchase would constitute an event of default
under Specified Bank Debt, then, prior to giving the notice to Holders provided
below, the Senior Debt Securities

27
<PAGE>
Indenture requires the Company to (1) repay in full in cash such Specified Bank
Debt or (2) obtain the requisite consent of holders of such Specified Bank Debt
to permit the repurchase of Senior Debt Securities without giving rise to an
event of default under such Specified Bank Debt.

As of September 30, 1993, approximately $1.7 billion of Specified Bank Debt
was outstanding.

Promptly upon satisfaction of either one of the obligations described above,
the Company shall mail a notice to each Holder of Senior Debt Securities of each
applicable series in respect of the Change of Control Offer (which notice shall
contain all instructions and materials necessary to enable such Holders to
tender Senior Debt Securities). All Senior Debt Securities of each applicable
series tendered will be accepted for payment on a date (the "Change of Control
Payment Date") which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 40 days
from the date such notice is mailed, but in any event prior to the date on which
any Subordinated Indebtedness is paid pursuant to the terms of a provision
similar to the Change of Control Offer covenant.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall accept for payment
Senior Debt Securities of each applicable series or portions thereof tendered
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, and deposit with the Paying Agent money
sufficient to pay the purchase price of all Senior Debt Securities of each
applicable series or portions thereof so accepted. The Paying Agent shall
promptly mail or deliver to the Holder of Senior Debt Securities of each
applicable series so accepted payment in an amount equal to the purchase price,
and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail or make available for
delivery to such Holder a new Senior Debt Security of the same series as, and
equal in principal amount to, any unpurchased portion of the Senior Debt
Security surrendered. The Company will publicly announce the results of the
Change of Control Offer.

Whether a Change of Control has occurred depends entirely on the
accumulation of Common Stock of the Company and on certain changes in the
composition of the Company's Board of Directors. As a result, the Company can
enter into certain highly leveraged transactions, including certain
recapitalizations, mergers or stock repurchases, that would not result in the
application of the Change of Control provisions. Because the definitions of
"Change of Control" and "Acquiring Person" exclude the Company, any Subsidiary
of the Company and certain members of the Stone family, certain transactions in
which such entities and persons participate as beneficial owners of Common Stock
(including, among others, a leveraged buyout or recapitalization) would not
constitute a Change of Control. With respect to any Change of Control Offer, the
Company intends to comply with the requirements of Section 14(e) and Rule 14e-1
under the Exchange Act, if then applicable.

RANKING OF SENIOR DEBT SECURITIES

The payment of the principal of, interest on and any other amounts due on
Subordinated Indebtedness will be subordinated in right of payment to the prior
payment in full of the Senior Debt Securities. The Senior Debt Securities are
senior to the Company's $150 million aggregate principal amount of 10 3/4%
Senior Subordinated Notes due June 15, 1997, $125 million aggregate principal
amount of 11% Senior Subordinated Notes due August 15, 1999, $230 million
aggregate principal amount of 11 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due September 1,
1999, $200 million aggregate principal amount of 10 3/4% Senior Subordinated
Debentures due April 1, 2002, $250 million aggregate principal amount of 8 7/8%
Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due July 15, 2000, $98 million aggregate
principal amount of 13 5/8% Subordinated Notes due June 1, 1995, and $115
million aggregate principal amount of 6 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures
due February 15, 2007.

EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND NOTICE THEREOF

The following are Events of Default under the Senior Debt Securities
Indenture with respect to Senior Debt Securities of any series: (1) failure to
pay interest on any Senior Debt Security of that series when due, continued for
30 days; (2) failure to pay the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Senior
Debt Securities of that series when due and payable at Maturity, upon
redemption, upon repurchase pursuant to a Deficiency Offer as described under
"Maintenance of Subordinated Capital Base" above, pursuant to an Asset
Disposition Offer as described under "Change of Control" above or otherwise; (3)
failure to observe or perform any other covenant, warranty or agreement
contained in the Senior Debt Securities of that series or in the Senior Debt

the Senior Debt Securities Indenture solely for the benefit of Senior Debt
Securities other than that series), continued for a period of 60 days after
notice has been given to the Company by the Trustee or Holders of at least 25%
in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Debt

28
<PAGE>
Securities of that series; (4) failure to pay at final maturity, or acceleration
of, Indebtedness of the Company having an aggregate principal amount of not less
than $25 million (or, if less, the least amount contained in any similar
provision of an instrument governing any outstanding Subordinated Indebtedness
of the Company, but in no event less than $10 million), unless cured within 15
days after notice has been given to the Company by the Trustee or Holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Debt
Securities of that series; (5) the entering against the Company of one or more
judgments or decrees involving an aggregate liability of $25 million or more

reorganization relating to the Company; and (7) any other Event of Default with
respect to Senior Debt Securities of that series specified in the Prospectus
Supplement relating thereto.

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that the Trustee shall, within
30 days after the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default with respect to
Senior Debt Securities of any series, give the Holders of Senior Debt Securities
of that series notice of all uncured Defaults or Events of Default known to it
(the term "Default" to include the events specified above without grace or
notice); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, except in the case of an Event of Default or a
Default in payment on any Senior Debt Securities of any series, the Trustee
shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of
directors, the executive committee or directors or responsible officers of the
Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the
interest of the Holders of Senior Debt Securities of that series.

If an Event of Default with respect to Senior Debt Securities of any series
(other than due to event of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization) occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the Outstanding Senior Debt Securities of that series, by notice in
writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders of at least

the unpaid principal of and accrued interest to the date of acceleration on all
the Outstanding Senior Debt Securities of that series to be due and payable
immediately and, upon any such declaration, the Senior Debt Securities of that
series shall become immediately due and payable.

If an Event of Default occurs due to bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization, all unpaid principal (without premium) of and accrued interest
on the Outstanding Senior Debt Securities of any series ipso facto becomes
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of
the Trustee or any Holder of any Senior Debt Security of that series.

Any such declaration with respect to Senior Debt Securities of any series
may be annulled and past Events of Default and Defaults (except, unless
theretofore cured, an Event of Default or a Default, in payment of principal of
or interest on the Senior Debt Securities of that series) may be waived by the
Holders of a majority of the principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Debt
Securities, upon the conditions provided in the Senior Debt Securities
Indenture.

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that the Company will
periodically file statements with the Trustee regarding compliance by the
Company with certain of the covenants thereof and specifying any Event of
Default or Defaults with respect to Senior Debt Securities of any series in
performing such covenants of which the signers may have knowledge.

supplement any provision which may be inconsistent with any other provision of
the Senior Debt Securities Indenture and (ii) to make any change that does not
materially adversely affect the interests of any Holder of Senior Debt
Securities of any series. In addition, under the Senior Debt Securities
Indenture, certain rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of

any Senior Debt Securities of any series, or reduction of the percentage
required for modification, will be effective against any Holder of any
Outstanding Senior Debt Security of any series affected thereby without his

amount of Senior Debt Securities of the Company which may be issued thereunder.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Debt
Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all Senior Debt
Securities of that series waive, insofar as that series is concerned, compliance
by the Company with certain restrictive covenants of the Senior Debt Securities
Indenture. The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Senior Debt Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of
all Senior Debt Securities of that series waive any past Event of Default or

except an Event of Default or a Default in the payment of the principal of or

Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (the "Change in Control Date")
and subject to the requirements of the next succeeding sentence, each Holder of
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities shall have
the right, at the Holder's option, to require the Company to purchase all or any
part (provided that the principal amount must be $1,000 or an integral multiple
thereof) of such Holder's Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated
Debt Securities pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change in Control
Offer") at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to the date of such purchase. It shall be a condition
precedent to such right of any Holder to require the purchase of any such Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities that prior thereto,
and prior to giving the notice to Holders provided below, the Company shall have
first (1) repaid in full in cash all Specified Bank Debt or (2) obtained the
requisite consent of holders of such Specified Bank Debt to permit the purchase
of such Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities.

Promptly upon satisfaction of either one of the conditions precedent
described above, the Company shall mail a notice (which notice shall contain all
instructions and materials necessary to enable Holders to tender Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities) to each Holder of
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of each
applicable series. All Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt
Securities of each applicable series tendered will be accepted for payment on a
date which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 40 days from the date

unpurchased portion of the Senior Subordinated Debt Security or Subordinated
Debt Security surrendered. The Company will publicly announce the results of the
Change in Control Offer.

42
<PAGE>
Whether a Change in Control has occurred depends entirely on the
accumulation of Common Stock of the Company and on certain changes in the
composition of the Company's Board of Directors. As a result, the Company can
enter into certain highly leveraged transactions, including certain
recapitalizations, mergers or stock repurchases, that would not result in the
application of the Change in Control provisions. With respect to any Change in
Control Offer, the Company intends to comply with the requirements of Section
14(e), Rule 14e-1 and Rule 13e-4 under the Exchange Act, if then applicable.

The Change in Control purchase feature of the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities and the Subordinated Debt Securities may in certain circumstances
make more difficult or discourage a takeover of the Company and, thus, the
removal of incumbent management. The Change in Control purchase feature,
however, is not the result of management's knowledge of any specific effort to
accumulate shares of Common Stock or to obtain control of the Company by means
of a merger, tender offer, solicitation or otherwise, or part of a plan by
management to adopt a series of anti-takeover provisions. Instead, the Change in
Control purchase feature is a standard term contained in other similar debt
offerings. Change in control provisions are also contained in the Credit
Agreements and other indentures.

If a Change in Control were to occur, there can be no assurance that the
required condition precedent to a Holder's right to require the purchase of the
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities will be
satisfied. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company would have
sufficient funds to pay the required purchase price for all the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities tendered by the
Holders thereof. The Company's ability to purchase the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities tendered upon a Change in Control may
be limited by the terms of its then-existing borrowing and other agreements. The
subordination provisions of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture
and the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture may limit the ability of the
Company to purchase the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt
Securities if an event of default has occurred with respect to the Senior
Indebtedness. See "-- Additional Terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities -- Subordination" and "-- Additional Terms of the Subordinated Debt
Securities -- Subordination."

As of September 30, 1993, approximately $1.7 billion of Specified Bank Debt
was outstanding.

Because the definitions of "Change in Control" and "Acquiring Person"
exclude the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company and certain members of the
Stone family, certain transactions in which such entities and persons
participate as beneficial owners of Common Stock (including, among others, a
leveraged buyout or recapitalization) would not constitute a Change in Control.

Other provisions of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture or the
Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture may be applicable in the event of a
highly leveraged transaction by the Company. See "Description of Debt Securities
- -- Particular Terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities and Subordinated
Debt Securities -- Restrictions on Mergers and Consolidations and Sales of
Assets" and "-- Additional Terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities --
Minimum Net Worth Interest Rate Adjustment." The Board of Directors of the
Company may not unilaterally waive these provisions.

For purposes of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture and the
Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, the definitions of "Change in Control,"
"Acquiring Person," "Continuing Director" and "Specified Bank Debt" have
identical meanings as the definitions used in the Senior Debt Securities
Indenture except for references to the specific Debt Securities being issued and
the applicable Indenture. See "Description of Debt Securities -- Particular
Terms of the Senior Debt Securities -- Certain Definitions."

RESTRICTIONS ON MERGERS AND CONSOLIDATIONS AND SALES OF ASSETS

The Company shall not consolidate with, merge with or into any other
corporation (whether or not the Company shall be the surviving corporation), or
sell, assign, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its properties and
assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to any Person or group of
affiliated Persons, in one transaction or a series of related transactions,
unless: (1) either the Company shall be the continuing Person or the Person (if
other than the Company) formed by such consolidation or with which or into which
the Company is merged or the Person (or group of affiliated Persons) to which
all or substantially all the properties and assets of the Company are sold,
assigned, transferred or leased is a corporation (or constitute corporations)
organized under

43
<PAGE>
the laws of the United States or any State thereof or the District of Columbia
and expressly assumes, by indentures supplemental to the Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities Indenture or the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, as the
case may be, all the obligations of the Company under the Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities, as the case may be, and the
respective Indentures; (2) immediately before and after giving effect to such
transaction or series of related transactions, no Event of Default, and no
Default, with respect to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated
Debt Securities, as the case may be, shall have occurred and be continuing; (3)
immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of related
transactions on a pro forma basis, but prior to any purchase accounting
adjustments resulting from the transaction or series of related transactions,
the Net Worth of the Company (or of the surviving, consolidated or transferee
entity if the Company is not continuing) shall be at least equal to the Net
Worth of the Company immediately before such transaction or series of related
transactions; and (4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such
consolidation, merger or sale, assignment, transfer or lease and such
supplemental indentures comply with the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
Indenture or the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, as the case may be.

EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND NOTICE THEREOF

The following are Events of Default under the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities Indenture or the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, as the case
may be, with respect to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated
Debt Securities of any series: (1) failure to pay interest on any Debt
Securities of that series when due, continued for 30 days; (2) failure to pay
the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Debt Securities of that series
when due and payable at Maturity, upon redemption or otherwise; (3) failure to
observe or perform any other covenant, warranty or agreement contained in the
Debt Securities of that series or in the applicable Indenture (other than a
covenant, agreement or warranty included in the applicable Indenture solely for
the benefit of Debt Securities of a series other than that series), continued
for a period of 60 days after notice has been given to the Company by the
applicable Trustee or Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of
the Outstanding Debt Securities of that series; (4) failure to pay at final
maturity, or acceleration of, Indebtedness of the Company having an aggregate
principal amount of not less than $25 million, unless cured within 15 days after
notice has been given to the Company by the applicable Trustee or Holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of
that series; (5) the entering against the Company of one or more judgments or
decrees involving an aggregate liability of $25 million or more unless vacated,
discharged, satisfied or stayed within 30 days of the entering of such judgments
or decrees; (6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization
relating to the Company; and (7) any other Event of Default with respect to Debt
Securities of that series specified in the Prospectus Supplement relating
thereto.

Both of the applicable Indentures provides that the applicable Trustee
shall, within 30 days after the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
with respect to Debt Securities of any series issued under such Indenture, give
the Holders of Debt Securities of that series notice of all uncured Defaults or
Events of Default known to it (the term "Default" to include the events
specified above without grace or notice); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, EXCEPT in the
case of an Event of Default or a Default in payment on any Debt Securities of
any series, the applicable Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice
if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee or directors
or responsible officers of the applicable Trustee in good faith determine that
the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders of the Debt
Securities of that series.

If an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any series (other than due to
events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization) occurs and is continuing,
the applicable Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of that series, by notice in writing
to the Company (and to the applicable Trustee if given by the Holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of that series),
may declare the unpaid principal of and accrued interest to the date of
acceleration on all the Outstanding Debt Securities of that series to be due and
payable immediately and, upon any such declaration, the Debt Securities of that
series shall become immediately due and payable.

If an Event of Default occurs due to bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization, all unpaid principal (without premium) of and accrued interest
on the Outstanding Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt

44
<PAGE>
Securities of any series IPSO FACTO becomes immediately due and payable without
any declaration or other act on the part of the applicable Trustee or any Holder
of any Senior Subordinated Debt Security or Subordinated Debt Security of that
series.

Any such declaration with respect to Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or
Subordinated Debt Securities of any series may be annulled and past Events of
Default and Defaults (except, unless theretofore cured, an Event of Default or a
Default, in payment of principal of or interest on the Debt Securities of that
series) may be waived by the Holders of a majority of the principal amount of
the Outstanding Debt Securities of that series, upon the conditions provided in
the applicable Indenture.

The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture and the Subordinated Debt
Securities Indenture provide that the Company shall periodically file statements
with the Trustees regarding compliance by the Company with certain of the
respective covenants thereof and shall specify any Event of Default or Defaults
with respect to Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt
Securities of any series, in performing such covenants, of which the signers may
have knowledge.

MODIFICATION OF THE INDENTURES; WAIVER

The Indentures applicable to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities and the
Subordinated Debt Securities may be modified by the Company and the applicable
Trustee without the consent of any Holders with respect to certain matters,
including (i) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or to correct or
supplement any provision which may be inconsistent with any other provision of
the applicable Indenture and (ii) to make any change that does not materially
adversely affect the interests of any Holder of Debt Securities of any series
issued under such Indenture. In addition, under both of the Indentures, certain
rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of Holders of the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities may be modified by
the Company and the applicable Trustee with the written consent of the Holders
of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of each series
affected thereby; but no extension of the maturity of any Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any series, reduction in the
interest rate or extension of the time for payment of interest, change in the
optional redemption or repurchase provisions in a manner adverse to any Holder
of Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any
series issued under the applicable Indenture, other modification in the terms of
payment of the principal of, or interest on, any Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any series, or reduction of the
percentage required for modification, will be effective against any Holder of
any Outstanding Senior Subordinated Debt Security or Subordinated Debt Security
of any series issued under the applicable Indenture and affected thereby without
his consent. Neither of the Indentures limits the aggregate amount of Debt
Securities of the Company which may be issued thereunder.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any
series may on behalf of the Holders of all Debt Securities of that series waive,
insofar as that series is concerned, compliance by the Company with certain
restrictive covenants of the applicable Indenture. The Holders of not less than
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any series may on behalf of
the Holders of all Debt Securities of that series waive any past Event of
Default or Default under the applicable Indenture with respect to that series,
except an Event of Default or a Default in the payment of the principal of, or
premium, if any, or any interest on any Debt Securities of that series or in
respect of a provision which under the applicable Indenture cannot be modified
or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Debt Security
of that series affected.

DEFEASANCE

The Company may terminate its substantive obligations in respect of Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any series
(except for its obligations to pay the principal of (and premium, if any, on)
and the interest on the Debt Securities of that series) by (i) depositing with
the applicable Trustee, under the terms of an irrevocable trust agreement, money
or United States Government Obligations sufficient to pay all remaining
indebtedness on the Debt Securities of that series, (ii) delivering to the
applicable Trustee either an Opinion of Counsel or a ruling directed to the
applicable Trustee from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the
Holders of the Debt Securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or
loss for federal income tax

45
<PAGE>
purposes as a result of such deposit and termination of obligations, and (iii)
complying with certain other requirements set forth in the applicable Indenture.
In addition, the Company may terminate all of its substantive obligations in
respect of Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or the Subordinated Debt
Securities of any series (including its obligations to pay the principal of (and
premium, if any, on) and interest on the Debt Securities of that series) by (i)
depositing with the applicable Trustee, under the terms of an irrevocable trust
agreement, money or United States Government Obligations sufficient to pay all
remaining indebtedness on the Debt Securities of that series, (ii) delivering to
the applicable Trustee either a ruling directed to the applicable Trustee from
the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the Holders of the Debt
Securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal
income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and termination of obligations
or an Opinion of Counsel, based upon such a ruling or a change in the applicable
federal tax law since the date of the applicable Indenture, to such effect, and
(iii) complying with certain other requirements set forth in the applicable
Indenture.

THE TRUSTEES

Norwest Bank Minnesota, National Association, is the Trustee under the
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, and The Bank of New York is the
Trustee under the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture.

The Company maintains normal commercial banking relations with The Bank of
New York, which is also a lender under the Credit Agreements and the Trustee
under the Senior Debt Securities Indenture and other indentures of the Company.
In addition, Norwest Bank Minnesota, National Association, is the trustee of the
indenture relating to the 8 7/8% Convertible Notes.

ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE SENIOR SUBORDINATED
DEBT SECURITIES

The following terms apply solely to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities.
See "Description of Debt Securities -- Particular Terms of the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities and Subordinated Debt Securities" for other terms
which are also applicable to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities. The
particular terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities offered by any
Prospectus Supplement and the extent, if any, to which such general provisions
may apply to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities so offered will be
described in the Prospectus Supplement relating to such Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities.

SUBORDINATION

The payment of the principal of, interest on or any other amounts due on the
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities will be subordinated in right of payment to
the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company. No payment
on account of principal of, redemption of, interest on or any other amounts due
on the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities and no redemption, purchase or other
acquisition of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities may be made unless (i)
full payment of amounts then due for principal, sinking funds, interest
(including interest accruing on or after the filing of any petition in
bankruptcy or for reorganization relating to the Company, whether or not a claim
for such post-petition interest is allowed in such proceeding), penalties,
reimbursement or indemnification amounts, fees and expenses, and of all other
amounts then due on all Senior Indebtedness have been made or duly provided for
pursuant to the terms of the instrument governing such Senior Indebtedness, and
(ii) at the time for, or immediately after giving effect to, any such payment,
redemption, purchase or other acquisition, there shall not exist under any
Senior Indebtedness or any agreement pursuant to which any Senior Indebtedness
has been issued, any default which shall not have been cured or waived and which
shall have resulted in the full amount of such Senior Indebtedness being
declared due and payable. In addition, the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
Indenture provides that if the holders of any Senior Indebtedness notify the
Company and the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Trustee that a default has
occurred giving the holders of such Senior Indebtedness the right to accelerate
the maturity thereof, no payment on account of principal, sinking fund or other
redemption, interest or any other amounts due on the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities and no purchase, redemption or other acquisition of the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities will be made for the period (the "Payment Blockage
Period") commencing on the date notice is received and ending on the earlier of
(A) the date on which such event of default shall have been cured or waived or
(B) 180 days from the date notice is received. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
only one payment blockage notice with respect to the same event of default or
any other events of default existing and known to the person giving such notice
at the time of such notice on the same

46
<PAGE>
issue of Senior Indebtedness may be given during any period of 360 consecutive
days. No new Payment Blockage Period may be commenced by the holders of Senior
Indebtedness during any period of 360 consecutive days unless all events of
default which triggered the preceding Payment Blockage Period have been cured or
waived. The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture provisions described
in this paragraph, however, do not prevent the Company from making a mandatory
redemption payment, if any, with Senior Subordinated Debt Securities acquired
prior to the happening of such a default as described in this paragraph. Upon
any distribution of its assets in connection with any dissolution, winding-up,
liquidation or reorganization of the Company or acceleration of the principal
amount due on the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities because of an Event of
Default, all Senior Indebtedness must be paid in full before the Holders of the
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities are entitled to any payments whatsoever.

The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture does not restrict the
amount of Senior Indebtedness or other indebtedness of the Company or any
subsidiary of the Company, except that the Company may not incur any
Indebtedness which is senior to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities but
subordinate to Senior Indebtedness. As of July 12, 1993, the Company's Senior
Indebtedness aggregated approximately $2.6 billion.

As a result of these subordination provisions, in the event of the Company's
insolvency, holders of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities may recover
ratably less than general creditors of the Company.

The payment of the principal of, interest on or any other amounts due on
Junior Subordinated Indebtedness will be subordinated in right of payment to the
prior payment in full of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities.

The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities are subordinate to the indebtedness
under the Credit Agreements, the Company's 11 7/8% Senior Notes due December 1,
1998 and the 12 5/8% Senior Notes due July 15, 1998 and are senior to the
Company's 13 5/8% Subordinated Notes due June 1, 1995 and its 6 3/4% Convertible
Subordinated Debentures due February 15, 2007. The Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities will rank PARI PASSU in right of payment to all existing and future
Senior Subordinated Indebtedness, including with the Company's outstanding
10 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due June 15, 1997, its 11% Senior Subordinated
Notes due August 15, 1999, the 11 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due September
1, 1999, the 8 7/8% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due July 15, 2000, and
its 10 3/4% Senior Subordinated Debentures due April 1, 2002.

MINIMUM NET WORTH INTEREST RATE ADJUSTMENT

The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture requires that if a series
of Senior Subordinated Debt Securities so provides and if the Company's Net
Worth is below $500 million (the "Minimum Net Worth") as at the end of any two
consecutive fiscal quarters (the last day of the second such fiscal quarter, the
"Failure Date"), then (i) the interest rate on the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities shall be reset as of the first day of the second fiscal quarter
following the Failure Date (the "Reset Date") to a rate per annum (the "Reset
Rate") equal to the greater of (x) the initial interest rate as set forth on the
cover page of the respective Prospectus Supplement (the "Initial Interest Rate")
or (y) the sum of (A) the basis points specified in the respective Prospectus
Supplement for purposes of this reset provision, and (B) the highest of the
treasury rates specified in the respective Prospectus Supplement for purposes of
this reset provision, (ii) on the first Interest Payment Date following the
Reset Date, the interest rate on the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities, as
reset on the Reset Date, shall increase by 50 basis points, and (iii) the
interest rate on the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities shall further increase
by an additional 50 basis points on each succeeding Interest Payment Date.
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing, in no event shall the interest rate
on the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities at any time exceed the Initial
Interest Rate by more than 200 basis points. However, if the Company's Net Worth
is equal to or above the Minimum Net Worth as of the last day of any fiscal
quarter subsequent to the Failure Date, then the interest rate on the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities shall return to the Initial Interest Rate as of the
first day of the second following fiscal quarter. If the Company's Net Worth
shall thereafter be less than the Minimum Net Worth as of the last day of any
two consecutive subsequent fiscal quarters, then the interest rate on the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities shall again be adjusted as provided in this
paragraph.

"NET WORTH" means the amount which, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") consistently applied, would be set forth under
the caption "stockholders' equity" (or any like caption) on the consolidated
balance sheet of the Company, exclusive of amounts attributable to Redeemable
Stock. If the

47
<PAGE>
Company has changed one or more of the accounting principles used in the
preparation of its financial statements, because of a change mandated by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, then Net Worth shall mean the Net Worth
the Company would have had if the Company had continued to use those generally
accepted accounting principles employed at December 31, 1991.

If a Reset Rate has been established for a series of Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities, it will be described in the Prospectus Supplement relating to
such Senior Subordinated Debt Securities.

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture provides that the Company
will not, and will not permit any subsidiary of the Company to, directly or
indirectly, (1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution, in cash or
otherwise, in respect of any shares of capital stock of the Company or to the
holders of capital stock of the Company as such (other than dividends or
distributions payable in shares of capital stock of the Company, other than
Redeemable Stock) or (2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for
value any of the capital stock of the Company or options, warrants or other
rights to acquire any such capital stock, other than acquisitions of capital
stock or such options, warrants or other rights by any Subsidiary of the Company
from the Company (any such transaction included in clause (1) or (2) a
"Restricted Payment") if (i) at the time of such Restricted Payment and after
giving effect thereto, (a) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing with respect to any series of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
or (b) the Net Worth of the Company shall be less than $750 million; or if (ii)
after giving effect to such Restricted Payment, the aggregate amount expended
subsequent to the date of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture for
all such Restricted Payments (the amount of any Restricted Payment, if other
than cash, to be the fair market value of such payment as determined by the
Board of Directors of the Company, whose reasonable determination shall be
conclusive and evidenced by a Board Resolution) exceeds the algebraic sum of (w)
a number calculated as follows: (A) if the aggregate Consolidated Net Income of
the Company earned on a cumulative basis during the period subsequent to June
30, 1993 through the end of the last fiscal quarter that is prior to the
declaration of any such dividend or distribution or the giving of notice of such
purchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement and for which such
financial information is then available, is a positive number, then 100% of such
positive number, and (B) if the aggregate Consolidated Net Income of the Company
earned on a cumulative basis during the period subsequent to June 30, 1993
through the end of the last fiscal quarter that is prior to the declaration of
any such dividend or distribution or the giving of notice of such purchase,
redemption or other acquisition or retirement and for which such financial
information is then available, is a negative number, then 100% of such negative
number, (x) the aggregate net cash proceeds received by the Company from the
issuance and sale, other than to a subsidiary of the Company, subsequent to the
date of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, of capital stock
(including capital stock issued upon the conversion of, or in exchange for,
securities other than capital stock and options, warrants or other rights to
acquire capital stock, but excluding Redeemable Stock), (y) the aggregate net
cash proceeds received by the Company from the issuance and sale, other than to
a subsidiary of the Company, of Indebtedness of the Company that is converted
into capital stock of the Company subsequent to the date of the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, and (z) $300 million; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that the retirement of any shares of the Company's capital stock by exchange
for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of, other
shares of capital stock of the Company other than Redeemable Stock shall not
constitute a Restricted Payment. If all of the conditions to the declaration of
a dividend or distribution that are described above are satisfied at the time
such dividend or distribution is declared, then such dividend or distribution
may be paid or made within sixty days after such declaration even if the payment
of such dividend, the making of such distribution or the declaration thereof
would not have been permitted at any time after such declaration.

"CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME" of the Company means, for any period for which the
determination thereof is to be made, the net income (or loss) of the Company and
its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for such period taken as a single
accounting period, determined in accordance with GAAP; PROVIDED that there shall
be excluded therefrom (i) the net income (or loss) of any person (a "joint
venture") in which any other person (other than the Company or any of its
subsidiaries) has a joint equity interest, except to the extent of the amount of
dividends or other distributions actually paid to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries by such joint venture during such period, (ii) except to the extent
includable pursuant to the foregoing clause (i), the net income (or loss) of any
person accrued prior to the date it becomes a subsidiary of the Company or is
merged into or consolidated with the

48
<PAGE>
Company or any of its subsidiaries or that person's assets are acquired by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) the net income of any subsidiary of
the Company to the extent that the declaration or payment of dividends or
similar distributions by that subsidiary of that income is not at the time
permitted by operation of the terms of its charter or any agreement, instrument,
judgment, decree, order, statute, rule or governmental regulation applicable to
that subsidiary, and (iv) the excess (but not the deficit), if any, of (x) any
gain which must be treated as an extraordinary item under GAAP or any gain
realized upon the sale or other disposition of any asset that is not sold in the
ordinary course of business or of any capital stock of the Company or a
subsidiary of the Company over (y) any loss which must be treated as an
extraordinary item under GAAP or any loss realized upon the sale or other
disposition of any asset that is not sold in the ordinary course of business or
of any capital stock of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company.

ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES

The following terms apply solely to the Subordinated Debt Securities. See
"Description of Debt Securities -- Particular Terms of the Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities and Subordinated Debt Securities" for other terms which are also
applicable to the Subordinated Debt Securities. The particular terms of the
Subordinated Debt Securities offered by any Prospectus Supplement and the
extent, if any, to which such general provisions may apply to the Subordinated
Debt Securities so offered will be described in the Prospectus Supplement
relating to such Subordinated Debt Securities.

SUBORDINATION

The payment of the principal of, interest on or any other amounts due on the
Subordinated Debt Securities will be subordinated in right of payment to the
prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness and Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Company. No payment on account of principal of, redemption
of, interest on or any other amounts due on the Subordinated Debt Securities and
no redemption, purchase or other acquisition of the Subordinated Debt Securities
may be made unless (i) full payment of amounts then due for principal, sinking
funds, interest (including interest accruing on or after the filing of any
petition in bankruptcy or for reorganization relating to the Company, whether or
not a claim for such post-petition interest is allowed in such proceeding),
penalties, reimbursement or indemnification amounts, fees and expenses, and of
all other amounts then due on all Senior Indebtedness and Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness have been made or duly provided for pursuant to the terms of the
instrument governing such Senior Indebtedness or Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness, and (ii) at the time for, or immediately after giving effect to,
any such payment, redemption, purchase or other acquisition, there shall not
exist under any Senior Indebtedness, Senior Subordinated Indebtedness or any
agreements pursuant to which any Senior Indebtedness or Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness has been issued, any default which shall not have been cured or
waived and which shall have resulted in the full amount of such Senior
Indebtedness or Senior Subordinated Indebtedness being declared due and payable.
In addition, the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture provides that if the
Holders of any Senior Indebtedness or Senior Subordinated Indebtedness notify
the Company and the Subordinated Debt Securities Trustee that a default has
occurred giving the holders of such Senior Indebtedness or Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness the right to accelerate the maturity thereof, no payment on account
of principal, sinking fund or other redemption, interest or any other amounts
due on the Subordinated Debt Securities and no purchase, redemption or other
acquisition of the Subordinated Debt Securities will be made for the period (the
"Subordinated Payment Blockage Period") commencing on the date notice is
received and ending on the earlier of (A) the date on which such event of
default shall have been cured or waived or (B) 270 days from the date notice is
received. Notwithstanding the foregoing, only one payment blockage notice with
respect to the same event of default or any other events of default existing and
known to the person giving such notice at the time of such notice on the same
issue of Senior Indebtedness or Senior Subordinated Indebtedness may be given
during any period of 360 consecutive days. No new Subordinated Payment Blockage
Period may be commenced by the holders of Senior Indebtedness or Senior
Subordinated Indebtedness during any period of 360 consecutive days unless all
events of default which triggered the preceding Subordinated Payment Blockage
Period have been cured or waived. The Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture
provisions described in this paragraph, however, do not prevent the Company from
making a mandatory redemption payment, if any, with Subordinated Debt Securities
acquired prior to the happening of such a default as described in this
paragraph. Upon any distribution of its assets in connection with any
dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization of the Company or
acceleration of the

49
<PAGE>
principal amount due on the Subordinated Debt Securities because of an Event of
Default, all Senior Indebtedness and Senior Subordinated Indebtedness must be
paid in full before the Holders of the Subordinated Debt Securities are entitled
to any payments whatsoever.

As a result of these subordination provisions, in the event of the Company's
insolvency, holders of the Subordinated Debt Securities may recover ratably less
than general creditors of the Company.

The Subordinated Debt Securities are subordinate in right of payment to all
existing and future Senior Indebtedness and Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of
the Company, including the indebtedness under the Credit Agreements, the
Company's 11 7/8% Senior Notes due December 1, 1998, its 12 5/8% Senior Notes
due July 15, 1998, its 10 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due June 15, 1997, its
11% Senior Subordinated Notes due August 15, 1999, its 11 1/2% Senior
Subordinated Notes due September 1, 1999, its 8 7/8% Convertible Senior
Subordinated Notes due July 15, 2000 and its 10 3/4% Senior Subordinated
Debentures due April 1, 2002. The Subordinated Debt Securities will rank PARI
PASSU upon liquidation with the Company's 13 5/8% Subordinated Notes due June 1,
1995 and its 6 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due February 15, 2007.

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK

THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY
ARE SUBJECT TO THE DETAILED PROVISIONS OF THE COMPANY'S CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION, AS AMENDED (THE "CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION"), INCLUDING THE
CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS FOR EACH OF THE SERIES E CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE
EXCHANGEABLE PREFERRED STOCK (THE "SERIES E PREFERRED STOCK") AND THE SERIES F
CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE EXCHANGEABLE PREFERRED STOCK (THE "SERIES F PREFERRED
STOCK") AND BY-LAWS, AS AMENDED (THE "BY-LAWS"). THESE STATEMENTS DO NOT PURPORT
TO BE COMPLETE, OR TO GIVE FULL EFFECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF STATUTORY OR COMMON
LAW, AND ARE SUBJECT TO, AND ARE QUALIFIED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO,
THE TERMS OF THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, THE CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS
OF EACH OF THE SERIES E AND SERIES F PREFERRED STOCK AND THE BY-LAWS.

GENERAL

The Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of a total of 210
million shares of all classes of stock, of which 10 million may be shares of
preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, and 200 million may be shares of the
Common Stock, par value $.01 per share. At July 13, 1993, approximately 71.2
million shares of Common Stock were outstanding. The Certificate of
Incorporation authorizes the Company's Board of Directors, without first
obtaining approval of the holders of Common Stock or any series of preferred
stock, to provide for the issuance of any or all shares of the preferred stock
in one or more series, and to fix the voting powers, full or limited, and the
designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special
rights, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, applicable
to the shares to be included in any such series as may be permitted by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. As of the date hereof, 4.6
million shares of Series E Preferred Stock are outstanding. In addition, 2
million shares of Series D Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.01
per share, of the Company (the "Series D Preferred Stock") have been authorized
and reserved for issuance in connection with the Series D Rights described below
and up to 400,000 shares of Series F Preferred Stock have been authorized and
reserved for issuance upon the occurrence of certain specified events described
in "Series F Preferred Stock" below.

COMMON STOCK

DIVIDEND RIGHTS

Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of the Company's
preferred stock which may at the time be outstanding, holders of the Common
Stock are entitled to receive, to the extent permitted by law, such dividends as
may be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors out of funds legally
available therefor.

VOTING RIGHTS

Each holder of Common Stock is entitled to one vote for each share of Common
Stock registered in such holder's name on the books of the Company on all
matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Except as otherwise provided by
law, the holders of shares of the Common Stock vote as one class. The holders of
shares of the Common Stock have cumulative voting rights under the Certificate
of Incorporation such that in all elections for directors, each holder entitled
to vote thereat is entitled to as many votes as is equal to the number of votes
which

50
<PAGE>
such holder would be entitled to cast for the election of directors with respect
to such holder's shares multiplied by the number of directors to be elected, and
such holder may cast all of such votes for a single director or may distribute
them among any two or more of them as such holder may see fit.

LIQUIDATION RIGHTS AND OTHER PROVISIONS

The Company has granted its lenders security interests in a substantial
portion of the Company's assets under the Credit Agreements and other debt
agreements. See "Credit Agreements." Subject to the prior rights of creditors
and the holders of any preferred stock which may be outstanding from time to
time, the holders of the Common Stock are entitled to share PRO RATA in the
distribution of any remaining assets in the event of liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company. The shares of Common Stock are not liable to any
calls or assessments and have no conversion rights or redemption or sinking fund
provisions. The Transfer Agent and Registrar for the Common Stock is The First
National Bank of Chicago.

CHANGE IN CONTROL

The Certificate of Incorporation and the Rights Agreement dated July 25,
1988, as amended (the "Rights Agreement"), between the Company and First Chicago
Trust Company of New York, as Rights Agent, contain certain provisions
(described below) that could make more difficult or discourage a change in
control of the Company. Such provisions are designed to discourage situations in
which the Company is forced to accept a proposal for the takeover of the Company
without ample time to evaluate the proposal and appropriate alternatives and to
encourage anyone contemplating a business combination with the Company to
negotiate directly with the Company on a fair and equitable basis.

SERIES D RIGHTS

Each share of Common Stock has associated with it one preferred share
purchase right (the "Series D Right") permitting the holder to purchase
approximately one-hundredth of a share of the Company's Series D Preferred Stock
at an exercise price of $130 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The
terms of the Series D Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement dated as of
July 25, 1988, as amended, between the Company and The First National Bank of
Chicago, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement").

The Series D Rights are not exercisable and are transferable only with the
related Common Stock certificates. The Series D Rights become exercisable and
separately transferable ten days after a person or group (excluding certain
entities including members of the Stone family) acquires 15% or more of the
outstanding shares of the Common Stock or ten business days after a person or
group (excluding certain entities including members of the Stone family)
announces a tender offer or exchange offer that would, if completed, result in
ownership by such person or group of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of
the Common Stock. Thereafter, the Series D Rights will trade separately from the
Common Stock.

After the Series D Rights become exercisable, if a person or group
(excluding certain entities including members of the Stone family) acquires 15%
or more of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock and the Company is
acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction, each Series D
Right will entitle its holder (other than the acquiring person or group) to
purchase, at the Series D Right's then-current exercise price, a number of the
acquiring company's shares of common stock having a market value at that time of
twice the Series D Right's then-current exercise price. In addition, in the
event that a person or group (excluding certain entities including members of
the Stone family) acquires 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the Common
Stock, each holder of a Series D Right (other than the acquiring person or
group) will be entitled to purchase the number of shares of the Common Stock
having a market value of twice the then-current exercise price of the Series D
Right.

Under certain circumstances, the Series D Rights may be redeemed at a price
of $.01 per Series D Right. The Series D Rights will expire in August 1998,
unless earlier redeemed by the Company.

The Rights Agreement generally provides that a Series D Right will be issued
in connection with each share of Common Stock (i) issued prior to the earliest
of the Distribution Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement) or the redemption,
exchange or expiration of the Series D Rights or (ii) issued at certain other
times pursuant to certain options, warrants or convertible securities.

51
<PAGE>
SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENTS

The Certificate of Incorporation provides that the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors (the "Voting Stock") is required to authorize (a) any merger or
consolidation of the Company with or into any other corporation (other than a
Subsidiary of the Company) or (b) the sale (other than to the Company or its
Subsidiaries) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. For purposes of the foregoing paragraph, a
"Subsidiary" is any corporation more than 50% of the voting securities of which
are owned by the Company.

SERIES E PREFERRED STOCK

There are 4.6 million shares of Series E Preferred Stock authorized and
outstanding on the date hereof. The Series E Preferred Stock is entitled to
cumulative cash preferential dividends of $1.75 per share, per annum, payable
quarterly, and has a liquidation preference of $25 per share plus accrued and
unpaid dividends. Unless full cumulative dividends on the Series E Preferred
Stock have been paid or payment has been provided for, no dividends (other than
dividends in shares of Common Stock or other capital stock ranking junior to the
Series E Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends) shall be paid or declared
and set aside for payment or other distribution made upon the Common Stock or
any other capital stock of the Company ranking junior or on a parity with the
Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends.

The Series E Preferred Stock is exchangeable, in whole but not in part, at
the option of the Company, on any dividend date commencing February 15, 1994,
for the Company's 7% Convertible Subordinated Exchange Debentures due February
15, 2007 (the "Exchange Debentures") at an exchange rate of $25 principal amount
of Exchange Debentures for each share of Series E Preferred Stock so exchanged.
The Exchange Debentures entitle the holders thereof to convert the Exchange
Debentures into shares of Common Stock.

The Series E Preferred Stock is redeemable by the Company, in whole but not
in part, on and after February 16, 1996, at $26.50 per share, if redeemed during
the 12 month period commencing February 15, 1996, and thereafter at prices
declining to $25 per share on and after February 15, 2002, together with accrued
and unpaid dividends to the date of redemption. The Series E Preferred Stock,
unless previously exchanged or redeemed by the Company, is convertible at the
option of the holder thereof at any time into shares of Common Stock at a
conversion price of $33.94 per share (as of the date hereof), subject to
adjustment under certain conditions.

If the Company fails to pay any six quarterly dividends on the Series E
Preferred Stock, then the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock, voting
together as a class with all other outstanding classes or series of preferred
stock ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock and
entitled to vote thereon, have the right to elect two directors to be added to
the Company's Board of Directors. Such voting rights continue until all
dividends in arrears on such stock have been paid or provided for. Without the
approval of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred
Stock, the Company may not issue any capital stock ranking senior to the Series
E Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends or in distribution of assets upon
liquidation or make any change which adversely affects the preferences, rights
or powers of the Series E Preferred Stock.

SERIES F PREFERRED STOCK

The Company has authorized 400,000 shares of Series F Preferred Stock, no
shares of which have been issued or are outstanding on the date hereof. The
terms of the Series F Preferred Stock are identical to the terms of the Series E
Preferred Stock, except with respect to the amount of dividend and dividend
payment dates, the liquidation preference, the optional redemption schedule and
redemption prices, the conversion rate at which Series F Preferred Stock may be
converted into shares of Common Stock and the exchange rate at which Series F
Preferred Stock may be exchanged by the Company for Exchange Debentures.

The Series F Preferred Stock, if issued, will be entitled to cumulative cash
preferential dividends of $7 per share, per annum, payable quarterly, will have
a liquidation preference of $100 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends,
will rank on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock with respect to rights
to receive dividends and distributions upon liquidation and has identical voting
rights as the Series E Preferred Stock. The Series F Preferred Stock is
exchangeable for the Company's Exchange Debentures which in turn are convertible
into shares of Common Stock.

52
<PAGE>
The Series F Preferred Stock will be redeemable by the Company, in whole but
not in part, on and after 48 months from the date of issuance, at $104.20 per
share, if redeemed during the 12 month period commencing on such date, and
thereafter at prices declining to $100 per share on and after the 120th month
from issuance, together with accrued and unpaid dividends to the date of
redemption. The Series F Preferred Stock will be convertible at the option of
the holder thereof at any time into shares of Common Stock at a conversion rate
of 5.4283 shares of Common Stock per share of Series F Preferred Stock (as of
the date hereof), subject to adjustment under certain conditions.

The Company has entered into an agreement with Venezolana de Pulpa y Papel
("Venepal"), a Venezuelan pulp and paper company, whereby Venepal's investment
in the Celgar pulp mill represented by 50% of the outstanding common stock of
Stone Venepal (Celgar) Pulp Inc. ("SVCPI") can be exchanged for shares of Series
F Preferred Stock. The exchange would occur at Venepal's option as a result of
certain specific conditions relating to operations of the Celgar pulp mill,
which is 50% owned by SVCPI. The Company may at its option elect to honor the
exchange obligation with a cash payment to Venepal. Based upon Venepal's initial
investment in SVCPI, 212,903 shares of Series F Preferred Stock would be
issuable in the event Venepal was eligible to exercise, and did exercise, its
option. The number of shares issuable to Venepal upon exchange is to be
determined based upon (i) the value of Venepal's investment in SVCPI at the time
of such exchange and (ii) the market price of the Common Stock at the time of
such exchange.

PROSPECTUS SUMMARY

THIS SUMMARY IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY THE DETAILED INFORMATION AND
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDING THE NOTES THERETO, APPEARING ELSEWHERE OR
INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT AND IN THE ACCOMPANYING
PROSPECTUS. PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FACTORS SET

THE COMPANY

GENERAL

The Company is a major international pulp and paper company engaged
principally in the production and sale of paper, packaging products, and
commodity pulp. The Company believes that it is the world's largest producer of
unbleached containerboard and kraft paper and the world's largest converter of
those products. The Company also believes that it is one of the largest paper
companies in terms of annual tonnage produced. The Company produced 5.0 million
tons and 4.9 million tons of unbleached containerboard and kraft paper in 1992
and 1991, respectively, which accounted for approximately 66% of its total
tonnage produced for both 1992 and 1991. The Company had net sales of
approximately $5.5 billion and $5.4 billion in 1992 and 1991, respectively.

The Company has increased dramatically in size over the past ten years,
primarily through four major acquisitions, including the 1989 acquisition of
Consolidated-Bathurst Inc. (a Canadian corporation, now renamed Stone Container
(Canada) Inc. ("Stone Canada")), and several smaller acquisitions. The
acquisition of Stone Canada increased the Company's market share in its core
business operations and provided the Company with the opportunity to pursue its
strategy to expand its production capacity and sales in international markets.
The Company owns or has an interest in 136 manufacturing facilities in the
United States, 27 in Canada, 15 in Germany, five in France, two in Belgium and
one in each of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The facilities include 24
mills. The Company also maintains sales offices in the United States, Canada,
the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, France, China and Japan.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

PROGRESS OF FINANCIAL PLAN

In 1993, the Company adopted a financial plan designed to enhance the
Company's liquidity, reduce amortization under certain bank credit agreements of
the Company and Stone Canada (the "Credit Agreements") and improve financial
flexibility. The Company completed a major portion of its financial plan during
1993 resulting in net proceeds to the Company and Stone Canada of approximately
$1.0 billion which the Company and Stone Canada used to repay indebtedness under
the Credit Agreements and fund operating losses and working capital needs. These
repayments satisfied the remaining September 1993 amortization of approximately
$118 million, the full 1994 amortization of approximately $409 million and
approximately $21 million of the March 1995 amortization under the Credit
Agreements. The Company had as of January 5, 1994 $60.0 million available for
borrowing out of a total revolving credit commitment of $315.8 million.

The transactions completed in 1993 were as follows:

- the sale in June, 1993 of $150 million of the Company's 12 5/8%
Senior Notes due 1998 and a concurrent private sale of $250
million principal amount of 8 7/8% Convertible Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2000.

- the public offerings in December 1993 by Stone-Consolidated
Corporation, a newly created Canadian subsidiary
("Stone-Consolidated"), of Cdn. $231 million of its common stock
(representing 25.4% of its outstanding common stock), Cdn. $231
million of its 8% Convertible Unsecured Subordinated Debentures
due 2003 and $225 million of its 10.25% Senior Secured Notes due
2000 (the "Stone-Consolidated Transaction"). Stone-Consolidated
now owns all of the Canadian and U.K. newsprint and groundwood
paper assets of the Company. The net proceeds paid by
Stone-Consolidated to the Company and Stone Canada in connection
with these offerings approximated $490 million.

S-3
<PAGE>
- the sale of the Company's 49% equity interest in Empaques de
Carton Titan, S.A., a Mexican corrugated container company
("Titan"), two of the Company's short line railroads and a
specialty packaging plant in Sheridan, Arkansas. The proceeds of
these three transactions approximated $125 million.

In connection with the completion of the Stone-Consolidated Transaction, the
Company also received approval from its bank group to extend the maturity date
of its revolving credit facilities from March 1, 1994 to March 1, 1997.

The final stages of the Company's current financial plan are as follows:

- the Offerings, from which the Company expects to use the net
proceeds to (i) prepay approximately $403 million of the remaining
1995 and March 1996 required amortization under the Credit
Agreements (including amortization payments under the Company's
revolving credit facilities reducing the total commitments
thereunder to approximately $224 million); (ii) redeem at par
approximately $98 million plus accrued interest of the Company's
13 5/8% Subordinated Notes due 1995; and (iii) repay
approximately $200 million of the borrowings under the Company's
revolving credit facilities without reducing the commitments
thereunder (or to the extent no borrowings are outstanding, the
Company may retain the balance in cash).

- the completion of a transaction involving a favorable energy
supply agreement relating to the Company's mill in Florence, South
Carolina. The proceeds of this transaction are subject to the
execution of definitive documentation and regulatory approval.
The gross proceeds of this transaction, which are currently
expected to be approximately $100 million, would be utilized to
repay borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities
without reducing commitments thereunder (or to the extent no
borrowings are outstanding, the Company may retain the balance in
cash). There can be no assurance, however, that this transaction
will be consummated or that the expected amount of proceeds from
such transaction will be received.

The completion of the Offerings will provide the Company with the following
benefits:

- repayment of all major amortization through the end of 1995
(except for revolving credit facilities relating to receivables
financings which the Company intends to extend or refinance).

- improvement of the Company's liquidity by repaying borrowings
under the revolving credit facility by $200 million (or to the
extent no borrowings are outstanding, the Company may retain the
balance in cash). As of January 5, 1994, the Company had $60.0
million available for borrowing out of a total revolving credit
commitment of $315.8 million.

- improvement of the Company's financial flexibility through
amendments to the Credit Agreements (see "-- Amendments to Credit
Agreements").

PRODUCTS AND INDUSTRY TRENDS

The markets for products sold by the Company are highly competitive and are
also sensitive to cyclical changes in industry capacity and in the economy, both
of which can significantly influence selling prices and thereby the Company's
profitability. Although the Company has experienced declining product pricing in
all of its product lines over the last several years, the Company believes that
market conditions are present which should permit the Company to realize
improved product pricing in most of its product lines.

The Company implemented a $25 per ton price increase for linerboard
effective October 1, 1993, which raised the transaction price for the base grade
of linerboard to $325 per ton. This increase will not, however, restore prices
for linerboard to the levels present at the beginning of 1993. In addition, the
Company is in the process of final implementation of a corrugated container
price increase. The Company currently expects final implementation to occur in
the first quarter of 1994. As a result of strengthening demand, the Company
announced a further price increase of $30 per ton for linerboard effective in
January 1994. While the Company currently believes that it will implement this
price increase in the early part of 1994, there is little likelihood of
achieving the increase in January

S-4
<PAGE>
1994. There can be no assurance that prices will continue to increase or even be
maintained at present levels, but the Company believes the demand for linerboard
and the converted products produced from linerboard are increasing.

Pricing conditions for newsprint and groundwood paper have been volatile in
recent years. While the industry successfully implemented a price increase in
1992, efforts to maintain an additional price increase in 1993 were
unsuccessful. In 1993, Stone-Consolidated and other industry participants
attempted to balance supply and demand by taking downtime at selected production
facilities. Stone-Consolidated announced a $47.50 per metric ton price increase
for newsprint effective March 1, 1994 in light of recent industry improvements
in supply and demand characteristics. Other major North American producers have
announced similar price increases. There is no assurance, however, that such
price increases will be achieved as scheduled or at all.

Market pulp has also experienced volatile pricing in recent years. The
Company announced a price increase of $40 to $80 per ton in the various grades
of market pulp effective January 1, 1994 in light of improved supply and demand
characteristics in the industry. There is, however, significant world-wide
competition in this product line and no assurances can be given that such price
increases will be realized or maintained.

OPERATING PERFORMANCE

The Company will report a net loss for the full year 1993, which loss will
be greater than the loss incurred for 1992. The Company anticipates that the net
loss for the fourth quarter of 1993 will be within the expectations of paper
industry analysts. The losses incurred in 1993 and in the previous two years had
a severe negative impact on the Company's liquidity. The Company believes,
however, that the implementation of its financial plan significantly improves
the Company's liquidity. As of January 5, 1994, available borrowings under the
Company's revolving credit facilities were $60.0 million and upon consummation
of the Offerings, the Company's cash and available borrowings under such
facilities are expected to increase by approximately $200 million.

The Company believes that demand for its products has recently increased.
Production of linerboard for October and November 1993 versus the similar period
in 1992 increased 9%. The Company also increased its sales of corrugated
products (measured in terms of footage sold) by 4.5% for October and November
1993 versus the similar period in 1992. The production of newsprint and
groundwood papers increased by 2.6% for October and November 1993 versus the
similar period in 1992. Production of market pulp, however, declined 5.1% for
the comparable period.

AMENDMENTS TO CREDIT AGREEMENTS

In connection with the Offerings, the Company is seeking amendments to the
Credit Agreements. The amendments, which are conditional upon the consummation
of the Offerings and the prepayment of a minimum of $385 million under the
Credit Agreements, contain the following provisions:

- Permit the repayment of borrowings under the revolving credit
facilities without reducing the commitments thereunder (or to the
extent no borrowings are outstanding, the Company may retain the
balance in cash) of up to $200 million with a portion of the net
proceeds from the Offerings.

- Permit the redemption of the Company's 13 5/8% Subordinated
Notes due 1995 with a portion of the net proceeds from the Common
Stock Offering.

S-5
<PAGE>
- Amend the EBITDA (as defined under the Credit Agreements)
covenant to require the Company to meet the following minimum
EBITDA levels:

<TABLE>
<S> <C> <C>
For the quarter ended 3/31/94............................... $ 20 million
For the two quarters ended 6/30/94.......................... $ 55 million
For the three quarters ended 9/30/94........................ $111 million
For the four quarters ended 12/31/94........................ $180 million
For the four quarters ended 3/31/95......................... $226 million
For the four quarters ended 6/30/95......................... $300 million
For the four quarters ended 9/30/95......................... $380 million
For the four quarters ended 12/31/95........................ $457 million
For the four quarters ended 3/31/96......................... $567 million
For the four quarters ended 6/30/96......................... $657 million
For the four quarters ended 9/30/96......................... $735 million
and each four quarter period thereafter..................... $822 million
</TABLE>

- Replace the existing cross-default provisions relating to
obligations of $10 million or more
of the Company's separately financed subsidiaries, Seminole Kraft
Corporation ("Seminole Kraft") and Stone Savannah River Pulp &
Paper Corporation, ("Stone Savannah") with cross-acceleration
provisions.

- Reset to zero as of January 1, 1994 the "dividend basket" under
the Credit Agreements which permits payment of dividends on the
Company's capital stock. The dividend basket under the Credit
Agreements as of September 30, 1993 had a deficit amount of
$334.1 million. On an ongoing basis, the dividend basket would be
increased by (a) 100% (rather than the current 50%) of the cash
proceeds of sales of Common Stock (other than proceeds of the
Common Stock Offering, for which no dividend credit would be
received) and permitted preferred stock and (b) 75% (rather than
the current 50%) of Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the
Credit Agreements) from January 1, 1994 and would be decreased by
100% of Consolidated Net Losses (as defined) from January 1,
1994. Additionally, restrictions with respect to dividends on the
Series E Preferred Stock would be modified to mirror the dividend
restrictions in the Company's Senior Subordinated Indenture dated
as of March 15, 1992. This should permit a higher dividend basket
for payment of dividends on the Series E Preferred Stock. See
"Description of Debt Securities -- Additional Terms of the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities -- Dividend Restrictions" in the
accompanying Prospectus.

- Replace the current prohibition of investments in Stone Venepal
(Celgar) Pulp Inc. with restrictions substantially similar to the
restrictions applicable to the Company's subsidiaries, Stone
Savannah and Seminole Kraft.

For a more complete description of the Credit Agreements, see "Credit
Agreements" in the accompanying Prospectus.

THE OFFERING OF NOTES

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Securities Offered.................. $500,000,000 principal amount of % Senior Notes due
, 2001 (the "Notes").
Interest Payment Dates.............. Interest on the Notes will be payable and ,
commencing , 1994.
Optional Redemption................. The Notes are redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole
or from time to time in part, on and after , 1999, at
the redemption prices set forth herein, together with accrued
and unpaid interest. See "Certain Terms of the Notes."
</TABLE>

S-6
<PAGE>
<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Change of Control................... Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the
accompanying Prospectus), the Company is required to offer to
repurchase each Holder's Notes at a purchase price equal to
101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to the date of repurchase. If such
repurchase would constitute an event of default under Specified
Bank Debt (as defined), then, prior to making such repurchase
offer, the Company is required to (i) repay in full in cash
such Specified Bank Debt or (ii) obtain the requisite consent
of lenders of such Specified Bank Debt to permit the repurchase
of Notes without giving rise to an event of default under such
Specified Bank Debt. Such Change of Control provisions in and
of themselves may not afford holders of the Notes protection in
the event of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization,
restructuring, merger or similar transaction involving the
Company that may adversely affect such holders if such
transaction is not the type of transaction included within the
definition of Change of Control. A transaction involving
specified Stone family members or their affiliates will result
in a Change of Control only if it is the type of transaction
specified by such definition. See "Description of Debt
Securities -- Change of Control" in the accompanying
Prospectus. There can be no assurance that the Company would
have sufficient funds to pay the required purchase price for
all Notes tendered by the Holders in the event of a Change of
Control. Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor the
trustee under the Indenture relating to the Notes may waive the
Change of Control provisions.
Ranking............................. The Notes will rank PARI PASSU in right of payment with all
existing and future Senior Indebtedness (as defined) of the
Company and senior in right of payment and in rights upon
liquidation to all existing and future Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Company. Obligations of the Company's
Subsidiaries (as defined), however, will represent prior claims
with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries.
See "Description of Debt Securities -- Ranking" in the
accompanying Prospectus.
Limitation on Future Liens.......... If the Company or any Subsidiary shall permit the existence of
any Lien (as defined) upon any of its respective assets as
security for (i) any Indebtedness (as defined) or other
obligation of the Company that ranks PARI PASSU with the Notes
or any Indebtedness or other obligation of a Subsidiary of the
Company, the Company will secure or will cause such Subsidiary
to guarantee and secure the outstanding Notes equally and
ratably with such Indebtedness or other obligation or (ii) any
Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined), the Company will secure
the outstanding Notes prior to such Subordinated Indebtedness;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the foregoing shall not apply to
certain specified Liens, including Liens to secure any
Indebtedness under the Credit Agreements, which Indebtedness is
currently secured by Liens on a substantial portion of the
assets of the Company and Stone-Consolidated and on stock of
various of the Company's Subsidiaries.
</TABLE>

S-7
<PAGE>
<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Limitation on Future Guaranties..... Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary (including Stone
Savannah and Seminole Kraft) will guarantee Indebtedness;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the foregoing shall not apply to
certain specified guaranties, including guaranties in a
principal amount up to the principal amount outstanding or
committed under the Credit Agreements as of the date of the
Indenture, plus $250 million, less the proceeds from the sale
of Debt Securities (as defined) issued from time to time that
are applied to repay Indebtedness under the Credit Agreements.

certain proceeds of certain Asset Dispositions (as defined) by
the Company or its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined), (ii)
restricts the ability of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
subject to certain exceptions, to pay dividends or make
distributions with respect to shares of the Company's Capital
Stock (as defined) or acquire or retire Capital Stock of the
Company, (iii) subject to certain significant exceptions,
restricts the ability of the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries to create, incur or guarantee Indebtedness and
(iv) requires the Company to make certain offers to repurchase
Debt Securities in the event that the Company's Subordinated
Capital Base (as defined) is less than a specified level. See
"Description of Debt Securities -- Certain Covenants."
Use of Proceeds..................... The net proceeds will be used to repay indebtedness of the
Company and for general corporate purposes. See "Use of

RISK FACTORS

BEFORE INVESTING, PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS OF THE NOTES SHOULD CAREFULLY
CONSIDER THE RISK FACTORS SET FORTH BELOW AND THE OTHER INFORMATION SET FORTH
AND INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE IN THIS PROSPECTUS SUPPLEMENT AND THE ACCOMPANYING
PROSPECTUS.

SIGNIFICANT LEVERAGE AND DEBT SERVICE REQUIREMENTS; LIMITED LIQUIDITY

The Company is significantly leveraged and will continue to be so after
completion of the Offerings. The Company's long-term debt to total
capitalization ratio was 74.3% at September 30, 1993. On a pro forma basis,
after giving effect to the Stone-Consolidated Transaction, the sale of the
Company's 49% equity interest in Titan and the sale by the Company of its
interest in two short line railroads (the "1993 Fourth Quarter Transactions")
and the Offerings, and the use of the estimated net proceeds therefrom, such
ratio at September 30, 1993 would have been approximately 71.8%. Capitalization,
for purposes of this ratio, includes long-term debt, deferred income taxes,
redeemable preferred stock, minority interests and stockholders' equity. Giving
effect to the 1993 Fourth Quarter Transactions and the Offerings, the amounts of
long-term debt (excluding capitalized lease obligations) outstanding at
September 30, 1993 maturing during the next five years and thereafter are as
follows:

- ------------------------------
(1) Includes indebtedness of Stone Savannah, Seminole Kraft and
Stone-Consolidated. See "-- Credit Agreement Restrictions."
(2) The 1995 maturities include $261.3 million outstanding under Stone
Financial Corporation's and Stone Fin II Receivables Corporation's
revolving credit facilities, which the Company intends to extend or
refinance.
</TABLE>

The Company's income before interest expense and income taxes was
insufficient to cover interest expense for the nine months ended September 30,
1993 and 1992 and for the year ended December 31, 1992 by $346.8 million, $135.9
million and $229.3 million, respectively, and will continue to be insufficient
for at least 1994.

The Company's liquidity and financial flexibility is adversely affected by
continued losses which have resulted in utilization of a significant portion of
its revolving credit facilities (for which the borrowing availability was $60.0
million as of January 5, 1994). The net proceeds from the Offerings will be used
to (i) prepay approximately $403 million of the remaining 1995 and March 1996
required amortization under the Credit Agreements; (ii) redeem at par
approximately $98 million plus accrued interest of the Company's 13 5/8%
Subordinated Notes due 1995; and (iii) repay approximately $200 million of the
borrowings under the Company's revolving credit facilities without reducing the
commitments thereunder (or to the extent no borrowings are outstanding, the
Company may retain the balance in cash). See "Use of Proceeds." The Company is
also expecting to improve its liquidity and financial flexibility through a
transaction involving a favorable energy supply agreement relating to its mill
in Florence, South Carolina, the net proceeds of which would be applied to repay
borrowings under the revolving credit facilities without reducing commitments
thereunder (or to the extent no borrowings are outstanding, the Company may
retain the balance in cash). There can be no assurance, however, that this
transaction will be consummated or that the expected amount of proceeds from
such transaction will be received.

Notwithstanding the improvements in the Company's liquidity and financial
flexibility which will result from the Offerings and which would result from the
proposed energy supply contract transaction, unless the Company achieves
sustained price increases beyond current levels (including announced price
increases which have not yet been fully implemented as described under
"Prospectus Summary -- Recent Developments -- Products and

S-10
<PAGE>
Industry Trends"), the Company will continue to incur net losses and a deficit
in net cash provided by operating activities. Without such sustained price
increases, the Company may exhaust all or substantially all of its cash
resources and borrowing availability under the revolving credit facilities. In
such event, the Company would be required to pursue other alternatives to
improve liquidity, including further cost reductions, sales of assets, the
deferral of postponable capital expenditures, obtaining additional sources of
funds or pursuing the possible restructuring of its indebtedness. There can be
no assurance that such measures, if required, would generate the liquidity
required by the Company to operate its business and service its indebtedness.

Beginning in 1996 and continuing thereafter, the Company will be required to
make significant amortization payments on its indebtedness which will require
the Company to raise sufficient funds from operations or other sources or
refinance or restructure maturing indebtedness. No assurance can be given that
the Company will be successful in doing so.

ADVERSE INDUSTRY CONDITIONS AND CYCLICAL PRODUCT PRICING

The markets for paper, packaging products and commodity pulp sold by the
Company are highly competitive, and are sensitive to changes in industry
capacity and cyclical changes in the economy, both of which can significantly
impact selling prices and the Company's profitability. The markets for
containerboard and corrugated containers, which represent a substantial portion
of the Company's net sales, generally experienced price declines during the
period since 1990. The Company has, however, successfully implemented a $25 per
ton price increase for containerboard and is in the process of implementing a
price increase in corrugated containers. The Company expects to realize the
benefits of such price increases in the first quarter of 1994. Newsprint and
market pulp prices have also fallen substantially since 1990 due to
supply/demand imbalances. While newsprint prices generally increased in 1992, an
additional price increase announced in 1993 was unsuccessful. The Company has
announced a price increase for newsprint effective March 1, 1994 in light of
strengthening demand for newsprint. Market pulp prices, which had improved
modestly during 1992 from the low prices of 1991, began deteriorating in the
fourth quarter of 1992 and weakened further in 1993. The Company is also in the
process of implementing price increases effective January 1, 1994 for market
pulp of $40 to $80 per ton. There also can be no assurance that announced price
increases for the Company's products can be implemented, that prices for the
Company's products will not decline from current levels or that the Company will
not elect to take further economic downtime.

RECENT LOSSES; NET CASH USED IN OPERATING ACTIVITIES

The Company incurred losses of $233.5 million (before taking into account
the cumulative effect of an accounting change) and $273.0 million (taking into
account such change) for the nine months ended September 30, 1993, $169.9
million (before taking into account the cumulative effect of an accounting
change) and $269.4 million (taking into account such change) in 1992 and $49.1
million in 1991. Net cash used in operating activities totalled $115.6 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 1993, while net cash provided by
operating activities totalled $46.5 million for the nine months ended September
30, 1992. The Company expects the fourth quarter of 1993 will have a deficit in
net cash provided by operating activities. The Company expects to incur a net
loss for the quarter ending December 31, 1993 that will be less than the loss
reported for the third quarter of 1993. See "Selected Consolidated Financial
Data." As a result of the net losses, it has been necessary for the Company to
obtain various amendments and waivers of certain covenants in the Credit
Agreements. See "Credit Agreements" in the accompanying Prospectus. If current
pricing levels for the Company's products do not significantly improve, the
Company will continue to incur losses. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Outlook" in the accompanying
Prospectus.

CREDIT AGREEMENT RESTRICTIONS

All indebtedness under the Credit Agreements is secured by a substantial
portion of the assets of the Company. The Credit Agreements contain certain
restrictions on the Company, including requirements that the Company achieve and
maintain certain financial ratios (including a minimum current ratio, an
indebtedness ratio, minimum EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreements) and a
tangible net worth test). The restrictions also include, among other things,
limitations on the ability of the Company to incur additional indebtedness, to
create, incur or permit the existence of certain liens, to make guarantees, to
make certain investments, to make aggregate capital expenditures above certain
levels, to make certain payments with respect to its outstanding stock, and to
enter into

S-11
<PAGE>
certain types of transactions. In particular, the Credit Agreements currently
prohibit investments in Stone Venepal (Celgar) Pulp Inc., and
Stone-Consolidated. A default by Stone-Consolidated of any of its obligations in
excess of $10 million constitutes a default under the Credit Agreements.

The Credit Agreements also limit in certain specific circumstances any
further investments by the Company in two of its subsidiaries, Seminole Kraft
and Stone Savannah. Stone Savannah and Seminole Kraft have incurred substantial
indebtedness in connection with project financings and are significantly
leveraged. As of September 30, 1993, Stone Savannah had $413.8 million in
outstanding indebtedness (including $280.1 million in secured indebtedness owed
to bank lenders) and Seminole Kraft had $179.8 million in outstanding
indebtedness (including $117.5 million in secured indebtedness owed to bank
lenders). The Company has entered into separate output purchase agreements with
each subsidiary which require the Company to purchase the output of the mills
operated by each subsidiary at rates which are above current market rates until
September 30, 1994 for Seminole Kraft, until December 20, 1994 for linerboard
production at Stone Savannah and until November 14, 1995 for market pulp
production at Stone Savannah. After such dates, the Company is required to
purchase the respective productions at market prices for the remaining terms of
these agreements. At the time that the fixed price provisions of the output
purchase agreements terminate, such subsidiaries may need to undertake
additional measures to meet their debt service requirements, including obtaining
additional sources of funds, postponing or restructuring of debt service
payments or refinancing of the indebtedness. In the event that such measures are
required and are not successful, and such indebtedness is accelerated by the
respective lenders to Stone Savannah or Seminole Kraft, the lenders to the
Company under various of its debt instruments will be entitled to accelerate the
indebtedness owed by the Company. The cross-acceleration provisions in the
Credit Agreements are effective upon the completion of the Offerings. Prior to
the completion of the Offerings, the Credit Agreements contained cross-default
provisions similar to the cross-default provisions mentioned above for
Stone-Consolidated Corporation.

There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve and
maintain compliance with the prescribed financial ratio tests or other
requirements of the Credit Agreements. Failure to achieve or maintain compliance
with such financial ratio tests or other requirements under the Credit
Agreements, in the absence of a waiver or amendment, would result in an event of
default and could lead to the acceleration of the obligations under the Credit
Agreements. The Company has successfully sought and received waivers and
amendments to its Credit Agreements on various occasions since entering into the
Credit Agreements. Most recently, the Credit Agreements were modified to permit
the earnings from the sale of the Company's interest in Titan to be included in
EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreements) solely for purposes of satisfying
the minimum EBITDA requirement for the quarter ended December 31, 1993. On
December 17, 1993, the Company obtained approval of amendments to the Credit
Agreements in connection with the Stone-Consolidated Transaction which
permitted, among other things, Stone-Consolidated to grant liens on its property
to the holders of its 10.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2000 and the lenders under
its revolving credit facilities, and restricted Stone-Consolidated's ability to
pay dividends on its capital stock. In connection with the Offerings, the
Company is seeking further amendments to the Credit Agreements which will, upon
the effective date of the Offerings, amend the Credit Agreements including to
change certain financial covenants. See "Recent Developments -- Amendments to
Credit Agreements." If further waivers or amendments are requested by the
Company, there can be no assurance that the Company's bank lenders will again
grant such requests. The failure to obtain any such waivers or amendments would
reduce the Company's flexibility to respond to adverse industry conditions and
could have a material adverse effect on the Company. See "Credit Agreements --
Covenants" in the accompanying Prospectus.

FUTURE ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS

Giving effect to the Offerings, the Company will have sold securities on a
number of occasions in the last two years for total proceeds in excess of $2.0
billion. The recent issuance of a substantial amount of securities may make it
difficult, at least in the near future, for the Company to access the capital
markets for further financings and therefore may limit the Company's sources for
future liquidity.

RANKING

The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will rank
PARI PASSU in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness,
including the indebtedness under the Credit Agreements and the Company's 11 7/8%
Senior Notes due 1998 and 12 5/8% Senior Notes due 1998. The payment of the
principal of,

S-12
<PAGE>
interest on and any other amounts due on Subordinated Indebtedness will be
subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of the Notes. As
of September 30, 1993, the total amount of outstanding Senior Indebtedness was
approximately $1.8 billion (which amount does not reflect the 1993 Fourth
Quarter Transactions and the Offerings and the application of the net proceeds
therefrom).

A substantial portion of the Company's assets currently secure borrowings
outstanding under the Credit Agreements. At September 30, 1993 (without
adjusting for the 1993 Fourth Quarter Transactions and the Offerings and the
application of the net proceeds therefrom), the Company had approximately $1.48
billion of term loans and approximately $271 million in revolving credit
borrowings under the Credit Agreements. In the event of the Company's insolvency
or liquidation, the claims of the lenders under the Credit Agreements would have
to be satisfied out of such collateral before any such assets would be available
to pay claims of holders of the Notes. If the lenders under the Credit
Agreements should foreclose on such collateral, no assurance can be given that
there will be sufficient assets available in the Company to pay amounts due on
the Notes. See "Description of Debt Securities -- Ranking" in the accompanying
Prospectus.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

The Company's operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation
by federal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatory
authorities with jurisdiction over its foreign operations. Such regulation
requires significant capital expenditures. On December 17, 1993, the
Environmental Protection Agency proposed regulations under the Clean Air Act and
the Clean Water Act for the pulp and paper industry which when implemented would
affect directly many of the Company's facilities. Since the regulations have
only recently been proposed, the Company is currently unable to estimate the
nature or level of future expenditures that may be required to comply. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations -- Financial Condition and Liquidity -- Environmental Issues" in the
accompanying Prospectus. In addition, the Company is from time to time subject
to litigation and governmental proceedings regarding environmental matters in
which injunctive and/or monetary relief is sought. The Company has been named as
a potentially responsible party ("PRP") at a number of sites which are the
subject of remedial activity under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA" or "Superfund") or comparable state
laws. Although the Company is subject to joint and several liability imposed
under Superfund, at most of the multi-PRP sites there are organized groups of
PRPs and costs are being shared among PRPs. The Company currently believes that
adequate provisions have been established for these sites and that such costs
will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on
its financial position or future operating results.

LIMITED MARKET FOR NOTES

It is likely that the Notes will have a limited trading market and the
Company does not intend to list them on any securities exchange. The
Representatives have each indicated an intention initially to make a market in
the Notes as permitted by applicable laws and regulations. No underwriter,
however, is obligated to make a market in the Notes and any such market making
could be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of such underwriter.

USE OF PROCEEDS

The net proceeds to the Company from the Offerings are estimated to
aggregate $ million ($ million if the Underwriters' over-allotment option
with respect to the Common Stock Offering is exercised in full). Such proceeds

purposes, as set forth below. For further information on the interest rate,
maturity and other terms with respect to the Company's indebtedness, see
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations -- Financial Condition and Liquidity" and "Credit Agreements" in the

The Underwriters have advised the Company that they propose initially to
offer the Notes directly to the public at the public offering price set forth on
the cover page of this Prospectus Supplement and to certain dealers at such
price less a concession of % of the principal amount of the Notes. The
Underwriters may allow and such dealers may reallow a concession not in excess
of % of the principal amount of the Notes on sales to certain other dealers.
After the initial offering, the public offering price and concessions to dealers
may be changed.

The Company has agreed to indemnify the Underwriters against certain civil
liabilities, including certain liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Act").

The Notes are new issues of securities with no established trading market.
The Company has been advised by certain of the Underwriters that they intend to
make a market in the Notes, but they are not obligated to do so and may
discontinue such market making at any time without notice. No assurance can be
given as to the development or liquidity of any trading market for the Notes.

The Company has agreed that, for a period of thirty days from the date of
the issuance of the Notes, without the consent of Salomon Brothers Inc, acting
on behalf of the Underwriters, neither the Company nor any subsidiary of the
Company (except in limited circumstances) will (i) file with the Securities and
Exchange Commission or publicly announce its intent to file any registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), or
pre-effective amendment to any registration statement under the Act relating to
debt securities (other than industrial development bonds) or (ii) enter into any
agreement for or consummate the sale of, or publicly announce its intent to
sell, any debt securities (other than the Notes and industrial development
bonds).

Certain of the Underwriters from time to time perform investment banking and
other financial advisory services for the Company for which they receive
customary compensation.

Bankers Trust Company ("Bankers Trust"), an affiliate of BT Securities
Corporation, is the agent and a lender, and Chemical Bank, an affiliate of
Chemical Securities Inc., is a co-agent and lender under the Credit Agreements.
NationsBank, N.A., an affiliate of NationsBanc Capital Markets, Inc., is a
lender under the Credit Agreements. In their capacity as lenders under the
Credit Agreements, Bankers Trust, Chemical Bank and Nationsbank would receive
their pro rata share of the net proceeds of the sale of the Notes hereunder used
to repay indebtedness under the Credit Agreements. See "Use of Proceeds." In the
aggregate, such lenders may receive more than 10% of the net proceeds from the
distribution of the Notes. Under the Rules of Fair Practice of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the "NASD"), when affiliates of members
of the NASD participating in a distribution of debt securities receive in the
aggregate more than 10% of the net proceeds of such distribution, the yield at
which such

S-20
<PAGE>
debt securities may be distributed to the public can be no lower than that
recommended by a "qualified independent underwriter," as defined by Section 2(1)
of Schedule E to the By-Laws of the NASD. Accordingly, in connection with the
offering of the Notes, Salomon Brothers Inc intends to serve as a qualified
independent underwriter in recommending the yield at which the Notes will be
offered and conducting due diligence. Bankers Trust is also the indenture
trustee for the Company's 11 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due September 1,
1999.

LEGAL MATTERS

The validity of the Notes offered hereby will be passed upon for the Company
by Leslie T. Lederer, Vice President, Secretary and Counsel of the Company (who
owns approximately 15,900 shares of Common Stock) and by Sidley & Austin,
Chicago, Illinois. Certain legal matters will be passed upon for the
Underwriters by Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, New York, New York.

THE COMPANY

GENERAL
The Company is a major international pulp and paper company engaged
principally in the production and sale of paper, packaging products and
commodity pulp. The Company believes that it is the world's largest producer of
unbleached containerboard and kraft paper and the world's largest converter of
those products. The Company also believes that it is one of the largest paper
companies in terms of annual tonnage produced. The Company produced 5.0 million
tons and 4.9 million tons of unbleached containerboard and kraft paper in 1992
and 1991, respectively, which accounted for approximately 66% of its total
tonnage produced for both 1992 and 1991. The Company had net sales of
approximately $5.5 billion and $5.4 billion in 1992 and 1991, respectively. As
used herein, the term "Company" includes Stone Container Corporation, its
subsidiaries and its affiliates, except as the context otherwise may require.

The Company has increased dramatically in size over the past ten years,
primarily through four major acquisitions, including the 1989 acquisition of
Consolidated-Bathurst Inc. (a Canadian corporation, now renamed Stone Container
(Canada) Inc. ("Stone Canada")), and several smaller acquisitions. The
acquisition of Stone Canada increased the Company's market share in its core
business operations and provided the Company with the opportunity to pursue its
strategy to expand its production capacity and sales in international markets.

OPERATIONS
The following table presents actual annual mill production capacity of the
Company at December 31, 1992 and at December 31, 1991:

(a) Includes 25% of production capacity of the Celgar mill, 49% of the
facilities of Empaques de Carton Titan, S.A. and 100% of Seminole Kraft and
Stone Savannah River mills.
</TABLE>

The paperboard and paper packaging segment of the Company's business
includes the manufacture of linerboard, corrugating medium and kraft paper,
among other products. Linerboard and corrugating medium are the basic materials
used in the manufacture of corrugated containers. Kraft paper is primarily used
to produce paper bags and sacks. The Company's principal customers for
linerboard, corrugating medium and kraft paper are its corrugated container
division and its bag divisions. In 1992 and 1991, those divisions consumed
approximately 88% and 87%, respectively, of the Company's aggregate production
of linerboard, corrugating medium and kraft paper.

The Company has more than 100 board converting operations, which produced
and shipped approximately 51.7 billion square feet and 49.2 billion square feet
of corrugated containers in 1992 and 1991, respectively. Corrugated shipments by
U.S. facilities were approximately 12% of the total U.S. industry shipments in
both 1992 and 1991. Corrugated containers are sold in a broad range of markets.

The Company operates 19 kraft paper converting facilities, which shipped
approximately 689 thousand tons and 735 thousand tons of paper bags and sacks
nationwide in 1992 and 1991, respectively. These shipments represented
approximately 34% and 35% of the total U.S. industry shipments for 1992 and
1991, respectively. The Company believes that it is the leading North American
producer of paper bags and sacks. Kraft paper is converted at the Company's
plants into grocery bags and sacks, merchandise bags and multiwall shipping
sacks. Grocery

3
<PAGE>
bags and sacks are sold primarily to supermarket chains; merchandise bags are
sold primarily to retailers of consumer products; and multiwall shipping sacks
are sold to the agricultural, chemical and cement industries, among others.

Wood fiber, particularly from wood chips, and waste paper constitute the
basic raw materials for linerboard, corrugating medium, unbleached kraft paper,
newsprint, groundwood paper and market pulp. Wood fiber resources are available
within economic proximity of the mills and the Company has not experienced any
significant difficulty in obtaining such resources, although environmental
concerns in the Pacific Northwest (including the designation of the spotted owl
as a threatened species) have reduced the supply of wood in that region.
Consistent with its strategy to obtain long-term wood fiber sources without the
costs associated with land ownership, the Company sold approximately 329
thousand acres of timberland during the years 1988 through 1992. This acreage
had been owned by Southwest Forest Industries, Inc., now named Stone Southwest,
Inc., which was acquired by the Company in 1987. At December 31, 1992, the
Company had approximately 14 thousand and 343 thousand acres of private fee
timberland in the United States and Canada, respectively. The Company assists
certain landowners in the Southeastern United States in managing approximately
2.0 million acres of timberland.

Recycled fiber, one of the Company's principal raw material components along
with wood fiber, must be purchased in a price sensitive market. The Company
believes that the demand for recycled fiber will increase and expects that the
cost of purchasing recycled fiber will also increase as a result of increased
demand and market conditions. As a result of the recognition of greater recycled
fiber utilization in the United States, the Company and WMX (formerly Waste
Management of North America) have formed a joint venture, Paper Recycling
International, L.P., which will assist the Company in the procurement of waste
fiber.

The Company's business is not dependent upon a single customer or upon a
small number of major customers. The loss of any one customer would not have a
material adverse effect on the Company.

The Company's products and the raw materials needed to manufacture those
products have historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. Cyclical
economic factors such as growth in the economy generally, interest rates,
unemployment levels and fluctuations in currency exchange rates have had a
significant impact on prices and sales of the Company's products. The
availability and cost of wood fiber, including wood chips, and waste paper may
be subject to substantial variation, depending upon economic, political and
conservation considerations.

As of December 31, 1992, the Company had approximately 31,200 employees, of
whom approximately 21,900 were employees of U.S. operations and the remainder
were employees of foreign operations. Of those in the United States,
approximately 13,900 are union employees.

At March 1, 1993, the Company's founders and individual members of their
families, in the aggregate but not as a group, owned approximately 13.5 million
shares of the Company's Common Stock, constituting approximately 19% of the
approximately 71 million then-outstanding shares of Common Stock.

The Company is incorporated in Delaware and its Common Stock is listed on
the New York Stock Exchange. The Company's executive offices are located at 150
North Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60601; telephone number (312) 346-6600.

USE OF PROCEEDS

Unless otherwise specified in the Prospectus Supplement, the net proceeds to
be received by the Company from the sale of the Securities will be used to repay
indebtedness outstanding under the Company's Credit Agreements or to refinance
certain indebtedness as permitted thereunder. The terms of the Credit Agreements
require, except in certain circumstances, the application of proceeds resulting
from an offering of the Securities to be applied against indebtedness then
outstanding thereunder. See "Credit Agreements." Pending use for these purposes,
the Company may invest proceeds from the sale of the Securities in short-term
marketable securities.

SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL DATA

The following selected Statement of Operations and Balance Sheet Data for
the five years ended December 31, 1992 has been derived from, and should be read
in conjunction with, the related audited consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes of the Company. The audit report relating to the Company's
1992 consolidated financial statements contains an explanatory paragraph
referring to the March 1, 1994 expiration of the Company's revolving credit
facilities and the Company's financial plan discussed in Note 10 to the
Company's 1992 consolidated financial statements. Effective December 17, 1993,
the Company's revolving credit facilities were extended until March 1, 1997. The
selected financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 1993 and
September 30, 1992 has been derived from the unaudited consolidated financial
statements included in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF
FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE
SELECTED HISTORICAL FINANCIAL DATA AND THE HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (AND RELATED NOTES) OF THE COMPANY INCLUDED OR INCORPORATED BY
REFERENCE IN THIS PROSPECTUS.

GENERAL

The Company's major products are containerboard and corrugated containers,
newsprint and market pulp. The markets for paper, packaging products and
commodity pulp sold by the Company are highly competitive and sensitive to
industry capacity and cyclical changes in the economy that can significantly
impact selling prices and the Company's profitability. The Company's sales and
operating results have, in recent years, been more sensitive to price changes
than to changes in sales volume.

The markets for containerboard and corrugated containers, which represent a
substantial portion of the Company's net sales, generally experienced price
declines in the period 1990 through the third quarter of 1993 (except for one
increase in August 1991), and, despite increasing industry-wide capacity
utilization (which is now at approximately the same level as 1989), the Company
was unable to implement announced price increases for these products in 1992 or
for the first nine months of 1993. In prior periods, comparable levels of
capacity utilization supported higher product pricing.

Additions to industry-wide capacity for newsprint and market pulp and
declines in demand for such products during the past three years have led to
supply/demand imbalances that have contributed to depressed prices for these
products. The newsprint industry, which began discounting sales prices in 1990,
was adversely affected by progressively increasing price discounts throughout
1991 and most of 1992, although such discounts were partially reversed in the
fourth quarter of 1992 and the first quarter of 1993 when discounts were
reduced. During this time, new production capacity in the industry came on line,
approximating two million tons annually, representing an approximate 12%
increase in capacity. At the same time, U.S. consumption of newsprint fell, due
to declines in readership and ad linage. As prices fell, certain high cost paper
machines, representing approximately 1.2 million tons and located mostly in
Canada, were shut down. Market pulp prices, which had improved modestly during
1992 from the low prices of 1991, began deteriorating in the fourth quarter of
1992 and have weakened further in 1993.

If current pricing levels for the Company's products do not significantly
improve, the Company will continue to incur net losses.

Due to the industry conditions described above and the Company's highly
leveraged capital structure and related interest expense associated with
indebtedness incurred to finance the acquisition of Stone Canada, the Company
has incurred net losses in each of the last two years and the first nine months
of 1993 and expects to incur a net loss for the full year 1993. In 1992, the
Company suspended payment of cash dividends on its Common Stock. The Company is
pursuing a financial plan that is intended to enhance the Company's liquidity
and increase its financial flexibility. See "-- Financial Condition and
Liquidity -- Outlook."

</TABLE>

NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1993 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER
30, 1992

The net loss for the third quarter of 1993 was $99.2 million, or $1.42 per
share of common stock, compared to the net loss of $43.2 million, or $.64 per
share of common stock for the third quarter of 1992.

For the nine months ended September 30, 1993, the loss before the cumulative
effect of a change in the accounting for postretirement benefits other than
pensions was $233.5 million, or $3.36 per share of common stock. The adoption of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106 "Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions" ("SFAS 106"), effective January 1,
1993, resulted in a one-time, non-cash cumulative effect charge of $39.5 million
net of income taxes or $.56 per share of common stock, resulting in a net loss
of $273.0 million or $3.92 per share of common stock. For the nine months ended
September 30, 1992, the restated loss before the cumulative effect of a change
in the accounting for income taxes was $93.2 million, or $1.38 per share of
common stock. The adoption of SFAS 109, which the Company adopted retroactive to
January 1, 1992, resulted in a one-time, non-cash cumulative effect charge of
$99.5 million, or $1.40 per share of common stock, resulting in a restated net
loss of $192.7 million, or $2.78 per share of common stock. The Company's income
tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 1993 includes a third
quarter adjustment for the retroactive increase in the U.S. federal income tax
rate and an enacted decrease in German tax rates, the effects of which
substantially offset each other, and a second quarter favorable adjustment of
approximately $5 million which reflects the effect of a reduction in the
Canadian statutory income tax rate.

The increases in the losses before the cumulative effects of the accounting
changes were primarily due to lower average selling prices for most of the
Company's products. Additionally, the Company's operating results for the 1993
third quarter were negatively impacted by market-related production downtime.
The mills involved have all resumed production and are currently operating at
normal levels.

PAPERBOARD AND PAPER PACKAGING:

Net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 1993 for the
paperboard and paper packaging segment decreased 14.4 percent and 9.7 percent,
respectively over the comparable prior year periods. This

7
<PAGE>
decrease was due in part to the exclusion of sales for the Company's European
folding carton operations which earlier this year were merged into a joint
venture and accordingly is now accounted for under the equity method of
accounting. Sales from these operations were approximately $48 million and $136
million for the third quarter and first nine months of 1992, respectively. Sales
for 1993 were approximately $60 million prior to the merger in May. Excluding
the effect of the joint venture, sales for the third quarter and first nine
months decreased 10.6 percent and 7.6 percent from the year ago periods
reflecting lower sales of paperboard, corrugated containers, kraft paper and
paper bags and sacks. The sales decreases for paperboard reflect both reduced
sales volume and lower average selling prices while the sales decreases for
kraft paper and paper bags and sacks were mainly attributable to lower sales
volume. Sales of corrugated containers for the third quarter and nine months
ended September 30, 1993, as compared to the prior year periods, decreased as
sales volume increases were offset by lower average selling prices, particularly
during the third quarter.

Shipments of corrugated containers, including the Company's proportional
share of the shipments by its foreign affiliates, were 13.6 billion square feet
in the third quarter of 1993, compared with 13.3 billion square feet for the
comparable prior year period. For the first nine months of 1993, the Company
shipped 39.8 billion square feet of corrugated containers, compared with 39.3
billion square feet shipped during the first nine months of 1992. Shipments of
paper bags and sacks were 156 thousand tons and 459 thousand tons for the three
and nine month periods ended September 30, 1993, respectively, compared with 177
thousand tons and 522 thousand tons shipped during the comparable 1992 periods.

Production of containerboard and kraft paper for the three and nine month
periods ended September 30, 1993, including 100 percent of the production at
Seminole Kraft Corporation ("Seminole") and Stone Savannah River Pulp & Paper
Corporation ("Stone Savannah River"), was 1.17 million tons and 3.58 million
tons, respectively, compared to 1.23 million tons and 3.75 million tons produced
during the comparable prior year periods.

Operating income for the paperboard and paper packaging segment decreased
70.8 percent and 49.0 percent for the three months and nine months ended
September 30, 1993, respectively, as compared to the corresponding 1992 periods.
The decreases were mainly attributable to reduced operating margins primarily
resulting from lower average selling prices for containerboard and corrugated
containers.

WHITE PAPER AND PULP:

Net sales for the third quarter and first nine months of 1993 for the white
paper and pulp segment decreased 24.1 percent and 11.2 percent, respectively,
from the prior year periods, primarily due to significant declines in sales of
market pulp. Additionally, decreases in newsprint sales, particularly during the
1993 third quarter, contributed to the lower sales. Partially offsetting the
sales decreases for market pulp and newsprint were increases for sales of
groundwood paper. The sales declines for market pulp were primarily attributable
to significantly lower average selling prices. Reduced sales volume during the
1993 periods also contributed to the lower market pulp sales. The decrease in
newsprint sales for the third quarter of 1993, as compared with the
corresponding prior year period, resulted primarily from reduced sales volume
and unfavorable foreign exchange translation effects attributable to the
stronger U.S. dollar, which more than offset the impact of higher average
selling prices. For the nine months ended September 30, 1993, sales of newsprint
decreased slightly from the year ago period as foreign exchange translation
effects more than offset the impact of higher average selling prices and a
slight volume increase. The 1993 sales increases for groundwood paper over the
comparable 1992 periods were primarily due to significant volume increases which
more than offset the effects of lower average selling prices.

Production of newsprint, market pulp and groundwood paper for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 1993, including 25 percent of the production at
the Company's affiliated market pulp mill in British Columbia, was 610 thousand
tons and 1.86 million tons, compared with 633 thousand tons and 1.79 million
tons produced during the comparable prior year periods.

Operating losses for the third quarter and first nine months of 1993 for the
white paper and pulp segment increased 59.6 percent and 74.3 percent,
respectively, from the previous year periods due to the reduced operating
margins primarily resulting from the significantly lower average selling prices
for market pulp. Lower average selling prices for groundwood paper also
contributed to the reduced earnings. While average selling prices for newsprint

8
<PAGE>
improved over the prior year periods and certain cost reductions have been
implemented, the margins associated with such improvements have only partially
offset the effects of the lower average selling prices for market pulp and
groundwood paper.

OTHER:

Net sales and operating income for the third quarter and first nine months
of 1993 increased over the comparable 1992 periods mainly as a result of
improved demand and a tighter supply of timber available to the U.S. building
industry. This resulted in increased sales volume and the realization of higher
average selling prices for certain of the Company's lumber and wood products.

1992 COMPARED WITH 1991

Net sales for 1992 were $5.5 billion, an increase of 2.5% over 1991 net
sales of $5.4 billion. Net sales rose primarily as a result of increased sales
volume, most of which was offset by reduced average selling prices for certain
of the Company's products. In 1992, the Company incurred a loss before the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes of $170 million, or
$2.49 per common share, compared to a net loss of $49 million, or $.78 per
common share, for 1991. The Company adopted SFAS 109 effective January 1, 1992
and recorded a one-time, non-cash cumulative effect charge of $99.5 million or
$1.40 per common share. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect a 2%
Common Stock dividend issued September 15, 1992. The increase in the loss before
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes primarily
resulted from lower average selling prices for newsprint and groundwood paper in
1992 as compared with 1991. Additionally, continued low average selling prices
for the majority of the Company's other products contributed to the net loss for
1992.

The 1992 results include foreign currency transaction losses of $15.0
million and a $7.9 million pretax charge relating to the write-down of an
investment. The 1991 results included non-recurring pretax gains of $59.3
million and foreign currency transaction gains of $4.9 million. The Company
recorded an income tax benefit of $59.4 million in 1992 as compared with a $31.1
million income tax expense in 1991. This change primarily reflects the tax
effect associated with the increased pretax loss for 1992 over 1991 and the
adoption of SFAS 109 effective January 1, 1992. The Company's effective income
tax rates for both years reflect the impact of non-deductible depreciation and
amortization, together with taxes payable by certain foreign subsidiaries at
rates in excess of the U.S. statutory rate.

PAPERBOARD AND PAPER PACKAGING:

The 1992 net sales for the paperboard and paper packaging segment increased
3.7% as sales increases for corrugated containers, paperboard and folding
cartons more than offset sales declines for kraft paper and paper bags and
sacks.

Net sales of corrugated containers increased 6.7% over 1991, primarily as a
result of increased sales volume. Additionally, slightly higher average selling
prices in 1992 contributed to this increase. However, such selling prices
continued to remain at unsatisfactory levels.

10
<PAGE>
Net sales of paperboard increased over 1991 mainly as a result of modestly
higher average selling prices. Such 1992 average paperboard selling prices were
still, however, at unsatisfactory levels. Slight volume increases also
contributed to the improved paperboard sales for 1992. Net sales of kraft paper
decreased 9.3% from 1991, primarily due to reduced sales volume.

Net sales of paper bags and sacks decreased from 1991 primarily due to lower
sales volume and a decrease in average selling prices for retail paper bags.

Operating income for the paperboard and paper packaging segment for 1992
decreased 9.5%, primarily as a result of the inclusion, in 1991, of a
non-recurring pretax gain of $17.5 million from an involuntary conversion
relating to a boiler explosion at the Company's Missoula, Montana linerboard
mill. Excluding this 1991 non-recurring item, 1992 operating income for this
segment would have decreased by 4.8%. This decrease is mainly attributable to
reduced operating margins resulting from continued low average selling prices
for the Company's paperboard and paper packaging products. See also "--
Financial Condition and Liquidity -- Outlook."

WHITE PAPER AND PULP:

The 1992 net sales for the white paper and pulp segment decreased 3.4%, as
significant sales decreases for newsprint more than offset a significant sales
increase for market pulp. Net sales for groundwood paper decreased slightly as
lower average selling prices more than offset volume increases for this product.
The significant decrease in newsprint sales resulted primarily from lower
average selling prices. Additionally, reduced volume associated with
market-related downtime contributed to the lower sales of newsprint. The
increase in 1992 market pulp sales mainly resulted from volume increases
associated with sales generated from the Stone Savannah River mill, which
commenced market pulp operations in the fourth quarter of 1991. Furthermore,
while market pulp selling prices declined significantly in the fourth quarter of
1992, the Company realized modestly higher average selling prices for this
product in 1992, as compared with the even more depressed average selling prices
of 1991.

Operating income for the white paper and pulp segment for 1992 decreased
significantly from 1991, primarily due to reduced operating margins resulting
from the significantly lower average selling prices for newsprint and groundwood
paper. The 1991 results included a non-recurring pretax gain of $41.8 million
resulting from the settlement and termination of a Canadian supply contract. See
also "-- Financial Condition and Liquidity -- Outlook."

OTHER:

Net sales and operating income for the other segment increased over 1991
mainly due to improved demand and a tighter supply of timber available to the
U.S. building industry. This resulted in increased sales volume and the
realization of higher average selling prices for certain of the Company's lumber
and wood products. However, shortages of timber due to environmental concerns in
the Pacific Northwest continue to keep raw material costs high.

1991 Compared with 1990

Net sales for 1991 were $5.4 billion, a decrease of 6.5% from a record $5.8
billion for 1990. The Company recorded a net loss for 1991 of $49 million, or
$.78 per common share, compared to net income of $95 million, or $1.56 per
common share for 1990. All per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect a 2%
Common Stock dividend issued September 15, 1992. Lower average selling prices
for most of the Company's products was the major factor contributing to the
sales decrease and the net loss for 1991. Additionally, reduced sales volume for
certain products had an unfavorable effect on 1991 net sales and results of
operations.

The 1991 results included a $41.8 million pretax gain resulting from the
settlement and termination of a Canadian supply contract and a $17.5 million
pretax gain from an involuntary conversion relating to a boiler explosion at the
Company's Missoula, Montana linerboard mill. Partially offsetting these gains
was a $6 million pretax charge for reorganization costs at the Company's
Canadian subsidiary and a $4 million write-down on certain de-commissioned
assets at the Company's Jacksonville, Florida mill. Also contributing to the
1991 net loss was a $31 million income tax provision, which resulted primarily
from non-deductible depreciation and amortization, together with taxes payable
by certain foreign subsidiaries at rates in excess of the U.S. statutory rate.

11
<PAGE>
PAPERBOARD AND PAPER PACKAGING:

The 1991 net sales for the paperboard and paper packaging segment decreased
3.9% as sales declines for paperboard, paper bags and sacks, kraft paper and
corrugated containers more than offset a sales increase for folding cartons.

Net sales of corrugated containers decreased slightly from 1990 as an
overall decrease in average selling prices of corrugated containers more than
offset sales volume increases.

Net sales of paper bags and sacks decreased primarily due to volume
decreases resulting from the effects of increased competition.

Net sales of paperboard and kraft paper decreased from 1990 primarily due to
lower average selling prices. Additionally, a reduction in sales volume
contributed to the sales decrease for these products.

Operating income for the paperboard and paper packaging segment decreased
28.1% from 1990 due primarily to reduced operating margins resulting from lower
average selling prices of linerboard and corrugating medium. Additionally,
average selling prices of most converted products declined. 1991 operating
income for this segment included the $17.5 million pretax gain from the
involuntary conversion relating to the boiler explosion at the Company's
Missoula, Montana linerboard mill and the $4 million write-down on certain
de-commissioned assets at the Company's Jacksonville, Florida mill. Operating
income for 1990 reflected a $5.3 million gain from the sale of timberlands.

WHITE PAPER AND PULP:

The 1991 net sales for the white paper and pulp segment decreased 12.5%,
primarily as a result of declines in newsprint and market pulp sales. The
decrease in newsprint sales resulted primarily from lower sales volume, which
was partially due to significant down-time taken by the Company in an effort to
improve the short-term balance of supply and demand. Lower average selling
prices also contributed to the decrease in newsprint sales. The decrease in
market pulp sales resulted mainly from significantly lower average selling
prices.

Operating income for the white paper and pulp segment for 1991 decreased
45.8% as compared with 1990, primarily due to reduced operating margins
resulting from the previously mentioned declines in average selling prices for
market pulp and newsprint. Operating income for this segment included the $41.8
million pretax gain resulting from the settlement and termination of a Canadian
supply contract and a $4.2 million pretax charge, which represents an allocation
of the previously mentioned $6 million provision for reorganization costs at the
Company's Canadian subsidiary.

OTHER:

Net sales and operating income for the other segment decreased from 1990,
mainly due to the general economic downturn in the U.S. building market during
1991, which resulted in less demand for the Company's U.S. lumber and wood
products. Additionally, environmental concerns in the Pacific Northwest kept raw
material costs high for this segment.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

The Company's working capital ratio was 1.1 to 1 at September 30, 1993 and
1.8 to 1 at December 31, 1992, as restated to reflect the adoption of SFAS 109.
The decrease was mainly due to an increase in current maturities of $573 million
which, in accordance with the terms of the respective debt instruments, are
payable on or before September 30, 1994. A significant portion of the increase
in current maturities was attributable to $271 million ($309 million at November
9, 1993) of borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facilities which,
prior to the December 17, 1993 amendment to the U.S. Credit Agreement which
extended the expiration of such revolving credit facilities to March 1, 1997,
were originally scheduled to mature March 1, 1994. The Company's consolidated
long-term debt to total capitalization ratio was 74.3 percent at September 30,
1993 and 69.2 percent at December 31, 1992, as restated to reflect the adoption
of SFAS 109. Capitalization, for purposes of this ratio, includes long-term debt
(which includes debt of certain consolidated affiliates which is non-recourse to
the Company), deferred income taxes, redeemable preferred stock, minority
interest and stockholders' equity. The indebtedness ratio, as defined in the
Credit Agreement, was 79.6 percent at September 30, 1993.

The Company and Stone Canada have entered into bank credit agreements
(collectively, the "Credit Agreements") consisting of (i) two term-loan
facilities with outstanding borrowings in the aggregate of $1.11 billion as of

12
<PAGE>
September 30, 1993, (ii) an additional term loan (the "Additional Term Loan")
with outstanding borrowings at September 30, 1993 of $371 million and (iii) two
revolving credit facilities with aggregate commitments of $400 million (less
amounts outstanding, if any, under Canadian lines of credit) and total
outstanding borrowings thereunder of $271 million at September 30, 1993. The
Company is the borrower under one of the term loans, the Additional Term Loan
and one of the revolving credit facilities (collectively, the "U.S. Credit
Agreement") and Stone Canada is the borrower under the other term loan and
revolving credit facility. At September 30, 1993, the Company had unused
borrowing availability of $128 million under the revolving credit facilities. At
November 9, 1993, the Company had borrowing availability under its revolving
credit facilities of approximately $88 million. The term loans (other than the
Additional Term Loan) and the revolving credit facilities had weighted average
interest rates for the nine months ended September 30, 1993 of 8.37 percent and
5.62 percent, respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the Additional
Term Loan for the nine months ended September 30, 1993 was 6.30 percent.

In October 1993, the Company sold, prior to their expiration date, certain
of its U.S. dollar denominated cross currency swaps associated with the Credit
Agreement borrowings of Stone Canada. The net proceeds totalled approximately
$26 million, the substantial portion of which was used to repay borrowings under
the Company's revolving credit facilities, thereby restoring borrowing
availability thereunder.

On July 6, 1993 the Company sold $150 million principal amount of 12 5/8
percent Senior Notes due 1998 ("the 12 5/8 percent Senior Notes") and sold $250
million principal amount of 8 7/8 percent Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes
due 2000 ("the 8 7/8 percent Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes"). The net
proceeds of approximately $386 million from the sale of the 12 5/8 percent
Senior Notes and the concurrent sale of the 8 7/8 percent Convertible Senior
Subordinated Notes were used to repay borrowings under the Company's revolving
credit facilities, thereby restoring borrowing availability thereunder.

The Credit Agreements contain covenants that include, among other things,
requirements to maintain certain financial tests and ratios and certain
restrictions and limitations, including those on capital expenditures and
dividend payments. The Credit Agreements also contain cross default provisions
relating to the non-recourse debt of the consolidated affiliates. Additionally,
the Company's Credit Agreements limit the application of the proceeds from
certain financings and asset sales to amortization payments, except in specified
circumstances. See "Credit Agreements."

OPERATING ACTIVITIES:

Net cash used in operating activities was $115.6 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 1993 compared to net cash provided by operating activities
of $46.5 for the comparable period of 1992. The 1992 period included $43 million
of cash received from the settlement and termination of a Canadian supply
contract. Excluding the receipt of such cash, the Company's cash flow from
operations for the first nine months of 1993 decreased $119.1 million over the
prior year period. This decrease primarily resulted from the increase in the
1993 loss before the non-cash, cumulative effects of accounting changes as
compared with the prior year period along with decreases in accounts payable and
other current liabilities. These decreases in cash flow were partially offset by
favorable effects of changes in accounts and notes receivable and inventories.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES:

During the first nine months of 1993, outstanding borrowings under the
Company's revolving credit facilities increased approximately $14 million. The
net increase in borrowings takes into account the July 6, 1993 repayment of $386
million of revolving credit borrowings and subsequent reborrowing under the
credit facility. Such excess borrowings were primarily used to repay $110
million of the September 1993 bank term amortization and to provide cash for
operations and general corporate purposes.

On July 26, 1993, due to a restrictive provision in the indenture relating
to the Company's 10 3/4 percent Senior Subordinated Notes due June 15, 1997, its
11 percent Senior Subordinated Notes due August 15, 1999 and its 10 3/4 percent
Senior Subordinated Debentures due April 1, 2002, the Board of Directors did not
declare the scheduled August 15, 1993 quarterly dividend of .4375 per share on
the Series E Cumulative Convertible Exchangeable Preferred Stock (the "Series E
Cumulative Preferred Stock"), nor will it pay future dividends on the Series E
Cumulative Preferred Stock until the Company generates income, or effects
certain sales of capital stock, to replenish the dividend "pool" under various
of its debt instruments. As of September 30, 1993, accumulated dividends on the
Series E Cumulative Preferred Stock amounted to $2.0 million. In the event the
Company does not

13
<PAGE>
pay a dividend on the Series E Cumulative Preferred Stock for six quarters, the
Series E Cumulative Preferred Stock holders would have a right to elect two
members to the Company's Board of Directors until the full dividends accumulated
on such Series E Cumulative Preferred Stock have been declared and paid or set
apart for payment.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES:

Capital expenditures for the nine month period ended September 30, 1993,
(including capitalized interest of $8.1 million), totalled approximately $100.7
million, of which approximately $12.4 million was funded from existing project
financing facilities related to the major reconfiguration and paper machine
rebuild at Seminole.

Also during the nine months ended September 30, 1993, the Company purchased
an additional 6,152 shares of common stock of Stone Savannah River. The
Company's ownership in the common stock of Stone Savannah River is now 91.0
percent.

ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES:

The Company's operations are subject to extensive environmental regulation
by federal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatory
authorities with jurisdiction over its foreign operations. The Company has in
the past made significant capital expenditures to comply with water, air and
solid and hazardous waste regulations and expects to make significant
expenditures in the future. Capital expenditures for environmental control
equipment and facilities were approximately $24 million in 1992 and the Company
anticipates that 1993 and 1994 environmental capital expenditures will
approximate $44 million and $74 million, respectively. Although capital
expenditures for environmental control equipment and facilities and compliance
costs in future years will depend on legislative and technological developments
which cannot be predicted at this time, the Company anticipates that these costs
are likely to increase as environmental regulations become more stringent.
Environmental control expenditures include projects which, in addition to
meeting environmental concerns, yield certain benefits to the Company in the
form of increased capacity and production cost savings. In addition to capital
expenditures for environmental control equipment and facilities, other
expenditures incurred to maintain environmental regulatory compliance (including
any remediation) represent ongoing costs to the Company. Future environmental
regulations may have an unpredictable adverse effect on the Company's operations
and earnings, but they are not expected to adversely affect the Company's
competitive position.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CHANGES

In November 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for
Postemployment Benefits" ("SFAS 112"), which requires accrual accounting for the
estimated costs of providing certain benefits to former or inactive employees
and the employees' beneficiaries and dependents after employment but before
retirement. SFAS 112 is required to be adopted no later than the first quarter
of 1994. Upon adoption of this standard, any catch-up obligation is to be
reported as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the Statements of
Operations. While the effect of this standard has yet to be determined, it is
currently anticipated that SFAS 112 will not have a material impact upon the
Company's financial statements.

CREDIT AGREEMENTS

THE FOLLOWING IS SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF CERTAIN
BANK CREDIT AGREEMENTS OF THE COMPANY AND STONE CANADA AND IS QUALIFIED IN ITS
ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS AND INSTRUMENTS GOVERNING
SUCH INDEBTEDNESS, COPIES OF WHICH CONSTITUTE EXHIBITS TO THE REGISTRATION
STATEMENT OF WHICH THIS PROSPECTUS IS A PART OR ARE EXHIBITS TO THE COMPANY'S
REPORTS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, AND ARE INCORPORATED
BY REFERENCE INTO THIS PROSPECTUS.

GENERAL

The Credit Agreements consist of (i) two term-loan facilities with
outstanding borrowings in the aggregate amount of $877.7 million as of December
21, 1993, (ii) an additional term loan (the "Additional Term Loan") (previously
a multiple-draw facility) with outstanding borrowings at December 21, 1993 of
$292.9 million and (iii) two revolving credit facilities with aggregate
commitments of $315.8 million (less amounts outstanding, if any, under Canadian
lines of credit). The Company is the borrower under one of the term loans, the
Additional Term Loan and one of the revolving credit facilities (collectively,
the "U.S. Credit Agreement") and Stone Canada is the borrower under the other
term loan and revolving credit facility. Proceeds of the Additional Term Loan
borrowings were used solely to repay regularly scheduled amortization of term
loans under the U.S. Credit Agreement. The term loans (other than the Additional
Term Loan) and the revolving credit facilities had weighted average interest
rates for the nine months ended September 30, 1993 of 8.37% and 5.62%,
respectively. The weighted average interest rate on the Additional Term Loan was
6.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 1993.

The Company as of September 30, 1993 also had $261.3 million of borrowings
outstanding with certain lenders pursuant to two receivables financing programs
permitted by the Credit Agreements.

Effective December 17, 1993, the Credit Agreements were amended and restated
(the "Third Restated Agreement"), with the unanimous consent of the bank group,
to, among other things, extend the maturity of the revolving credit facilities
until March 1, 1997 and reduce over a three year period the revolving loan
commitments, revise various financial covenants to provide greater flexibility
to the Company, increase interest rate margins, mortgage or pledge additional
collateral, permit the Company to retain 25 percent of the net proceeds from
future sales of equity securities, permit the Company to retain 50 percent
(maximum $100 million in the aggregate) of the net proceeds from any sale or
disposition of certain designated investments, and various other changes.

The Credit Agreements generally include terms, conditions, representations
and warranties, covenants, indemnities and events of default and other
provisions which are customary in such agreements. The following is a summary of
certain of the principal terms of the Credit Agreements, as restated.

MATURITIES AND MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS

The term loans under the Credit Agreements and the Additional Term Loan are
scheduled to be paid in installments due March 31 and September 30 of each year.
Each installment of $204.5 million is applied ratably to the aggregate principal
amount of the term loans, the Additional Term Loan, the aggregate commitment
amounts (in the case of the revolving credit facilities) and the aggregate
amount of net letter of credit obligations relating to a letter of credit
providing credit support for industrial revenue bonds issued by Florence County,
South Carolina. The amount applied to the net letter of credit obligations is
required to be used to fund a cash collateral account in favor of the banks
participating in the letter of credit.

A portion of the amortization payments required by the Credit Agreements
will be ratably applied to reduce outstanding borrowings under the revolving
credit facilities and permanently reduce the commitments thereunder. The
revolving credit facilities under the Credit Agreements terminate on March 1,
1997, unless extended by agreement of the lenders, at which time all outstanding
indebtedness under such revolving credit facilities would have to be repaid or
refinanced.

Mandatory prepayments under the Credit Agreements are required in the event
that the Company has excess cash flow (as defined in the Credit Agreements) or
receives proceeds from the issuance of certain debt or equity securities or from
the sale of certain material assets. By reason of an amendment contained in the
Third Restated Agreement, 75 percent of the net proceeds from the offering of
equity securities by the Company must be applied in

15
<PAGE>
chronological order to the next regularly scheduled amortization payments except
that the Additional Term Loan does not receive any amortization payments from
sales of equity securities. Twenty-five percent of the net proceeds of an equity
offering may be retained by the Company.

Through prepayments in 1993, the Company has satisfied its March and
September, 1994 amortization requirements under the Credit Agreements.

INTEREST RATES

The Credit Agreements permit the Company to choose among various interest
rate options, to specify the portion of the borrowings to be covered by specific
interest rate options and to specify the interest rate period to which the
interest rate options are to apply, subject to certain parameters. At December
17, 1993, the interest rate options available to the Company and Stone Canada
under term loan and revolving credit borrowings were (i) U.S. or Canadian prime
rate plus a borrowing margin of 2%, (ii) CD rate plus a borrowing margin of
3 1/8%, and (iii) Eurodollar rate plus a borrowing margin of 3%. In the case of
Stone Canada, there is also an option of selecting a banker's acceptance rate
plus a borrowing margin of 3%. Upon achievement of specified indebtedness ratios
and interest coverage ratios, the borrowing margins will be reduced.
Additionally, the Company pays a 3/8% commitment fee on the unused portions of
the revolving credit facilities.

The Company has also paid to the banks amendment fees of 100 basis points
calculated on the aggregate term loan and commitment amounts in connection with
the execution of the Third Restated Agreement.

HEDGING REQUIREMENTS

The Credit Agreements required that the Company hedge a portion of the U.S.
dollar-based borrowings to protect against increases in market interest rates.
At September 30, 1993, the Company was a party to an interest rate swap contract
related to $150 million of such borrowings. The effect of this contract is to
fix the interest rate at approximately 12.9% on $150 million. The swap is
scheduled to expire no later than March 22, 1994. Upon the expiration of this
contract, the interest rate on these borrowings will be the rates described
above unless a new hedging arrangement is entered into.

SECURITY

Loans under the Credit Agreements are secured by a mortgage on the Company's
mill in Florence, South Carolina, and a pledge of the stock of various
subsidiaries of the Company, including Stone Southwest, Inc. and Stone Mill
Operating Corporation. Stone Southwest, Inc. owns mills in Snowflake, Arizona
and Panama City, Florida, and Stone Mill Operating Corporation owns mills in
Coshocton, Ohio, Missoula, Montana, Ontonagon, Michigan, and York, Pennsylvania.
The Company has also pledged to the lenders all of the common stock of Stone
Financial Corporation and Stone Fin II Receivables Corporation and certain
subordinated notes payable to the Company. All of the stock of Stone Canada has
also been pledged to the lenders under the Credit Agreements. The Company has
guaranteed the obligations of Stone Canada as a borrower under the Credit
Agreements. The Company and its subsidiary, Stone Bag Corporation, have granted
mortgages and security interests on approximately 47 box or bag plants owned or
leased by the Company or Stone Bag Corporation in the United States, together
with all fixed assets located at such plants and have granted a security
interest in inventories owned by the Company and Stone Bag Corporation.

Pursuant to the Third Restated Agreement effective December 17, 1993, the
bank group obtained mortgages on the Uncasville, Connecticut mill owned by Stone
Connecticut Paperboard Corporation, the Coshocton, Ohio mill owned by Stone Mill
Operating Corporation and the Pontiac mill owned by Stone Canada. Stone Canada
also pledged 100% of the shares of Stone-Consolidated Corporation owned by Stone
Canada and executed a limited recourse guaranty of the Company's indebtedness
under the Credit Agreements. Stone Bag and Stone Connecticut have also executed
limited recourse guarantees of the Company's indebtedness under the Credit
Agreements. Certain other security interests were also granted to the bank
group.

COVENANTS

The Credit Agreements contain covenants that include, among other things,
requirements to maintain certain financial tests and ratios (including a minimum
current ratio, an indebtedness ratio, an EBITDA test, and a tangible

16
<PAGE>
net worth test) and certain restrictions and limitations, including those on
capital expenditures, changes in control, payments of dividends, sales of
assets, lease payments, investments, additional borrowings, mergers and
purchases of stock and assets.

CONSOLIDATED TANGIBLE NET WORTH

The Third Restated Agreement requires that the Company have a consolidated
tangible net worth at the end of each calendar quarter, less certain excluded
investments, at least equal to the greater of 50% of (a) the consolidated
tangible net worth of the Company as of March 1, 1989 and (b) the highest
consolidated tangible net worth of the Company as of the end of any calendar
quarter ending after March 1, 1989.

EBITDA REQUIREMENT

The Third Restated Agreement requires that the Company have earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as defined in the Third Restated
Agreement) equal to or greater than

On December 29, 1993, the banks amended the Third Restated Agreement to
permit the earnings from the sale of the Company's interest in Empaques de
Carton Titan, S.A., a Mexican corrugated container company, to be counted for
purposes of satisfying the minimum EBITDA requirement solely for the quarter
ended December 31, 1993.

INDEBTEDNESS RATIO

The Company is currently required to have an indebtedness ratio (ratio of
total consolidated indebtedness to consolidated tangible net worth plus total
consolidated indebtedness, as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreements)
not exceeding (i) 81% at the end of each calendar month ending on or after
September 30, 1993 and ending prior to December 31, 1993; (ii) 81.5% at the end
of each calendar month ending on or after December 31, 1993 and ending prior to
March 31, 1995; (iii) 81.0% at the end of each calendar month ending on and

prior to March 31, 1996; (vii) 76.0% at the end of each calendar month ending on
and after March 31, 1996 and ending prior to June 30, 1996; (viii) 74.0% at the
end of each calendar month ending on or after June 30, 1996 and ending prior to
September 30, 1996; (ix) 72.0% at the end of each calendar month ending on or
after September 30, 1996 and ending prior to December 31, 1996; and (x) 68% at
the end of each calendar month ending on or after December 31, 1996.

At September 30, 1993, the Company's actual indebtedness ratio (as defined)
was 79.6%.

RESTRICTIONS ON INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND GUARANTEES; CROSS-DEFAULTS

The U.S. Credit Agreement contains prohibitions on investments in Stone
Venepal (Celgar) Pulp, Inc., a Canadian federal corporation, and the Company's
subsidiary, Stone-Consolidated Corporation. The Credit Agreements also restrict
further investments in two of the Company's subsidiaries, Seminole Kraft
Corporation and Stone Savannah River Pulp & Paper Corporation. The Company is
also not permitted to guarantee the indebtedness of Stone-Consolidated
Corporation and there are restrictions on other guarantees. There are also
restrictions on

17
<PAGE>
transactions with affiliates which are wholly-owned subsidiaries. Any event of
default or default with respect to a Subsidiary's indebtedness for money
borrowed having an aggregate principal amount of $10 million or more constitutes
an event of default under the Credit Agreements.

RESTRICTIONS ON DIVIDENDS

The U.S. Credit Agreement provides that the Company's dividend payments,
distributions or purchases of any class of capital stock of the Company and its
subsidiaries cannot exceed the sum of $50 million plus (i) 50% of the
consolidated net income (as defined by the Credit Agreements) of the Company
from April 1, 1991 to the date of payment of such dividends, minus (ii) 100% of
the consolidated net loss (as defined by the Credit Agreements) of the Company
from April 1, 1991 to the date of payment of such dividend plus (iii) 50% of any
net cash proceeds from sales of Common Stock or certain preferred stock of the
Company from April 1, 1991 to the date of payment of such dividends. The Credit
Agreements also provide that, with respect to the first cash dividend to be
declared after September 1, 1992, such declaration cannot be made unless the
unused portion of the revolving credit facilities (net of any unused portion
required to be reserved for capital expenditures only) is at least equal to $96
million plus the amount of such cash dividend.

At September 30, 1993, the dividend pool under the U.S. Credit Agreement had
a deficit of approximately $334.1 million. The dividend pool will be further
reduced by 100% of the consolidated net loss of the Company that will be
reported for the fourth quarter of 1993. The dividend pool will be increased by
50% of any net cash proceeds from the sale of Common Stock or certain preferred
stock of the Company.

In addition, the indentures relating to the Debt Securities and indentures
relating to the Company's outstanding senior subordinated indebtedness and the
13 5/8% Subordinated Notes due 1995 also restrict the payment of dividends and
distributions. See "Description of Debt Securities -- Particular Terms of the
Senior Debt Securities -- Certain Covenants -- Dividend Restrictions" and "--
Additional Terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities -- Dividend
Restrictions."

RESTRICTIONS ON INCURRENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS

The Credit Agreements restrict the incurrence of additional indebtedness,
subject to certain exceptions. The U.S. Credit Agreement permits the Company to
undertake accounts receivable securitization financings of up to $500 million,
the initial net proceeds of which are required to be used to reduce outstanding
term loans. The Company has instituted two accounts receivable securitization
financings of $365 million of which balances of $261.3 million were outstanding
as of September 30, 1993. The Company may incur an additional $135 million in
securitization financings under the Credit Agreements although no new program is
currently contemplated.

In addition, the Company's indentures relating to the Debt Securities also
restricts the incurrence of additional indebtedness, subject to certain
exceptions. See "Description of Debt Securities -- Particular Terms of the
Senior Debt Securities -- Certain Covenants -- Limitation on Future Incurrence
of Indebtedness."

the extent, if any, to which such general provisions may apply to the Debt
Securities so offered will be described in the Prospectus Supplement relating to
such Debt Securities.

The Debt Securities may be issued from time to time in one or more series
and will constitute either Senior Debt Securities, Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities. Senior Debt Securities will be
issued under an Indenture dated as of November 1, 1991, as supplemented by the
First Supplemental Indenture dated as of June 23, 1993 (the "Senior Debt
Securities Indenture"), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee
(the "Senior Debt Securities Trustee"). The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities

Indenture are referred to herein individually as an "Indenture" and,
collectively, as the "Indentures," and the Senior Debt Securities Trustee, the
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Trustee and the Subordinated Debt Securities
Trustee are referred to herein individually as to the "Trustee" and collectively
as the "Trustees." A copy of each Indenture is filed or incorporated by
reference as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.

The following summaries of certain provisions of the Debt Securities and the
Indentures do not purport to be complete and are subject to, and are qualified
in their entirety by express reference to, all the provisions of the Indentures,
including the definitions therein of certain terms. Certain capitalized terms
herein are defined in the Indentures.

GENERAL

The Debt Securities will be unsecured obligations of the Company.

The Indentures do not limit the aggregate principal amount of Debt
Securities which may be issued thereunder and provide that Debt Securities may
be issued thereunder from time to time in one or more series.

Reference is made to the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Debt
Securities being offered (the "Offered Debt Securities") for, among other
things, the following terms thereof: (1) the title of the Offered Debt
Securities; (2) the aggregate principal amount of the Offered Debt Securities;
(3) the date or dates on which the Offered Debt Securities will mature; (4) the
rate or rates (which may be fixed or variable) per annum at which the Offered
Debt Securities will bear interest and the date from which such interest will
accrue; (5) the dates on which such interest will be payable and the Regular
Record Dates for such Interest Payment Dates; (6) the dates, if any, on which,
and the price or prices at which, the Offered Debt Securities may, pursuant to
any mandatory or optional sinking fund provisions, be redeemed by the Company
and other detailed terms and provisions of such sinking funds; (7) the terms and
conditions, if any, pursuant to which the Offered Debt Securities are
convertible into Common Stock; and (8) the date, if any, after which, and the
price or prices at which, the Offered Debt Securities may, pursuant to any
optional redemption provisions, be redeemed at the option of the Company or of
the Holder thereof and other detailed terms and provisions of such optional
redemption. For a description of the terms of the Offered Debt Securities,
reference must be made to both the Prospectus Supplement relating thereto and to
the description of Debt Securities set forth herein.

Debt Securities which are convertible into Common Stock may only be issued
under the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture.

Unless otherwise indicated in the Prospectus Supplement relating thereto,
the principal of, and any premium or interest on, the Offered Debt Securities
will be payable, and the Offered Debt Securities will be exchangeable and
transfers thereof will be registrable, at the Place of Payment, provided that,
at the option of the Company, payment of interest may be made by check mailed to
the address of the person entitled thereto as it appears in the Security
Register.

19
<PAGE>
Unless otherwise indicated in the Prospectus Supplement relating thereto,
the Offered Debt Securities will be issued in United States dollars in fully
registered form, without coupons, in denominations of $1,000 or any integral
multiple thereof. No service charge will be made for any transfer or exchange of
the Offered Debt Securities, but the Company may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection
therewith.

RANKING

The Senior Debt Securities will rank PARI PASSU in right of payment with all
other Senior Indebtedness (as defined) of the Company. The Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities will (i) be subordinate in right of payment to all existing and
future Senior Indebtedness of the Company, (ii) be senior in right of payment to
all existing and future Junior Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined) and (iii)
rank PARI PASSU in right of payment with all existing and future Senior
Subordinated Indebtedness (as defined). The Subordinated Debt Securities will
(i) be subordinate in right of payment to all existing and future Senior
Indebtedness and Senior Subordinated Indebtedness and (ii) rank PARI PASSU upon
liquidation with all existing and future Junior Subordinated Indebtedness.

A substantial portion of the Company's assets currently secure the
borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreements, which are a component of
Senior Indebtedness. At July 29, 1993, the Company, together with Stone Canada,
had $1.601 billion of term-loan borrowings outstanding under the Credit
Agreements plus approximately $101 million in borrowings outstanding under the
revolving credit facilities available under the Credit Agreements.

The Debt Securities are obligations exclusively of the Company. Because the
operations of the Company are currently conducted primarily by subsidiaries, the
Company's cash flow and consequent ability to service debt, including the Debt
Securities, are dependent, in part, upon the earnings of its subsidiaries and
the distribution of those earnings or upon loans or other payments of funds by
those subsidiaries to the Company. The subsidiaries of the Company are separate
and distinct legal entities and have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to
pay any amount due pursuant to the Debt Securities or to make any funds
available therefor, whether by dividends, loans or other payments. In addition,
the payment of dividends and the making of loans and advances to the Company by
its subsidiaries may be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions (as
well as potential foreign tax withholding under certain circumstances), are
contingent upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and are subject to various
business considerations.

Any right of the Company to receive assets of any of its subsidiaries upon
their liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the Holders to
participate in the distribution of or proceeds from those assets) will be
effectively subordinated to the claims of such subsidiary's creditors (including
trade creditors and holders of debt issued by such subsidiary), except to the
extent that the Company is itself recognized as a creditor of such subsidiary,
in which case the claims of the Company would still be subordinate to any
security interests in the assets of such subsidiary and any indebtedness of such
subsidiary senior to that held by the Company. The 12 1/8% Subordinated
Debentures due September 15, 2001 of Stone Southwest, Inc., a significant
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, have been guaranteed on a subordinated
basis by the Company. At September 30, 1993, approximately $92.1 million
principal amount of such 12 1/8% Subordinated Debentures due September 15, 2001
was outstanding.

BOOK-ENTRY DEBT SECURITIES

The Debt Securities of a series may be issued in whole or in part in the
form of one or more Global Securities that will be deposited with, or on behalf
of, a Depositary ("Depositary") or its nominee identified in the applicable
Prospectus Supplement. In such a case, one or more Global Securities will be
issued in a denomination or aggregate denomination equal to the portion of the
aggregate principal amount of outstanding Debt Securities of the series to be
represented by such Global Security or Global Securities. Unless and until it is
exchanged in whole or in part for Debt Securities in registered form, a Global
Security may not be registered for transfer or exchange except as a whole by the
Depositary for such Global Security to a nominee of such Depositary or by a
nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or another nominee of such
Depositary or by such Depositary or any nominee to a successor Depositary or a
nominee of such successor Depositary and except in the circumstances described
in the applicable Prospectus Supplement.

<PAGE>
The specific terms of the depositary arrangement with respect to any portion
of a series of Debt Securities to be represented by a Global Security will be
described in the applicable Prospectus Supplement. The Company expects that the
following provisions will apply to depositary arrangements.

Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement, Debt
Securities which are to be represented by a Global Security to be deposited with
or on behalf of a Depositary will be represented by a Global Security registered
in the name of such Depositary or its nominee. Upon the issuance of such Global
Security, and the deposit of such Global Security with or on behalf of the
Depositary for such Global Security, the Depositary will credit, on its
book-entry registration and transfer system, the respective principal amounts of
the Debt Securities represented by such Global Security to the accounts of
institutions that have accounts with such Depositary or its nominee
("participants"). The accounts to be credited will be designated by the
underwriters or agents of such Debt Securities or, if such Debt Securities are
offered and sold directly by the Company, by the Company. Ownership of
beneficial interests in such Global Security will be limited to participants or
Persons that may hold interests through participants. Ownership of beneficial
interests by participants in such Global Security will be shown on, and the
transfer of that ownership interest will be effected only through, records
maintained by the Depositary or its nominee for such Global Security. Ownership
of beneficial interests in such Global Security by Persons that hold through
participants will be shown on, and the transfer of that ownership interest
within such participant will be effected only through, records maintained by
such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers
of securities take physical delivery of such securities in certificated form.
The foregoing limitations and such laws may impair the ability to transfer
beneficial interests in such Global Securities.

So long as the Depositary for a Global Security, or its nominee, is the
registered owner of such Global Security, such Depositary or such nominee, as
the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or Holder of the Securities
represented by such Global Security for all purposes under the applicable
Indenture. Unless otherwise specified in the applicable Prospectus Supplement,
owners of beneficial interests in such Global Security will not be entitled to
have Debt Securities of the series represented by such Global Security
registered in their names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical
delivery of Debt Securities of such series in certificated form and will not be
considered the Holders thereof for any purposes under the applicable Indenture.
Accordingly, each Person owning a beneficial interest in such Global Security
must rely on the procedures of the Depositary and, if such Person is not a
participant, on the procedures of the participant through which such Person owns
its interest, to exercise any rights of a Holder under the applicable Indenture.
The Company understands that under existing industry practices, if the Company
requests any action of Holders or an owner of a beneficial interest in such
Global Security desires to give any notice or take any action a Holder is
entitled to give or take under the applicable Indenture, the Depositary would
authorize the participants to give such notice or take such action, and
participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through such participants
to give such notice or take such action or would otherwise act upon the
instructions of beneficial owners owning through them.

Principal of and any premium and interest on a Global Security will be
payable in the manner described in the applicable Prospectus Supplement.

PARTICULAR TERMS OF THE SENIOR DEBT SECURITIES

The following description of the Senior Debt Securities sets forth certain
general terms and provisions of the Senior Debt Securities to which any
Prospectus Supplement may relate. The particular terms of the Senior Debt
Securities offered by any Prospectus Supplement and the extent, if any, to which
such general provisions may apply to the Senior Debt Securities so offered will
be described in the Prospectus Supplement relating to such Senior Debt
Securities.

CERTAIN COVENANTS

MAINTENANCE OF SUBORDINATED CAPITAL BASE

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that, subject to the exception
described in the third following paragraph, in the event that the Company's
Subordinated Capital Base is less than $1 billion (the "Minimum Subordinated
Capital Base") as at the end of each of any two consecutive fiscal quarters (the
last day of the second such fiscal quarter, a "Deficiency Date"), then, with
respect to Senior Debt Securities of each series, the Company shall, no later
than 60 days after the Deficiency Date (105 days if a Deficiency Date is also
the end of the Company's

21
<PAGE>
fiscal year), make an offer to all Holders of Senior Debt Securities of each
such series to purchase (a "Deficiency Offer") 10% of the principal amount of
Senior Debt Securities of each such series originally issued, or such lesser
amount as may be Outstanding at the time such Deficiency Offer is made (the
"Deficiency Offer Amount"), at a purchase price equal to 100% of principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the Deficiency Payment Date (as
defined below). Thereafter, semiannually the Company shall make like Deficiency
Offers for the then applicable Deficiency Offer Amount of Senior Debt Securities
of each such series until the Company's Subordinated Capital Base as at the end
of any subsequent fiscal quarter shall be equal to or greater than the Minimum
Subordinated Capital Base. Notwithstanding the foregoing, after any specified
Deficiency Date, the last day of any subsequent fiscal quarter shall not
constitute a Deficiency Date (giving rise to an additional obligation under the
first sentence of this paragraph) unless the Company's Subordinated Capital Base
was equal to or greater than the Minimum Subordinated Capital Base as at the end
of a fiscal quarter that followed such specified Deficiency Date and preceded
such subsequent quarter.

Within 60 days (105 days if the Deficiency Date is also the end of the
Company's fiscal year) following a Deficiency Date, the Company shall mail a
notice to each Holder of Senior Debt Securities of the applicable series in
respect of the Deficiency Offer (which notice shall contain all instructions and
materials necessary to enable such Holders to tender Senior Debt Securities).
Senior Debt Securities tendered pursuant to a Deficiency Offer will be accepted
for payment, in amounts as set forth below, on the date which shall be 20
Business Days from the date such notice is mailed or, if acceptance for payment
and payment is not then lawful, on the earliest subsequent Business Day on which
acceptance for payment and payment is then lawful (a "Deficiency Payment Date").

On a Deficiency Payment Date, the Company shall accept for payment Senior
Debt Securities of each applicable series or portions thereof tendered pursuant
to the Deficiency Offer in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Deficiency
Offer Amount or such lesser principal amount of such Senior Debt Securities as
shall have been tendered, and deposit with the Paying Agent money sufficient to
pay the purchase price of all such Senior Debt Securities or portions thereof so
accepted. If the aggregate principal amount of such Senior Debt Securities
tendered exceeds the Deficiency Offer Amount, the Company shall select the
Senior Debt Securities to be purchased on a pro rata basis to the nearest $1,000
of principal amount. The Paying Agent shall promptly mail or deliver to Holders
of Senior Debt Securities so accepted payment in amounts equal to the purchase
prices therefor, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall promptly
authenticate and mail or make available for delivery to such Holders new Senior
Debt Securities of the same series as, and equal in principal amounts to, any
unpurchased portion of the Senior Debt Securities surrendered. The Company will
publicly announce the results of the Deficiency Offer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that (1) the making of a
Deficiency Offer by the Company or (2) the purchase of Senior Debt Securities by
the Company in respect of a Deficiency Offer would constitute a default (with
the giving of notice, the passage of time or both) with respect to any Specified
Bank Debt at the time outstanding in an aggregate principal amount greater than
$25 million, then, in lieu of the making of a Deficiency Offer in the
circumstances set forth above, (i) the interest rate on the Senior Debt
Securities of each applicable series shall be reset as of the first day of the
second fiscal quarter following the Deficiency Date (the "Reset Date") to a rate
per annum (the "Reset Rate") equal to the greater of (x) the initial interest
rate as set forth on the face of the Senior Debt Security (the "Initial Interest
Rate") and (y) the sum of (A) the basis points specified in the applicable Board
Resolution or supplemental indenture for purposes of this reset provision and
(B) the highest of the treasury rates specified in the applicable Board
Resolution or supplemental indenture for purposes of this reset provision, (ii)
on the first Interest Payment Date following the Reset Date, the interest rate
on the Senior Debt Securities of each such series, as reset on the Reset Date,
shall increase by 50 basis points, and (iii) the interest rate on the Senior
Debt Securities of each such series shall further increase by an additional 50
basis points on each succeeding Interest Payment Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in no event shall the interest rate on the Senior Debt Securities of
any such series at any time exceed the Initial Interest Rate by more than 200
basis points. If the Company's Subordinated Capital Base falls below $1 billion,
the Company would be in default of certain covenants in the Credit Agreements as
in effect on the date hereof.

Once the interest rate on the Senior Debt Securities of any series has been
reset as set forth above, if the Company's Subordinated Capital Base is equal to
or greater than the Minimum Subordinated Capital Base as of the last day of any
fiscal quarter subsequent to the Deficiency Date, interest on the Senior Debt
Securities of each such

22
<PAGE>
series shall return to the Initial Interest Rate effective as of the first day
of the second following fiscal quarter; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the interest
rate on the Senior Debt Securities of each such series shall again be adjusted
as set forth above if the Company's Subordinated Capital Base shall thereafter
be less than the Minimum Subordinated Capital Base as at the last day of each of
any two consecutive subsequent fiscal quarters and if the making of a Deficiency
Offer or the purchase of Senior Debt Securities by the Company in respect of a
Deficiency Offer would, at such time, constitute a default (with the giving of
notice, passage of time or both) with respect to any Specified Bank Debt at the
time outstanding in an aggregate principal amount greater than $25 million.

The Company shall notify the Trustee of the Reset Rate not later than two
Business Days after the Reset Date in the circumstances set forth in the second
preceding paragraph. Not later than five Business Days after the Trustee has
received such notice from the Company, the Trustee shall mail to each Holder of
Senior Debt Securities of the applicable series such notice setting forth the
Reset Rate. The Company shall notify the Trustee and the Holders of such Senior
Debt Securities promptly when the interest rate on such Debt Securities returns
to the Initial Interest Rate as set forth above.

With respect to any Deficiency Offer, the Company intends to comply with the
requirements of Section 14(e) and Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, if then
applicable.

LIMITATION ON FUTURE INCURRENCE OF INDEBTEDNESS

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that the Company will not, and
will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, incur, create, assume, guarantee
or in any other manner become directly or indirectly liable with respect to or
responsible for the payment of, any Indebtedness, except: (1) Permitted
Indebtedness; and (2) Indebtedness of the Company if at the time thereof and
after giving effect thereto the Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of the
Company, on a pro forma basis for the four most recent quarters, taken as a
whole (giving effect to (i) such Indebtedness and (ii) the effect on the
Consolidated Cash Flow Available for Fixed Charges of the Company for the then
four most recent full fiscal quarters, taken as a whole, as a result of any
acquisition of a Person acquired by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
with the proceeds of such Indebtedness), would be greater than 1.75 to 1.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, guarantee, or in any other manner become directly or
indirectly liable with respect to or responsible for the payment of,
Indebtedness of any Unrestricted Subsidiary in an amount greater than, for all
guaranties and undertakings of responsibility by the Company and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, 20% of the aggregate amount of Indebtedness of such Unrestricted
Subsidiary.

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that the Company will not, and
will not permit any Subsidiary of the Company to, directly or indirectly, (1)
declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution, in cash or otherwise, in
respect of any shares of Capital Stock of the Company or to the holders of
Capital Stock of the Company as such (other than dividends or distributions
payable in shares of Capital Stock of the Company, other than Redeemable Stock)
or (2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value any of the
Capital Stock of the Company or options, warrants or other rights to acquire any
such Capital Stock, other than acquisitions of Capital Stock or such options,
warrants or other rights by any Subsidiary of the Company from the Company (any
such transaction included in clause (1) or (2), a "Restricted Payment") if (i)
at the time of such Restricted Payment and after giving effect thereto, (a) an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to any
series of the Senior Debt Securities or (b) the Consolidated Net Worth of the
Company shall be less than $750 million; or if (ii) after giving effect to such
Restricted Payment, the aggregate amount expended subsequent to the date of the
Senior Debt Securities Indenture for all such Restricted Payments (the amount of
any Restricted Payment, if other than cash, to be the fair market value of such
payment as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose reasonable
determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a Board Resolution) exceed
the algebraic sum of (w) a number calculated as follows: (A) if the aggregate
Consolidated Net Income of the Company earned on a cumulative basis during the
period subsequent to September 30, 1991 through the end of the last fiscal
quarter that is prior to the declaration of any such dividend or distribution or
the giving of notice of such purchase, redemption or other acquisition or
retirement and for which such financial information is then available, is a
positive number, then 100% of such positive number, and (B) if the aggregate
Consolidated Net Income of the Company earned on a cumulative basis during the
period subsequent to September 30, 1991 through the end of the last fiscal
quarter that

23
<PAGE>
is prior to the declaration of any such dividend or distribution or the giving
of notice of such purchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement and
for which such financial information is then available, is a negative number,
then 100% of such negative number, (x) the aggregate net cash proceeds received
by the Company from the issuance and sale, other than to a Subsidiary of the
Company, subsequent to the date of the Senior Debt Securities Indenture, of
Capital Stock (including Capital Stock issued upon the conversion of, or in
exchange for, securities other than Capital Stock and options, warrants or other
rights to acquire Capital Stock, but excluding Redeemable Stock, (y) the
aggregate net cash proceeds received by the Company from the issuance and sale,
other than to a Subsidiary of the Company, of Indebtedness of the Company that
is converted into Capital Stock of the Company subsequent to the date of the
Senior Debt Securities Indenture, and (z) $300 million; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the retirement of any shares of the Company's Capital Stock by exchange for, or
out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of, other shares of
Capital Stock of the Company other than Redeemable Stock shall not constitute a
Restricted Payment. If all of the conditions to the declaration of a dividend or
distribution that are described above are satisfied at the time such dividend or
distribution is declared, then such dividend or distribution may be paid or made
within sixty days after such declaration even if the payment of such dividend,
the making of such distribution or the declaration thereof would not have been
permitted at any time after such declaration.

LIMITATION ON FUTURE LIENS AND GUARANTIES

Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Debt Securities Indenture, if the
Company or any Subsidiary shall create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any
Lien upon any of the assets of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company
(whether such assets are owned at the date of the Senior Debt Securities
Indenture or thereafter acquired) as a security for (1) any Indebtedness or
other obligation (whether unconditional or contingent) of the Company that ranks
PARI PASSU with the Senior Debt Securities or any Indebtedness or other
obligation (whether unconditional or contingent) of a Subsidiary of the Company,
the Company will secure or will cause such Subsidiary to guarantee and secure
the Outstanding Senior Debt Securities equally and ratably with (or, at the
option of the Company, prior to) such Indebtedness or other obligation, so long
as such Indebtedness or other obligation shall be so secured, or (2) any
Subordinated Indebtedness, the Company will secure the Outstanding Senior Debt
Securities prior to such Subordinated Indebtedness, so long as such Subordinated
Indebtedness shall be so secured; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this covenant does not
apply in the case of Permitted Liens or Liens granted by any Unrestricted
Subsidiary to secure Indebtedness or other obligations of itself or of any
Person other than the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Senior Debt Securities Indenture,
the Company will not guarantee the Indebtedness of any Subsidiary and will not
permit any Subsidiary (including Stone Savannah River Pulp & Paper Corporation
and Seminole Kraft Corporation) to guarantee (i) any Indebtedness of the Company
that ranks PARI PASSU with the Senior Debt Securities, (ii) any Indebtedness of
a Subsidiary of the Company or (iii) any Subordinated Indebtedness; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that this paragraph does not apply to (1) any guaranty by a Subsidiary
if such Subsidiary also guarantees the Senior Debt Securities on a PARI PASSU
basis with respect to guaranties of Indebtedness described in clauses (i) and
(ii) and on a senior basis with respect to guaranties of Indebtedness described
in clause (iii); (2) any guaranty existing on the date of the Senior Debt
Securities Indenture or any extension or renewal of such guaranty to the extent
such extension or renewal is for the same or a lesser amount; (3) any guaranty
which constitutes Indebtedness permitted by clause (v) or (vi) of the definition
of Permitted Indebtedness granted by a Person permitted to incur such
Indebtedness; (4) any guaranty by the Company of Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary, PROVIDED that (A) incurrence of such Indebtedness of the Restricted
Subsidiary is not prohibited by the Senior Debt Securities Indenture and (B) (x)
such guaranty constitutes Indebtedness of the Company incurred as Permitted
Indebtedness pursuant to clause (vii) or (viii) of the definition of Permitted
Indebtedness (it being understood that, for purposes of determining Permitted
Indebtedness, any such guaranty shall be deemed to constitute Indebtedness
separate from, and, in addition to, Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary
which is so guaranteed) or (y) immediately prior to and (on a pro forma basis)
after granting such guaranty, the Company would be permitted to incur an
additional dollar of Indebtedness (not constituting Permitted Indebtedness)
under the restrictions described in "Limitation on Future Incurrence of
Indebtedness" above; (5) any guaranty by an Unrestricted Subsidiary of
Indebtedness or other obligations of any Person other than the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries; (6) any guaranty by the Company or any Subsidiary
(including Stone Savannah River Pulp & Paper Corporation and Seminole Kraft
Corporation) of Indebtedness or other

24
<PAGE>
obligations constituting Indebtedness permitted by clause (i)(a) of the
definition of Permitted Indebtedness in a principal amount not exceeding the
principal amount outstanding or committed under the Credit Agreements (including
any letter of credit facility, but without duplication with respect to
commitments for loans the use of proceeds of which is restricted to repayment of
other Indebtedness under the Credit Agreements) as of the date of the Senior
Debt Securities Indenture, plus $250 million and less the proceeds from the sale
of all Senior Debt Securities issued from time to time that are applied to repay
Indebtedness under the Credit Agreements); (7) any guaranty by the Company of
Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the date of the Senior
Debt Securities Indenture which is not subordinated to any Indebtedness of such
Restricted Subsidiary, and any renewal extension or refinancing of such
Indebtedness permitted by the Senior Debt Securities Indenture; (8) any guaranty
by the Company of Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is organized
under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States or any subdivision
thereof, PROVIDED that the incurrence of such Indebtedness of such Restricted
Subsidiary is not prohibited by the Senior Debt Securities Indenture; (9) any
guaranty by a Restricted Subsidiary that is organized under the laws of a
jurisdiction other than the United States or any subdivision thereof of the
Indebtedness of any of its Subsidiaries that is a Restricted Subsidiary and that
is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction other than the United States or
any subdivision thereof, PROVIDED that incurrence of such Indebtedness of such
Restricted Subsidiary is not prohibited by the Senior Debt Securities Indenture;
(10) any guaranty by the Company or a Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other
obligations in a principal amount not exceeding $250,000; (11) any guaranty in
the form of an endorsement of negotiable instruments for deposit or collection
and similar transactions; (12) any guaranty arising under or in connection with

outstanding; (13) any guaranty by a Subsidiary of Indebtedness or other
obligations of another Subsidiary in effect at the time of such guarantor
becoming a Subsidiary and not created in contemplation thereof; or (14) any
guaranty by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of any Interest Swap
Obligation, Currency Agreement or Commodities Agreement relating to Indebtedness
that is guaranteed pursuant to another clause of this paragraph.

LIMITATION ON ASSET DISPOSITIONS

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that so long as any of the
Senior Debt Securities are Outstanding, (i) the Company will not, and will not
permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any Asset Disposition unless the
Company (or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) receives
consideration at the time of such Asset Disposition at least equal to the fair
market value for the assets sold or otherwise disposed of (which shall be
determined in good faith (x) in the case of dispositions of assets having a fair
market value of $10 million or more, by the Board of Directors of the Company,
whose reasonable determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a Board
Resolution, or (y) in the case of dispositions of assets having a fair market
value of less than $10 million but not less than $5 million, an officer of the
Company, whose reasonable determination shall be conclusive and evidenced by a
certificate of such officer) and (ii) the Company will apply the aggregate net
proceeds in excess of $300 million received by the Company or any Restricted
Subsidiary from all Asset Dispositions occurring subsequent to the date of the
Senior Debt Securities Indenture (but excluding for purposes of this clause
(ii), whether before or after the receipt of net proceeds in excess of $300
million, (1) the net proceeds of any Asset Disposition or series of related
Asset Dispositions where the net proceeds are less than $5 million and (2) the
first $25 million of net proceeds in each fiscal year without taking into
account any amount excluded pursuant to (1)) as follows: (a) to the payment or
prepayment of any Senior Indebtedness within six months of such Asset
Disposition, or (b) to investment in the business of the Company and its
Restricted Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, by acquiring equity,
other than Redeemable Stock, of the transferee of such Asset Disposition) within
six months of such Asset Disposition or, if such investment is with respect to a
project to be completed within a period greater than six months from such Asset
Disposition, then within the period of time necessary to complete such project;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (x) in the case of applications contemplated by clause
(b), the Board of Directors has, within such six-month period, adopted in good
faith a resolution committing such excess proceeds to such investment, (y)
except as provided in the next sentence, none of such excess proceeds shall be
used to make any Restricted Payment or any payment in respect of Subordinated
Indebtedness and (z) to the extent not applied in accordance with clauses (a) or
(b) above, or if after being so applied there remain excess net proceeds in an
amount greater than $10 million, the Company shall make a pro rata offer to all
Holders to purchase Senior Debt Securities at 100% of principal amount, plus
accrued and unpaid interest to the Asset Disposition Payment Date (as defined
below), up to an aggregate principal amount equal to such excess net proceeds
(the "Asset Disposition Offer Amount"). If after

25
<PAGE>
being applied in accordance with clauses (a), (b) and (z) above there remain
excess net proceeds, the Company will apply such excess net proceeds to the
general corporate purposes of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company. An
offer to purchase Senior Debt Securities required to be made pursuant to this
covenant is an "Asset Disposition Offer" and the date on which the purchase of
Debt Securities relating to any such Asset Disposition Offer is to be made is an
"Asset Disposition Payment Date."

Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries receives securities or other non-cash property or assets
as proceeds of an Asset Disposition (other than equity in the transferee not
constituting Redeemable Stock), the Company shall not be required to make any
application required by the preceding paragraph until it receives cash proceeds
from a sale, repayment, exchange, redemption or retirement of or extraordinary
dividend or return of capital on such non-cash property, except that if and to
the extent the sum of all cash proceeds plus the fair market value of equity
(other than Redeemable Stock) in the transferee of such Asset Disposition
received at the time of such Asset Disposition is less than 70% of the fair
market value of the total proceeds of such Asset Disposition (with such fair
market value determined and evidenced in the same manner as stated in clause (i)
of the preceding paragraph), the amount of such deficiency (the "Deficiency
Amount") shall be applied as required by the preceding paragraph as if received
at the time of the Asset Disposition. Any amounts deferred pursuant to the
preceding sentence shall be applied in accordance with the preceding paragraph
when cash proceeds are thereafter received from a sale, repayment, exchange,
redemption or retirement of or extraordinary dividend or return of capital on
such non-cash property; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be
required to apply with respect to any equity interest in a transferee an amount
exceeding the fair market value attributable to such equity interest at the time
of the Asset Disposition; and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if a Deficiency Amount was
applied pursuant to the exception contained in the preceding sentence, then once
the cumulative amount of applications made pursuant to the preceding paragraph
and this paragraph (including any Deficiency Amount) equals 100% of the fair
market value of the total proceeds of the Asset Disposition at the time of such
Asset Disposition, cash proceeds thereafter received from a sale, repayment,
exchange, redemption or retirement of or extraordinary dividend or return of
capital on such non-cash property shall not be required to be applied in
accordance with the preceding paragraph except to the extent such cash proceeds
exceed the Deficiency Amount.

Notice of an Asset Disposition Offer shall be mailed on behalf of the
Company by the Trustee to all Holders of Senior Debt Securities at their last
registered addresses not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days before the
Asset Disposition Payment Date, which shall be a date not more than 210 days
after the Asset Disposition giving rise to such Asset Disposition Offer. The
Asset Disposition Offer shall remain open from the time of the mailing of such
notice until not more than 5 Business Days before the Asset Disposition Payment
Date.

On the Asset Disposition Payment Date, the Company shall accept for payment
Senior Debt Securities or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Asset
Disposition Offer in an aggregate principal amount equal to the Asset
Disposition Offer Amount or such lesser amount of Senior Debt Securities as
shall have been tendered, and deposit with the Paying Agent money sufficient to
pay the purchase price of all Senior Debt Securities or portions thereof so
accepted. If the aggregate principal amount of Senior Debt Securities tendered
exceeds the Asset Disposition Offer Amount, the Company shall select the Senior
Debt Securities to be purchased on a pro rata basis to the nearest $1,000 of
principal amount. The Paying Agent shall promptly mail or deliver to Holders of
Senior Debt Securities so accepted payment in an amount equal to the purchase
price, and the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate
and mail or make available for delivery to such Holders a new Senior Debt
Security of the applicable series and equal in principal amount to any
unpurchased portion of the Senior Debt Security surrendered. The Company will
publicly announce the results of the Asset Disposition Offer.

With respect to any Asset Disposition Offer, the Company intends to comply
with the requirements of Section 14(e) and Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act, if
applicable.

RESTRICTIONS ON MERGERS AND CONSOLIDATIONS AND SALES OF ASSETS

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that the Company shall not
consolidate with, merge with or into any other corporation (whether or not the
Company shall be the surviving corporation), or sell, assign, transfer or lease
all or substantially all of its properties and assets as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety to any Person or group of affiliated Persons, in
one transaction or a series of related transactions, unless: (1) either the
Company

26
<PAGE>
shall be the continuing Person or the Person (if other than the Company) formed
by such consolidation or with which or into which the Company is merged or the
Person (or group of affiliated Persons) to which all or substantially all the
properties and assets of the Company are sold, assigned, transferred or leased
is a corporation (or constitute corporations) organized under the laws of the
United States or any State thereof or the District of Columbia and expressly
assumes, by an indenture supplemental to the Senior Debt Securities Indenture,
all the obligations of the Company under the Senior Debt Securities and the
Senior Debt Securities Indenture; (2) immediately before and after giving effect
to such transaction, no Event of Default, and no Default, with respect to the
Senior Debt Securities shall have occurred and be continuing; (3) immediately
after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis, but prior to any
purchase accounting adjustments resulting from the transaction, the Consolidated
Net Worth of the Company (or of the surviving, consolidated or transferee entity
if the Company is not continuing, treating such entity as the Company for
purposes of determining Consolidated Net Worth) shall be at least equal to the
Consolidated Net Worth of the Company immediately before such transaction; (4)
immediately after giving effect to such transaction the Company (or the
surviving, consolidated or transferee entity if the Company is not continuing,
but treating such entity as the Company for purposes of making such
determination) would be permitted to incur an additional dollar of Indebtedness
(not constituting Permitted Indebtedness) immediately prior to such transaction
under the covenant contained in the Senior Debt Securities Indenture restricting
the incurrence of Indebtedness; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this clause (4) shall be
inapplicable if (a) such transaction would result in the occurrence of a Change
of Control or (b) immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction, the
Company would not be permitted to incur an additional dollar of Indebtedness
(not constituting Permitted Indebtedness) under such covenant, and immediately
after giving effect to such transaction on a pro forma basis (but prior to any
purchase accounting adjustments resulting from the transaction), the
Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of the Company (or the surviving,
consolidated or transferee entity if the Company is not continuing, treating
such entity as the Company for purposes of determining the Consolidated Interest
Coverage Ratio) shall be at least equal to the Consolidated Interest Coverage
Ratio of the Company immediately before such transaction; and (5) the Company
shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel, each stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such
supplemental indenture comply with the Senior Debt Securities Indenture.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if clause (4) of the preceding sentence is
inapplicable by reason of clause (b) of the proviso thereto, and at the date
three months after the consummation of such transaction the rating ascribed to
the Senior Debt Securities of any series by Standard and Poor's Corporation or
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. shall be lower than the rating ascribed to the
Senior Debt Securities of any series prior to the public announcement of such
transaction, then the Company shall make an offer for the Senior Debt Securities
of each series at the same price and following the same procedures and
obligations as required with respect to a Change of Control (as if such date
three months after the giving effect to such transaction were the "Change of
Control Date"). See "Limitation on Future Incurrence of Indebtedness" above and
"Change of Control" below.

If, upon any consolidation or merger, or upon any sale, assignment, transfer
or lease, as provided in the preceding paragraph, any material property of the
Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or any shares of Capital Stock or
Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary, owned immediately prior thereto,
would thereupon become subject to any Lien securing any indebtedness for
borrowed money of, or guaranteed by, such other corporation or Person (other
than any Permitted Lien), the Company, prior to such consolidation, merger,
sale, assignment, transfer or lease, will secure the due and punctual payment of
the principal of, and premium, if any, and interest on the Senior Debt
Securities of each series then Outstanding (together with, if the Company shall
so determine, any other indebtedness of, or guaranteed by, the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary and then existing or thereafter created) equally and
ratably with (or, at the option of the Company, prior to) the Indebtedness
secured by such Lien.

CHANGE OF CONTROL

Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (the "Change of Control Date")
and subject to the requirements of the next succeeding sentence, each Holder
shall have the right to require that the Company repurchase such Holder's Senior
Debt Securities pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control
Offer") at a purchase price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of
such Senior Debt Securities plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the
date of such repurchase. If such repurchase would constitute an event of default
under Specified Bank Debt, then, prior to giving the notice to Holders provided
below, the Senior Debt Securities

27
<PAGE>
Indenture requires the Company to (1) repay in full in cash such Specified Bank
Debt or (2) obtain the requisite consent of holders of such Specified Bank Debt
to permit the repurchase of Senior Debt Securities without giving rise to an
event of default under such Specified Bank Debt.

As of September 30, 1993, approximately $1.7 billion of Specified Bank Debt
was outstanding.

Promptly upon satisfaction of either one of the obligations described above,
the Company shall mail a notice to each Holder of Senior Debt Securities of each
applicable series in respect of the Change of Control Offer (which notice shall
contain all instructions and materials necessary to enable such Holders to
tender Senior Debt Securities). All Senior Debt Securities of each applicable
series tendered will be accepted for payment on a date (the "Change of Control
Payment Date") which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 40 days
from the date such notice is mailed, but in any event prior to the date on which
any Subordinated Indebtedness is paid pursuant to the terms of a provision
similar to the Change of Control Offer covenant.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall accept for payment
Senior Debt Securities of each applicable series or portions thereof tendered
pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, and deposit with the Paying Agent money
sufficient to pay the purchase price of all Senior Debt Securities of each
applicable series or portions thereof so accepted. The Paying Agent shall
promptly mail or deliver to the Holder of Senior Debt Securities of each
applicable series so accepted payment in an amount equal to the purchase price,
and the Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail or make available for
delivery to such Holder a new Senior Debt Security of the same series as, and
equal in principal amount to, any unpurchased portion of the Senior Debt
Security surrendered. The Company will publicly announce the results of the
Change of Control Offer.

Whether a Change of Control has occurred depends entirely on the
accumulation of Common Stock of the Company and on certain changes in the
composition of the Company's Board of Directors. As a result, the Company can
enter into certain highly leveraged transactions, including certain
recapitalizations, mergers or stock repurchases, that would not result in the
application of the Change of Control provisions. Because the definitions of
"Change of Control" and "Acquiring Person" exclude the Company, any Subsidiary
of the Company and certain members of the Stone family, certain transactions in
which such entities and persons participate as beneficial owners of Common Stock
(including, among others, a leveraged buyout or recapitalization) would not
constitute a Change of Control. With respect to any Change of Control Offer, the
Company intends to comply with the requirements of Section 14(e) and Rule 14e-1
under the Exchange Act, if then applicable.

RANKING OF SENIOR DEBT SECURITIES

The payment of the principal of, interest on and any other amounts due on
Subordinated Indebtedness will be subordinated in right of payment to the prior
payment in full of the Senior Debt Securities. The Senior Debt Securities are
senior to the Company's $150 million aggregate principal amount of 10 3/4%
Senior Subordinated Notes due June 15, 1997, $125 million aggregate principal
amount of 11% Senior Subordinated Notes due August 15, 1999, $230 million
aggregate principal amount of 11 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due September 1,
1999, $200 million aggregate principal amount of 10 3/4% Senior Subordinated
Debentures due April 1, 2002, $250 million aggregate principal amount of 8 7/8%
Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due July 15, 2000, $98 million aggregate
principal amount of 13 5/8% Subordinated Notes due June 1, 1995, and $115
million aggregate principal amount of 6 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures
due February 15, 2007.

EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND NOTICE THEREOF

The following are Events of Default under the Senior Debt Securities
Indenture with respect to Senior Debt Securities of any series: (1) failure to
pay interest on any Senior Debt Security of that series when due, continued for
30 days; (2) failure to pay the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Senior
Debt Securities of that series when due and payable at Maturity, upon
redemption, upon repurchase pursuant to a Deficiency Offer as described under
"Maintenance of Subordinated Capital Base" above, pursuant to an Asset
Disposition Offer as described under "Change of Control" above or otherwise; (3)
failure to observe or perform any other covenant, warranty or agreement
contained in the Senior Debt Securities of that series or in the Senior Debt
Securities Indenture (other than a covenant, agreement or warranty included in
the Senior Debt Securities Indenture solely for the benefit of Senior Debt
Securities other than that series), continued for a period of 60 days after
notice has been given to the Company by the Trustee or Holders of at least 25%
in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Debt

28
<PAGE>
Securities of that series; (4) failure to pay at final maturity, or acceleration
of, Indebtedness of the Company having an aggregate principal amount of not less
than $25 million (or, if less, the least amount contained in any similar
provision of an instrument governing any outstanding Subordinated Indebtedness
of the Company, but in no event less than $10 million), unless cured within 15
days after notice has been given to the Company by the Trustee or Holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Debt
Securities of that series; (5) the entering against the Company of one or more
judgments or decrees involving an aggregate liability of $25 million or more
unless vacated, discharged, satisfied or stayed within 30 days of the entering
of such judgments or decrees; (6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization relating to the Company; and (7) any other Event of Default with
respect to Senior Debt Securities of that series specified in the Prospectus
Supplement relating thereto.

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that the Trustee shall, within
30 days after the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default with respect to
Senior Debt Securities of any series, give the Holders of Senior Debt Securities
of that series notice of all uncured Defaults or Events of Default known to it
(the term "Default" to include the events specified above without grace or
notice); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, except in the case of an Event of Default or a
Default in payment on any Senior Debt Securities of any series, the Trustee
shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the board of
directors, the executive committee or directors or responsible officers of the
Trustee in good faith determine that the withholding of such notice is in the
interest of the Holders of Senior Debt Securities of that series.

If an Event of Default with respect to Senior Debt Securities of any series
(other than due to event of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization) occurs and
is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the Outstanding Senior Debt Securities of that series, by notice in
writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the Holders of at least
25% in aggregate amount of Senior Debt Securities of that series), may declare
the unpaid principal of and accrued interest to the date of acceleration on all
the Outstanding Senior Debt Securities of that series to be due and payable
immediately and, upon any such declaration, the Senior Debt Securities of that
series shall become immediately due and payable.

If an Event of Default occurs due to bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization, all unpaid principal (without premium) of and accrued interest
on the Outstanding Senior Debt Securities of any series ipso facto becomes
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of
the Trustee or any Holder of any Senior Debt Security of that series.

Any such declaration with respect to Senior Debt Securities of any series
may be annulled and past Events of Default and Defaults (except, unless
theretofore cured, an Event of Default or a Default, in payment of principal of
or interest on the Senior Debt Securities of that series) may be waived by the
Holders of a majority of the principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Debt
Securities, upon the conditions provided in the Senior Debt Securities
Indenture.

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture provides that the Company will
periodically file statements with the Trustee regarding compliance by the
Company with certain of the covenants thereof and specifying any Event of
Default or Defaults with respect to Senior Debt Securities of any series in
performing such covenants of which the signers may have knowledge.

MODIFICATION OF SENIOR DEBT SECURITIES INDENTURE; WAIVER

The Senior Debt Securities Indenture may be modified by the Company and the
Trustee without the consent of any Holders with respect to certain matters,
including (i) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or to correct or
supplement any provision which may be inconsistent with any other provision of
the Senior Debt Securities Indenture and (ii) to make any change that does not
materially adversely affect the interests of any Holder of Senior Debt
Securities of any series. In addition, under the Senior Debt Securities
Indenture, certain rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of
Holders of the Senior Debt Securities may be modified by the Company and the
Trustee with the written consent of the Holders of at least a majority in
principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Debt Securities of each series
affected thereby; but no extension of the maturity of any Senior Debt Securities
of any series, reduction in the interest rate or extension of the time for
payment of interest, change in the optional redemption or repurchase provisions
in a manner adverse to any Holder of Senior Debt Securities of any series,

29
<PAGE>
other modification in the terms of payment of the principal of or interest on
any Senior Debt Securities of any series, or reduction of the percentage
required for modification, will be effective against any Holder of any
Outstanding Senior Debt Security of any series affected thereby without his
consent. The Senior Debt Securities Indenture does not limit the aggregate
amount of Senior Debt Securities of the Company which may be issued thereunder.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Debt
Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all Senior Debt
Securities of that series waive, insofar as that series is concerned, compliance
by the Company with certain restrictive covenants of the Senior Debt Securities
Indenture. The Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Senior Debt Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of
all Senior Debt Securities of that series waive any past Event of Default or
Default under the Senior Debt Securities Indenture with respect to that series,
except an Event of Default or a Default in the payment of the principal of or
premium, if any, or any interest on any Senior Debt Security of that series or
in respect of a provision which under the Senior Debt Securities Indenture
cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of each
Outstanding Senior Debt Security of that series affected.

SATISFACTION AND DISCHARGE OF SENIOR DEBT SECURITIES INDENTURE; DEFEASANCE

The Company may terminate its substantive obligations in respect of Senior
Debt Securities of any series by delivering all Outstanding Senior Debt
Securities of that series to the Trustee for cancellation and paying all sums
payable by it on account of principal of and interest on all Senior Debt
Securities of that series or otherwise. The Company may terminate its
substantive obligations in respect of Senior Debt Securities of any series

series will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes

CERTAIN DEFINITIONS

For purposes of the Senior Debt Securities Indenture, certain defined terms
have the following meanings:

"ACQUIRING PERSON" means any Person or group (as defined in Section
13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) who or which, together with all affiliates and
associates (as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act), becomes the

(collectively, the "Stone Family"), or (v) any group which includes any member
or members of the Stone Family and a majority of the Common Stock of the Company

the number of shares outstanding, increases the proportionate number of shares
beneficially owned by such Person to more than 50% or more of the Common Stock
of the Company then outstanding; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if a Person shall
become the beneficial owner of more than 50% or more of the Common Stock of the

transfer or other disposition by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary to an
Unrestricted Subsidiary of the shares, property or assets referred to in clauses

PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, with respect to the Company, for purposes of the Senior
Debt

<PAGE>
Securities Indenture (other than the covenant referred to in the second
paragraph of "Limitation on Future Liens and Guaranties" above), "Subsidiary"
shall not include Stone Savannah River Pulp & Paper Corporation or Seminole
Kraft Corporation, each a Delaware corporation.

"UNRESTRICTED SUBSIDIARY" means a Subsidiary of the Company which has been
designated as an "Unrestricted Subsidiary" for purposes of the Senior Debt
Securities Indenture by the Company and (a) at least 20% of whose common stock
is held by one or more Persons (other than the Company and its Affiliates) which
acquired such common stock in a bona fide transaction for fair value and (b) at
least 10% of whose total capitalization at the time of designation is in the
form of common stock or at least 15% of the fair market value of whose assets at
such time shall have been contributed by such Person. An Unrestricted Subsidiary
may be designated to be a Restricted Subsidiary only if, at the time of such
designation, all Indebtedness and Liens of such Subsidiary could be incurred
under the Senior Debt Securities Indenture.

PARTICULAR TERMS OF THE SENIOR
SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES AND
SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES

The following description of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities and the
Subordinated Debt Securities sets forth the general terms and provisions of the
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities to which any
Prospectus Supplement may relate. Additional terms of the Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities and the Subordinated Debt Securities, respectively, are
described below. The specific terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
or Subordinated Debt Securities offered by any Prospectus Supplement and the
extent, if any, to which such general provisions may apply will be described in
the Prospectus Supplement relating to such Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
or Subordinated Debt Securities.

For purposes of the description of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
and the Subordinated Debt Securities under the captions "Particular Terms of the
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities and Subordinated Debt Securities,"
"Additional Terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities" and "Additional
Terms of the Subordinated Debt Securities," certain defined terms have the
following meanings:

"SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS" means the principal of, interest on and other amounts
due on (i) Indebtedness of the Company, whether outstanding on the dates of the
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture or the Subordinated Debt
Securities Indenture or thereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed by
the Company in compliance with the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture
or the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, for money borrowed from banks or
other financial institutions, including, without limitation, money borrowed
under the Credit Agreements and any refinancings or refundings thereof; (ii)
Indebtedness of the Company, whether outstanding on the dates of the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture or the Subordinated Debt Securities
Indenture or thereafter created, incurred, assumed or guaranteed by the Company
in compliance with the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture or the
Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, which is not Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness or Junior Subordinated Indebtedness; and (iii) Indebtedness of the
Company under interest rate swaps, caps or similar hedging agreements and
foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps or similar agreements.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, Senior Indebtedness
shall not include: (a) Indebtedness of or amounts owed by the Company for
compensation to employees, or for goods or materials purchased in the ordinary
course of business, or for services, or (b) Indebtedness of the Company to a
subsidiary of the Company.

"INDEBTEDNESS" means, with respect to any person, (i) any obligation of such
person to pay the principal of, premium, if any, interest on (including interest
accruing on or after the filing of any petition in bankruptcy or for
reorganization relating to the Company, whether or not a claim for such
post-petition interest is allowed in such proceeding), penalties, reimbursement
or indemnification amounts, fees, expenses or other amounts relating to any
indebtedness and any other liability, contingent or otherwise, of such person
(A) for borrowed money (whether or not the recourse of the lender is to the
whole of the assets of such person or only to a portion thereof), (B) evidenced
by a note, debenture or similar instrument (including a purchase money
obligation) given in connection with the acquisition of any property or assets
(other than inventory or similar property acquired in the ordinary course of
business), including securities, (C) for goods, materials or services purchased
in the ordinary

41
<PAGE>
course of business, (D) for any letter of credit or performance bond in favor of
such person, or (E) for the payment of money relating to a Capitalized Lease
Obligation; (ii) any liability of others of the kind described in the preceding
clause (i), which the person has guaranteed or which is otherwise its legal
liability; (iii) any obligation secured by a Lien to which the property or
assets of such person are subject, whether or not the obligations secured
thereby shall have been assumed by or shall otherwise be such person's legal
liability; and (iv) any and all deferrals, renewals, extensions and refunding
of, or amendments, modifications or supplements to, any liability of the kind
described in any of the preceding clauses (i), (ii) or (iii). The amount of
Indebtedness of any person at any date shall be the outstanding balance at such
date of all unconditional obligations as described above, plus the maximum
amount of any contingent obligations as described above, in each case at such
date.

"SENIOR SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS" means Indebtedness of the Company
(whether outstanding on the dates of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
Indenture or the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture or thereafter created,
incurred, assumed or guaranteed by the Company) which, pursuant to the terms of
the instrument creating or evidencing the same, is subordinate in right of
payment to the Senior Indebtedness and senior in right of payment to the Junior
Subordinated Indebtedness.

"JUNIOR SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS" means Indebtedness of the Company
(whether outstanding on the dates of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
Indenture or the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture or thereafter created,
incurred, assumed or guaranteed by the Company) which, pursuant to the terms of
the instrument creating or evidencing the same, is subordinate in right of
payment to the Senior Indebtedness and the Senior Subordinated Indebtedness.

CHANGE IN CONTROL

Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control (the "Change in Control Date")
and subject to the requirements of the next succeeding sentence, each Holder of
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities shall have
the right, at the Holder's option, to require the Company to purchase all or any
part (provided that the principal amount must be $1,000 or an integral multiple
thereof) of such Holder's Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated
Debt Securities pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change in Control
Offer") at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount of such Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities plus accrued and
unpaid interest, if any, to the date of such purchase. It shall be a condition
precedent to such right of any Holder to require the purchase of any such Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities that prior thereto,
and prior to giving the notice to Holders provided below, the Company shall have
first (1) repaid in full in cash all Specified Bank Debt or (2) obtained the
requisite consent of holders of such Specified Bank Debt to permit the purchase
of such Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities.

Promptly upon satisfaction of either one of the conditions precedent
described above, the Company shall mail a notice (which notice shall contain all
instructions and materials necessary to enable Holders to tender Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities) to each Holder of
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of each
applicable series. All Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt
Securities of each applicable series tendered will be accepted for payment on a
date which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 40 days from the date
such notice is mailed (the "Change in Control Payment Date").

On the Change in Control Payment Date, the Company shall accept for payment
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of each
applicable series or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the Change in Control
Offer, and deposit with the applicable Paying Agent money sufficient to pay the
purchase price of all Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt
Securities of each applicable series or portions thereof so accepted. The
applicable Paying Agent shall promptly mail or deliver to the Holder of Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of each applicable
series so accepted payment in an amount equal to the purchase price, and the
applicable Trustee shall promptly authenticate and mail or make available for
delivery to such Holder a new Senior Subordinated Debt Security or Subordinated
Debt Security of the same series as, and equal in principal amount to, any
unpurchased portion of the Senior Subordinated Debt Security or Subordinated
Debt Security surrendered. The Company will publicly announce the results of the
Change in Control Offer.

42
<PAGE>
Whether a Change in Control has occurred depends entirely on the
accumulation of Common Stock of the Company and on certain changes in the
composition of the Company's Board of Directors. As a result, the Company can
enter into certain highly leveraged transactions, including certain
recapitalizations, mergers or stock repurchases, that would not result in the
application of the Change in Control provisions. With respect to any Change in
Control Offer, the Company intends to comply with the requirements of Section
14(e), Rule 14e-1 and Rule 13e-4 under the Exchange Act, if then applicable.

The Change in Control purchase feature of the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities and the Subordinated Debt Securities may in certain circumstances
make more difficult or discourage a takeover of the Company and, thus, the
removal of incumbent management. The Change in Control purchase feature,
however, is not the result of management's knowledge of any specific effort to
accumulate shares of Common Stock or to obtain control of the Company by means
of a merger, tender offer, solicitation or otherwise, or part of a plan by
management to adopt a series of anti-takeover provisions. Instead, the Change in
Control purchase feature is a standard term contained in other similar debt
offerings. Change in control provisions are also contained in the Credit
Agreements and other indentures.

If a Change in Control were to occur, there can be no assurance that the
required condition precedent to a Holder's right to require the purchase of the
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities will be
satisfied. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company would have
sufficient funds to pay the required purchase price for all the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities tendered by the
Holders thereof. The Company's ability to purchase the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities tendered upon a Change in Control may
be limited by the terms of its then-existing borrowing and other agreements. The
subordination provisions of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture
and the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture may limit the ability of the
Company to purchase the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt
Securities if an event of default has occurred with respect to the Senior
Indebtedness. See "-- Additional Terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities -- Subordination" and "-- Additional Terms of the Subordinated Debt
Securities -- Subordination."

As of September 30, 1993, approximately $1.7 billion of Specified Bank Debt
was outstanding.

Because the definitions of "Change in Control" and "Acquiring Person"
exclude the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company and certain members of the
Stone family, certain transactions in which such entities and persons
participate as beneficial owners of Common Stock (including, among others, a
leveraged buyout or recapitalization) would not constitute a Change in Control.

Other provisions of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture or the
Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture may be applicable in the event of a
highly leveraged transaction by the Company. See "Description of Debt Securities
- -- Particular Terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities and Subordinated
Debt Securities -- Restrictions on Mergers and Consolidations and Sales of
Assets" and "-- Additional Terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities --
Minimum Net Worth Interest Rate Adjustment." The Board of Directors of the
Company may not unilaterally waive these provisions.

For purposes of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture and the
Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, the definitions of "Change in Control,"
"Acquiring Person," "Continuing Director" and "Specified Bank Debt" have
identical meanings as the definitions used in the Senior Debt Securities
Indenture except for references to the specific Debt Securities being issued and
the applicable Indenture. See "Description of Debt Securities -- Particular
Terms of the Senior Debt Securities -- Certain Definitions."

RESTRICTIONS ON MERGERS AND CONSOLIDATIONS AND SALES OF ASSETS

The Company shall not consolidate with, merge with or into any other
corporation (whether or not the Company shall be the surviving corporation), or
sell, assign, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its properties and
assets as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to any Person or group of
affiliated Persons, in one transaction or a series of related transactions,
unless: (1) either the Company shall be the continuing Person or the Person (if
other than the Company) formed by such consolidation or with which or into which
the Company is merged or the Person (or group of affiliated Persons) to which
all or substantially all the properties and assets of the Company are sold,
assigned, transferred or leased is a corporation (or constitute corporations)
organized under

43
<PAGE>
the laws of the United States or any State thereof or the District of Columbia
and expressly assumes, by indentures supplemental to the Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities Indenture or the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, as the
case may be, all the obligations of the Company under the Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities, as the case may be, and the
respective Indentures; (2) immediately before and after giving effect to such
transaction or series of related transactions, no Event of Default, and no
Default, with respect to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated
Debt Securities, as the case may be, shall have occurred and be continuing; (3)
immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of related
transactions on a pro forma basis, but prior to any purchase accounting
adjustments resulting from the transaction or series of related transactions,
the Net Worth of the Company (or of the surviving, consolidated or transferee
entity if the Company is not continuing) shall be at least equal to the Net
Worth of the Company immediately before such transaction or series of related
transactions; and (4) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an
Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that such
consolidation, merger or sale, assignment, transfer or lease and such
supplemental indentures comply with the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
Indenture or the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, as the case may be.

EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND NOTICE THEREOF

The following are Events of Default under the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities Indenture or the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, as the case
may be, with respect to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated
Debt Securities of any series: (1) failure to pay interest on any Debt
Securities of that series when due, continued for 30 days; (2) failure to pay
the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Debt Securities of that series
when due and payable at Maturity, upon redemption or otherwise; (3) failure to
observe or perform any other covenant, warranty or agreement contained in the
Debt Securities of that series or in the applicable Indenture (other than a
covenant, agreement or warranty included in the applicable Indenture solely for
the benefit of Debt Securities of a series other than that series), continued
for a period of 60 days after notice has been given to the Company by the
applicable Trustee or Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of
the Outstanding Debt Securities of that series; (4) failure to pay at final
maturity, or acceleration of, Indebtedness of the Company having an aggregate
principal amount of not less than $25 million, unless cured within 15 days after
notice has been given to the Company by the applicable Trustee or Holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of
that series; (5) the entering against the Company of one or more judgments or
decrees involving an aggregate liability of $25 million or more unless vacated,
discharged, satisfied or stayed within 30 days of the entering of such judgments
or decrees; (6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization
relating to the Company; and (7) any other Event of Default with respect to Debt
Securities of that series specified in the Prospectus Supplement relating
thereto.

Both of the applicable Indentures provides that the applicable Trustee
shall, within 30 days after the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default
with respect to Debt Securities of any series issued under such Indenture, give
the Holders of Debt Securities of that series notice of all uncured Defaults or
Events of Default known to it (the term "Default" to include the events
specified above without grace or notice); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, EXCEPT in the
case of an Event of Default or a Default in payment on any Debt Securities of
any series, the applicable Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice
if and so long as the board of directors, the executive committee or directors
or responsible officers of the applicable Trustee in good faith determine that
the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders of the Debt
Securities of that series.

If an Event of Default with respect to the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any series (other than due to
events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization) occurs and is continuing,
the applicable Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the Outstanding Debt Securities of that series, by notice in writing
to the Company (and to the applicable Trustee if given by the Holders of at
least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities of that series),
may declare the unpaid principal of and accrued interest to the date of
acceleration on all the Outstanding Debt Securities of that series to be due and
payable immediately and, upon any such declaration, the Debt Securities of that
series shall become immediately due and payable.

If an Event of Default occurs due to bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization, all unpaid principal (without premium) of and accrued interest
on the Outstanding Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt

44
<PAGE>
Securities of any series IPSO FACTO becomes immediately due and payable without
any declaration or other act on the part of the applicable Trustee or any Holder
of any Senior Subordinated Debt Security or Subordinated Debt Security of that
series.

Any such declaration with respect to Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or
Subordinated Debt Securities of any series may be annulled and past Events of
Default and Defaults (except, unless theretofore cured, an Event of Default or a
Default, in payment of principal of or interest on the Debt Securities of that
series) may be waived by the Holders of a majority of the principal amount of
the Outstanding Debt Securities of that series, upon the conditions provided in
the applicable Indenture.

The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture and the Subordinated Debt
Securities Indenture provide that the Company shall periodically file statements
with the Trustees regarding compliance by the Company with certain of the
respective covenants thereof and shall specify any Event of Default or Defaults
with respect to Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt
Securities of any series, in performing such covenants, of which the signers may
have knowledge.

MODIFICATION OF THE INDENTURES; WAIVER

The Indentures applicable to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities and the
Subordinated Debt Securities may be modified by the Company and the applicable
Trustee without the consent of any Holders with respect to certain matters,
including (i) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency or to correct or
supplement any provision which may be inconsistent with any other provision of
the applicable Indenture and (ii) to make any change that does not materially
adversely affect the interests of any Holder of Debt Securities of any series
issued under such Indenture. In addition, under both of the Indentures, certain
rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of Holders of the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities may be modified by
the Company and the applicable Trustee with the written consent of the Holders
of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of each series
affected thereby; but no extension of the maturity of any Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any series, reduction in the
interest rate or extension of the time for payment of interest, change in the
optional redemption or repurchase provisions in a manner adverse to any Holder
of Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any
series issued under the applicable Indenture, other modification in the terms of
payment of the principal of, or interest on, any Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any series, or reduction of the
percentage required for modification, will be effective against any Holder of
any Outstanding Senior Subordinated Debt Security or Subordinated Debt Security
of any series issued under the applicable Indenture and affected thereby without
his consent. Neither of the Indentures limits the aggregate amount of Debt
Securities of the Company which may be issued thereunder.

The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any
series may on behalf of the Holders of all Debt Securities of that series waive,
insofar as that series is concerned, compliance by the Company with certain
restrictive covenants of the applicable Indenture. The Holders of not less than
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any series may on behalf of
the Holders of all Debt Securities of that series waive any past Event of
Default or Default under the applicable Indenture with respect to that series,
except an Event of Default or a Default in the payment of the principal of, or
premium, if any, or any interest on any Debt Securities of that series or in
respect of a provision which under the applicable Indenture cannot be modified
or amended without the consent of the Holder of each Outstanding Debt Security
of that series affected.

DEFEASANCE

The Company may terminate its substantive obligations in respect of Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities or Subordinated Debt Securities of any series
(except for its obligations to pay the principal of (and premium, if any, on)
and the interest on the Debt Securities of that series) by (i) depositing with
the applicable Trustee, under the terms of an irrevocable trust agreement, money
or United States Government Obligations sufficient to pay all remaining
indebtedness on the Debt Securities of that series, (ii) delivering to the
applicable Trustee either an Opinion of Counsel or a ruling directed to the
applicable Trustee from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the
Holders of the Debt Securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or
loss for federal income tax

45
<PAGE>
purposes as a result of such deposit and termination of obligations, and (iii)
complying with certain other requirements set forth in the applicable Indenture.
In addition, the Company may terminate all of its substantive obligations in
respect of Senior Subordinated Debt Securities or the Subordinated Debt
Securities of any series (including its obligations to pay the principal of (and
premium, if any, on) and interest on the Debt Securities of that series) by (i)
depositing with the applicable Trustee, under the terms of an irrevocable trust
agreement, money or United States Government Obligations sufficient to pay all
remaining indebtedness on the Debt Securities of that series, (ii) delivering to
the applicable Trustee either a ruling directed to the applicable Trustee from
the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the Holders of the Debt
Securities of that series will not recognize income, gain or loss for federal
income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and termination of obligations
or an Opinion of Counsel, based upon such a ruling or a change in the applicable
federal tax law since the date of the applicable Indenture, to such effect, and
(iii) complying with certain other requirements set forth in the applicable
Indenture.

THE TRUSTEES

Norwest Bank Minnesota, National Association, is the Trustee under the
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, and The Bank of New York is the
Trustee under the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture.

The Company maintains normal commercial banking relations with The Bank of
New York, which is also a lender under the Credit Agreements and the Trustee
under the Senior Debt Securities Indenture and other indentures of the Company.
In addition, Norwest Bank Minnesota, National Association, is the trustee of the
indenture relating to the 8 7/8% Convertible Notes.

ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE SENIOR SUBORDINATED
DEBT SECURITIES

The following terms apply solely to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities.
See "Description of Debt Securities -- Particular Terms of the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities and Subordinated Debt Securities" for other terms
which are also applicable to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities. The
particular terms of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities offered by any
Prospectus Supplement and the extent, if any, to which such general provisions
may apply to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities so offered will be
described in the Prospectus Supplement relating to such Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities.

SUBORDINATION

The payment of the principal of, interest on or any other amounts due on the
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities will be subordinated in right of payment to
the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company. No payment
on account of principal of, redemption of, interest on or any other amounts due
on the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities and no redemption, purchase or other
acquisition of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities may be made unless (i)
full payment of amounts then due for principal, sinking funds, interest
(including interest accruing on or after the filing of any petition in
bankruptcy or for reorganization relating to the Company, whether or not a claim
for such post-petition interest is allowed in such proceeding), penalties,
reimbursement or indemnification amounts, fees and expenses, and of all other
amounts then due on all Senior Indebtedness have been made or duly provided for
pursuant to the terms of the instrument governing such Senior Indebtedness, and
(ii) at the time for, or immediately after giving effect to, any such payment,
redemption, purchase or other acquisition, there shall not exist under any
Senior Indebtedness or any agreement pursuant to which any Senior Indebtedness
has been issued, any default which shall not have been cured or waived and which
shall have resulted in the full amount of such Senior Indebtedness being
declared due and payable. In addition, the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
Indenture provides that if the holders of any Senior Indebtedness notify the
Company and the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Trustee that a default has
occurred giving the holders of such Senior Indebtedness the right to accelerate
the maturity thereof, no payment on account of principal, sinking fund or other
redemption, interest or any other amounts due on the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities and no purchase, redemption or other acquisition of the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities will be made for the period (the "Payment Blockage
Period") commencing on the date notice is received and ending on the earlier of
(A) the date on which such event of default shall have been cured or waived or
(B) 180 days from the date notice is received. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
only one payment blockage notice with respect to the same event of default or
any other events of default existing and known to the person giving such notice
at the time of such notice on the same

46
<PAGE>
issue of Senior Indebtedness may be given during any period of 360 consecutive
days. No new Payment Blockage Period may be commenced by the holders of Senior
Indebtedness during any period of 360 consecutive days unless all events of
default which triggered the preceding Payment Blockage Period have been cured or
waived. The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture provisions described
in this paragraph, however, do not prevent the Company from making a mandatory
redemption payment, if any, with Senior Subordinated Debt Securities acquired
prior to the happening of such a default as described in this paragraph. Upon
any distribution of its assets in connection with any dissolution, winding-up,
liquidation or reorganization of the Company or acceleration of the principal
amount due on the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities because of an Event of
Default, all Senior Indebtedness must be paid in full before the Holders of the
Senior Subordinated Debt Securities are entitled to any payments whatsoever.

The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture does not restrict the
amount of Senior Indebtedness or other indebtedness of the Company or any
subsidiary of the Company, except that the Company may not incur any
Indebtedness which is senior to the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities but
subordinate to Senior Indebtedness. As of July 12, 1993, the Company's Senior
Indebtedness aggregated approximately $2.6 billion.

As a result of these subordination provisions, in the event of the Company's
insolvency, holders of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities may recover
ratably less than general creditors of the Company.

The payment of the principal of, interest on or any other amounts due on
Junior Subordinated Indebtedness will be subordinated in right of payment to the
prior payment in full of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities.

The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities are subordinate to the indebtedness
under the Credit Agreements, the Company's 11 7/8% Senior Notes due December 1,
1998 and the 12 5/8% Senior Notes due July 15, 1998 and are senior to the
Company's 13 5/8% Subordinated Notes due June 1, 1995 and its 6 3/4% Convertible
Subordinated Debentures due February 15, 2007. The Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities will rank PARI PASSU in right of payment to all existing and future
Senior Subordinated Indebtedness, including with the Company's outstanding
10 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due June 15, 1997, its 11% Senior Subordinated
Notes due August 15, 1999, the 11 1/2% Senior Subordinated Notes due September
1, 1999, the 8 7/8% Convertible Senior Subordinated Notes due July 15, 2000, and
its 10 3/4% Senior Subordinated Debentures due April 1, 2002.

MINIMUM NET WORTH INTEREST RATE ADJUSTMENT

The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture requires that if a series
of Senior Subordinated Debt Securities so provides and if the Company's Net
Worth is below $500 million (the "Minimum Net Worth") as at the end of any two
consecutive fiscal quarters (the last day of the second such fiscal quarter, the
"Failure Date"), then (i) the interest rate on the Senior Subordinated Debt
Securities shall be reset as of the first day of the second fiscal quarter
following the Failure Date (the "Reset Date") to a rate per annum (the "Reset
Rate") equal to the greater of (x) the initial interest rate as set forth on the
cover page of the respective Prospectus Supplement (the "Initial Interest Rate")
or (y) the sum of (A) the basis points specified in the respective Prospectus
Supplement for purposes of this reset provision, and (B) the highest of the
treasury rates specified in the respective Prospectus Supplement for purposes of
this reset provision, (ii) on the first Interest Payment Date following the
Reset Date, the interest rate on the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities, as
reset on the Reset Date, shall increase by 50 basis points, and (iii) the
interest rate on the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities shall further increase
by an additional 50 basis points on each succeeding Interest Payment Date.
Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing, in no event shall the interest rate
on the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities at any time exceed the Initial
Interest Rate by more than 200 basis points. However, if the Company's Net Worth
is equal to or above the Minimum Net Worth as of the last day of any fiscal
quarter subsequent to the Failure Date, then the interest rate on the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities shall return to the Initial Interest Rate as of the
first day of the second following fiscal quarter. If the Company's Net Worth
shall thereafter be less than the Minimum Net Worth as of the last day of any
two consecutive subsequent fiscal quarters, then the interest rate on the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities shall again be adjusted as provided in this
paragraph.

"NET WORTH" means the amount which, in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles ("GAAP") consistently applied, would be set forth under
the caption "stockholders' equity" (or any like caption) on the consolidated
balance sheet of the Company, exclusive of amounts attributable to Redeemable
Stock. If the

47
<PAGE>
Company has changed one or more of the accounting principles used in the
preparation of its financial statements, because of a change mandated by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board, then Net Worth shall mean the Net Worth
the Company would have had if the Company had continued to use those generally
accepted accounting principles employed at December 31, 1991.

If a Reset Rate has been established for a series of Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities, it will be described in the Prospectus Supplement relating to
such Senior Subordinated Debt Securities.

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

The Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture provides that the Company
will not, and will not permit any subsidiary of the Company to, directly or
indirectly, (1) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution, in cash or
otherwise, in respect of any shares of capital stock of the Company or to the
holders of capital stock of the Company as such (other than dividends or
distributions payable in shares of capital stock of the Company, other than
Redeemable Stock) or (2) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for
value any of the capital stock of the Company or options, warrants or other
rights to acquire any such capital stock, other than acquisitions of capital
stock or such options, warrants or other rights by any Subsidiary of the Company
from the Company (any such transaction included in clause (1) or (2) a
"Restricted Payment") if (i) at the time of such Restricted Payment and after
giving effect thereto, (a) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing with respect to any series of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities
or (b) the Net Worth of the Company shall be less than $750 million; or if (ii)
after giving effect to such Restricted Payment, the aggregate amount expended
subsequent to the date of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture for
all such Restricted Payments (the amount of any Restricted Payment, if other
than cash, to be the fair market value of such payment as determined by the
Board of Directors of the Company, whose reasonable determination shall be
conclusive and evidenced by a Board Resolution) exceeds the algebraic sum of (w)
a number calculated as follows: (A) if the aggregate Consolidated Net Income of
the Company earned on a cumulative basis during the period subsequent to June
30, 1993 through the end of the last fiscal quarter that is prior to the
declaration of any such dividend or distribution or the giving of notice of such
purchase, redemption or other acquisition or retirement and for which such
financial information is then available, is a positive number, then 100% of such
positive number, and (B) if the aggregate Consolidated Net Income of the Company
earned on a cumulative basis during the period subsequent to June 30, 1993
through the end of the last fiscal quarter that is prior to the declaration of
any such dividend or distribution or the giving of notice of such purchase,
redemption or other acquisition or retirement and for which such financial
information is then available, is a negative number, then 100% of such negative
number, (x) the aggregate net cash proceeds received by the Company from the
issuance and sale, other than to a subsidiary of the Company, subsequent to the
date of the Senior Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, of capital stock
(including capital stock issued upon the conversion of, or in exchange for,
securities other than capital stock and options, warrants or other rights to
acquire capital stock, but excluding Redeemable Stock), (y) the aggregate net
cash proceeds received by the Company from the issuance and sale, other than to
a subsidiary of the Company, of Indebtedness of the Company that is converted
into capital stock of the Company subsequent to the date of the Senior
Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture, and (z) $300 million; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that the retirement of any shares of the Company's capital stock by exchange
for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of, other
shares of capital stock of the Company other than Redeemable Stock shall not
constitute a Restricted Payment. If all of the conditions to the declaration of
a dividend or distribution that are described above are satisfied at the time
such dividend or distribution is declared, then such dividend or distribution
may be paid or made within sixty days after such declaration even if the payment
of such dividend, the making of such distribution or the declaration thereof
would not have been permitted at any time after such declaration.

"CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME" of the Company means, for any period for which the
determination thereof is to be made, the net income (or loss) of the Company and
its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis for such period taken as a single
accounting period, determined in accordance with GAAP; PROVIDED that there shall
be excluded therefrom (i) the net income (or loss) of any person (a "joint
venture") in which any other person (other than the Company or any of its
subsidiaries) has a joint equity interest, except to the extent of the amount of
dividends or other distributions actually paid to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries by such joint venture during such period, (ii) except to the extent
includable pursuant to the foregoing clause (i), the net income (or loss) of any
person accrued prior to the date it becomes a subsidiary of the Company or is
merged into or consolidated with the

48
<PAGE>
Company or any of its subsidiaries or that person's assets are acquired by the
Company or any of its subsidiaries, (iii) the net income of any subsidiary of
the Company to the extent that the declaration or payment of dividends or
similar distributions by that subsidiary of that income is not at the time
permitted by operation of the terms of its charter or any agreement, instrument,
judgment, decree, order, statute, rule or governmental regulation applicable to
that subsidiary, and (iv) the excess (but not the deficit), if any, of (x) any
gain which must be treated as an extraordinary item under GAAP or any gain
realized upon the sale or other disposition of any asset that is not sold in the
ordinary course of business or of any capital stock of the Company or a
subsidiary of the Company over (y) any loss which must be treated as an
extraordinary item under GAAP or any loss realized upon the sale or other
disposition of any asset that is not sold in the ordinary course of business or
of any capital stock of the Company or a subsidiary of the Company.

ADDITIONAL TERMS OF THE SUBORDINATED DEBT SECURITIES

The following terms apply solely to the Subordinated Debt Securities. See
"Description of Debt Securities -- Particular Terms of the Senior Subordinated
Debt Securities and Subordinated Debt Securities" for other terms which are also
applicable to the Subordinated Debt Securities. The particular terms of the
Subordinated Debt Securities offered by any Prospectus Supplement and the
extent, if any, to which such general provisions may apply to the Subordinated
Debt Securities so offered will be described in the Prospectus Supplement
relating to such Subordinated Debt Securities.

SUBORDINATION

The payment of the principal of, interest on or any other amounts due on the
Subordinated Debt Securities will be subordinated in right of payment to the
prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness and Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Company. No payment on account of principal of, redemption
of, interest on or any other amounts due on the Subordinated Debt Securities and
no redemption, purchase or other acquisition of the Subordinated Debt Securities
may be made unless (i) full payment of amounts then due for principal, sinking
funds, interest (including interest accruing on or after the filing of any
petition in bankruptcy or for reorganization relating to the Company, whether or
not a claim for such post-petition interest is allowed in such proceeding),
penalties, reimbursement or indemnification amounts, fees and expenses, and of
all other amounts then due on all Senior Indebtedness and Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness have been made or duly provided for pursuant to the terms of the
instrument governing such Senior Indebtedness or Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness, and (ii) at the time for, or immediately after giving effect to,
any such payment, redemption, purchase or other acquisition, there shall not
exist under any Senior Indebtedness, Senior Subordinated Indebtedness or any
agreements pursuant to which any Senior Indebtedness or Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness has been issued, any default which shall not have been cured or
waived and which shall have resulted in the full amount of such Senior
Indebtedness or Senior Subordinated Indebtedness being declared due and payable.
In addition, the Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture provides that if the
Holders of any Senior Indebtedness or Senior Subordinated Indebtedness notify
the Company and the Subordinated Debt Securities Trustee that a default has
occurred giving the holders of such Senior Indebtedness or Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness the right to accelerate the maturity thereof, no payment on account
of principal, sinking fund or other redemption, interest or any other amounts
due on the Subordinated Debt Securities and no purchase, redemption or other
acquisition of the Subordinated Debt Securities will be made for the period (the
"Subordinated Payment Blockage Period") commencing on the date notice is
received and ending on the earlier of (A) the date on which such event of
default shall have been cured or waived or (B) 270 days from the date notice is
received. Notwithstanding the foregoing, only one payment blockage notice with
respect to the same event of default or any other events of default existing and
known to the person giving such notice at the time of such notice on the same
issue of Senior Indebtedness or Senior Subordinated Indebtedness may be given
during any period of 360 consecutive days. No new Subordinated Payment Blockage
Period may be commenced by the holders of Senior Indebtedness or Senior
Subordinated Indebtedness during any period of 360 consecutive days unless all
events of default which triggered the preceding Subordinated Payment Blockage
Period have been cured or waived. The Subordinated Debt Securities Indenture
provisions described in this paragraph, however, do not prevent the Company from
making a mandatory redemption payment, if any, with Subordinated Debt Securities
acquired prior to the happening of such a default as described in this
paragraph. Upon any distribution of its assets in connection with any
dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization of the Company or
acceleration of the

49
<PAGE>
principal amount due on the Subordinated Debt Securities because of an Event of
Default, all Senior Indebtedness and Senior Subordinated Indebtedness must be
paid in full before the Holders of the Subordinated Debt Securities are entitled
to any payments whatsoever.

As a result of these subordination provisions, in the event of the Company's
insolvency, holders of the Subordinated Debt Securities may recover ratably less
than general creditors of the Company.

The Subordinated Debt Securities are subordinate in right of payment to all
existing and future Senior Indebtedness and Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of
the Company, including the indebtedness under the Credit Agreements, the
Company's 11 7/8% Senior Notes due December 1, 1998, its 12 5/8% Senior Notes
due July 15, 1998, its 10 3/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due June 15, 1997, its
11% Senior Subordinated Notes due August 15, 1999, its 11 1/2% Senior
Subordinated Notes due September 1, 1999, its 8 7/8% Convertible Senior
Subordinated Notes due July 15, 2000 and its 10 3/4% Senior Subordinated
Debentures due April 1, 2002. The Subordinated Debt Securities will rank PARI
PASSU upon liquidation with the Company's 13 5/8% Subordinated Notes due June 1,
1995 and its 6 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Debentures due February 15, 2007.

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK

THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE COMPANY
ARE SUBJECT TO THE DETAILED PROVISIONS OF THE COMPANY'S CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION, AS AMENDED (THE "CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION"), INCLUDING THE
CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS FOR EACH OF THE SERIES E CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE
EXCHANGEABLE PREFERRED STOCK (THE "SERIES E PREFERRED STOCK") AND THE SERIES F
CUMULATIVE CONVERTIBLE EXCHANGEABLE PREFERRED STOCK (THE "SERIES F PREFERRED
STOCK") AND BY-LAWS, AS AMENDED (THE "BY-LAWS"). THESE STATEMENTS DO NOT PURPORT
TO BE COMPLETE, OR TO GIVE FULL EFFECT TO THE PROVISIONS OF STATUTORY OR COMMON
LAW, AND ARE SUBJECT TO, AND ARE QUALIFIED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO,
THE TERMS OF THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION, THE CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS
OF EACH OF THE SERIES E AND SERIES F PREFERRED STOCK AND THE BY-LAWS.

GENERAL

The Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of a total of 210
million shares of all classes of stock, of which 10 million may be shares of
preferred stock, par value $.01 per share, and 200 million may be shares of the
Common Stock, par value $.01 per share. At July 13, 1993, approximately 71.2
million shares of Common Stock were outstanding. The Certificate of
Incorporation authorizes the Company's Board of Directors, without first
obtaining approval of the holders of Common Stock or any series of preferred
stock, to provide for the issuance of any or all shares of the preferred stock
in one or more series, and to fix the voting powers, full or limited, and the
designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional or other special
rights, and any qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof, applicable
to the shares to be included in any such series as may be permitted by the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. As of the date hereof, 4.6
million shares of Series E Preferred Stock are outstanding. In addition, 2
million shares of Series D Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $.01
per share, of the Company (the "Series D Preferred Stock") have been authorized
and reserved for issuance in connection with the Series D Rights described below
and up to 400,000 shares of Series F Preferred Stock have been authorized and
reserved for issuance upon the occurrence of certain specified events described
in "Series F Preferred Stock" below.

COMMON STOCK

DIVIDEND RIGHTS

Subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of the Company's
preferred stock which may at the time be outstanding, holders of the Common
Stock are entitled to receive, to the extent permitted by law, such dividends as
may be declared from time to time by the Board of Directors out of funds legally
available therefor.

VOTING RIGHTS

Each holder of Common Stock is entitled to one vote for each share of Common
Stock registered in such holder's name on the books of the Company on all
matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. Except as otherwise provided by
law, the holders of shares of the Common Stock vote as one class. The holders of
shares of the Common Stock have cumulative voting rights under the Certificate
of Incorporation such that in all elections for directors, each holder entitled
to vote thereat is entitled to as many votes as is equal to the number of votes
which

50
<PAGE>
such holder would be entitled to cast for the election of directors with respect
to such holder's shares multiplied by the number of directors to be elected, and
such holder may cast all of such votes for a single director or may distribute
them among any two or more of them as such holder may see fit.

LIQUIDATION RIGHTS AND OTHER PROVISIONS

The Company has granted its lenders security interests in a substantial
portion of the Company's assets under the Credit Agreements and other debt
agreements. See "Credit Agreements." Subject to the prior rights of creditors
and the holders of any preferred stock which may be outstanding from time to
time, the holders of the Common Stock are entitled to share PRO RATA in the
distribution of any remaining assets in the event of liquidation, dissolution or
winding up of the Company. The shares of Common Stock are not liable to any
calls or assessments and have no conversion rights or redemption or sinking fund
provisions. The Transfer Agent and Registrar for the Common Stock is The First
National Bank of Chicago.

CHANGE IN CONTROL

The Certificate of Incorporation and the Rights Agreement dated July 25,
1988, as amended (the "Rights Agreement"), between the Company and First Chicago
Trust Company of New York, as Rights Agent, contain certain provisions
(described below) that could make more difficult or discourage a change in
control of the Company. Such provisions are designed to discourage situations in
which the Company is forced to accept a proposal for the takeover of the Company
without ample time to evaluate the proposal and appropriate alternatives and to
encourage anyone contemplating a business combination with the Company to
negotiate directly with the Company on a fair and equitable basis.

SERIES D RIGHTS

Each share of Common Stock has associated with it one preferred share
purchase right (the "Series D Right") permitting the holder to purchase
approximately one-hundredth of a share of the Company's Series D Preferred Stock
at an exercise price of $130 per share, subject to certain adjustments. The
terms of the Series D Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement dated as of
July 25, 1988, as amended, between the Company and The First National Bank of
Chicago, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement").

The Series D Rights are not exercisable and are transferable only with the
related Common Stock certificates. The Series D Rights become exercisable and
separately transferable ten days after a person or group (excluding certain
entities including members of the Stone family) acquires 15% or more of the
outstanding shares of the Common Stock or ten business days after a person or
group (excluding certain entities including members of the Stone family)
announces a tender offer or exchange offer that would, if completed, result in
ownership by such person or group of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of
the Common Stock. Thereafter, the Series D Rights will trade separately from the
Common Stock.

After the Series D Rights become exercisable, if a person or group
(excluding certain entities including members of the Stone family) acquires 15%
or more of the outstanding shares of the Common Stock and the Company is
acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction, each Series D
Right will entitle its holder (other than the acquiring person or group) to
purchase, at the Series D Right's then-current exercise price, a number of the
acquiring company's shares of common stock having a market value at that time of
twice the Series D Right's then-current exercise price. In addition, in the
event that a person or group (excluding certain entities including members of
the Stone family) acquires 15% or more of the outstanding shares of the Common
Stock, each holder of a Series D Right (other than the acquiring person or
group) will be entitled to purchase the number of shares of the Common Stock
having a market value of twice the then-current exercise price of the Series D
Right.

Under certain circumstances, the Series D Rights may be redeemed at a price
of $.01 per Series D Right. The Series D Rights will expire in August 1998,
unless earlier redeemed by the Company.

The Rights Agreement generally provides that a Series D Right will be issued
in connection with each share of Common Stock (i) issued prior to the earliest
of the Distribution Date (as defined in the Rights Agreement) or the redemption,
exchange or expiration of the Series D Rights or (ii) issued at certain other
times pursuant to certain options, warrants or convertible securities.

51
<PAGE>
SUPERMAJORITY VOTE REQUIREMENTS

The Certificate of Incorporation provides that the affirmative vote of the
holders of at least 66 2/3% of the voting power of the then outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors (the "Voting Stock") is required to authorize (a) any merger or
consolidation of the Company with or into any other corporation (other than a
Subsidiary of the Company) or (b) the sale (other than to the Company or its
Subsidiaries) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. For purposes of the foregoing paragraph, a
"Subsidiary" is any corporation more than 50% of the voting securities of which
are owned by the Company.

SERIES E PREFERRED STOCK

There are 4.6 million shares of Series E Preferred Stock authorized and
outstanding on the date hereof. The Series E Preferred Stock is entitled to
cumulative cash preferential dividends of $1.75 per share, per annum, payable
quarterly, and has a liquidation preference of $25 per share plus accrued and
unpaid dividends. Unless full cumulative dividends on the Series E Preferred
Stock have been paid or payment has been provided for, no dividends (other than
dividends in shares of Common Stock or other capital stock ranking junior to the
Series E Preferred Stock in the payment of dividends) shall be paid or declared
and set aside for payment or other distribution made upon the Common Stock or
any other capital stock of the Company ranking junior or on a parity with the
Series E Preferred Stock as to dividends.

The Series E Preferred Stock is exchangeable, in whole but not in part, at
the option of the Company, on any dividend date commencing February 15, 1994,
for the Company's 7% Convertible Subordinated Exchange Debentures due February
15, 2007 (the "Exchange Debentures") at an exchange rate of $25 principal amount
of Exchange Debentures for each share of Series E Preferred Stock so exchanged.
The Exchange Debentures entitle the holders thereof to convert the Exchange
Debentures into shares of Common Stock.

The Series E Preferred Stock is redeemable by the Company, in whole but not
in part, on and after February 16, 1996, at $26.50 per share, if redeemed during
the 12 month period commencing February 15, 1996, and thereafter at prices
declining to $25 per share on and after February 15, 2002, together with accrued
and unpaid dividends to the date of redemption. The Series E Preferred Stock,
unless previously exchanged or redeemed by the Company, is convertible at the
option of the holder thereof at any time into shares of Common Stock at a
conversion price of $33.94 per share (as of the date hereof), subject to
adjustment under certain conditions.

If the Company fails to pay any six quarterly dividends on the Series E
Preferred Stock, then the holders of the Series E Preferred Stock, voting
together as a class with all other outstanding classes or series of preferred
stock ranking junior to or on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock and
entitled to vote thereon, have the right to elect two directors to be added to
the Company's Board of Directors. Such voting rights continue until all
dividends in arrears on such stock have been paid or provided for. Without the
approval of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred
Stock, the Company may not issue any capital stock ranking senior to the Series
E Preferred Stock as to payment of dividends or in distribution of assets upon
liquidation or make any change which adversely affects the preferences, rights
or powers of the Series E Preferred Stock.

SERIES F PREFERRED STOCK

The Company has authorized 400,000 shares of Series F Preferred Stock, no
shares of which have been issued or are outstanding on the date hereof. The
terms of the Series F Preferred Stock are identical to the terms of the Series E
Preferred Stock, except with respect to the amount of dividend and dividend
payment dates, the liquidation preference, the optional redemption schedule and
redemption prices, the conversion rate at which Series F Preferred Stock may be
converted into shares of Common Stock and the exchange rate at which Series F
Preferred Stock may be exchanged by the Company for Exchange Debentures.

The Series F Preferred Stock, if issued, will be entitled to cumulative cash
preferential dividends of $7 per share, per annum, payable quarterly, will have
a liquidation preference of $100 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends,
will rank on a parity with the Series E Preferred Stock with respect to rights
to receive dividends and distributions upon liquidation and has identical voting
rights as the Series E Preferred Stock. The Series F Preferred Stock is
exchangeable for the Company's Exchange Debentures which in turn are convertible
into shares of Common Stock.

52
<PAGE>
The Series F Preferred Stock will be redeemable by the Company, in whole but
not in part, on and after 48 months from the date of issuance, at $104.20 per
share, if redeemed during the 12 month period commencing on such date, and
thereafter at prices declining to $100 per share on and after the 120th month
from issuance, together with accrued and unpaid dividends to the date of
redemption. The Series F Preferred Stock will be convertible at the option of
the holder thereof at any time into shares of Common Stock at a conversion rate
of 5.4283 shares of Common Stock per share of Series F Preferred Stock (as of
the date hereof), subject to adjustment under certain conditions.

The Company has entered into an agreement with Venezolana de Pulpa y Papel
("Venepal"), a Venezuelan pulp and paper company, whereby Venepal's investment
in the Celgar pulp mill represented by 50% of the outstanding common stock of
Stone Venepal (Celgar) Pulp Inc. ("SVCPI") can be exchanged for shares of Series
F Preferred Stock. The exchange would occur at Venepal's option as a result of
certain specific conditions relating to operations of the Celgar pulp mill,
which is 50% owned by SVCPI. The Company may at its option elect to honor the
exchange obligation with a cash payment to Venepal. Based upon Venepal's initial
investment in SVCPI, 212,903 shares of Series F Preferred Stock would be
issuable in the event Venepal was eligible to exercise, and did exercise, its
option. The number of shares issuable to Venepal upon exchange is to be
determined based upon (i) the value of Venepal's investment in SVCPI at the time
of such exchange and (ii) the market price of the Common Stock at the time of
such exchange.

jurisdiction to which such purchaser is subject. The underwriters, dealers and
such other persons will not have any responsibility in respect of the validity
or performance of such contracts. The Prospectus Supplement will set forth the
commission payable for solicitation of such contracts.

Any underwriters, dealers or agents participating in the distribution of

Act. Underwriters, dealers or agents may be entitled, under agreements entered
into with the Company, to indemnification against or contribution toward certain
civil liabilities, including liabilities under the Act.
