EAGLE FINANCIAL CORP 1994 EARNINGS HIT NEW HIGH
___________________________________________________________

Dividend Increases by 11%
___________________________________________________________

BRISTOL, CT/October 25, 1994 -- Eagle Financial Corp. (NASDAQ: EGFC), the
holding company for Eagle Federal Savings Bank, today reported record net income
of $7,566,000, or $2.34 per share, for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1994.
This represents an increase of $1.4 million, or 23%, over the $6,152,000, or
$1.97 per share, earned in fiscal 1993. The earnings increase was primarily
attributable to continued growth in net interest income, which was higher by
$3.8 million, or 14%, in 1994 versus 1993. Fiscal 1994 earnings also benefited
from lower loan loss provisions and higher fee income on deposit accounts.

Earnings for the forth quarter of fiscal 1994 were 37% higher than in the last
quarter of fiscal 1993. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 1994
was $1,954,000, or $0.60 per share, compared to $1,428,000, or $0.46 per share,
for the same period in 1993.

The strong earnings increase in both the fiscal 1994 year and fourth quarter was
achieved despite several non-recurring expenses totaling approximately $550,000
(after taxes), or $0.17 per share, relating to the retirements of two senior
officers. These one-time charges were partly offset by the positive impact on
Eagle's fourth quarter of the acquisition of the Bank of Hartford from the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on June 10, 1994.

Robert J. Britton, President and Chief Executive officer of Eagle Financial,
commented, "We are extremely pleased with our 1994 results, which represent the
Company's sixth consecutive year of higher earnings. Over the last six fiscal
years, Eagle's core earnings have grown on average by 23%. We look forward to
fiscal 1995, which will receive a full twelve month contribution from our Bank
of Hartford acquisition this year."

In response to the strong annual earnings, Eagle's Board of Directors increased
the Company's quarterly cash dividend by 11% to $0.21 per share. The dividend is
payable on December 1, 1994 to shareholders of record on November 15, 1994. The
Board also announced that Eagle Financial's annual meeting will be held on
Tuesday, 1/24/95, in Torrington, Connecticut.

Britton added, "Our steady rise in earnings each year has been accompanied by
growth in or cash dividend, which at the current market price represents a yield
of approximately 4%."

In October, 1994, Eagle completed a stock offering which added 800,000 shares
of common stock to the Company's shareholders' equity. Net proceeds from the
offering after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses were
$15.5 million. In addition, the underwriter was granted a 30-day option to
purchase up to an additional 120,000 shares of common stock to cover over-
allotments, if any. As of October 25, 1994, the underwriter has not exercised
this option.

Eagle's total assets at September 30, 1994 were $1.07 billion. Loans receivable
and deposits at year end were $811 million and $949 million, respectively, while
total shareholder's equity was $66.3 million. Book value per share grew by 7% in
1994 from $19.78 to $21.16.

Eagle's subsidiary, Eagle Federal Savings Bank, now operates 23 banking offices
in Hartford, Litchfield and northern Fairfield counties including six offices of
the former Bank of Hartford.
