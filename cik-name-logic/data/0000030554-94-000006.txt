WILMINGTON, Del., Jan. 26 -- DuPont fourth quarter 
and full year 1993 earnings showed substantial improvement over 
1992. The company reported net income of $226 million for the 
fourth quarter of 1993, or $.33 per share, compared with a 
loss of $230 million, or $.35 per share, for the same period 
last year. Excluding nonrecurring items from each period, 
fourth quarter earnings were $.48 per share, up from $.14 per 
share earned in the fourth quarter, 1992, resulting in the 
full year being up 25 percent.
Nonrecurring items in the fourth quarter of 1993 
resulted in a net charge of $103 million, or $.15 per share, 
reflecting an accrual of $144 million after-tax, or $.21 per 
share, for certain product liability claims and legal expenses, 
predominantly related to the recall of "Benlate" DF fungicide, 
and a $.02 per share charge for early redemption of debt. These 
charges were partly offset by a net gain of $52 million, or $.08 
per share, on the previously announced sales of Remington Arms 
Company and DuPont Canada's polyethylene business. The 
additional accrual for "Benlate" DF updates the estimate of 
costs relating to the product recall, following the first full 
quarter's experience of court trials and review of case histories

<PAGE>

and rate of spending on litigation. The fourth quarter of 1992 
included net nonrecurring charges of $327 million, or $.49 per 
share, primarily due to restructuring.
"Our fourth quarter results show a substantial 
improvement over a year ago," said Chairman Edgar S. Woolard. 
"This is reflected particularly in petroleum and in a number 
of our chemicals and specialty businesses. Our businesses 
have benefited in the quarter from reduced fixed costs, better 
results in Europe, and improving economic conditions in the 
United States. In addition, aggressive working capital 
management substantially reduced inventories, thus boosting 
cash flow."
Net income for the full year 1993 was $555 million, or 
$.81 per share, compared with a loss for 1992 of $3,927 million, 
or $5.85 per share. Excluding nonrecurring items from both 
years and one-time charges in 1992 for adoption of new account-
ing standards, 1993 earnings were $1,677 million, or $2.46 per 
share, 25 percent higher than the $1,341 million, or $1.98 per 
share earned last year.
Total sales for 1993 were $37.1 billion, down 
2 percent versus 1992. Combined sales for Chemicals, Fibers, 
Polymers and Diversified Businesses were 2 percent lower than 
last year, on somewhat higher volumes.

<PAGE>

Said Woolard, "It is gratifying to begin to see the 
results of our cash management and productivity improvement 
strategies implemented over the last several years. Our focus 
on cash management resulted in a reduction in borrowings in 
1993 of more than $1 billion. This year's 25 percent increase 
in earnings before nonrecurring items was primarily due to 
improvement in the petroleum segment, a large part of which is 
the result of aggressive cost reduction and restructuring 
programs. Chemicals and specialty businesses also benefited 
from lower costs, but this was mitigated somewhat by weak 
economic conditions in Europe. We will continue with strong 
efforts to improve productivity and increase revenues, so that 
our businesses grow faster than the growth anticipated in 
global economies."
The following compares segment results for the full 
year 1993 with prior year, excluding the impact of nonrecurring 
items described in the accompanying footnotes:
Petroleum segment earnings were $743 million, up 
$310 million, or 72 percent from last year. Upstream earnings 
of $441 million were 79 percent higher, reflecting significantly 
lower costs, higher international crude oil and worldwide 
natural gas volumes, higher U.S. natural gas prices, and lower 
effective tax rates. Downstream earnings were $302 million, 
62 percent above last year, primarily reflecting lower costs 
and higher refined products margins.

<PAGE>

Chemicals segment earnings were $282 million, up 
2 percent from $277 million earned last year, reflecting 
improvements in chemical specialties, partly offset by lower 
results for white pigments. The latter experienced declining 
prices for most of the year, despite increases in volume. 
Segment sales were down 2 percent, largely due to the currency 
effects of a strong dollar.
Fibers segment earnings of $425 million were 
11 percent below the $478 million for 1992. This is mainly 
attributable to lower earnings for "Lycra" spandex and nylon, 
particularly in Europe. Sales were up 2 percent, principally 
reflecting additional nylon business acquired from ICI, partly 
offset by 3 percent lower selling prices. U.S. selling prices 
were flat, while outside the United States, prices were lower by 
9 percent, reflecting the stronger dollar.
Earnings for the Polymers segment were $340 million, 
unchanged from last year. Improvements in the businesses 
supplying automotive original equipment and aftermarkets were 
largely offset by lower results in non-automotive markets. 
Sales were up less than 1 percent, reflecting 5 percent higher 
volume almost entirely offset by lower prices, principally due 
to currency effects.
Diversified Businesses segment earnings were 
$238 million, up 35 percent from last year. Excluding the 
impact of coal results, which were adversely affected for much

8

<PAGE>

of the year by United Mine Workers strikes, segment earnings 
increased $169 million, or 146 percent. This reflects strong 
results from crop protection chemicals and substantial cost 
improvements in printing and publishing from restructuring. 
Segment sales were down 7 percent on lower volume, principally 
due to disposition of the connectors business.
