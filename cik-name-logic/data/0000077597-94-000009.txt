Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On February 2, 1994, Spartech Corporation ("the Company")
completed the acquisition of Product Components, Inc. ("ProCom")
and ProCom's affiliates. The purchase included two rigid plastic
sheet and rollstock manufacturing plants, located in Richmond,
Indiana and Clare, Michigan, along with various other assets
of ProCom. 

The acquired assets were used by ProCom in the business
of manufacturing and selling extruded rigid plastic sheet & roll-
stock produced from various resins, including polyethylenes, high
impact polystyrenes, crystal polystyrenes, acrylonitrile-
butadiene-styrenes, high impact acrylics and other related
specialty alloys and blends. ProCom's rigid plastic sheet &
rollstock was sold to a large group of manufacturers, who
thermoformed, cut and trimmed the plastic sheet & rollstock into
end products, such as golf carts, material handling systems,
and automotive/recreational vehicle parts. The Company
intends to use the acquired assets in the same manner as ProCom.

The purchase price for Procom's net assets, exclusive of
working capital purchased, totaled $8 million of which $7 million
was paid in cash, subject to post-closing adjustments. The
purchase price was determined by arms' length negotiations
between the parties. To facilitate the funding of the purchase,
the Company amended its credit arrangement with Chemical Bank by
increasing the limit on its revolving credit loan from $30 
million to $38 million.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits

(a) Financial statements of businesses acquired.

At present, it is impractical for the Company to provide
required financial statements for the acquired business, but such
financial statements will be filed by an amendment to this report
within 60 days after the time for filing this report.

(b) Pro forma financial information.

At present, it is impractical for the Company to provide
required pro forma financial information relative to the acquired 
business, but such financial information will be filed by an
amendment to this report within 60 days after the time for 
filing this report.

obligations of Seller only to the extent and as provided in this
Agreement. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement,
Purchaser shall not assume and shall not be responsible for any
liabilities or obligations of the Business or Seller.

1.3 The Purchase Price.

1.3.1 Purchase Price. The Purchase Price shall be an
amount equal to the sum of the following, but in no event more
than $13,700,000:

(a) The amount of Seller's accounts receivables due
from customers of the Business assigned to Buyer at the
Closing consistent with Seller's historical accounting but
before any allowances for bad debts;

(b) The value of Seller's inventory transferred to
Buyer at the Closing valued in accordance with Seller's
historical accounting after adjustments from book value to
actual physical inventory count; and

(c) $5,000,000 representing the agreed value the value
of Seller's and the Related Parties' land, buildings and
equipment transferred to Buyer at the Closing.

1.3.2 Payment of Purchase Price.

(a) The Purchase Price up to a maximum of $13,700,000
shall be paid as follows:

(i) By Buyer assuming Seller's accounts payable,
accrued liabilities, including accrued payroll taxes,
and indebtedness to banks and/or Durakon Industries,
Inc. relating to the Business existing as of the
Closing up to a maximum of $12,700,000.

(ii) $1,000,000 in cash at Closing; provided,
however, that to the extent that the sum of Promat
receivables and inventory and Injectech (Aeropro)
receivables included in Excluded Assets are less than
$872,000, the Purchase Price shall be increased by such
amount which shall be paid in cash at Closing, but in
no event shall such cash portion of the Purchase Price
exceed $1,872,000 in the aggregate.

(b) To the extent that the sum of accounts payable,
accrued liabilities, indebtedness to banks and/or Durakon
Industries, Inc. assumed by Buyer and cash paid at Closing
exceeds the Purchase Price by more than $300,000, the cash
portion of the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount
equal to 50% of such excess.

(c) The Purchase Price shall be preliminarily
determined at Closing based upon Seller's Interim Balance
Sheet (as hereinafter defined) after increasing Seller's
accrued reserve for returned goods by $50,000 above Seller's
historical reserve for returned goods subject to adjustment
pursuant to Section 1.5 hereof. Six months after Closing,
the unused portion, if any, of such $50,000 reserve shall be
paid to Seller.

(d) By notice to Purchaser given at least three
business days prior to the Closing, Seller may designate
equipment related to Seller's "Promat" division (the "Promat
Equipment") referred to in Section 1.1.2(a) of this
Agreement which Seller does not wish to retain as part of
the Excluded Assets. In such event, the equipment so
designated by Seller shall be included in the Assets
transferred to Purchaser at Closing. The cash portion of
the Purchase Price shall be adjusted at Closing based upon
such list of Promat Equipment as ultimately determined by
reducing such cash amount to the extent the value of such
Promat Equipment exceeds $600,000 and increasing such cash
amount to the extent such value is less than $600,000;
provided, however, that regardless of the value of the
equipment so designated by Seller in no event shall the cash
portion of the Purchase Price be increased by more than
$100,000. In making such adjustments, the Promat Equipment
shall be valued at the amounts shown on Schedule 1.1.2.

(e) The Purchase Price and the amount of cash payable
to Seller at Closing shall be calculated in accordance with
the example attached hereto as Exhibit D.

1.3.3 Allocation of Purchase Price. The Purchase
Price, the liabilities assumed by Purchaser in accordance with
Section 1.4 hereof and any non-recourse liabilities to which any
Asset is subject, as finally determined, shall be allocated among
the Assets acquired hereunder by mutual agreement of the parties. 
If the parties cannot agree on such allocations within 90 days
after the Closing, Seller, Stockholder and Purchaser hereby agree
that the Assets shall be valued for purposes of the allocation
under this Section 1.3.3 in accordance with a written appraisal
made by a nationally recognized appraisal firm to be selected by
Purchaser, and in accordance with the requirements of Section
1060 of the Internal Revenue Code. Such appraisal shall be
conducted at Purchaser's sole direction and completed no less
than 30 days prior to the earlier to occur of the due date,
including extensions, for filing the U.S. federal income tax
return for either Seller or Purchaser for the fiscal year which
includes the Closing Date. The cost of such appraisal shall be

Agreement provided for herein.

The liabilities of Seller assumed by Purchaser under this
Agreement are referred to herein as the "Assumed Liabilities."
The liabilities of Seller not assumed by Purchaser under this
Agreement are referred to herein as the "Excluded Liabilities."

1.5 Closing Balance Sheet. Not later than 30 days after
the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a balance
sheet of the Business as of the Closing Date, prepared
consistently with the Interim Balance Sheets ("Seller's Closing
Balance Sheet"). In connection with preparation of Seller's
Closing Balance Sheet, Seller shall perform a physical inventory
on the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall have the right to have a
representative present at all times during such physical
inventory. Seller's Closing Balance Sheet shall (i) specifically
identify all assets reflected thereon which are deemed by Seller
to be Excluded Assets and all liabilities reflected thereon which
are deemed by Seller to be Excluded Liabilities, (ii) shall
include as liabilities any liabilities of the Related Parties
assumed by Purchaser and (iii) shall include a reserve for
returned goods $50,000 greater than Seller's historical reserve
for returned goods. Purchaser shall review, or cause its
independent accountants to review, Seller's Closing Balance Sheet
within 30 days of receipt thereof by Purchaser. Upon completion
of such review, Purchaser shall deliver to Seller a balance sheet
of the Business at the Closing Date which shall contain all
revisions deemed to be appropriate by Purchaser from the Seller's
Closing Balance Sheet (the "Purchaser's Closing Balance Sheet"),
including any revised identification of any Excluded Assets or
Excluded Liabilities.

Any dispute which may arise between Seller and
purchaser as to such financial statements and the calculation of
the Purchase Price shall be resolved in the following manner:

(a) Seller, if it disputes the Purchaser's Closing
Balance Sheet or the calculation of the Purchase Price,
shall notify Purchaser in writing within 15 days after
Seller's receipt of Purchaser's Closing Balance Sheet; such
notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of the
dispute;

(b) during the 15 day period following the date of
such notice, Seller and Purchaser shall attempt to resolve
such dispute and to determine the appropriateness of the
Purchaser's Balance Sheet or the calculation of the Purchase
Price; and

(c) if at the end of the 15 day period specified in
subsection (b) above, Seller and Purchaser shall have failed
to reach a written agreement with respect to such dispute,
the matter shall be referred to the accounting firm of Ernst
& Young, independent certified public accountants (the
"Arbitrator"), which shall act as an arbitrator and shall
issue its report as to the balance sheet or the calculation
of the Purchase Price within 60 days after such dispute is
referred to the Arbitrator. Each of the parties hereto
shall bear all costs and expenses incurred by it in
connection with such arbitration, except that the fees and
expenses of the Arbitrator hereunder shall be borne equally
by Seller and Purchaser. This provision for arbitration
shall be specifically enforceable by the parties and the
decision of the Arbitrator in accordance with the provisions
hereof shall be final and binding and there shall be no
right of appeal therefrom.

References in this Agreement to the "Closing Balance
Sheet" shall mean the balance sheet of the Business at the
Closing Date, as agreed to or finally determined in accordance
with this Section 1.5. The "Adjustment Date" shall be the later
of the 15th day after delivery by Purchaser of the Purchaser's
Closing Balance Sheet pursuant hereto, or the date upon which any
dispute concerning the balance sheet of the Business at the
Closing Date or the amount of the Net Assets is resolved.

If the Purchase Price is adjusted as a result of the
Closing Balance Sheet, the party owing the adjustment shall pay
the same within ten days of such determination. If the Purchase
Price is reduced and Seller has not paid Purchaser the amount of
such adjustment within ten days of such determination, Purchaser
may offset the amount due against any payments due Seller or any
of the Related Parties.

the other parties hereto such other instruments and documents and
take such other actions as may be reasonably requested from time
to time by any other party hereto as necessary to carry out,
evidence and confirm the intended purposes of this Agreement.

agreements, documents and instruments delivered by Seller or the
Stockholder in connection herewith (the "Seller's Documents")
have been duly executed and delivered on behalf of Seller and the
Stockholder by duly authorized officers of Seller and the
Stockholder, and this Agreement and the Seller's Documents
constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of such of
Seller and the Stockholder as shall be a party thereto,
enforceable against such party in accordance with their
respective terms.

3.1.3 No Interest in Other Entities. No shares of any
corporation or any ownership or other investment interest, either
of record, beneficially or equitably, in any association,
partnership, joint venture or other legal entity are included in
the Assets.

3.1.4 Validity of Contemplated Transactions, etc. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Seller
and the Stockholder does not and will not violate, conflict with

or require the consent of any other person under, (a) any
existing law, ordinance, or governmental rule or regulation to

rights or obligations of Seller or the Stockholder thereunder. 
Except as aforesaid, no authorization, approval or consent of,

inventory of Seller.

3.1.6 Financial Statements. Seller has delivered to
Purchaser true and complete copies of (a) the balance sheets of
Seller at May 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991 and the related statements

then ended, certified by Seller's Auditors; and (b) an unaudited
balance sheet of Seller at November 30, 1993 and related
statement of income, for the six month period then ended, all of

involved. Such balance sheets, including the related notes,
fairly present the financial position, assets and liabilities
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) of Seller at
the dates indicated and such statements of income, retained
earnings and cash flows fairly present the results of operations,
changes in retained earnings and cash flows of Seller for the
periods indicated. The unaudited financial statement as at and

necessary to present fairly in all material respects the
financial position for the period then ended. Subject to
inventory adjustments based on a physical count, the Interim
Balance Sheet specifically identifies the assets and liabilities
which, if the Closing had been held on the Interim Balance Sheet
Date, would have been transferred to or assumed by Purchaser in
accordance herewith. References in this Agreement to the
"Interim Balance Sheet" shall mean the balance sheet of the
Business as at November 30, 1993 referred to above; and

Balance Sheet or arising since the date thereof are valid and
genuine; have arisen solely out of bona fide sales and deliveries

in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
and are not subject to any known defenses, set-offs or
counterclaims, except as set forth on Schedule 3.1.17.

3.1.8 Inventory. All inventory of Seller used in the
conduct of the Business, including without limitation raw

Business; and will not be adulterated, misbranded, mispackaged or
mislabeled within the meaning of, or in violation of, any
applicable local, state or federal laws or regulations. 
Purchaser is otherwise accepting Seller's inventory "as is". 
Seller is not under any liability or obligation with respect to
the return of inventory in the possession of customers.

3.1.9 Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as
set forth in Schedule 3.1.9, Seller has no liabilities or

compensation, social security, payroll, sales and use, excise
privilege, property, ad valorem, franchise, license, school and
any other tax or similar governmental charge or imposition under
laws of the United States or any state or municipal or political
subdivision thereof or any foreign country or political
subdivision thereof) (the "Taxes") have been filed with the
appropriate governmental agencies in all jurisdictions in which
such Tax Returns are required to be filed, and all such Tax
Returns properly reflect the liabilities of Seller for Taxes for
the periods, property or events covered thereby. All Taxes,
including without limitation those which are called for by the
Tax Returns or heretofore or hereafter claimed to be due by any
taxing authority from Seller, have been properly accrued or paid. 
Seller has not received any notice of assessment or proposed
assessment in connection with any Tax Returns and there are no
pending Tax examinations of or Tax claims asserted against Seller
or any of its assets or properties. Seller has not extended, or
waived the application of, any statute of limitations of any

Authorizations are listed and described on Schedule 3.1.15
hereto. Seller is not in default, nor has it received any notice
of any claim of default, with respect to any such Authorization. 
All such Authorizations are renewable by their terms or in the
ordinary course of business without the need to comply with any
special qualification procedures or to pay any amounts other than

any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or award of any
court, arbitrator or governmental or regulatory official, body or
authority which may adversely affect Seller, its assets or the

respect to the termination of any employees of Seller prior
to the Closing Date.

limited by this Article IV, Seller and its officers, directors,
employees, agents, successors and assigns shall be indemnified
and held harmless by Purchaser from any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs and expenses, interest, awards,

from:

Purchaser contained herein;

(b) the breach of any covenant or agreement by
Purchaser contained herein or in any document delivered
hereunder at the Closing; or

(c) the failure of Purchaser to pay or otherwise
discharge the Assumed Liabilities.

4.3 Indemnification Procedures.

(a) For the purposes of this Section 4.3, the term
"Indemnitee" shall refer to the person indemnified, or
entitled, or claiming to be entitled, to be indemnified,
pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.1 or 4.2, as the
case may be; the term "Indemnitor" shall refer to the person
having the obligation to indemnify pursuant to such
provisions; and "Losses" shall refer to the "Seller Losses"
or the "Purchaser Losses," as the case may be.

(b) An Indemnitee shall give written notice (a "Notice
of Claim") to the Indemnitor within 30 days after the
Indemnitee has knowledge of any claim (including a Third
Party Claim, as hereinafter defined) which an Indemnitee has
determined has given or could give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement. No failure to give
such Notice of Claim shall affect the indemnification
obligations of the Indemnitor hereunder, except to the
extent Indemnitor can demonstrate such failure materially
prejudiced such Indemnitor's ability to successfully defend
the matter giving rise to the claim. The Notice of Claim
shall state the nature of the claim and the amount of the
Loss, if known, and the Indemnitor shall have a period of 30
days to reply to such Notice of Claim.

(c) The obligations and liabilities of an Indemnitor
under this Article IV with respect to losses arising from
claims of any third party that are subject to the
indemnification provisions provided for in this Article IV
("Third Party Claims") shall be governed by the following
additional terms and conditions: The Indemnitee at the time
it gives a Notice of Claim to the Indemnitor of the Third
Party Claim shall advise the Indemnitor that Indemnitor
shall be permitted, at Indemnitor's option, to assume and
control the defense of such Third Party Claim at
Indemnitor's expense and through counsel of Indemnitor's
choice if Indemnitor gives notice within the 30 day period
specified above of Indemnitor's intention to do so to the
Indemnitee and confirms that the Third Party Claim is one
with respect to which the Indemnitor is obligated to
indemnify. In the event the Indemnitor exercises
Indemnitor's right to undertake the defense against any such
Third Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnitee shall
cooperate with the Indemnitor in such defense and make
available to the Indemnitor all witnesses, pertinent
records, materials and information in Indemnitee's
possession or under Indemnitee's control relating thereto as
is reasonably required by the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee
may participate by Indemnitee's own counsel and at
Indemnitee's own expense in defense of such Third Party
Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnitor shall
thereafter consult with the Indemnitee upon the Indemnitee's
reasonable request for such consultation from time to time
with respect to such Third Party Claim. Except for the
settlement of a Third Party Claim which involves the payment
of money only, no Third Party Claim for which the Indemnitor
has elected to defend may be settled by the Indemnitor
without the written consent of the Indemnitee, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the
Indemnitee does not receive written notice within said
period that the Indemnitor has elected to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee may elect to
assume such defense, assisted by counsel of Indemnitee's own
choosing; provided however, the Indemnitee shall thereafter
consult with the Indemnitor upon the Indemnitor's reasonable
request for such consultation from time to time with respect
to such Third Party Claim. Whether or not Indemnitee elects
to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnitor shall not be relieved of Indemnitor's obligations
hereunder. The Indemnitee will give the Indemnitor at least
15 days notice of any proposed settlement or compromise of
any Third Party Claim it has elected to defend, during which
time the Indemnitor may assume the defense of, and
responsibility for, such Third Party Claim and if it does so
the proposed settlement or compromise may not be made. In
the event the Indemnitee is, directly or indirectly,
conducting the defense against any such Third Party Claim,
the Indemnitor shall cooperate with the Indemnitee in such
defense and make available to Indemnitee all such witnesses,
records, materials and information in Indemnitor's
possession or under Indemnitor's control relating thereto as
is reasonably required by the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor
may participate by Indemnitor's own counsel and at
Indemnitor's own expense in the defense of such Third Party
Action.

(d) Any claim by an Indemnitee with respect to Losses
which do not result from a Third Party Claim will be
asserted in the same manner as specified in Section 4.3(b)
above. If the Indemnitor does not respond to such claim
within the 30 day period specified in Section 4.3(b), the
Indemnitor will be deemed to have rejected such claim, in
which event the Indemnitee will be free to pursue such
remedies as may be available to the Indemnitee under and as
limited by this Agreement.

4.4 Limits on Indemnification. No claim may be made
against Seller or the Stockholder under this Article IV for
breach of a representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement or in any exhibit, schedule or certificate delivered
under this Agreement unless and only to the extent the aggregate
of all Purchaser Losses exceed $100,000 (the "Seller Basket") and
then only with respect to that portion of Purchaser Losses which
exceed the Seller Basket; provided, however, that the Seller
Basket shall not apply with respect to Purchaser Losses to the
extent the same are incurred as the result of any breach of a
representation or warranty contained in Sections 3.1.2, 3.1.7,
3.1.10, 3.1.15, 3.1.17, 3.1.23, 3.1.24, 3.1.29, 9.1(a) or to the
extent the same relates to any one of the foregoing Sections. No
claim may be made against Purchaser under this Article IV for any
breach of a representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement or in any exhibit, schedule or certificate delivered
under this Agreement unless and only to the extent the aggregate
of all Seller Losses exceed $100,000 (the "Purchaser Basket"),
and then only with respect to that portion of Seller's Losses
which exceed the Purchaser Basket; provided, however, that the
Purchaser Basket shall not apply with respect to Seller Losses to
the extent the same are incurred as the result of any breach of a
representation or warranty contained in Sections 3.2.2 or 9.1(b).

4.5 Compliance with Bulk Sales Laws. Purchaser and Seller
hereby waive compliance by Purchaser and Seller with the bulk
sales law and any other similar laws in any applicable
jurisdiction in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Seller and the Stockholder shall jointly and
severally indemnify Purchaser from, and hold it harmless against,
any liabilities, damages, costs and expenses resulting from or
arising out of (a) the parties' failure to comply with any of
such laws in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or (b) any action brought or levy made as a result
thereof, other than those liabilities which have been expressly
assumed, on such terms as expressly assumed, by Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement.

4.6 Other Rights and Remedies Not Affected. The
indemnification rights of the parties under this Article IV are
independent of and in addition to such rights and remedies as the
parties may have at law or in equity or otherwise for any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure to fulfill any
agreement or covenant hereunder on the part of any party hereto,
including without limitation the right to seek specific
performance, rescission or restitution, none of which rights or
remedies shall be affected or diminished hereby.

as to permit Purchaser to continue its operation, without
interruption, following the Closing.

5.4 Legal Proceedings. No action or proceeding at law or
in equity shall have been commenced with respect to (i) the
transactions herein contemplated, or (ii) the right of Purchaser

all required governmental approvals, authorizations, consents,
licenses, orders, registrations and permits of all agencies

in good faith.

5.6 Environmental and Structural Inspection. The Real

shall notify Seller and the Closing shall be extended for up to

6.1 Accuracy of Representations and Warranties. At the

Purchaser contained in this Agreement or in any other agreement
executed and delivered in connection herewith shall be true and
correct in all respects as though restated and made again at the

ARTICLE VII

OTHER MATTERS

7.1 Access to Information. From the date hereof and until
the Closing, Seller will afford to Purchaser and Purchaser's
authorized representatives reasonable access to the officers,
management and employees of Seller and the Related Parties and
will make available to Purchaser such additional information
pertaining to the Assets and Business as Purchaser may reasonably
request.

7.2 No Shopping. From the date hereof and until the
Closing, Seller will not, directly or indirectly, solicit or
encourage (including by way of furnishing any nonpublic
information) any proposal for any acquisition of any portion of
the Business or Assets. If Seller receives any proposal for the
acquisition of any portion of the Business or Assets, Seller
shall promptly notify Purchaser of such proposal and the terms
thereof.

7.3 Relocation of Lines. Prior to Closing, Seller shall
breakdown and relocate (i) Seller's No. 6 line from Seller's
Elkhart, Indiana plant to Seller's Clare, Michigan plant and (ii)
Seller's other Elkhart, Indiana lines to Seller's Richmond,
Indiana plant. Within 90 days after Closing, Purchaser shall
breakdown Seller's three Promat lines so that Seller may relocate
the same to Seller's Knoxville, Tennessee plant, and Purchaser
shall notify Seller of such activities so that Seller may observe
the same.

7.4 Employee Benefits. Except to the extent included in
Seller's Closing Balance Sheet, Seller shall pay directly to each
employee of the Business that portion of all benefits (including
the arrangements, plans and programs set forth in Schedule
3.1.22) which has been accrued on behalf of that employee (or is
attributable to expenses incurred by that employee) as of the
Closing Date, and Purchaser shall assume no liability therefor. 
No portion of the assets of any plan, fund, program or
arrangement, written or unwritten, heretofore sponsored or
maintained by Seller (and no amount attributable to any such
plan, fund, program or arrangement) shall be transferred to
Purchaser, and Purchaser shall not be required to continue any
such plan, fund, program or arrangement after the Closing Date. 
The amounts payable on account of all benefit arrangements shall
be determined with reference to the date of the event by reason
of which such amounts become payable, without regard to
conditions subsequent, and Purchaser shall not be liable for any
claim for insurance, reimbursement or other benefits payable by
reason of any event which occurs prior to the Closing Date. All
amounts payable directly to employees, or to any fund, program,
arrangement or plan maintained by Seller therefor shall be paid
by Seller within 30 days after the Closing Date to the extent
that such payment is not inconsistent with the terms of such
fund, program, arrangement or plan. All employees of Seller who
are employed by Purchaser on or after the Closing Date shall be
new employees of Purchaser, but any prior employment by Seller of
such employees shall be counted in determining eligibility for
any employee benefits offered by Seller.

7.5 Employees. As of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
offer employment to, and Seller shall use its best efforts to
assist Purchaser in employing as new employees of Purchaser, all
persons presently engaged in the business who are identified by
Purchaser prior to the Closing Date (the "Employees"). Seller
shall terminate effective as of the Closing Date all employment
agreements it has with any of the Employees.

7.6 Discharge of Business Obligations. From and after the
Closing Date Seller shall pay and discharge, in accordance with
past practice but not less than on a timely basis, all
obligations and liabilities incurred prior to the Closing Date in
respect of the Business, its operations or the assets and
properties used therein (except for those expressly assumed by
Purchaser hereunder), including without limitation any
liabilities or obligations to employees, trade creditors and
customers of the Business.

7.7 Maintenance of Books and Records. Each of Seller and
Purchaser shall preserve until the seventh anniversary of the
Closing Date all records possessed or to be possessed by such
party relating to any of the assets, liabilities or business of
the Business prior to the Closing Date. After the Closing Date,
where there is a legitimate purpose, such party shall provide the
other parties with access, upon prior reasonable written request
specifying the need therefor, during regular business hours, to
(a) the officers and employees of such party and (b) the books of
account and records of such party, but, in each case, only to the
extent relating to the assets, liabilities or business of the
Business prior to the Closing Date, and the other parties and
their representatives shall have the right to make copies of such
books and records; provided, however, that the foregoing right of
access shall not be exercisable in such a manner as to interfere
unreasonably with the normal operations and business of such
party; and further provided, that, as to so much of such
information as constitutes trade secrets or confidential business
information of such party, the requesting party and its officers,
directors and representatives will use due care to not disclose
such information except (i) as required by law, (ii) with the
prior written consent of such party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, or (iii) where such information becomes
available to the public generally, or becomes generally known to
competitors of such party, through sources other than the
requesting party, its affiliates or its officers, directors or
representatives. Such records may nevertheless be destroyed by a
party if such party sends to the other parties written notice of
its intent to destroy records, specifying with particularity the
contents of the records to be destroyed. Such records may then
be destroyed after the 30th day after such notice is given unless
another party objects to the destruction, in which case the party
seeking to destroy the records shall deliver such records to the
objecting party.

7.8 Payments Received. Seller and Purchaser each agree
that after the Closing they will hold and will promptly, but in
any event within 10 days, transfer and deliver to the other, from
time to time as and when received by them, any cash, checks with
appropriate endorsements (using their best efforts not to convert
such checks into cash), or other property that they may receive
on or after the Closing which properly belongs to the other
party, including without limitation any insurance proceeds, and
will account to the other for all such receipts. From and after
the Closing, Purchaser shall have the right and authority to
endorse without recourse the name of Seller on any check or any
other evidences of indebtedness received by Purchaser on account
of the Business and the Assets transferred to Purchaser
hereunder.

7.9 Covenant Not to Compete.

(a) Seller agrees that for a period of five years
after the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its
affiliates will, directly or indirectly, as a partner, joint
venturer, employer, employee, consultant, shareholder,
principal, agent or otherwise, own, manage, operate, join,
control or participate in the ownership, management,
operation or control of any business, whether in corporate,
proprietorship or partnership form or otherwise, as more
than a five percent owner in such business, which is in any
way involved in the Business in the United States. The
parties hereto specifically acknowledge and agree that the
remedy at law for any breach of the foregoing will be
inadequate and that the Purchaser, in addition to any other
relief available to it, shall be entitled to temporary and
permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving
actual damage.

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement, neither
Seller nor any of its affiliates shall, directly or
indirectly, disclose or use for their own benefit, or for
the benefit of any other person, any information relating to
the Business or the Assets, except to the extent such
disclosure may be required by law.

(c) Seller acknowledges that in view of the nature of
the Business and the business objectives of Purchaser in
acquiring it, and the consideration paid to Seller and the
Stockholders therefor, the territorial and time limitations
contained in subsection (a) of this Section 7.9 are
reasonable and properly required for the adequate protection
of Purchaser and that in the event that any such territorial
or time limitation is deemed to be unreasonable and is then
reduced by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, as
reduced, the territorial and/or time limitation shall be
enforced. Subsections (a) and (b) of this Section 7.9
constitute independent and severable covenants and if any or
all of the provisions of either thereof are held to be
unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, it will not in any
way invalidate or affect the remainder of this Agreement,
which will remain in full force and effect. The parties
intend for the covenants of subsections (a) and (b) of this
Section 7.9 to be enforceable to the maximum extent
permitted by law, and if any reviewing court deems any of
such covenants to be unenforceable or invalid, Purchaser and
Seller authorize such court to reform (i) the unenforceable
or invalid provisions and to impose such restrictions as
reformed and (ii) the remaining provisions as it deems
reasonable. Nothing herein shall prohibit Seller from
engaging in (i) the existing business of Seller's Promat
division or (ii) producing extruded plastic sheet which has
rubber laminated to it as part of a Promat package.

7.10 Publicity. Prior to the fifth anniversary of the
Closing Date, none of Purchaser, Seller or the Stockholder shall,
nor shall any of them permit their respective then current
employees, agents, representatives or affiliates to, make or
cause to be made, any oral or written disclosure concerning the
Purchase Price paid or the other terms and conditions of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto. This provision
shall not apply to any disclosure required to be made by law or
applicable stock exchange rule.

7.11 Completion of Schedules and Exhibits. The parties
hereto acknowledge that this Agreement has been executed prior to
the preparation of the Schedules and Exhibits hereto. Seller
agrees to proceed with all due diligence to cause the preparation
of such Schedules by January 17, 1994. Upon review and
acceptance of such Schedules and Exhibits by Purchaser, such
Schedules and Exhibits shall be attached to this Agreement and
initialled by authorized representatives of each party hereto.

knowingly or wilfully breaches or defaults in any of its
representations, warranties or covenants, the other party
adversely affected may at its option seek and exercise all
remedies permitted by law and seek to recover attorneys' fees and
other expenses related to the exercise of the foregoing remedies.

SPARTECH CORPORATION ACQUIRES

NET ASSETS OF PRODUCT COMPONENTS, INC.

ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI, February 3, 1994 -- Spartech Corporation
(AMEX-SEH) announced today that it completed its purchase of the net
assets of Product Components, Inc. ("ProCom"), a long established
manufacturer of rigid plastic sheet & rollstock, which has two
manufacturing plants and annual sales of approximately $25-$30 million.
Bradley B. Buechler, Spartech's President and Chief Executive
Officer, stated that, "This purchase is of pivotal importance in the
further expansion of the Company's national rigid sheet & rollstock
group, Spartech Plastics; it adds two new locations and significantly
improves our position in the growing polyolefin market. ProCom's two
mideastern U.S. locations, Richmond, Indiana and Clare, Michigan, will
operate as Spartech Plastics facilities in the future, expanding the
division to eight extrusion plants strategically situated throughout
the country." 
Mr. Buechler further stated, "Spartech Plastics now has total
production capacity of more than 225 million pounds with projected
annual sales over the next twelve months of nearly $190 million, or
approximately 20% of the $900 million U.S. custom rigid sheet &
rollstock market. The acquisition price, exclusive of working capital
requirements, was approximately $8 million."
-more-

David B. Mueller, Spartech's Vice President of Finance and Chief
Financial Officer, stated, "Assuming volumes continue at current
levels, Spartech Corporation's total annualized sales (including our
merchant compounding division) will approximate $235 million, with
operating earnings of around $13.5 million. Spartech plans on putting
additional manufacturing equipment and capital into the newly acquired
operations over the next twelve months. Claude Cason, ProCom's prior
owner, will be a consultant to Spartech's rigid sheet & rollstock group
for the next few years, with Pat Fleming, who recently joined the
Company, becoming General Manager for Spartech Plastics' new mideastern
region."
