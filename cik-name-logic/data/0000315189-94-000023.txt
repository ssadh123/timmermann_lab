Item 5. Other Events

The following is the text of a press release issued by Deere &
Company October 12,
1994.

MOLINE, ILLINOIS -- Deere & Company announced that negotiations
for a new labor
agreement between the Company and the United Auto Workers (UAW)
have been
suspended without the two parties having reached a settlement
agreement.

"Representatives from Deere and the UAW have worked for a number
of months trying
to reach agreement on a new labor contract," according to Robert
Combs, the company's
director of corporate communications. "To the company's
disappointment, our efforts to
reach agreement have ended without success. Deere is committed
to the process of
collective bargaining. At present, however, the negotiations are
deadlocked.

"To further the long-term position of the Company, we know it is
essential to treat
employees fairly," Combs said. "Equally importantly, as we've
stressed to the UAW's
leadership during these negotiations, our employment practices
must recognize the
realities of our intensely competitive markets and lay a
foundation for long-term success
in the marketplace.

"During our discussions with the UAW, Deere has developed and
presented a
comprehensive proposal that would preserve and enhance for our
current UAW-
represented workforce their outstanding wage and benefit package,
a compensation
package which is the very best in our industries," Combs said. 
"Our proposal for an
agreement would also enhance the Company's long-term
competitiveness.

"While we regret the lack of success in reaching a new labor
agreement, the Company
expects to maintain normal operations," Combs said.

Combs noted that the Company is willing to resume meeting with
UAW representatives
at any time if there is an indication that new discussions would
be fruitful.
