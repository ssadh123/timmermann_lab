Enfield, CT - Dairy Mart Convenience Stores, Inc. (NASDAQ: DMCVA

Frank Colaccino as Chief Executive Officer and President. Mr.
Colaccino will remain a director of the Company.

Robert B. Stein, Jr., Executive Vice President/Store

special committee of the Board of Directors has been appointed to
review various governance matters, and expects to make a
recommendation to the full Board of Directors in the near term

level," said Frank W. Barrett, a non-management director of the
Company and a member of the special committee. "Dairy Mart is in
sound financial condition, with an intact management team that the

Mr. Stein commented, "The Company will continue to focus on
its previously announced strategic objectives, and I am confident
that we have the necessary talent and resources in place to
accomplish our objectives." Mr. Stein continued, "We anticipate,
