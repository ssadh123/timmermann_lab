ITEM 5. Other Events.

In the first phase of a proceeding that was instituted to consider 
the possible development of a performance-based regulation plan for 
New York Telephone Company (the "Company"), on December 24, 1993 the 
New York State Public Service Commission ("NYSPSC") issued an Order, 
pending a full opinion, for a reduction in the Company's rates of 
$170 million, to be effective January 1, 1994. The reduction is 
intended to reduce the Company's intrastate revenues by $141 million 
annually. In addition, the NYSPSC Order determined that an 
additional $159 million of current revenues are to be made available 
"for the ultimate benefit of customers and the Company's competitive 
position through earnings incentives for short-term service 
improvements and a longer term plan for performance-based earning 
incentives and network improvements". That plan will be pursued in 
a second phase of the proceeding.

The Order did not make a final finding on return on equity. Subject 
to the Company's achieving net productivity gains, the rates adopted 
by the Order would, according to the Order, allow the Company an 
opportunity to earn above a 10.8% return on equity. There will also 
be equal sharing between shareholders and ratepayers of any earnings 
above 12% return on equity. 

A full opinion explaining the basis of the Order will be issued 
shortly. It is expected that this opinion will also address the 
Company's treatment of deferred expenses related to various early 
retirement programs. It is probable that the opinion will require 
the Company to incur a charge to income in 1993 of $49 million 
after-tax. This charge represents a reversal of a portion of the 
Company's deferred regulatory asset related to pension costs. These 
costs, which the Company previously expected to recover through the 
regulatory process, were deferred, and the asset was created, under 
the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 71 
- Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation.
