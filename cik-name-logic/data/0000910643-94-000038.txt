INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

We have audited the accompanying Historical Summary of Revenues and
Certain Operating Expenses of The Pines Apartments, Cedar Village
Apartments and Paddock Place Apartments (the "Properties") for the
year ended December 31, 1993. This Historical Summary is the
responsibility of New Plan Realty Trust's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on this Historical Summary
based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. These standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
Historical Summary is free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the
amounts and disclosures in the Historical Summary. An audit also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the Historical Summary. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The Historical Summary has been prepared for the purpose of
complying with the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, and its use for any other purpose may be
inappropriate. Accordingly, as described in the Note to the
Historical Summary, the statement excludes interest, depreciation,
and general and administrative expenses for the period examined,
and is not intended to be a complete presentation of the Property's
revenues and expenses.

In our opinion, the Historical Summary referred to above presents
fairly, in all material respects, the revenues and certain
operating expenses (exclusive of interest, depreciation and general
and administrative expenses) in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles.

NOTE:

The Historical Summary of Revenues and Certain Operating Expenses
relates to the operations of The Pines Apartments, Cedar Village
Apartments and Paddock Place Apartments (the "Properties") while
under ownership previous to New Plan Realty Trust. The Properties
are residential apartment complexes.

The summary has been prepared on the accrual method of accounting. 
Operating expenses include maintenance and repair expenses,
utilities, real estate taxes, insurance and certain other expenses. 
In accordance with the regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, mortgage interest expense, depreciation, and general
and administrative costs have been excluded from operating
expenses, as they are dependent upon a particular owner, purchase
price or financial arrangement.

NEW PLAN REALTY TRUST AND SUBSIDIARIES
INFORMATION PURSUANT TO RULE 3-14 REGULATION S-X

Part I MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT

Management's assessment of the Properties prior to acquisition
includes, but is not limited to, the quality of the tenant base,
regional demographics, the competitive environment, operating
expenses and local property taxes. In addition, the physical
aspect of the Properties, location, condition and quality of design
and construction are evaluated. Management also always conducts
Phase I and II environmental tests. All factors, when viewed in
their entirety, have met management's acquisition criteria. 
Management is not aware of any material factors relating to the
acquisition other than those discussed above. 

Part II ESTIMATES OF TAXABLE OPERATING INCOME AND FUNDS GENERATED
FROM CERTAIN PROPERTIES ACQUIRED (UNAUDITED)

a. The following presents an estimate of taxable net income and
funds generated from the operation of the acquired Properties
for a twelve month period ended December 31, 1993 based on the
Historical Summary of Revenues and Certain Operating Expenses
for the Year Ended December 31, 1993. These estimated results
do not purport to present expected results of operations for
the Properties in the future and were prepared on the basis
described in the accompanying notes which should be read in
conjunction herewith.

Estimates of taxable operating income: (000 omitted)

- - -------------------------------------------

Operating income before depreciation 
expense $2,027

Less:

b. Estimated taxable income for New Plan Realty Trust (including
the acquired properties) for the year ended July 31, 1993 is
approximately the same as Pro Forma net income and Revised Pro
Forma net income reported on the Pro Forma Condensed Statement
of Income (Unaudited).<PAGE>
NEW PLAN REALTY TRUST AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO ESTIMATES OF NET INCOME AND FUNDS GENERATED FROM
CERTAIN PROPERTIES ACQUIRED
(UNAUDITED)

Basis of Presentation

1. Estimated depreciation was based upon an allocation of
the purchase price to land (20%) and building (80%) with
the depreciation being taken over a 40 year life using
the straight line method.

2. No income taxes have been provided because New Plan
Realty Trust is taxed as a real estate investment trust
under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Accordingly, the Trust does not pay Federal income tax
whenever income distributed to shareholders is equal to
at least 95% of real estate investment trust taxable
income and certain other conditions are met.<PAGE>

based on the historical statements of the Trust after giving effect
to the acquisition of this property.

The unaudited pro forma condensed financial statements have
been prepared by New Plan Realty Trust management. The unaudited
pro forma condensed statements of income may not be indicative of
the results that would have actually occurred had the acquisitions
been made on the dates indicated. Also, they may not be indicative
of the results that may be achieved in the future. The unaudited
pro forma condensed financial statements should be read in
conjunction with New Plan Realty Trust's audited financial
statements as of July 31, 1993 and for the year then ended (which
are contained in the Trust's Form 10-K for the year ended July 31,
1993) and the unaudited financial statements as of April 30, 1994

the year ended July 31, 1993 and the nine months ended April
30, 1994 was 4.3% and 4% respectively.
