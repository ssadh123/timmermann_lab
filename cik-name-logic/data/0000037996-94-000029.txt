FORD POSTS SOLID THIRD-QUARTER EARNINGS

DEARBORN, Mich., Oct. 26 -- Steady improvement in most
automotive markets and another record performance in financial
services provided Ford Motor Company with third-quarter earnings
of $1.04 per share of common and Class B stock, compared with 40
cents per share in the same period last year. (Earnings per
share data have been adjusted to reflect the company's 2-for-1
stock split in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend which was
effective June 6, 1994.)

The third-quarter results marked the seventh-straight
quarterly earnings improvement for the company. Total earnings
were $1.124 billion, a third-quarter record. Earnings in the
third quarter of 1993 were $463 million, including a favorable
one-time effect of $140 million because of new U.S. tax
legislation. 

"These results reflect Ford's improving financial
performance," said Alex Trotman, chairman and chief executive
officer. "We are strengthening the fundamentals of our business
to support long-term growth and enhance our worldwide competitive
position."

Automotive Operations
- ---------------------

Ford's net income from worldwide automotive operations
improved $529 million, compared with the third quarter of 1993. 
The after-tax return on sales was 2.4 percent, up 2.0 percentage
points from last year. U.S. automotive operations showed
continued strength with a $245 million improvement over the prior
year (a $416 million improvement excluding the effect of
favorable 1993 U.S. tax legislation). The company projects U.S.
industry sales of about 15.5 million cars and trucks for 1994,
compared with 14.2 million units in 1993.

"We expect that vehicle demand in the U.S. will continue to
be healthy. There should be plenty of life left in this cycle. 
Our new products are improving the quality of our market share
and we have plans to further strengthen our car and truck lines
over the next couple of years," Trotman said. "The Ford Windstar
has helped increase our third-quarter share of the important
minivan segment by eight percentage points compared with last
year. The new Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique and the
redesigned Ford Explorer and Lincoln Continental should provide
further momentum."

Automotive operations outside the U.S. improved $284
million. Ford's European automotive operations (excluding
Jaguar) earned $25 million, compared with a loss of 
$217 million a year ago. 

"Europe is in the early stages of economic recovery and we
expect to see continued improvements in most countries," Trotman
said. "Our team in Europe has done an excellent job in
strengthening our operations there. We are well-positioned for
further progress."

European industry sales for 1994 are projected to be about
13.3 million units, compared with 12.5 million units in 1993. 
Industry volumes were up in most major markets in the third
quarter compared with last year.

The Financial Services Group
- ----------------------------

The Financial Services Group earned $523 million, a third-
quarter record. The Group's profit was up $132 million, compared
with the $391 million earned during the same period last year
($422 million excluding the effect of 1993 U.S. tax legislation).

The Group's improvement included earnings of $162 million by
The Associates Corp. of North America -- the best quarter in the
company's history -- compared with $134 million in the third
quarter of 1993. Ford Credit posted earnings of $315 million and
USL Capital recorded a profit of $27 million, both third-quarter
records.

"All three of the Group's operations turned in record
profits this quarter, and we are extremely pleased by their
contribution to the company's bottom line," Trotman said. 

Outlook -- Ford Focuses on Long-Term Growth
- -------------------------------------------

"This is one of the most exciting periods in Ford Motor
Company's history," Trotman said. "We're preparing for the
future by driving for improved efficiency, lower cost and ever
improving quality of our products and services in all of our
established markets. At the same time, we are preparing for
long-term growth by entering high-potential new markets
worldwide."

4. Sale of First Nationwide Bank

On April 14, 1994, an agreement was entered into between
Granite Savings Bank, a Federal Savings Bank (formerly First
Nationwide Bank)(the "Bank") and First Madison Bank, FSB
("First Madison") for the sale of substantially all of the
Bank's assets to, and the assumption of substantially all of
the Bank's liabilities by, First Madison. The Bank is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Granite Management Corporation
(formerly First Nationwide Financial Corporation)("Granite"),
which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ford. The
transaction was completed on September 30, 1994.

The Company recognized in First Quarter 1994 earnings a pre-
tax charge of $475 million and an after-tax charge of $440
million related to the disposition of Granite, reflecting the
non-recovery of goodwill and reserves for estimated losses on
assets to be retained or repurchased by Granite. These
assets will be liquidated over time as market conditions
permit. The tax effect of this transaction takes into
account differences between the book and tax basis of certain
assets for which deferred taxes were not required to be
provided under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
("SFAS") No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". The
Company's income statement includes the results of operations
of Granite through March 31, 1994. The net assets of Granite
at September 30, 1994 are included in the balance sheet under
Financial Services - Other Assets. Historically, Granite
(including the Bank) has not had a significant effect on
Ford's operating results.

5. Income Taxes
------------
On August 10, 1993 the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1993 was enacted in the U.S. Among other changes, the Act
increased the federal income tax rate for corporations by one
percentage point to 35% effective January 1, 1993. Net
income in the third quarter of 1993 included a reduction of
$140 million in the provision for income taxes as a result of
restating U.S. deferred tax balances. The favorable effect
reflected the higher tax rate applied to net deferred tax
assets in the U.S.

6. Stock Split
----------- 
On April 14, 1994, the Company's Board of Directors declared
a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a 100% stock dividend on
the Company's Common Stock and Class B Stock. The stock
split became effective June 6, 1994, and share data have been
restated to reflect the 2-for-1 stock split.

7. Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
------------------------------------
Effective January 1, 1994, the Company adopted SFAS No. 115,
"Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities". Accordingly, the purchases and sales of trading
securities are included in cash flows from operating
activities. Financial statements for the prior period were
not restated.

8. Acquisition of The Hertz Corporation
------------------------------------
On March 8, 1994, Ford purchased from Commerzbank
Aktiengesellschaft, a German bank, additional shares of
common stock of Hertz aggregating 5% of the total outstanding
voting stock, thereby bringing Ford's ownership of the total
voting stock of Hertz to 54% from 49%. On April 29, 1994,
Ford acquired 20% of Hertz' common stock from Park Ridge
Limited Partnership, and Hertz redeemed the common stock
(26%) and preferred stock of Hertz owned by AB Volvo for
$145 million; these transactions resulted in Hertz becoming a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Ford. In addition, a $150 million
subordinated promissory note of Hertz held by Ford Credit was
exchanged for $150 million of preferred stock of Hertz. 
Hertz' earnings included in Financial Services results for
the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 1994
were $61 million and $88 million respectively, compared with
$19 million and $22 million included in Automotive results
for the same periods a year ago (reflecting Ford's prior
equity interest in Hertz).
