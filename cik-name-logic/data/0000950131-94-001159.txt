FIRST BANK SYSTEM AND METROPOLITAN FINANCIAL CORPORATION
SIGN LETTER OF INTENT

MINNEAPOLIS, July 1, 1994 - First Bank System, Inc. (NYSE: FBS) today announced 
that it had signed a letter of intent to acquire Minneapolis-based Metropolitan 
Financial Corporation (NYSE: MFC). As of March 31, 1994, Metropolitan Financial 
had approximately $8 billion in assets, $5.7 billion in deposits and operated 
211 offices principally in North Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, 
South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Subject to the completion of a due 
diligence process and the execution of a definitive purchase agreement, FBS 
would exchange between .6803 and .7347 shares of First Bank System common stock 
for each common share of Metropolitan, which would result in a price of 
approximately $25 to $27 per share for Metropolitan shareholders. The 
acquisition also is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. The 
companies expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 1995. First 
Bank said it expects the acquisition to be accretive to earnings in the first 
year of operation.

FBS and Metropolitan Sign Letter of Intent -2

First Bank System chairman, president, and chief executive officer John F. 
Grundhofer said, "The Metropolitan Financial franchise is a great strategic fit 
with First Bank System's markets and customer focus. Metropolitan has a customer
relationship with over 300,000 households. We are excited about the opportunity
to offer these customers our full array of financial products, including our 
investment products, debit and credit cards, ATMs, home equity and revolving 
credit lines." Grundhofer noted that Metropolitan had done an excellent job in 
growing home equity and other consumer loans.
"In addition to the benefits to customers, the acquisition will enable
First Bank to further leverage its technology investments and acquisition
integration experience," Grundhofer concluded.
Norman M. Jones chairman and chief executive officer of Metropolitan 
Financial said, "We believe this transaction is in the best interests of our 
shareholders. The combination of these two premier financial services companies 
will result in expanded products and services for our customers and new 
opportunities for our employees."
The acquisition would add the states of Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, and Wyoming
to First Bank System's service area and expand its existing presence in 
Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. First Bank said that the 
acquisition will add to its existing leading market share in the Minneapolis/
St. Paul area and will result in the combined company having the leading market 
share in the Bismarck, N.D., Fargo, N.D., Hibbing, Minn. and Grand Forks, N.D. 
areas. It also significantly increases First Bank's presence in Rapid City,
S.D., St. Cloud, Minn. and Sioux Falls, S.D. and provides First Bank with a
large market share in four new major markets: Cheyenne, Wyo.; Des Moines, Iowa;
Lincoln, Neb.; and Omaha, Neb.
