NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 1993
(Unaudited; in millions)

The Company's press release on the results of operations for the
fourth quarter of and full-year fiscal 1993 was released to the
public on February 2, 1994. This condensed financial information
is prepared for the purpose of filing a summary of fourth quarter
and fiscal year 1993 financial information, which was included in
the Company's press release on February 2, 1994, with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

(1) On June 30, 1993, the Company acquired from The Coca-Cola
Company: (i) Coca-Cola Beverages Nederland B.V. in the
Netherlands; (ii) Roddy Coca-Cola Bottling Company, Inc.;
and (iii) Coca-Cola Bottling of Johnson City, Tennessee. 
The results of operations of these companies are included
in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations
from the beginning of third quarter 1993.

(2) Fourth quarter 1992 results include four more selling
days than fourth quarter 1993.

(3) Fiscal 1993 results include a $40 million ($0.31 per
common share) nonrecurring charge for the revaluation of
the Company's deferred tax liability resulting from the
impact of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.

(4) Per share data calculated prior to rounding to millions.

(5) Reported 1993 cash operating profit includes the effect
of acquisitions referred to in note (1) above. Reported
fourth quarter 1992 cash operating profit includes four
more selling days than fourth quarter 1993. In addition,
reported 1992 cash operating profit is not adjusted for
the effect of decreased postretirement benefits expense
realized in 1993 from the redesign and consolidation of
the Company's postretirement benefit plans. After
appropriate adjustments to eliminate the effects of these
differences, comparable 1993 cash operating profit
increased approximately 7% and 8%, respectively, for
fourth quarter and fiscal 1993 as compared to 1992.

(6) Adjusting 1992 volume for the effect of acquisitions and
fourth quarter 1992 for the effect of four additional
selling days as discussed in note (2) above, physical
case bottle/can volume would have increased approximately
3% and 2%, respectively, and fountain gallon volume would
have increased approximately 6% and 8.5%, respectively,
for fourth quarter and fiscal 1993 as compared to 1992.
