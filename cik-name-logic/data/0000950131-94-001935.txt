EXPLOSION OCCURS AT TERRA INDUSTRIES' PORT NEAL AMMONIA PLANT

Sioux City, Iowa (December 13, 1994)--Terra Industries Inc. (NYSE symbol: TRA) 
announced that at approximately 6:00 A.M. today a major explosion occurred at 
one of its five nitrogen fertilizer production plants. The affected facility is 
located in Port Neal, Iowa, about 16 miles south of Sioux City. Five fatalities 
and a dozen injuries have been confirmed.

Terra's President and CEO, Burton Joyce, said, "We are most concerned about our 
employees and their families; our initial efforts are directed to helping them. 
Secondly, we are cooperating with local emergency teams to contain the situation
so that we can begin a thorough investigation concerning the cause and extent of
damages which are not known at this time."

Additional details will be released as they become available.

This explosion has no effect on the business operations of Terra Nitrogen 
Company, L.P.

Terra Industries is a leading marketer and producer of nitrogen-based plant 
nutrients, crop protection products, seed and services for agricultural, turf, 
ornamental and other growers. Terra also produces nitrogen products and methanol
for industrial customers.

TERRA INDUSTRIES--UPDATE ON PLANT EXPLOSION

Sioux City, Iowa (December 13, 1994, 2:00 p.m. CST)--Terra Industries (NYSE 
symbol: TRA) currently believes that this morning's explosion occurred in the 
ammonium nitrate area of its Port Neal, Iowa plant. The cause has not been 
determined. However, the explosion resulted in metal fragments puncturing one of
two 15,000-ton refrigerated ammonia storage tanks. The spilled ammonia liquid
was contained within the facility's storage tank dike and evaporating ammonia
vapors are being released to the atmosphere.

It is estimated that 5,700 tons of ammonia were in the punctured tank. No 
estimate of release volume is possible at this time. Terra employees and local 
emergency response personnel are evaluating options to stop the on-going vapor 
release.

In addition, metal fragments punctured a near-by nitric acid tank, causing a 
spill of up to 100 tons of 56% nitric acid. The facility's wastewater discharge 
system was blocked in to ensure there were no releases to groundwater.

Local emergency response agencies are monitoring ammonia concentrations away 
from the plant. At this time, as a safety precaution they are evacuating people 
within a three-to-four mile radius of the plant. The local agencies state there
is no health hazard posed to anyone beyond this limit, although ammonia odors 
may be detected farther away.

Additional details will be released as they become available.

TERRA INDUSTRIES' INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF IMPACT
OF PORT NEAL EXPLOSION

Sioux City, Iowa (December 14, 1994)--Terra Industries Inc. (NYSE symbol: TRA) 
announced today that it believes insurance coverages are adequate to protect the
company from adverse material consequences of yesterday's explosion at its Port 
Neal, Iowa nitrogen fertilizer production plant. Terra anticipates recovering 
most of lost profits through its business interruption insurance coverage. 
Additionally, its property damage policy will enable the company to rebuild the 
plant. Terra expects to provide reserves during the fourth quarter of 
approximately $5 million to cover insurance deductibles and other uninsured 
costs related to the explosion.

The Port Neal facility contributed an estimated $12 million ($.17 per share) 
to 1993 net income and $11 million ($.15 per share) for the first nine months of
1994. On a pro forma basis, Terra's total earnings (including those derived from
Agricultural Minerals and Chemicals which was acquired on October 20, 1994) 
would have been $.97 per share. Port Neal accounts for 15% of Terra's total 
nitrogen fertilizer production, pro forma the acquisition.

Burton M. Joyce, Terra's President and CEO, commented, "It will be a few weeks 
before the company will know the length of time during which the plant will be 
out of service. However, we do not expect it to be operating prior to the 1995 
planting season."

Joyce commented that Terra does not believe the plant outage will affect the 
supply of fertilizer to its grower customers, who receive their fertilizer from 
Terra through its purchases from other fertilizer manufacturers. The company is 
currently exploring options for obtaining supplies for dealer customers 
normally serviced from the Port Neal plant. This may entail shipment from other 
Terra plants or purchases on the open market.

The company anticipates it will be some time before it will have any indication 
concerning the cause of the explosion or accurate assessments of rebuilding 
costs.
