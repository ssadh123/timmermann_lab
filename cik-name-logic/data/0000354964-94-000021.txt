Household International to Sell Hamilton Investments Unit

PROSPECT HEIGHTS, IL, August 8, 1994 -- Household
International said today it has agreed to sell most of the
operations of its Hamilton Investments subsidiary to Principal
Financial Securities, a member of The Principal Financial Group. 
Terms were not disclosed.

Hamilton Investments, headquartered in Chicago, is a
regional retail securities broker/dealer that provides securities
brokerage and investment banking services. 

Household said it will retain Hamilton's name and licenses
and will continue providing certain investment services to
customers of its Household Bank subsidiary, including investment
counsel and brokerage services.

Household said it is selling the Hamilton operations because
it has concluded that it doesn't need the full complement of
Hamilton services to effectively serve its bank customers. 

Household acquired Hamilton, then named Illinois Company
Investments, Inc., in 1989 when Household purchased Land of
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. Hamilton has achieved
substantial growth in its five years as a Household unit. When
it was acquired by Household, it had 12 offices in three states,
90 investment representatives, and revenues of $14 million. 
Currently Hamilton has 25 offices in six midwestern states, 350
investment representatives, and revenues of $85 million.

Principal Financial Securities is an investment banking and
securities brokerage firm based in Dallas. In 1993, the company
posted record growth with total income of $75 million, a 21
percent increase over the previous year.

The Principal Financial Group is a diversified family of
insurance and financial services companies with more than $44
billion in assets under management.

Household International, Inc. is a major provider of
consumer finance and banking services and consumer insurance and
investment products.
