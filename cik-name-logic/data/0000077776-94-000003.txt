PHH CORPORATION ANNOUNCES RECORD RESULTS; 
10 CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS OF RISING EARNINGS 
Full Year Net Income up 14%, Earnings Per Share Up 12% 

HUNT VALLEY, MARYLAND, May 23, 1994--PHH Corporation (NYSE:PHH) today 
reported record net income, earnings per share, and revenues for the year 
ended April 30, 1994. Net income increased 14 percent to $64.6 million 
compared with $56.4 million for the prior year. Earnings per share increased 
12 percent to $3.64 up from $3.25 for the prior year. Worldwide revenues 
increased 6 percent to $2.1 billion from $2.0 billion. 
For the fourth quarter of fiscal 1994, net income was $18.2 million, 
earnings per share were $1.03, and revenues were $533.9 million. 
"We are extremely proud of our accomplishments in fiscal 1994 and 
continuing our trend of 10 consecutive increases in quarterly earnings," said 
PHH Chairman and CEO Robert D. Kunisch. "We achieved our stated growth 
objectives, increased the number of new client signings and introduced many 
new and enhanced productivity services to the marketplace." 

MORTGAGE BANKING HAS BEST YEAR 
In discussing the Company's results, Kunisch said, "By every standard, it 
was a banner year for our mortgage banking services segment. At year-end, our 
servicing portfolio stood at $16.6 billion, a fifty percent increase over last 
year. This portfolio, with its high quality loans, provides us with an 
excellent long-term earnings stream. Loan originations were up 15 percent, and 
closings were up 44 percent over the comparable period last year." Kunisch 
added, "As anticipated, we are seeing a slowdown in refinancing activity 
because of rising interest rates. We expect this to be offset by expanding new 
customer groups and broadening our activities with affinity groups, 
corporations and our supplier networks. These efforts, coupled with the fact 
that we are beginning FY95 with a fifty percent larger servicing portfolio 
mean this business segment will remain a major contributor to earnings."

VEHICLE MANAGEMENT POSTS SOLID EARNINGS GROWTH 
Commenting on the vehicle management business, Kunisch said, "Gains from 
strong management fee growth and additional income from new automotive 
services fee-based products helped produce operating income gains from this 
business unit. North American operations exceeded our expectations and 
produced strong results. This unit is benefiting from our efforts toward 
becoming a broader transaction-based vehicle management services company. In 
the United Kingdom, results declined as our clients faced continuing pressure 
from the economy. In Germany, losses were comparable to last year but we are 
beginning to see a number of positive signs of improvement. Overall we expect 
this business unit to continue to show good growth in the coming fiscal year." 

CORPORATE DOWNSIZINGS IMPACT RELOCATION AND REAL ESTATE 
Reporting on the relocation and real estate services segment, Kunisch 
noted, "Results for the year were substantially below prior year. This major 
shortfall in profits came from steps undertaken this year to integrate our 
Canadian acquisition and refocus and realign our relocation business segment 
to meet a changing marketplace. We have taken steps to significantly improve 
cost efficiency, unbundle our traditional products, and aggressively expand 
our destination services and other fee-based real estate products. " 

OUTLOOK FOR FISCAL 1995 
Kunisch concluded, "In fiscal 1995, we expect another excellent year from 
our vehicle management business aided by significant improvements in Europe. 
We likewise, expect good recovery performance from our relocation and real 
estate services business reflecting the results of our cost reduction actions 
and expanded asset management volume in handling foreclosed properties for the 
financial services industry. We expect growth in fiscal 1995 to be more evenly 
distributed over our three business segments than in recent years, thereby 
enabling us to again meet our stated growth objectives."
