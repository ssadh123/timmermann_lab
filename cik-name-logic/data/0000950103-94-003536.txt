Notes to Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

a) Adjustments to record the disposition of certain cellular
properties. The adjustments assume that the sales proceeds, net of certain
escrow reserves and holdbacks discussed below and net of income taxes estimated
to be payable after the utilization of certain net operating loss
carryforwards, are retained as temporary cash investments.
The escrow reserves and holdbacks are
included in other current assets. The adjustments assume the realization of
deferred tax assets of approximately $21 million, representing the tax
benefits associated with the utilization of approximately $54.7 million
federal net operating loss carryforwards and approximately $18.9
million state net operating loss carryforwards. The final resolution of the
Company's current IRS examination may impact the utilization of net
operating loss carryforwards.
Adjustments also assume a reduction in a related valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets of approximately $6 million.
An after-tax gain of approximately $55 million was assumed to be recognized
on the sale.

Certain working capital adjustments to the sales price to be
made ninety days after closing were estimated to be approximately $7 million
based on the historical asset and liability balances at June 30, 1994.

b) Adjustments to eliminate the historical results of operations of
certain cellular properties. Corporate overhead allocated to cellular
operations has not been eliminated since that overhead would have been
reallocated to other business segments.

c) The Pro Forma Consolidated Statements of Operations exclude a
non-recurring after-tax gain of approximately $55 million expected to be
realized on the sale, any gain or loss resulting from the curtailment of the
pension obligation related to employees of the Company's cellular operations,
and the reversal of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets of
approximately $6 million.

d) Deferred revenue represents proceeds allocated by the Company to certain
noncompetition agreements entered into with an affiliate of Independent
Cellular Network, Inc. in connection with the disposition by the Company of
its cellular properties. The revenue will be recognized over the term of the
agreements, which is approximately three years.

e) Proceeds from the disposition and noncompetition agreements were $182.5
million subject to certain adjustments, estimated to be approximately $7
million, to be made within ninety days after closing. Such proceeds were
received in cash, subject to certain escrow reserves and holdbacks of
approximately $16 million.

The remaining shares of capital stock in ICCTC are held by the

parties and in the amounts identified on Schedule 2.5. Except

for this Agreement, there are no outstanding warrants, options

or rights of any kind to acquire from CP of I any of the ICCTC

Shares. Delivery of the ICCTC Shares by CP of I to Buyer in

accordance with this Agreement

<PAGE>

will vest title to all of the ICCTC Shares in Buyer, free and

clear of all liens, security interests, pledges, encumbrances,

claims and equities of every kind.

2.6 Status of Partnership Interests. CCTS is the lawful

owner of the Partnership Interests and has good and marketable

title thereto, free and clear of all liens, claims, security

interests, pledges, encumbrances and equities of every kind,

which Partnership Interests entitle CCTS to the percentage of

the profits, losses, distributions, percentage interests,

capital account balances and voting rights in the Partnerships

set forth on Schedule I attached hereto. CCTS's and Selling

Group's and its Affiliates' sole ownership interest in the

Partnerships is represented by the Partnership Interests. There

are no outstanding rights, options, warrants, subscriptions or

agreements of any kind to acquire from CCTS or Selling Group

any of the Partnership Interests other than the various rights

of first refusal set forth in each of the Partnership

Agreements of the Partnerships (collectively, the "Partnership

Agreements"). Other than as set forth on the financial

statements of the Partnerships (and provided for on the Working

Capital Adjustment), none of the Partnerships nor any present

or former partner of CCTS in the Partnerships nor any

affiliate, are owed any sums attributable to capital

contributions, loans, advances, consulting fees, management

fees, deferred fees, guarantee fees, compensation or similar

payments or is contesting its partnership or percentage

interest therein. Other than as set forth on the financial

statements of the Partnerships, neither CCTS nor any Affiliate

owes any sums (whether capital contributions, loans, advances,

consulting fees, management fees, deferred fees, guarantee

fees, compensation or similar payments or otherwise) to any of

the Partnerships. The acquisition of CCTS by Buyer contemplated

by this Agreement would, under each of the Partnership

Agreements, not require the consent or approval of the

respective Partnership, any other partner in the Partnerships

or any third party, except as set forth in Section 5.7 hereof,

and CCTS will continue as a general partner or limited partner

in the Partnerships, as the case may be, with all of the rights

which CCTS possessed as such a partner prior to the Closing

Date. Selling Group has delivered true and correct copies of

the Partnership Agreements to Buyer. The Partnership Agreements

are in full force and effect, have not been amended or modified

(except as provided in writing to Buyer), and there have been

no breaches, defaults or notices thereof or events which with

or without the passage of time or the giving of notice or both

would constitute a breach or default or both by CCTS or, to the

knowledge of Selling Group, any other partner thereto. Schedule

I attached hereto sets forth CCTS's capital account balances in

the Partnerships and such balances represent the percentage of

the aggregate capital account balance of all partners in the

Partnerships. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.6, CCTS has not

received notice of any other partner's in the Partnerships

intent to transfer or assign their interests in the

Partnership. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.6, there is

presently no notice pending which would require CCTS or any

other partner to contribute additional capital to the

Partnerships. CCTS or any other partner of a Controlled

<PAGE>

Partnership has never received any distributions from the

Partnerships in excess of or less than CCTS's or such partner's

pro rata entitlement thereto and no contributions of CCTS to

the Partnerships have been returned by the Partnerships to

CCTS. Schedule 2.6 contains a list of (a) all prior capital

calls (dates, amounts and purposes of each), (b) all prior

distributions of cash from the Partnerships to its partners,

both since the date CCTS acquired its interest in each

Partnership, (c) all dilutions of partners (and increase in

partners' interests) resulting from a partner's failure to make

a call for additional capital, (d) any notices or claims made

accordance with Schedule 5.6 or pursuant to the direction of

Buyer. If Selling Group expends more than the Construction

receive a credit at Closing equal to the difference between the

amounts actually expended by Selling Group and the Construction

interest in a Partnership, including restrictions with respect

to PA3LP and the management agreement for PA5GP (a "Stock Sale

Transfer") or (b) transfer of a partnership interest to an

obtain or assist Buyer in obtaining a waiver from unaffiliated

partners in PA3LP and PA4LP with respect to any future rights

of first refusal such partners may have in connection with

transfers of interest by,~CTS in PA3LP and PA4LP. If Selling

Group is unable, prior to Closing, to obtain the consents of

all unaffiliated partners in PA3LP to the Stock Sale Transfers,

Buyer shall receive a Purchase Price reduction equal to (X) the

proportionate number of "pops" (pursuant to 1990 U.S. Census

Data) owned by the Selling Group in any such Partnership

(believed to be 37,070 in sector 1 and 9,637 in sector 2),

multiplied by (Y) a per "pop" value of $180 ("Reduction

Amount"). In addition, C-TEC and Selling Group shall continue

to use their best efforts after the Closing to obtain the

consents of all unaffiliated partners in PA3LP to the Stock

Sale Transfers and if the receipt of same occurs within one

hundred and eighty (180) days of the Closing, Buyer shall pay

the Reduction Amount to Selling Group by wire transfer of same

day funds. To the extent that the transfer of the PA3LP

interest is retained by Selling Group, Selling Group shall

provide Buyer with a right of first refusal (subject to the

terms of the relevant Partnership Agreement) to purchase said

interest. If Selling Group is unable to obtain the consents of

the unaffiliated partners in PA5GP to the Stock Sale Transfers

(i.e. to keep CCTS as the System Manager), Buyer shall be

entitled to receive all termination payments and other amounts

that may be due to CCTS in connection with the termination of

the manaqement aqreement for PA5GP

5.8 Partition of Certain Partnerships. Selling Group will

use its best efforts to cause PA3LP and PA4LP (the "Partitioned

RSAs") to be partitioned (collectively, the "Partitions") into

two sectors as contemplated in the respective Partnership

Agreements for such Partnerships prior to Closing. Selling

Group will use its best efforts to obtain Final Approval for

the Partitions on or prior to the Closing Date. Simultaneous

with the Partitions, the Partnerships covering (a) sector 1 of

both Partitioned RSAs shall be owned 100% by CCTS (or Buyer)

and all other partners shall release and waive any claims in

and to said partnerships and against CCTS as general partner

and (b) sector 2 shall be created to reflect (in the case of

PA3LP) CCTS's ownership interest and rights (and consents to

transfer as contemplated in Section 5.7 hereof). If Final

Approval for the Partition of PA4LP has not been obtained on or

prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall have the option of

paying into an escrow ("Partition Escrow") a portion of the

Purchase Price equal to $252,300, which is equal to (a) (i) the

proportionate number of "pops" pursuant to 1990 U.S. Census

Data to be owned by CCTS in PA4LP after the Partition (28,076),

minus (ii) the proportionate number of "pops" pursuant to 1990

U.S. Census

<PAGE>

Data that would be owned by CCTS in PA4LP if the Partition did

not occur (26,396 or (95,147 x 27.742%)), multiplied by t2) a

per ''popll value of $150, ("Partition Holdback"). The

Partition Escrow shall be a joint order escrow and shall

provide that the Partition Holdback, together with all accrued

interest on such portion, will be (X) paid to Selling Group

upon the granting of Final Approval for the Partition of PA4LP,

or (Y) paid to Buyer upon the final rejection by the FCC of the

petition requesting Final Approval for the Partition of PA4LP.
