shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with such effect
and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture. Any

The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and
the Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures at the
time outstanding, evidenced as in the Indenture provided, to
execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to the

registrar may deem and treat the registered holder hereof as the
absolute owner of this Debenture (whether or not this Debenture
shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notations of ownership
or other writing hereon made by anyone other than the Security
registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account
of the principal hereof and interest due hereon as herein
provided and for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor
the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security registrar shall
be affected by any notice to the contrary.

No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of
or premium, if any, or interest on this Debenture, or for any
claim based hereon, or otherwise in respect hereof, or based on
