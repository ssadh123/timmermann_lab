Summary: ROCHESTER TEL TO ACQUIRE WCT COMMUNICATIONS
RCI Expands to Become Nationwide Company

Rochester, New York -- October 10, 1994 -- In its largest long distance

acquisition to date, Rochester Telephone Corporation (NYSE: RTC) will

acquire the California-based WCT Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ: WCTI).

Rochester Tel and WCT announced that they signed a Letter of

Intent which provides that Rochester Tel will make a cash tender offer

for all of the stock of WCT for $7.325 in cash for each share of WCT,

as more fully described later in this release. The total consideration

will be approximately $110 million in cash. The transaction is subject

to several conditions, including the approval of the Rochester Tel

Board of Directors, the WCT Board, necessary regulatory approvals, and

appropriate due diligence.

Once the transaction is finalized, WCT's interexchange operations

will be merged into Rochester Tel's long distance operation, RCI Long

Distance. RCI, with annualized revenues of over $300 million, is

currently the nation's ninth largest long distance carrier. WCT had

revenues of $103 million in its fiscal year ended June 30, 1994.

"This acquisition is an important milestone for Rochester Tel and

the next logical step for RCI," said Ronald L. Bittner, Rochester Tel's

chief executive officer. "The acquisition of WCT will accelerate RCI's

nationwide long distance expansion by at least a year. Geographically,

WCT is an excellent match, with service in 45 states and switches in

major metropolitan areas we have already targeted for expansion," said

Bittner.

WCT has switches in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas,

Atlanta and Seattle, while RCI maintains switches in Philadelphia,

Cleveland, Atlanta, Chicago, New York City, Washington, DC, Rochester,

NY, Burlington, VT and Manchester, NH. RCI, which was launched as a

regional long distance carrier in 1984, has introduced 1-plus services

nationwide over the last several years and now markets in 20 states in

the Midwest, South and Northeast.

Bittner added that WCT's customer base of small and mid-sized

business, and its growing retail presence, are a good match for RCI.

"RCI also has a strong base of mid-sized business accounts," said

Bittner, "and a growing retail base. RCI's retail revenues increased

by 43 percent in 1993 alone." A significant contributor to the growth

has been the popularity of RCI's Budget Call service, a direct-dial

retail product offering that does not require a customer to change long

distance carriers, now available in 16 states.

"This transaction is the right fit for WCT," said Richard Frockt,

chief executive officer of WCT. "We have built a strong company that

now needs to be part of a larger organization such as Rochester Tel and

<PAGE>
<PAGE>3

RCI. Our compatible philosophies and Rochester Tel's reputation as a

leader in the industry make this an excellent alliance."

Of the $7.325 per share, approximately $7.05 will be paid in cash

for each share of WCT common stock outstanding on the closing of the

tender offer and approximately $.27 will be payable for each share and

for each option and warrant to purchase a share of WCT. The $.27 shall

be deposited into escrow at the closing to cover the costs and

potential liability of certain litigation against WCT. Any amounts not

so used will be distributed to the holders of share options and

warrants as described above.

The cash tender offer will be followed by a cash merger in which

any shares not tendered will be acquired at the same price. The Letter

of Intent provides that the acquisition will not be subject to a

financing contingency. Richard Frockt and Christopher Edgecomb,

executive vice president, who between them hold approximately 30

percent of WCT's outstanding common stock, have agreed to tender their

shares to Rochester Tel in connection with the offer.

The tender offer will commence no later than October 17, 1994,

subject to the negotiation and execution of definitive documentation

and the approval of the acquisition by the respective Boards of

Directors of Rochester Tel and WCT no later than noon, New York City

time, on October 16, 1994. If the respective Boards of Directors of

Rochester Tel and WCT have not approved the acquisition by such time,

the Letter of Intent may be terminated by either party.

<PAGE>4

Since definitive agreements remain to be negotiated, there can be

no assurance that a transaction will ultimately be consummated. The

transaction requires various regulatory approvals, including that of

the New York State Public Service Commission ("NYSPSC").

Rochester Tel has acquired four other long distance companies over

the last three years: Long Distance North (Burlington, VT) and Taconic

Long Distance (Albany, NY) in 1991, and Budget Call Long Distance and

Mid Atlantic Telecom (Washington, DC) in 1993. Total long distance

revenues have grown from less than $144 million in 1990 to annualized

revenue of more than $300 million for 1994.

Based in Rochester, New York, Rochester Telephone Corporation is a

provider of integrated telecommunications services to more than 1.5

million customers in 32 states in the Northeast, Midwest and South.

Rochester Tel's principal lines of business are long distance service,

local telephone operations and cellular service. Its innovative Open

Market Plan, which would make Rochester the first community in the

country to be open to competition for local telephone service, will be

considered by the NYSPSC on October 13.

WCT Communications, Inc.
Revenues for fiscal year ending June 30, 1994: $103 million

WCT entered the long distance business in 1989. The company has
two primary areas of business: wholesale services in which the company
provides termination services for other long distance carriers and
resellers; and retail services in which the company provides both long
distance and local services, principally to small and mid-size
businesses. WCT controls one of the most extensive long-distance
networks in California.

In its fiscal year ended June 30, 1994, WCT's wholesale and retail
commercial customers accounted for approximately 60 percent and 40
percent, respectively, of total revenues.

RCI - Rochester Tel's Long Distance Operation
1993 Revenues: $263 million

RCI Long Distance provides a full range of long distance voice,
video and data communications services for business and residential
customers in the Northeast, Midwest, Mid-Atlantic and several southern
states. Through reciprocal arrangements with other long distance
carriers, RCI provides interconnections to the entire United States and
200 countries around the world, including direct dial services between
countries outside of the U.S.

Launched in 1984, RCI has built a robust network employing digital
switching systems, fiber optics, terrestrial microwave and SS7, the
latest industry-standard switching technology. With a network
availability rating of 99.9976 percent, the RCI network exceeds the
industry benchmarks for excellence.

Growth in long distance services over the past several years has
come from sales and marketing of the company's products; numerous
value-oriented programs and partnerships; the establishment of a resale
operation in communities served by the company's telephone
subsidiaries; and the acquisition of four long distance companies.
