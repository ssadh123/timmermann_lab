Item 5. Other Events

On January 31, 1994, the following news release was issued:

UNOCAL OPERATING EARNINGS UP BY 48 PERCENT FOR YEAR;
AT $70 MILLION FOR FOURTH QUARTER

Los Angeles, January 31 -- Unocal Corporation today said that preliminary
1993 operating earnings, excluding the effects of accounting changes and other
special items (detailed in attached table), were $347 million, or $1.29 per
common share.
This compares with full-year 1992 operating earnings, excluding special
items, of $234 million, or 91 cents per common share.
Including accounting changes and other special items, net earnings for
1993 were $213 million, or 73 cents per common share. Net earnings for 1992
were $220 million, or 85 cents per common share.
Cash flow from operations, before working capital changes, was $1.42
billion in 1993, up 28 percent from $1.11 billion in 1992.
Richard J. Stegemeier, Unocal chairman and chief executive officer, said
that increased operating earnings for full-year 1993 reflected higher domestic
natural gas prices and production, improved West Coast refining and marketing
margins, lower exploration expenses, continued cost reductions, and lower
interest expense.
"For the fourth quarter, Unocal's higher U.S. natural gas volumes -- up
10 percent over fourth quarter 1992 -- indicate that our three-year
accelerated development program is beginning to yield results," Stegemeier
said. "However," he added, "the fourth quarter 1993 was particularly
difficult with the fall in crude oil and domestic natural gas prices and lower
petroleum product margins. These factors offset the production gains and
depressed earnings."
In the fourth quarter 1993, Unocal's earnings from operations, excluding
special items, were $70 million, or 25 cents per common share. This compares
with

<PAGE2>
$91 million, or 34 cents per common share, a year earlier.
Including special items, 1993 fourth quarter net earnings were $44
million, or 14 cents per common share. Net earnings for 1992 fourth quarter
were $103 million, or 39 cents per common share.
The fourth quarter 1993 special items included a $12 million writeoff of
refining projects, primarily the cancellation of a portion of the work
associated with the reformulated fuels program at the company's Los Angeles
Refinery. Reformulated fuels programs are continuing, but with lower capital
costs. The results for the quarter also reflected a $10 million charge for
unusual litigation and environmental costs and a $4 million provision for the
closure of the company's credit card processing facility. Credit card
processing was outsourced.
Fourth quarter 1993 cash flow from operations, before working capital
changes, was $356 million, up from $334 million a year ago.
Stegemeier noted that Unocal's worldwide average crude oil sales price
was $12.47 per barrel in the fourth quarter, down from $16.23 per barrel for
the same period in 1992. The average domestic natural gas sales price in the
fourth quarter 1993 was $1.98 per thousand cubic feet (mcf), down from $2.07
per mcf in the fourth quarter a year ago.
Stegemeier said the company is now 80 percent of the way toward meeting
its goal of generating $700 million in after-tax proceeds from asset sales.
At year-end 1993, the company had realized proceeds of $560 million (after-
tax) from asset sales under the initiative announced in April 1992.
In 1993, the company pared its total debt by $176 million to $3.5
billion. In April 1992 Unocal said it planned to reduce total debt by $1.5
billion by 1997. To date, total debt has been reduced by $1.2 billion under
this initiative.
Fourth quarter revenues were $1.97 billion, down from $2.46 billion in
1992. The full-year 1993 revenues were $8.34 billion, down from $10.06
billion a year ago. The company had lower operating revenues because it sold
several businesses in 1992 and 1993.
Fourth quarter capital expenditures rose to $436 million, up from $253
million a year ago. For the full-year 1993, capital expenditures were $1.25
billion, up from $959 million the previous year. The increases reflect the
company's accelerated domestic development drilling program.
Exploration expense for the fourth quarter totaled $31 million, down from
$43 million a year ago. For the full-year, exploration expense was $119
million, compared with $170 million the previous year.

PETROLEUM EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION
- ------------------------------------
Fourth quarter 1993 operating earnings (excluding special items) from
petroleum exploration and production totaled $89 million, compared with $116
million in 1992. Full-year operating earnings were $432 million for 1993,
versus $415 million in 1992.
The quarter and full-year results reflect lower worldwide crude oil
prices, higher domestic natural gas production, lower exploration costs and
other cost reductions.
Net worldwide crude oil and condensate production for the fourth quarter
averaged 245,800 barrels per day, down from 251,200 barrels per day a year
ago.
Fourth quarter daily worldwide natural gas production averaged 1,626
million cubic feet in 1993, compared with 1,609 million cubic feet in 1992.
The average natural gas sales price was $2.02 per mcf, down slightly from
$2.05 per mcf the previous year. Increases in domestic natural gas production
more than offset the decline in foreign production. This decline reflected
continued curtailments in pipeline allocations for Unocal's Gulf of Thailand
operations. A new pipeline, slated for start-up in February 1994, will allow
Unocal to increase its Thai gas volumes.

REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION
- --------------------------------------
Excluding special items, fourth quarter earnings for Unocal's refining,
marketing and transportation segment totaled $39 million, compared with $43
million in 1992. Full-year 1993 earnings for the segment were $175 million,
up from $127 million in 1992.
For the fourth quarter, margins on refined product sales were lower. The
full-year results reflected higher West Coast margins and lower losses from
the company's Southeast U.S. marketing operations, which are being phased out.
In the fourth quarter, sales of petroleum products averaged 341,600
barrels per day, down from 406,000 barrels per day the previous year. The
sale of the company's Auto/TruckStop system and the continuing phase out of
Southeast U.S. marketing contributed to the lower product sales.

CHEMICALS
- ---------
Unocal's chemicals segment recorded earnings (excluding special items) of
$9 million in the fourth quarter and $44 million for the full-year 1993. For
1992, the chemicals segment broke even in the fourth quarter and had earnings
of $24 million for the full year. The improved earnings performance was due
principally to losses incurred in 1992 by businesses that have been sold, as
well as improved petroleum coke operations.

GEOTHERMAL
- ----------
Fourth quarter 1993 geothermal earnings, excluding special items, were $6
million, compared with $20 million a year ago. Full-year earnings were $22
million in

<PAGE4>
1993, down from $45 million the previous year. Earnings for the quarter and
full-year in the previous year had included the company's Imperial Valley
operations, which were sold in 1993. Also affecting the quarterly and full-
year comparison were higher expenses in Indonesia, where the company is
actively developing new geothermal resources. In Indonesia, a 110-megawatt
power plant is expected to start up in the first quarter 1994.
Corporate and Other
Net expense for corporate and other, excluding special items, were $73
million in the fourth quarter 1993. This compares with $88 million in the
same period in 1992. The 1993 fourth quarter results included a year-to-date
income tax adjustment that was not allocated to the business segments.
The adjusted full-year 1993 expenses were $326 million, versus $377
million in 1992.
The results reflect lower interest expense and improved mineral
operations. Ongoing environmental costs were higher for the full year, but
lower for the quarter.
