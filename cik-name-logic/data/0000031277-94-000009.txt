of substantially all the assets and business of the Distribution

Corporation for a cash purchase price of $1.1 billion. DCBU is
engaged in the manufacture and sale of electrical distribution
and control products. Funds for the purchase price were obtained
by the Company through the private placement of $930 million of
its short-term promissory notes and from existing cash reserves. 
The acquisition was effected through several subsidiaries or
other business entities of the Company.

In order to obtain U.S. government approval of the acquisition
under the antitrust laws, on January 31, 1994, the Company sold 
certain assets of DCBU, primarily consisting of operating assets
in Vidalia, Georgia and Canovanas, Puerto Rico, to Thomas & Betts
Corporation of Memphis, Tennessee.

It is impracticable for the Company to provide the financial
