FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

KEYCORP REPORTS RECORD QUARTERLY EARNINGS
-----------------------------------------

CLEVELAND, July 18, 1994 -- KeyCorp (NYSE: KEY) today reported record
earnings of $222 million for the 1994 second quarter, up 13 percent from the
year-ago quarter.

"We could not be more pleased with the results posted in the 1994
second quarter," said Victor J. Riley, Jr., chairman of the board and chief
executive officer. "This was the first complete quarter since the March 1,
1994, merger with Society Corporation and net income was right on plan."

Earnings per common share for the second quarter were $0.89, up 10
percent from the same period last year.

"We remain confident of attaining our cost savings targets," Riley
continued, "and we are also very encouraged to see early signs of success with
the revenue enhancement programs that provided an important strategic basis for
the merger. The completion of our merger integration process allows us to
focus our efforts on revenue generation and the pursuit of expansion
opportunities such as the recently announced acquisitions pending in the states
of Maine, Vermont, and Indiana."

For the first six months of 1994, net income was $430 million, an
increase of 11 percent from the first half of 1993, with earnings per common
share totaling $1.74, up 10 percent. Prior year results have been restated for
the March 1, 1994, merger with Society Corporation, accounted for as a pooling
of interests.

"Loan growth was particularly strong," said Robert W. Gillespie,
president and chief operating officer, "reflecting in part the favorable impact
of our 'Small Business Initiative'. This is our first franchise-wide program
since the merger which harnessed the product development, marketing, and
delivery system capabilities of the new corporation. Launched in mid-April,
this 12-week program was targeted to generate $200 million in new high-quality
small business loans. In the second quarter we booked $238 million in new
loans, and applications for another $278 million are yet to be processed. We
now expect new loan volume to more than double our original target for this
program."

Commenting on financial performance, James W. Wert, senior executive
vice president and chief financial officer, said, "The high performance
characteristics that have been KeyCorp's hallmark continued during the 1994
second quarter with a return on average total assets of 1.43 percent and a
return on average common equity of 19.8 percent. Our efficiency ratio, after
excluding net securities gains, improved to 58.4 percent from 60.1 percent in
the 1994 first quarter as we have begun to realize the combined impact of
initial merger-related cost savings and revenue growth. We are also pleased to
see that growth in average earning assets, primarily loans, resulted in an
increase in net interest income from the prior quarter, despite a modest
decline in the net interest margin."

Net interest income in the 1994 second quarter was up $6 million, or 1
percent, from the year-ago quarter. The favorable impact of a $4.9 billion, or
9 percent, increase in the level of average earning assets was partially offset
by a decline in the net interest margin to 4.92 percent from 5.35 percent.
Compared with the 1994 first quarter, net interest income increased $12
million, or 2 percent, reflecting the favorable impact of a $2.0 billion, or 4
percent, increase in average earning assets which more than offset a decline in
the net interest margin to 4.92 percent from 5.03 percent.

At June 30, 1994, loans totaled $43.2 billion, up $1.8 billion, or 17
percent on an annualized basis, from March 31, 1994. Average loans in the 1994
second quarter, compared to the first quarter, were up $1.8 billion. On an
annualized basis, 1994

second quarter average loan increases by region compared to the prior quarter
were: Rocky Mountain Region, 56 percent (23 percent excluding acquisitions);
Northeast Region, 16 percent; Northwest Region, 15 percent; and Great Lakes
Region, 13 percent.

Noninterest income in the 1994 second quarter was $227 million. When
noncore items such as special asset management fees and net securities
transactions are excluded from all reporting periods for comparative purposes,
core noninterest income in the current quarter was $220 million, an increase of
$2 million from the prior quarter, but down $24 million, or 10 percent, from
the year-ago quarter. This reflected the September 1993 sale of Ameritrust
Texas which contributed approximately $12 million to last year's second quarter
noninterest income and an $8 million, or 30 percent, decrease in mortgage
banking fee income.

The decline in mortgage banking revenue reflected the dramatic
industry-wide decline in origination activity from the record levels
experienced last year. Trust and investment management income was down
slightly from the 1994 first quarter, reflecting declines in both the stock and
bond markets, but up 7 percent from the year-ago quarter, after excluding the
impact of the 1993 divestiture of Ameritrust Texas. Regarding other major
categories of noninterest income, service charges on deposits increased $6
million from the first quarter level and were up 7 percent from the second
quarter of last year. Credit card fees increased $2 million from the first
quarter and slightly from last year. Insurance and brokerage fees decreased
slightly during the current quarter compared to the 1994 first quarter, and
were down $2 million, or 13 percent, from the year-ago quarter. The all other
income category decreased $4 million from the 1994 first quarter, and was down
$10 million, or 19 percent, from the year-ago quarter.

Special asset management fees increased $5 million from the 1994 first
quarter. As previously disclosed, these fees are associated with loan
collection work done for the FDIC and are expected to decrease over time as the
FDIC assets under contract are collected and, therefore, decline. These fees
will continue to exhibit quarter-to-

quarter volatility depending on the timing associated with the loan work-outs.
For this reason, they are considered noncore fee income.

Noninterest expense totaled $539 million in the 1994 second quarter.
Excluding net OREO expense, core noninterest expense was down $21 million, or 4
percent, from the year-ago quarter. Compared to the 1994 first quarter, core
noninterest expense declined $5 million, reflecting an $8 million decline in
personnel expense and decreases in equipment and net occupancy expenses
totaling $3 million. These decreases reflected a number of factors including
the beginning phase of anticipated merger-related cost savings, as well as a
downsizing of our mortgage banking business in light of the industry-wide
decline in originations. The all other expense category in the 1994 second
quarter was up $6 million from the previous quarter.

Credit quality measures continued to improve from their already strong
levels. Nonperforming assets declined $32 million, or 7 percent, from the 1994
first quarter and represented 1.00 percent of loans plus other real estate
owned and other nonperforming assets. Net loan charge-offs totaled $31
million, or 0.30 percent of average loans, relatively unchanged from the 1994
first quarter. Reflecting the improvement in credit quality measures, the
provision for loan losses in the 1994 second quarter was $35 million, down from
$37 million in the prior quarter. As a result of the growth in loans, the
allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans decreased slightly to 1.89
percent from 1.96 percent at March 31, 1994. Both the nonperforming loan and
nonperforming asset coverage ratios increased and remain strong at 264 percent
and 189 percent, respectively.

At June 30, 1994, assets totaled $63.4 billion and equity capital
totaled $4.6 billion. During the quarter the corporation repurchased 1.2
million shares of its common stock under the previously announced share
buy-back program. The June 30, 1994, Tier 1 capital ratio was estimated at
8.72 percent and the Total Capital ratio was estimated at 11.96 percent.
