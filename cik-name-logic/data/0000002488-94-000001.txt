ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES ANNOUNCES
LONG-TERM AGREEMENT WITH COMPAQ

SUNNYVALE, CA ... January 26, 1994 ... Advanced Micro Devices
announced today that it has entered into a long-term agreement under which
AMD will supply current and future generations of Microsoft registered
trademark Windows trademark -compatible microprocessors to Compaq Computer
Corporation. AMD said initial shipments of Am486 trademark microprocessors
will commence in the current quarter.

"Advanced Micro Devices is excited at the prospect of working more 
closely with one of the world's premier personal computer 
manufacturers," said W.J. Sanders III, chairman and chief executive 
officer. "'Differentiation within standards' will be the key to success 
for computer and chip vendors in the '90s. Our challenge is to provide 
Compaq with high-volume microprocessor products that will assist them in 
achieving their goal of becoming the world's leading supplier of personal 
computers.

"Compaq's commitment to building personal computers that maximize
ease-of-use and incorporate features to enhance user productivity make them 
an ideal technology partner for AMD," Mr. Sanders continued.

"This agreement completes the triad of enabling agreements that will 
catapult AMD into the forefront of the digital revolution made possible 
by the ubiquitous microprocessor. The first of these agreements is 
our joint venture with Fujitsu Limited. That alliance permits AMD and 
Fujitsu to build and share a billion-dollar, state-of-the-art, dedicated 
manufacturing facility in Japan for sub-0.5-micron flash memory products 
while AMD is simultaneously investing in a second billion-dollar, wholly 
owned, dedicated manufacturing facility for sub-0.5-micron microprocessor 
products at our Austin, Texas, site. The second agreement is our 
technology collaboration with Hewlett-Packard Company under
which we are currently jointly developing 0.35-micron logic technology for
the next generation of microprocessors. 

"Finally, the agreement with Compaq will be of enormous 
value in our efforts to develop innovative, silicon-based solutions that 
provide the determinant technology for higher performance, improved 
functionality and ease-of-use in a broad range of information devices. By
working with Compaq, a proven technology leader who has demonstrated an 
ability to produce world-class Windows-compatible products, AMD will derive 
significant benefits in the form of assistance in the definition of future
microprocessor requirements, as well as system-level compatibility and 
verification from Compaq -- the world's foremost authority on PC 
compatibility. AMD believes that competition is the driving force
of innovation and technological progress which ultimately benefit 
end-users."

"Compaq's philosophy of providing differentiated 
personal computers within widely accepted industry standards closely 
parallels AMD's corporate mission, which is to provide our customers with 
industry-standard products with a performance edge that reduce the cost 
and shorten the time to market for our customers worldwide," 
Mr. Sanders concluded.
