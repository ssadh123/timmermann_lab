Item 5. Other Events
- - -----------------------

Mellon Bank Corporation ("Mellon") completed its acquisition of The Boston
Company ("TBC") in May 1993. On May 25, 1993, Mellon filed a Current Report on
Form 8-K describing the completion of the TBC acquisition and, on June 30,
1993, filed a Form 8-K/A with financial statements and exhibits required under
Item 7.

In connection with that acquisition, Mellon recorded $175 million
of merger expenses, or approximately $112 million after-tax, to reflect
various expenses necessitated by the merger. This Form 8-K provides the
originally estimated components used to record the merger expenses, the
current revised estimate of the costs of each component, the actual costs
incurred by quarter through March 31, 1994, and the periods in which the
remaining expenditures are expected to occur.

When Mellon was evaluating the potential acquisition of TBC, Mellon identified
a number of duplicate systems, processes, locations and staff that would
require integration. This was expected to result in significant cost savings,
compared to the total of the respective companies' operating expenses, but
would require certain expenditures to eliminate duplication and to achieve the
benefit from system processing economies of scale.

Integration plans were developed with high regard given to the customer service
nature of the businesses being merged, the intolerance for error and the need
for a controlled and orderly transition. This was required to preserve
existing customer relationships and provide an uninterrupted level and quality
of service during the customer-by-customer conversions to the combined systems.
The incremental expenses necessary to accomplish this integration of systems,
staffs and facilities included estimated expenditures for systems integration 
and severance over a two and one half year period. Expenditures on systems 
conversions were planned to be low in the initial months following the 
acquisition and increasing over the two and a half year period. Likewise, 
expenditures on severance were expected to generally follow the systems 
expenditures, as duplicative processes were integrated and the merged 
systems became operational.

In connection with the acquisition, Mellon reevaluated the carrying value of
certain assets in light of the strategic direction of the merged businesses.
This resulted in adjustment to the merged entity's carrying values that would
not have been required had the merger not occurred.

The following table shows the original and current estimates of the components
of the merger expenses and the remaining accruals at March 31, 1994.
Adjustments to estimates for a $20 million reduction of severance expense and a
$19 million increase to systems integration expense were necessary due to
changed circumstances following the acquisition date, primarily due to
larger-than-anticipated voluntary attrition at TBC.

Approximately 54% of the $175 million has been incurred at March 31, 1994 to
implement activities through the first ten months following acquisition.
Current plans indicate approximately 85% or more will be incurred by year-end
1994 and the remaining 15% in 1995.

NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED INCOME STATEMENT FOR THE
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993

(a) The pro forma condensed income statement for the year ended December 31,
1993 combines the historical results of operations of the Corporation and
TBC as if the transaction had been completed and the related financing
been completed on January 1, 1993. The pro forma income statement uses
historical revenue, expense, and interest rates to the extent possible;
however, certain estimates and assumptions were necessary. Purchase
accounting adjustments assumed in this pro forma income statement may
change as additional information becomes available. The pro forma
adjustments include the effects of removing the financial results of nine
subsidiaries of TBC that were conveyed to Shearson via dividend prior to
the closing date of the transaction. The pro forma condensed income
statement is intended for informational purposes and is not indicative of
the future results of operations of the combined company or of the
results of operations that would have been obtained had the transactions
actually taken place on January 1, 1993.

(b) Certain amounts in TBC's income statement have been reclassified to
conform with the presentation used by the Corporation.

(c) To eliminate non-temporary valuation adjustments recorded by TBC on
investment securities that Shearson purchased from TBC prior to the
closing date.

(d) To eliminate revenues and expenses recorded on nine subsidiaries of TBC
that were conveyed via dividend to Shearson prior to the closing date of
the transaction.

(e) To eliminate the estimated interest revenue earned on the net proceeds of
the debt and equity issuances that were invested in money market
investments following these issuances in the first quarter of 1993.
Under its capital financing plan, the Corporation issued common stock on
January 25, 1993 for $229 million, net of $6 million of transaction
costs; $193 million of Series K preferred stock, net of $6 million of
transaction costs; and the debt issuances discussed below in note (g).
The income statement adjustment for 1993 was calculated using the
Corporation's weighted average interest rates for money market
investments for this period.

(f) To reflect the decrease in interest expense that would have resulted had
the net decrease in purchased funds, resulting primarily from the
issuance of senior debt, occurred at the beginning of the period. The
income statement adjustment for 1993 was calculated using the
Corporation's weighted average interest rates for federal funds purchased
for this period.

(g) To reflect the increase in interest expense that would have resulted had
the Corporation issued notes and debentures related to the capital
financing plan at the beginning of the period. These include $200
million of 6-1/2% Senior Notes (issued January 1993), $150 million of
6-7/8% Subordinated Debentures (issued March 1993), and $200 million of
Floating Rate Senior Notes (issued April 1993). Actual interest rates
were used to calculate the income statement adjustment to interest
expense for these notes and debentures.

NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED INCOME STATEMENT FOR THE
YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993
(continued)

(h) To reflect the amortization of the noncompete covenant and goodwill that
would have been recorded had the transaction been effective January 1,
1993 based on the $457 million of goodwill and other intangibles recorded. 
The estimated lives used to calculate the straight-line amortization of the
noncompete covenant and goodwill were 7 and 20 years, respectively.

(i) To eliminate the $175 million of merger expenses resulting directly 
from this transaction, including the related $63 million tax benefit, 
recorded by the Corporation, as these expenses do not represent
ongoing expenses of the Corporation.

(j) The tax effects of all pro forma adjustments, except the merger expenses
described in note (i) above, were calculated at a presumed statutory tax 
rate, which was the Corporation's average combined statutory rate for 
federal, state and local taxes. This average combined statutory
rate was 40% for 1993.

(k) The pro forma average number of shares outstanding for 1993 reflects the
issuance to Shearson of 2.5 million shares of common stock and 4,312,500
shares issued in a public offering in January 1993. The number of shares
used for the earnings per share calculation also reflects the dilutive
effect of the warrants to purchase an additional 3 million shares of the
Corporation's common stock issued to Shearson had they been issued on
January 1, 1993, as further discussed in note (l).

(l) Primary earnings per share is computed by dividing net income applicable
to common shareholders (net income reduced by dividends on preferred
stock) plus Series D dividends, if dilutive, by the total of the average
number of common shares outstanding and any additional dilutive effect of
the Series D preferred stock, stock options, warrants, common stock
subscription rights and Series D preferred stock subscriptions (common
stock equivalents) outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of
the common stock equivalents was computed using the average market price
of the Corporation's common stock for the period.

(l) (continued)

Fully diluted earnings per share is computed based on the total of the
average number of common shares, common stock equivalents, and other
dilutive items outstanding during the period. The dilutive effect of the
warrants issued in connection with the transaction was computed using the
average market price of the Corporation's common stock for the period.

Earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 1993 are based on the
following information:

(m) To reflect the dividends that would have been paid had the Series K
preferred stock, issued January 25, 1993 under the capital financing plan,
been issued at the beginning of 1993. The dividend rate used for this
calculation was 8.20%, the actual rate on the Series K preferred stock.
