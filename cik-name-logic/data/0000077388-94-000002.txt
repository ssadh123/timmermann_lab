SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Net Income

Net income applicable to common stock increased $188,000, to
$63.8 million, in fiscal 1994 from 1993. Results for fiscal
1994 include the recording of one-half of an Internal
Revenue Service income tax settlement that increased net income
by $9.7 million. However, this increase was largely offset by
increased operating costs related to the provision for
uncollectible accounts, labor, and depreciation.

Capital Spending

Capital expenditures for fiscal 1995 are expected to be about
$81.6 million, an increase of $7.0 million from the 1994 level.
Estimated expenditures in 1995 include the continuation of the
cast iron main replacement program, $10.4 million for computer
and office equipment, and $1.3 million to complete the
underground storage site enhancement.
