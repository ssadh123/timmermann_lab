ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

As reported in prior securities filings of Science Applications
International Corporation (the "Company"), on August 1, 1994, the U.S.
Government intervened in a civil complaint filed by an employee of the Company's
SAIT operating unit seeking damages on behalf of the U.S. Government under the
False Claims Act. At that time, the U.S. Government announced its intention to
file an amended complaint in such action without giving any indication of the
substance of the amended complaint. To date, an amended complaint has not been
filed.

The Company has participated in a series of meetings with the U.S.
Government in which the Company has provided the U.S. Government with
information responding to various allegations contained in the civil complaint
filed by the individual. In the most recent meeting, the U.S. Government
identified certain issues it was investigating. The Company is in the process
of responding to these issues. Because the Company is not fully aware of the
substance of all of the U.S. Government's claims, it is unable at this stage to
assess the impact, if any, that this investigation and the lawsuit may
ultimately have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or
ability to conduct business.
