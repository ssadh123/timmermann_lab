shares to be held by Motorola following the stock split (the

(i) 36,800,000 New Sub Shares (the "Nextel Attribut-
able Shares") (provided, however, that if the 
Clearnet Transaction shall have theretofore been 
consummated such that Motorola and/or Motorola 
Canada (or designees of either of them) shall 
have therefore received 2,500,000 Company Shares 
in respect of the issuance of the Canadian 
Equity Interest to the Company, then the Nextel 
Attributable Shares shall be reduced by 
2,500,000); plus

(ii) the OneComm Attributable Shares (A) if the 
OneComm Merger shall theretofore have closed, or

(b) Immediately prior to the Closing, the Company, 
New Sub, and Motorola and the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries (in 
each case as applicable), together with each other Person

executed.

(c) Except for the Motorola McSMRs-Nextel Territory 
listed in the Company Disclosure Statement at Tab 9, as to 
which Motorola hereby confirms its waiver, prior to Closing, 
neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates shall acquire, or 
offer to acquire, any Motorola McSMR, unless Motorola has con-
sented to such offer or acquisition. The Company may request a 
waiver of this restriction with respect to one or more identi-
fied Motorola McSMRs-Nextel Territory, by notice given in 
accordance with Section 11.3 hereof which specifically identi-
fies the Motorola McSMR-Nextel Territory as to which a waiver 
is sought. If, within 15 business days of receipt of such 
notice, Motorola does not reject such waiver request in writ-
ing, Motorola shall be deemed to have irrevocably waived (i) 

-26-

the restriction set forth in this subparagraph (c) and (ii) 
Motorola's right of first refusal, in each case with respect to

nature whatsoever held by it with respect to (A) the SMR Li-

Statement that are owned by the Company or its Affiliates (the 
"Applicable Management Agreements") or (B) any Motorola McSMR-
Nextel Territory which the Company was permitted to offer to 
acquire, and did acquire, pursuant to this subparagraph (c) (it 
being understood that such waivers and terminations shall (1) 
be effective only to the extent that the licensee of such 
Motorola McSMR similarly agrees to terminate such agreements 
and that the documents to be executed by such licensee and 
Motorola and/or the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries shall be sub-
stantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit D (the 
"Management Termination Agreement") and (2) be subject to the 
provisions of Section 7.11(j) hereof).

2.3. The Closing. Subject to the terms and condi-
tions of this Agreement:

waiver thereof by Motorola, in its sole discretion), Motorola 
and the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries shall contribute to New Sub

of assignment in a form mutually acceptable to the parties 
hereto (the "Assignment Instrument"); provided, however, that 
if Motorola shall have received such assurances from the FCC as 
it deems satisfactory in its reasonable judgment, that the SMR 
Licenses to be assigned to ESMR Sub will not, prior to the 
Closing, be issued in a name other than that of New Sub, New

other third party, as appropriate. The parties hereto also 
intend and acknowledge that, at the Closing (without regard to 
any liabilities or obligations of the Company, or to which the 
Company may be subject immediately prior to the Effective Time) 
New Sub shall have or shall be subject to only (A) the Appli-
cable SMR Liabilities-Nextel Territory, (B) all additional

referred to as the "Assumed Liabilities."

(e) The assumption by New Sub from Motorola and the 
Motorola SMR Subsidiaries of the Applicable SMR Liabilities-
Nextel Territory has been effected by the Asset Transfer and 
Assumption of Liability Document. The assumption at Closing by 
New Sub from Motorola and the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries of the

-43-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

SMR Liabilities-Dial Page Territory shall be effected by the 
execution by New Sub of an instrument of assumption substan-
tially in the form of the Asset Transfer and Assumption of 
Liability Document but which reflects the substance of Sections 
4.1(b), 4.1(c), 4.2(b) and 4.2(c), as appropriate.

4.3. Issuance of Shares. Subject to Sections 4.4 
through 4.10 hereof, in consideration of the transfer of the 
Applicable SMR Assets-Nextel Territory and the assumption of 
the Applicable SMR Liabilities-Nextel Territory, New Sub has 
contingently issued to Motorola and the Motorola SMR Subsidiar-
ies 1,000 shares of New Sub Common Stock. Subject to Section 
2.2(a) hereof, such New Sub Shares immediately prior to the 
Closing, will be recapitalized by means of a stock split into 
an aggregate of up to 62,000,000 New Sub Shares, as set forth 
in Section 2.2(a) hereof. 

(a) If, as of the Closing Date, after taking into 
account the Motorola Owned SMR Licenses-Nextel Territory and 
Acquired SMR Licenses-Nextel Territory actually contributed 
prior to or at Closing to New Sub, and applying the procedures 
set forth in clauses (iv) and (v) of Section 4.5(b), there 
remains one or more Markets-Nextel Territory in which there is 
an Actual Market Shortfall Amount-Nextel Territory, then a 
number of the New Sub Shares so delivered to Motorola and the 
Motorola SMR Subsidiaries shall be designated as Holdback 
Shares-Nextel Territory in accordance with Section 4.5(b)(vi) 
and Motorola and the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries shall be deemed 
to hold such Holdback Shares-Nextel Territory subject to (i) 
the restrictions set forth in Section 4.10(a) and (ii) possible 
cancellation in accordance with Section 4.6 hereof. 

(b) If, as of the Closing Date, after taking into 
account the Motorola Owned SMR Licenses-OneComm Territory and 
Acquired SMR Licenses-OneComm Territory actually contributed at 
Closing, the aggregate value of the SMR Channels so contributed 
(calculated in accordance with Section 4.7(b)(vii)) is less 
than or equal to the Required Channel Value-OneComm Territory, 
then a number of New Sub Shares so delivered to Motorola and 
the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries shall be designated as Holdback 
Shares-OneComm Territory in accordance with Section 4.7(b)(v) 
and Motorola and the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries shall be deemed 
to hold such Holdback Shares-OneComm Territory subject to the 
restrictions set forth in Section 4.10(a) and (ii) possible 
cancellation in accordance with Section 4.7(c) hereof.

(c) If, as of the Closing Date, after taking into 
account the Motorola Owned SMR Licenses-Dial Page Territory and 
Acquired SMR Licenses-Dial Page Territory actually contributed 

-44-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

at Closing, the aggregate value of the SMR Channels so contrib-
uted (calculated in accordance with Section 4.8(b)(vii)) is 
less than or equal to the Required Channel Value-Dial Page 
Territory, then a number of New Sub Shares so delivered to 
Motorola and the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries shall be designated 
as Holdback Shares-Dial Page Territory in accordance with 
Section 4.8(b)(v) and Motorola and the Motorola SMR Subsidi-
aries shall be deemed to hold such Holdback Shares-Dial Page 
Territory subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 
4.10(a) and (ii) possible cancellation in accordance with 
Section 4.8(c) hereof.

(d) If, as of the Closing Date, the Clearnet Trans-
action has not been consummated, then the Clearnet Attributable 
Shares so delivered to Motorola and the Motorola SMR Subsidiar-
ies shall be held subject to (i) the restrictions set forth in 
Section 4.10(a) and (ii) possible cancellation in accordance 
with Section 4.10(b) hereof.

4.4. Change in Capitalization. In the event of any 
change in the number and/or price of the outstanding Company 
Shares from and after the date hereof through the Closing Date, 
by reason of a recapitalization, spin-off, stock dividend, 
stock split or other similar transaction (other than any such 
transaction as is specifically provided for in this Agreement 
in connection with or in preparation for the Nextel Merger), 
the number of New Sub Shares issued to Motorola and the 
Motorola SMR Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective 
Time shall be appropriately adjusted; provided, however, that 
no adjustment is intended to be made pursuant to this Section 
4.4 by reason of the issuance of the number of Company Shares 
contemplated to be issued in the Currently Announced Transac-
tions as of the date hereof, as set forth in Tab 1 of the 
Company Disclosure Statement, and provided, further, that not-
withstanding this Section 4.4 or any other provision of this 
Agreement, Motorola and the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries shall 
not, by virtue of any transaction involving the Company which 
occurs prior to Closing, be required to accept consideration 
other than New Sub Shares.

4.5. Delivery Requirement and Procedures-Nextel Ter-
ritory. (a) (i) The total number of SMR Channels in the Ap-
plicable Nextel Geographic Areas targeted to be delivered by 
Motorola and the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries pursuant to the pro-
cedures in Sections 4.1(a), 4.5 through 4.6, and 4.9 through 
4.10 hereof, as Motorola Owned SMR Licenses-Nextel Territory or 
Acquired SMR Licenses-Nextel Territory is 2,842 Channels, com-
prised of a specified number of SMR Channels in each Market-
Nextel Territory within each Group-Nextel Territory, as set 
forth in Tab 10 of the Motorola/Nextel Disclosure Statement 

-45-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

(for each such Market, the "Applicable Nextel Market Channel 
Target").

(ii) As set forth in Tab 10 of the Motorola/Nextel 
Disclosure Statement, the SMR Channels within a given Group-
Nextel Territory have been assigned an assumed value, stated in 
terms of a fixed number of New Sub Shares (the same amount per 
SMR Channel within a Group-Nextel Territory). Such values per 
SMR Channel for any given Group are referred to herein as the 
"Group Per Channel Assigned Value-Nextel Territory." 

(iii) Set forth in Tab 10 of the Motorola/Nextel Dis-
closure Statement under the heading "Maximum Market Substitu-
tion" for each identified Market-Nextel Territory is the maxi-
mum number of SMR Channels from another Market-Nextel Territory 
or Group-Nextel Territory that, subject to the limitations set 
forth in Section 4.5(b)(iv), may be substituted for Motorola 
Owned SMR Licenses-Nextel Territory or Acquired SMR Licenses-
Nextel Territory in such identified Market-Nextel Territory in 
lieu of an SMR Channel actually located in such identified 
Market-Nextel Territory (the "Applicable Nextel Market Substi-
tution Cap").

(iv) Set forth in Tab 10 of the Motorola/Nextel Dis-
closure Statement under the heading "Maximum Group Substitu-
tion" for each identified Group-Nextel Territory is the maximum 
number of SMR Channels from other Groups-Nextel Territory that 
(subject to the limitations set forth in Section 4.5(b)(iii) 
and notwithstanding the fact that such number may be less than 
the sum of the Applicable Nextel Market Substitution Caps for 
all of the Markets within such Group) may be counted as 
Motorola Owned SMR Licenses-Nextel Territory or Acquired SMR 
Licenses-Nextel Territory in such Group-Nextel Territory in 
lieu of an SMR Channel actually located in such Group-Nextel 
Territory (the "Applicable Nextel Group Substitution Cap"). 

(b) (i) Pursuant to Sections 4.1(a)(i) and (ii), 
Motorola and the respective Motorola SMR Subsidiaries have (A) 
contributed to New Sub the Motorola Owned SMR Licenses-Nextel 
Territory held by them as of March 31, 1994 and (B) assigned to 
New Sub all rights to acquire SMR Licenses under all agreements 
relating to Acquired SMR Licenses-Nextel Territory which were 
entered into by Motorola or a Motorola SMR Subsidiary as of 
such date and will, prior to Closing, contribute to New Sub (or 
will pay directly) the cash necessary for New Sub to exercise 
all such rights to acquire all such Acquired SMR Licenses-
Nextel Territory to satisfy all of the other obligations of New 
Sub under all of such agreements assigned to it and to satisfy 
all reasonable expenses expected to be incurred by New Sub in 
connection therewith.

(ii) In lieu of (A) delivering any given Owned 
Channel-Nextel Territory which is revoked by the FCC, or is 
lost or forfeited by Motorola or a Motorola SMR Subsidiary or 
by New Sub, prior to the first anniversary of the Closing or as 
to which no Final FCC Order has been obtained for the transfer 
thereof to New Sub (including any Final FCC Order required to 
be obtained in connection with the First Merger and the Final 
Merger) prior to the first anniversary of the Closing or (B) 
acquiring any particular SMR Channel comprising all or part of 
a Motorola McSMR-Nextel Territory, Motorola may arrange for New 
Sub to enter into a contract for the right to acquire the 
rights to an SMR License (a "Substitute SMR License-Nextel Ter-
ritory") relating to one or more SMR Channels (a "Substitute 
SMR Channel-Nextel Territory") which are "equivalent" to the 
SMR Channels not delivered as a Motorola Owned SMR License-
Nextel Territory, or not acquired from the licensee of a 
Motorola McSMR-Nextel Territory; provided, that to the extent 
such contract or any related agreement contains terms which 
would represent obligations of New Sub other than those relat-
ing to payments of cash amounts by New Sub that will be funded 
by cash contributed to New Sub by Motorola or a Motorola SMR 
Subsidiary as contemplated by Section 4.5(b)(i), such contract 
or related agreement shall contain terms that are no less 
favorable to New Sub than those contracts heretofore assigned 
by Motorola to New Sub pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(ii) hereof, 
the form of which is set forth in Exhibit I hereto (the "Model 
Form"). For this purpose, a Substitute Channel-Nextel Terri-
tory shall be considered "equivalent" to the Owned Channel-
Nextel Territory or Motorola McSMR-Nextel Territory it replaces 
so long as such SMR Channel is (1) in a comparable location to 
(and in the same Market as) the Owned Channel-Nextel Territory 
or Motorola McSMR-Nextel Territory it replaces or (2) is at any 
location within 25 miles of the FCC defined center of the 
indicated Core Market-Nextel Territory for the Owned Channel-
Nextel Territory or Motorola McSMR-Nextel Territory it replaces 
(assuming such Owned Channel or Motorola McSMR is included in 
such Core Market); provided, that in each case, such Substitute 
Channel-Nextel Territory delivered is a trunked 800 MHz SMR 
Channel and is not an Advanced Digital Coverage License. 

(iii) From and after the date of this Agreement and 
prior to the Closing, Motorola shall use reasonable efforts to 
cause New Sub to enter into contracts providing the right to 
acquire outright ownership of such of the SMR Licenses which 
comprise the Motorola McSMRs-Nextel Territory as shall be nec-
essary to permit delivery of SMR Channels which meet the Appli-
cable Nextel Market Channel Targets for each Market-Nextel Ter-
ritory, it being understood that "reasonable efforts" for pur-
poses of this clause (iii) shall not obligate Motorola to cause 

-47-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

New Sub to enter into any arrangement to purchase an SMR Li-
cense comprising a Motorola McSMR-Nextel Territory at a price, 
or on other terms and conditions, which Motorola believes are 
not reasonable and that Motorola shall, in lieu of any such 
Motorola McSMR, be entitled to (A) cause New Sub to contract 
for the right to acquire a Substitute SMR License-Nextel Terri-
tory, (B) use excess SMR Channels from another Group-Nextel 
Territory or Market-Nextel Territory (as permitted in accor-
dance with Section 4.5(b)(ii)) (subject to the Applicable 
Nextel Group Substitution Caps and the Applicable Nextel Market 
Substitution Caps and subsection (iv) hereof), to compensate 
for shortfalls in one or more Markets and/or (C) incur the pen-
alty contemplated by Section 4.6 hereof, in the event that one 
or more Applicable Nextel Market Channel Targets have not been 
met; and provided that to the extent any such contract contem-
plated by this clause (iii) or any related agreement contains 
terms which would represent obligations of New Sub other than 
those relating to payments of cash amounts by New Sub that will 
be funded by cash contributed to New Sub by Motorola or a 
Motorola SMR Subsidiary as contemplated by Section 4.5(b)(i), 
such contract or related agreement shall contain terms that are 
no less favorable to New Sub than the Model Form. 

(iv) Subject to the procedures and limitations set 
forth in this Section 4.5(b)(iv), Motorola may use SMR Channels 
in a given Market-Nextel Territory which exceed the Applicable 
Nextel Market Channel Target for that Market-Nextel Territory 
("Excess Channels-Nextel Territory") to compensate for a short-
fall in any other Market-Nextel Territory if such other Market-
Nextel Territory is either (A) in the Group-Nextel Territory in 
which the excess SMR Channels occur or (B) in any Group-Nextel 
Territory which, in Tab 10 of the Motorola/Nextel Disclosure 
Statement, appears below the Group-Nextel Territory in which 
the Market-Nextel Territory with the Excess Channels-Nextel 
Territory is included. For purposes of such use of Excess 
Channel-Nextel Territory, (1) each Excess Channel-Nextel Terri-
tory shall carry its Group Per Channel Assigned Value-Nextel 
Territory, and (2) the SMR Channel replaced by such Excess 
Channels-Nextel Territory shall carry its Group Per Channel 
Assigned Value-Nextel Territory, such that an Excess Channel 
from a Group-Nextel Territory with a higher Group Per Channel 
Assigned Value-Nextel Territory can compensate for one or more 
SMR Channels (or one plus a portion of another SMR Channel so 
long as the remaining portion is compensated for by other Ex-
cess Channels) in a Group-Nextel Territory with a lower Group 
Per Channel Assigned Value-Nextel Territory, as set forth in 
the example in Tab 10 of the Motorola/Nextel Disclosure State-
ment. In no event may any Excess Channel-Nextel Territory be 
used to compensate for a shortfall in a given identified 

-48-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Market-Nextel Territory if (x) the number of Excess Channels-
Nextel Territory so used would exceed the Applicable Nextel 
Market Substitution Cap for such identified Market-Nextel 
Territory or (y) the number of Excess Channels-Nextel Territory 
so used for all Markets within the applicable Group-Nextel 
Territory in which such identified Market-Nextel Territory is 
included would exceed the Applicable Nextel Group Substitution 
Cap. 

(v) As of the Closing Date, and at the last day of 
each month thereafter up to and including the first anniversary 
of the Closing Date, Motorola shall prepare a statement (the 
"Channel Delivery Status Statement-Nextel Territory") showing 
(A) the total number of Owned Channels-Nextel Territory and the 
total number of SMR Channels underlying Acquired SMR Licenses-
Nextel Territory actually contributed within each Market-Nextel 
Territory and each Group-Nextel Territory, (B) the Markets-
Nextel Territory in which the Applicable Nextel Market Channel 
Target has not been met (based on the total number of SMR Chan-
nels actually contributed within such Market-Nextel Territory 
and disregarding any application of Excess Channels-Nextel 
Territory with respect to such Market-Nextel Territory), and, 
for each such Market-Nextel Territory, the value (stated in 
terms of a number of New Sub Shares) of such shortfall (calcu-
lated by multiplying the shortfall in SMR Channels for such 
Market-Nextel Territory by the applicable Group Per Channel 
Assigned Value-Nextel Territory (the "Initial Market Shortfall 
Amount-Nextel Territory"), (C) the total number of Excess 
Channels-Nextel Territory by Market-Nextel Territory and by 
Group-Nextel Territory, (D) the application of such Excess 
Channels-Nextel Territory, in the manner and to the extent 
permitted by clause (iv), to compensate for Initial Market 
Shortfall Amounts-Nextel Territory and (E) the remaining short-
fall, if any, in each Market-Nextel Territory where Excess 
Channels-Nextel Territory did not eliminate the Initial Market 
Shortfall Amount-Nextel Territory (for each such Market, as of 
such date, the "Actual Market Shortfall Amount-Nextel Terri-
tory").

(vi) In the event that as of the Closing Date, after 
taking into account the Motorola Owned SMR Licenses-Nextel Ter-
ritory and Acquired SMR Licenses-Nextel Territory which were 
actually contributed as of Closing, and applying the procedures 
set forth in clauses (iv) and (v), there remains one or more 
Markets-Nextel Territory in which there is an Actual Market 
Shortfall Amount-Nextel Territory, then a number of the New Sub 
Shares (the "Holdback Shares-Nextel Territory") equal to the 
sum of such Actual Market Shortfall Amounts-Nextel Territory 
for each such Market-Nextel Territory (the "Aggregate Closing 

-49-

Shortfall Amount-Nextel Territory"), shall be deemed held con-
tingently by Motorola and/or the applicable Motorola SMR Sub-
sidiaries, and, subject to the restrictions set forth in Sec-
tion 4.10(a) hereof, until the release of such restrictions, or 
the cancellation of such New Sub Shares, in each case in accor-
dance with Sections 4.5(b)(ix) and 4.6 hereof. 

(vii) For a period of twelve (12) months following the 
Closing, Motorola shall continue to use reasonable efforts to 
assist New Sub in entering into contracts providing the right 
to acquire such additional Motorola McSMRs-Nextel Territory or 
Substitute Channels-Nextel Territory (together, in the case of 
Substitute Channels, with site leases and related equipment), 
as shall be necessary to permit delivery of SMR Channels which 
meet the Applicable Nextel Market Channel Targets for each 
Market-Nextel Territory, it being understood that "reasonable 
efforts" for this purpose shall be subject to the same limita-
tions as set forth in clause 4.5(b)(iii) hereof. New Sub shall 
be obligated to enter into any such arrangements made by 
Motorola and take all other steps reasonably necessary to per-
mit it to effect the purchase thereunder provided that (A) 
Motorola shall, at or prior to the time that New Sub would ex-
ercise such rights to acquire, contribute or pay directly the 
cash necessary for the exercise of such rights, to satisfy all 
of the other obligations of New Sub under such contract and to 
satisfy all reasonable expenses expected to be incurred by New 
Sub in connection therewith and (B) the form of contract pro-
posed between the licensee and New Sub provides that New Sub is 
obligated to make cash payments thereunder only to the extent 
funded by contributions of cash to New Sub by Motorola as con-
templated above and otherwise contains terms that are no less 
favorable to New Sub than the Model Form.

(viii) For purposes of Sections 4.3 and 4.5 through 4.8 
hereof, Motorola (or the applicable Motorola SMR Subsidiary) 
shall be deemed to have "actually contributed" an Acquired SMR 
License as of a given date (A) if the transfer to New Sub has 
occurred pursuant to an FCC Order which has become a Final FCC 
Order and all amounts required to be paid to finally effect 
such transfer have been paid or (B) even if the transfer to New 
Sub has not been consummated if, as of such date, either (1) 
Motorola or such Motorola SMR Subsidiary shall have (x) 
executed an assignment of the agreement to acquire the 
underlying Motorola McSMR or Substitute SMR License to New Sub, 
which assignment shall have been approved pursuant to an FCC 
Order which has become a Final FCC Order, and (y) contributed 
to New Sub or paid directly the cash necessary to acquire such 
rights pursuant to such agreement, to satisfy all of the other 
obligations of New Sub under such contract and to satisfy all 
reasonable expenses expected to be incurred by New Sub in 

-50-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

connection therewith, or (2)(x) Motorola shall have arranged 
for New Sub to enter into such an agreement to acquire the 
underlying Motorola McSMR or Substitute SMR License and such 
transfer shall have been approved pursuant to an FCC Order 
which has become a Final FCC Order and (y) Motorola shall have 
contributed to New Sub or paid directly the cash necessary for 
New Sub to exercise such rights, to satisfy all of the other 
obligations of New Sub under such contract and to satisfy all 
reasonable expenses expected to be incurred by New Sub in 
connection therewith.

(ix) On the last day of each month following the 
Closing Date, through and including the first anniversary of 
the Closing Date, as provided in clause (v) of this Section 
4.5(b), Motorola shall deliver a Channel Delivery Status State-
ment-Nextel Territory. If the sum of the Actual Market Short-
fall Amounts-Nextel Territory as of such date is less than the 
Aggregate Closing Shortfall Amount-Nextel Territory then a num-
ber of the Holdback Shares-Nextel Territory shall be released 
and retained and held by Motorola and/or the Motorola SMR 
subsidiaries free of the restrictions set forth in Section 
4.10(a), such number being equal to (i) the difference between 
the Aggregate Closing Shortfall Amount-Nextel Territory and the 
sum of the Actual Market Shortfall Amounts-Nextel Territory as 
of such date (the "Interim Delivery Amount-Nextel Territory") 
(ii) minus the Interim Delivery Amount-Nextel Territory, if 
any, for each month-end following the Closing. The remainder 
of such Holdback Shares-Nextel Territory shall continue to be 
held contingently by Motorola and the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries 
and subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 4.10(a) 
hereof, until the release of such restrictions, or the cancel-
lation of such New Sub Shares, in each case in accordance with 
this Section 4.5(b)(ix) and Section 4.6 hereof.

4.6. Final Channel Delivery-Nextel Territory. (a) 
On the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Motorola shall 
submit to New Sub a final Channel Delivery Status Statement-
Nextel Territory. 

(b) If the sum of the Actual Market Shortfall 
Amounts-Nextel Territory as of such date (the "Aggregate Final 
Shortfall Amount-Nextel Territory") is less than the Aggregate 
Closing Shortfall Amount-Nextel Territory, then (i) Motorola 
and the applicable Motorola SMR Subsidiaries shall retain, and 
hold free of the restrictions set forth in Section 4.10(a), a 
portion of the Holdback Shares-Nextel Territory equal to (A) 
the difference between the Aggregate Closing Shortfall Amount-
Nextel Territory and the Aggregate Final Shortfall Amount-
Nextel Territory, (B) minus the sum of the Interim Delivery 
Amounts-Nextel Territory, if any, for each month-end following 

-51-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

the Closing prior to the first anniversary of the Closing and 
(ii) the remaining Holdback Shares-Nextel Territory, if any, 
shall be returned by Motorola and the applicable Motorola SMR 
Subsidiaries to New Sub for cancellation upon the reassignment 
to Motorola of all of New Sub's rights, if any, to any SMR 
Channels not deemed "actually contributed" as of such date, it 
being understood that the parties hereto may waive the opera-
tion of this clause (ii) in which case Motorola shall hold the 
Holdback Shares-Nextel Territory free of all restrictions and 
New Sub shall retain such SMR Channels, whether or not they 
ultimately satisfy the criteria set forth in Section 
4.5(b)(viii) hereof to be treated as "actually contributed".

(c) Except for Excess Channels-Nextel Territory used 
to compensate for a shortfall in one or more Markets-Nextel 
Territory in accordance with Section 4.5(b)(iv) hereof, it is 
the intention of the parties that any acquisition of SMR Chan-
nels in the Applicable Nextel Geographic Areas in excess of the 
Applicable Nextel Market Channel Targets be made directly by 
New Sub, so long as such acquisitions as are identified in a 
letter dated April 8, 1994 from the Company to Motorola (the 
"April 8, 1994 Letter") may be made by New Sub at prices less 
than or equal to the maximum prices per SMR Channel provided in 
the April 8, 1994 Letter (the "Maximum Prices") (or Motorola 
funds any amounts in excess of such Maximum Prices) and other-
wise on terms and conditions that are no less favorable to New 
Sub than those contained in the Model Form. Commencing on the 
date hereof until the Closing Date, if Motorola causes, or 
arranges for, New Sub to contract for the right to acquire any 
SMR Channel identified in the April 8, 1994 Letter which is (i) 
in excess of the Applicable Nextel Market Channel Target and 
(ii) will not be used as an Excess Channel-Nextel Territory in 
accordance with Section 4.5(b)(iv) hereof, at a per Channel 
price less than or equal to the applicable Maximum Price (or 
Motorola funds any amounts in excess of such Maximum Prices), 
New Sub shall enter into such agreement, and on or after the 
Closing Date shall exercise such right (or shall be solely 
responsible for any failure to exercise such right), it being 
understood that Motorola shall have no obligation to provide 
the cash necessary for the exercise of such rights by New Sub 
other than any amounts in excess of such Maximum Prices. 

4.7. Delivery Requirement and Procedures-OneComm 
Territory.

(a) (i) The total number of SMR Channels targeted 
to be delivered by Motorola and the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries 
pursuant to the procedures in Sections 4.1(b), 4.7, 4.9 and 
4.10 hereof as Motorola Owned SMR Licenses-OneComm Territory or 
Acquired SMR Licenses-OneComm Territory is 1,621 SMR Channels, 

-52-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

comprised of a total of 128 SMR Channels in Group 1 (the "Group 
1 Channel Target-OneComm Territory"), 368 SMR Channels in Group 
2 (the "Group 2 Channel Target-OneComm Territory"), 146 SMR 
Channels in Group 3 (the "Group 3 Channel Target-OneComm Terri-
tory") and 979 Channels in Group 4 (the "Group 4 Channel 
Target-OneComm Territory"), as set forth in Exhibit K hereto. 
Each Group shown in Exhibit K is herein referred to as a 
"Group-OneComm Territory". 

(ii) As set forth in Exhibit K, each SMR Channel 
within a given Group-OneComm Territory has been assigned an 
assumed value, stated in dollars (the same amount per SMR Chan-
nel within a Group). Such per channel values for any given 
Group in Exhibit K are referred to herein as the "Group Per 
Channel Assigned Value-OneComm Territory". The total assigned 
value of the SMR Channels required to be delivered by Motorola 
and the Motorola Subsidiaries pursuant to this Section 4.7 
(stated in dollars) is set forth in Exhibit K (the "Required 
Channel Value-OneComm Territory"), which represents the sum of 
the products (for each Group-OneComm Territory) of (i) the ap-
plicable Group Channel Target-OneComm Territory and (ii) the 
applicable Group Per Channel Assigned Value-OneComm Territory. 
SMR Channels delivered may be Motorola Owned SMR Licenses-
OneComm Territory or Acquired SMR Licenses-OneComm Territory 
and shall be delivered in accordance with the procedures set 
forth herein.

(b) (i) In lieu of (A) delivering any given Owned 
Channel-OneComm Territory which Motorola or a Motorola SMR Sub-
sidiary is unable to deliver at Closing or (B) acquiring any 
particular SMR Channel comprising all or part of a Motorola 
McSMR-OneComm Territory, Motorola may enter into a contract 
providing the right to acquire (or cause one of the Motorola 
SMR Subsidiaries to enter into such a contract) the rights to 
an SMR License (a "Substitute SMR License-OneComm Territory") 
relating to one or more SMR Channels (a "Substitute SMR 
Channel-OneComm Territory") which are "equivalent" to the SMR 
Channels not delivered as an Owned License-OneComm Territory or 
not acquired from the licensee of a Motorola McSMR-OneComm Ter-
ritory. For this purpose, an acquired SMR Channel shall be 
considered "equivalent" to the Owned Channel-OneComm Territory 
or SMR Channel comprising a Motorola McSMR-OneComm Territory it 
replaces so long as it would fall within one of the Groups-
OneComm Territory in Exhibit K if it were an Owned License-
OneComm Territory.

(ii) From and after the date of this Agreement and 
prior to the Closing, Motorola shall use its best efforts to 
enter into contracts providing the right to acquire (or to 
cause a Motorola SMR Subsidiary to enter into such contracts) 

-53-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

outright ownership of the SMR Licenses which comprise the 
Motorola McSMRs-OneComm Territory, it being understood that 
"best efforts" for purposes of this clause (ii) shall not obli-
gate Motorola or the applicable Motorola SMR Subsidiary to en-
ter into any arrangement to purchase an SMR License comprising 
a Motorola McSMR-OneComm Territory at a price, or on other 
terms and conditions, that Motorola believes are not reasonable 
and that Motorola shall, in lieu of any such Motorola McSMR-
OneComm Territory, be entitled to contract for the right to 
acquire a Substitute License-OneComm Territory or, if Motorola 
is unable to enter into such contract, incur the adjustment 
contemplated by paragraph (c) of this Section 4.7 hereof, in 
the event that Motorola fails to deliver the Required Channel 
Value-OneComm Territory.

(iii) As contemplated by Sections 4.1(b)(i) and (ii), 
at the Closing, Motorola and the respective Motorola SMR Sub-
sidiaries shall (A) contribute to New Sub the Owned Licenses-
OneComm Territory held by them as of such date and (B) shall 
assign to New Sub all rights to acquire SMR Licenses under all 
agreements relating to Acquired SMR Licenses-OneComm Territory 
which have been entered into by Motorola or a Motorola SMR Sub-
sidiary as of such date, together with the cash necessary for 
New Sub to exercise the right to acquire such Acquired SMR 
Licenses-OneComm Territory.

(iv) As of the Closing Date, and at the last day of 
each month thereafter up to and including the first anniversary 
of the Closing Date, Motorola shall prepare a statement (the 
"Channel Delivery Status Statement-OneComm Territory") showing 
(A) the total number of Motorola Owned SMR Channels-OneComm 
Territory and the total number of SMR Channels underlying Ac-
quired SMR Licenses-OneComm Territory actually contributed 
within each Group-OneComm Territory and (B) the aggregate value 
of the SMR Channels so contributed (calculated in accordance 
with clause (vii) of this Section 4.7(b)).

(v) In the event that as of the Closing Date, the 
aggregate value of the Motorola Owned SMR Licenses-OneComm Ter-
ritory and Acquired SMR Licenses-OneComm Territory which were 
actually contributed (as of any given date, the "Contributed 
Channels-OneComm Territory") as of Closing, is less than the 
Required Channel Value-OneComm Territory, then a number of the 
New Sub Shares (the "Holdback Shares-OneComm Territory") equal 
to (A) the difference between the Required Channel Value-
OneComm Territory and the aggregate value of the Contributed 
Channels-OneComm Territory as of such date (the "Closing Date 
Shortfall Amount-OneComm Territory") (B) divided by $40, shall 
be deemed held contingently by Motorola and/or the applicable 
Motorola SMR Subsidiaries and subject to the restrictions set 

-54-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

forth in Section 4.10(a) hereof, until the release of such 
restrictions, or the cancellation of such New Sub Shares, in 
each case in accordance with Section 4.7(c) hereof. 

(vi) For a period of twelve (12) months following the 
Closing, Motorola shall continue to use best efforts to enter 
into contracts providing the right to acquire and contribute to 
New Sub, additional Motorola McSMRs-OneComm Territory or Sub-
stitute Channels-OneComm Territory (together, in the case of 
such Substitute Channels, with site leases and related equip-
ment as are available), up to the Required Channel Value-
OneComm Territory, it being understood that "best efforts" for 
this purpose shall be subject to the same limitations as set 
forth in Section 4.7(b)(ii) hereof. New Sub shall be obligated 
to assume the right to acquire such SMR Licenses under such 
contracts and to take all other steps reasonably necessary (in-
cluding the assumption of site leases and equipment leases in 
connection therewith) to permit it to effect the purchase 
thereunder; provided, however, that Motorola shall, at or prior 
to the time that New Sub would exercise such rights to acquire, 
contribute any and all consideration necessary for the exercise 
of all rights under such contracts; provided, further, that 
such contracts shall be on terms no less favorable to Motorola 
or New Sub than the Model Form. 

(vii) For purposes of this Section 4.7, the "aggregate 
value" of the Contributed Channels-OneComm Territory as of a 
given date shall be calculated as the sum of the products (for 
each Group-OneComm Territory) of the number of SMR Channels 
actually contributed as of such date in each Group-OneComm 
Territory by the applicable Group Per Channel Assigned Value-
OneComm Territory (it being understood that for this purpose 
each Substitute SMR Channel-OneComm Territory shall be deemed 
to have the Group Per Channel Assigned Value-OneComm Territory 
of the Group-OneComm Territory in which it would fall if it 
were a Motorola Owned SMR License-OneComm Territory).

(viii) On the last day of each month following the 
Closing Date, through and including the first anniversary of 
the Closing Date, as provided in clause (iv) of this Section 
4.7(b), Motorola shall deliver a Channel Delivery Status State-
ment-OneComm Territory. If the difference between the Required 
Channel Value-OneComm Territory and the aggregate value of the 
Contributed Channels-OneComm Territory as of such date (such 
difference being the "Interim Shortfall Amount-OneComm Terri-
tory") is less than the Closing Date Shortfall Amount-OneComm 
Territory then a number of the Holdback Shares-OneComm Terri-
tory shall be released and retained and held by Motorola and/or 
the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries free of the restrictions set 
forth in Section 4.10(a), such number being equal to (A) the 

-55-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

difference between the Closing Date Shortfall Amount-OneComm 
Territory and the Interim Shortfall Amount-OneComm Territory as 
of such date (the "Interim Delivery Amount-OneComm Territory"), 
(B) minus the Interim Delivery Amount-OneComm Territory, if 
any, for each month-end following the Closing (C) divided by 
$40. The remainder of such Holdback Shares-OneComm Territory 
shall continue to be held contingently by Motorola and the 
Motorola SMR Subsidiaries and subject to the restrictions set 
forth in Section 4.10(a) hereof, until the release of such 
restrictions, or the cancellation of such New Sub Shares, in 
each case in accordance with this Section 4.7.

(c) (i) On the first anniversary of the Closing 
Date, Motorola shall submit to New Sub a final Channel Delivery 
Status Statement-OneComm Territory. 

(ii) If the aggregate value of the Contributed Chan-
nels-OneComm Territory as of such date (calculated in accor-
dance with subparagraph (b)(vii) of this Section 4.7) is less 
than or equal to the Required Channel Value-OneComm Territory, 
then Motorola and the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries shall (A) sur-
render to New Sub a number of New Sub Shares equal to (1) the 
difference between the Required Channel Value-OneComm Territory 
and the aggregate value of the Contributed Channels-OneComm 
Territory as of the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the 
"Final Channel Contribution-OneComm Territory") and (2) divided 
by $40 and (B) shall retain any remaining Holdback Shares-
OneComm Territory free of the restrictions in Section 4.10(a); 
provided that the surrender of New Sub Shares under clause (A) 
hereof shall be contingent upon the reassignment to Motorola of 
all of New Sub's rights, if any, to any SMR Channels not deemed 
"actually contributed" as of such date, it being understood 
that the parties hereto may waive the operation of clause (A) 
in which case Motorola shall hold the Holdback Shares-OneComm 
Territory free of all restrictions and New Sub shall retain 
such SMR Channels, whether or not they ultimately satisfy the 
criteria set forth in Section 4.5(b)(viii) hereof to be treated 
as "actually contributed".

4.8. Delivery Requirement and Procedures-Dial Page 
Territory.

(a) (i) The total number of SMR Channels targeted 
to be delivered by Motorola and the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries 
pursuant to the procedures in Sections 4.1(c), 4.7, 4.9 and 
4.10 hereof as Motorola Owned SMR Licenses-Dial Page Territory 
or Acquired SMR Licenses-Dial Page Territory is 2,091 SMR 
Channels, comprised of a total of 417 SMR Channels in Group 1 
(the "Group 1 Channel Target-Dial Page Territory"), 175 SMR 
Channels in Group 2 (the "Group 2 Channel Target-Dial Page 

-56-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Territory"), 109 SMR Channels in Group 3 (the "Group 3 Channel 
Target-Dial Page Territory"); 138 Channels in Group 4 (the 
"Group 4 Channel Target-Dial Page Territory") and 1252 SMR 
Channels in Group 5 (the "Group 5 Channel Target-Dial Page 
Territory"), as set forth in Tab 8 of the Motorola/Dial Page 
Disclosure Statement hereto. Each Group shown in Tab 8 of the 
Motorola/Dial Page Disclosure Statement is herein referred to 
as a "Group-Dial Page Territory". 

(ii) As set forth in Tab 8 of the Motorola/Dial Page 
Disclosure Statement, each SMR Channel within a given Group-
Dial Page Territory has been assigned an assumed value, stated 
in dollars (the same amount per SMR Channel within a Group). 
Such per channel values for any given Group in Tab 8 of the 
Motorola/Dial Page Disclosure Statement are referred to herein 
as the "Group Per Channel Assigned Value-Dial Page Territory". 
The total assigned value of the SMR Channels required to be 
delivered by Motorola and the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries pur-
suant to this Section 4.8 (stated in dollars) is set forth in 
Tab 8 of the Motorola/Dial Page Disclosure Statement (the 
"Required Channel Value-Dial Page Territory"), which represents 
the sum of the products (for each Group-Dial Page Territory) of 
(i) the applicable Group Channel Target-Dial Page Territory and 
(ii) the applicable Group Per Channel Assigned Value-Dial Page 
Territory. SMR Channels delivered may be Motorola Owned SMR 
Licenses-Dial Page Territory or Acquired SMR Licenses-Dial Page 
Territory and shall be delivered in accordance with the proce-
dures set forth herein. For purposes of this Section 4.8, 
Motorola shall be deemed to have delivered the SMR Channels 
listed on Exhibit N hereto, which have been acquired by Dial 
Page on Motorola's behalf by contributing $3,095,000 in cash to 
New Sub at the Closing.

(b) (i) In lieu of (A) delivering any given Owned 
Channel-Dial Page Territory which Motorola or a Motorola SMR 
Subsidiary is unable to deliver at Closing or (B) acquiring any 
particular SMR Channel comprising all or part of a Motorola 
McSMR-Dial Page Territory, Motorola may enter into a contract 
providing the right to acquire (or cause one of the Motorola 
SMR Subsidiaries to enter into such a contract) the rights to 
an SMR License (a "Substitute SMR License-Dial Page Territory") 
relating to one or more SMR Channels (a "Substitute SMR 
Channel-Dial Page Territory") which are "equivalent" to the SMR 
Channels not delivered as an Owned License-Dial Page Territory 
or not acquired from the licensee of a Motorola McSMR-Dial Page 
Territory. For this purpose, an acquired SMR Channel shall be 
considered "equivalent" to the Owned Channel-Dial Page Terri-
tory or SMR Channel comprising a Motorola McSMR-Dial Page Ter-
ritory it replaces so long as:

-57-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

(A) in the case of Substitute SMR Channels-Dial 
Page Territory replacing Owned Channels-Dial Page Territory or 
Motorola McSMRs-Dial Page Territory which are in Groups 1 
through 4-Dial Page Territory, such Substitute Channel would 
fall within one of such Groups 1 through 4 if it were an Owned 
Channel-Dial Page Territory; and

(B) in the case of Substitute SMR Channels-Dial 
Page Territory replacing Owned Channels-Dial Page Territory or 
Motorola McSMRs-Dial Page Territory which are in Group 5-Dial 
Page Territory, such Substitute Channel would fall within any 
of Groups 1 through 5-Dial Page Territory if it were an Owned 
Channel-Dial Page Territory.

Each Substitute Channel-Dial Page Territory shall be deemed to 
have the Group Per Channel Assigned Value-Dial Page Territory 
of the Group-Dial Page Territory in which such Substitute 
Channel-Dial Page Territory would actually fall if it were an 
Owned Channel-Dial Page Territory.

(ii) From and after the date of this Agreement and 
prior to the Closing, Motorola shall use its best efforts to 
enter into contracts providing the right to acquire (or to 
cause a Motorola SMR Subsidiary to enter into such contracts) 
outright ownership of the SMR Licenses which comprise the 
Motorola McSMRs-Dial Page Territory up to the Required Channel 
Value-Dial Page Territory, it being understood that "best 
efforts" for purposes of this clause (ii) shall not obligate 
Motorola or the applicable Motorola SMR Subsidiary to enter 
into any arrangement to purchase an SMR License comprising a 
Motorola McSMR-Dial Page Territory at a price, or on other 
terms and conditions, that Motorola believes are not reasonable 
and that Motorola shall, in lieu of any such Motorola McSMR-
Dial Page Territory, be entitled to contract for the right to 
acquire a Substitute License-Dial Page Territory or, if 
Motorola is unable to enter into such contract, incur the 
adjustment contemplated by paragraph (c) of this Section 4.8 
hereof, in the event that Motorola fails to deliver the Re-
quired Channel Value-Dial Page Territory.

(iii) As contemplated by Sections 4.1(c)(i) and (ii), 
at the Closing, Motorola and the respective Motorola SMR Sub-
sidiaries shall (A) contribute to New Sub the Owned Licenses-
Dial Page Territory held by them as of such date and (B) shall 
assign to New Sub all rights to acquire SMR Licenses under all 
agreements relating to Acquired SMR Licenses-Dial Page Terri-
tory which have been entered into by Motorola or a Motorola SMR 
Subsidiary as of such date, together with the cash necessary 
for New Sub to exercise the right to acquire such Acquired SMR 
Licenses-Dial Page Territory.

(iv) As of the Closing Date, and at the last day of 
each month thereafter up to and including the first anniversary 
of the Closing Date, Motorola shall prepare a statement (the 
"Channel Delivery Status Statement-Dial Page Territory") show-
ing (A) the total number of Motorola Owned SMR Channels-Dial 
Page Territory and the total number of SMR Channels underlying 
Acquired SMR Licenses-Dial Page Territory actually contributed 
within each Group-Dial Page Territory and (B) the aggregate 
value of the SMR Channels so contributed (calculated in accor-
dance with clause (vii) of this Section 4.8(b)).

(v) In the event that as of the Closing Date, the 
aggregate value of the Motorola Owned SMR Licenses-Dial Page 
Territory and Acquired SMR Licenses-Dial Page Territory which 
were actually contributed (the "Contributed Channels-Dial Page 
Territory") as of Closing, is less than the Required Channel 
Value-Dial Page Territory, then a number of the New Sub Shares 
(the "Holdback Shares-Dial Page Territory") equal to (A) the 
difference between the Required Channel Value-Dial Page Terri-
tory and the aggregate value of the Contributed Channels-Dial 
Page Territory as of such date (such difference being the 
"Closing Date Shortfall Amount-Dial Page Territory"), (B) 
divided by $50, shall be deemed held contingently by Motorola 
and/or the applicable Motorola SMR Subsidiaries and subject to 
the restrictions set forth in Section 4.10(a) hereof, until the 
release of such restrictions, or the cancellation of such New 
Sub Shares, in each case in accordance with Section 4.8(c) 
hereof. 

(vi) For a period of twelve (12) months following the 
Closing, Motorola shall continue to use best efforts to enter 
into contracts providing the right to acquire and contribute to 
New Sub, additional Motorola McSMRs-Dial Page Territory or Sub-
stitute Channels-Dial Page Territory (together, in the case of 
such Substitute Channels, with site leases and related equip-
ment as are available), up to the Required Channel Value-Dial 
Page Territory, it being understood that "best efforts" for 
this purpose shall be subject to the same limitations as set 
forth in Section 4.8(b)(ii) hereof. New Sub shall be obligated 
to assume the right to acquire such SMR Licenses under such 
contracts and to take all other steps reasonably necessary (in-
cluding the assumption of site leases and equipment leases in 
connection therewith) to permit it to effect the purchase 
thereunder; provided, however, that Motorola shall, at or prior 
to the time that New Sub would exercise such rights to acquire, 
contribute any and all consideration necessary for the exercise 
of all rights under such contracts; provided, further, that 
such contracts shall be on terms no less favorable to Motorola 
or New Sub than the Model Form.

(vii) For purposes of this Section 4.8, the "aggregate 
value" of the Contributed Channels-Dial Page Territory as of a 
given date shall be calculated as the sum of the products (for 
each Group-Dial Page Territory) of the number of SMR Channels 
actually contributed as of such date in each Group-Dial Page 
Territory by the applicable Group Per Channel Assigned Value-
Dial Page Territory.

(viii) On the last day of each month following the 
Closing Date, through and including the first anniversary of 
the Closing Date, as provided in clause (iv) of this Section 
4.8(b), Motorola shall deliver a Channel Delivery Status State-
ment-Dial Page Territory. If the difference between the Re-
quired Channel Value-Dial Page Territory and the aggregate 
value of the Contributed Channels-Dial Page Territory as of 
such date ("Interim Shortfall Amount-Dial Page Territory") is 
less than the Closing Date Shortfall Amount-Dial Page Terri-
tory, then a number of the Holdback Shares-Dial Page Territory 
shall be released and retained and held by Motorola and/or the 
Motorola SMR Subsidiaries free of the restrictions set forth in 
Section 4.10(a), such number being equal to (A) the difference 
between the Closing Date Shortfall Amount-Dial Page Territory 
and the Interim Shortfall Amount-Dial Page Territory as of such 
date (the "Interim Delivery Amount-Dial Page Territory"), (B) 
minus the Interim Delivery Amount-Dial Page Territory, if any, 
for each month-end following the Closing, (C) divided by $50. 
The remainder of such Holdback Shares-Dial Page Territory shall 
continue to be held contingently by Motorola and the Motorola 
SMR Subsidiaries and subject to the restrictions set forth in 
Section 4.10(a) hereof, until the release of such restrictions, 
or the cancellation of such New Sub Shares, in each case in 
accordance with this Section 4.8.

(c) (i) On the first anniversary of the Closing 
Date, Motorola shall submit to New Sub a final Channel Delivery 
Status Statement-Dial Page Territory. 

(ii) If the aggregate value of the Contributed Chan-
nels-Dial Page Territory as of such date (calculated in accor-
dance with subparagraph (b)(vii) of this Section 4.8) is less 
than or equal to the Required Channel Value-Dial Page Terri-
tory, then Motorola and the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries shall (A) 
surrender to New Sub a number of New Sub Shares equal to (1) 
the difference between the Required Channel Value-Dial Page 
Territory and the aggregate value of the Contributed Channels-
Dial Page Territory as of the first anniversary of the Closing 
Date (the "Final Channel Contribution-Dial Page Territory") and 
(2) divided by $50 and (B) shall retain any remaining Holdback 
Shares-Dial Page Territory free of the restrictions in Section 

-60-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

4.10(a); provided that the surrender of New Sub Shares under 
clause (A) hereof shall be contingent upon the reassignment to 
Motorola of all of New Sub's right, if any, to any SMR Channels 
not deemed "actually contributed" as of such date, it being 
understood that the parties hereto may waive the operation of 
clause (A) in which case Motorola shall hold the Holdback 
Shares-Dial Page Territory free of all restrictions and New Sub 
shall retain such SMR Channels, whether or not they ultimately 
satisfy the criteria set forth in Section 4.5(b)(viii) hereof 
to be treated as "actually contributed". 

4.9. Certain Covenants Relating to Channel Delivery. 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly contemplated by 
this Agreement, during the period from the date of this Agree-
ment through the date on which all contractual rights relating 
to Motorola McSMRs-Nextel Territory contemplated by Section 
4.1(a)(iii) to be assigned to New Sub have been validly and 
effectively so assigned (or, if earlier, the date on which all 
such contractual rights which have not been so assigned ex-
pire), Motorola shall give the Company written notice of any 
options, rights of first refusal or similar right with respect 
to any Motorola McSMR-Nextel Territory as soon as reasonably 
practicable after such option or right becomes exercisable (or 
earlier, if necessary to provide at least 20 business days' 
notice to the Company prior to the expiration of any such op-
tion or right).

(i) If the time at which such option or right be-
comes exercisable occurs prior to the first anniversary of the 
Closing and (A) the Applicable Nextel Market Channel Target for 
the Market-Nextel Territory which includes such Motorola McSMR 
has been satisfied and (B) Motorola does not intend to acquire 
such Motorola McSMR in order to use it as an Excess Channel-
Nextel Territory to compensate for a shortfall in another 
Market-Nextel Territory (as set forth in the notice given by 
Motorola), the Company shall (subject to Section 7.11(j) here-
of) have the right (subject to any applicable restrictions in 
the contract relating to such Motorola McSMR) to request that 
Motorola or the relevant Motorola SMR Subsidiary assign to New 
Sub, the right to exercise such right of first refusal, which 
assignment (subject to the next sentence) shall be made as soon 
as practicable (but in the case of such requests for assignment 
as are made prior to the Closing, such assignments may be made 
effective upon the Closing), and the Company shall provide 
written notice of such determination within 15 business days of 
its receipt of the notice given by Motorola. Should Motorola 
or the relevant Motorola SMR Subsidiary be unable to assign any 
such option, right of first refusal or other similar rights 

-61-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

contemplated in this clause (i), or should the time for exer-
cise thereof expire prior to the Closing, then (1) Motorola or 
the relevant Motorola SMR Subsidiary shall exercise such option 
or right on behalf of the Company if requested to do so by the 
Company and (2) the Company (or New Sub if the Closing occurs) 
will forthwith reimburse Motorola for the cost of such exer-
cise.

(ii) If the time at which such option or right be-
comes exercisable occurs prior to the first anniversary of the 
Closing and either (A) the Applicable Nextel Market Channel 
Target for the Market-Nextel Territory which includes such 
Motorola McSMR-Nextel Territory has not been satisfied, or (B) 
Motorola could acquire such Motorola McSMR-Nextel Territory in 
order to use it as an Excess Channel-Nextel Territory to com-
pensate for a shortfall in another Market-Nextel Territory, 
Motorola shall include in its written notice a statement as to 
whether Motorola intends to exercise such right. If Motorola 
does not intend to exercise such right, the Company shall 
(subject to Section 7.11(j) hereof) have the rights set forth 
in clause (i) hereof, subject to the limitations and obliga-
tions set forth therein.

(iii) If the time at which such option or right be-
comes exercisable occurs on or after the first anniversary of 
the Closing, the Company shall (subject to Section 7.11(j) 
hereof) have the rights set forth in clause (i) this Section 
4.9(a), subject to the limitations and obligations set forth 
therein, and Motorola or the relevant Motorola SMR Subsidiary 
shall not exercise any such option or right, except in accor-
dance with a request to that effect from the Company.

(b) (i) No Motorola McSMR which is required to be 
assigned pursuant to Section 4.1(a)(iii), (b)(iii) or (c)(iii) 
hereto shall be assigned to New Sub without the consent of each 
of the licensee thereunder and (prior to the Closing) the Com-
pany or (after the Closing) New Sub. If the licensee there-
under consents to the assignment (which consent to such assign-
ment shall be subject to no conditions, other than that New Sub 
shall assume all obligations of Motorola or the relevant 
Motorola SMR Subsidiary thereunder which accrue after such 
assignment), but the Company (or New Sub, as appropriate) does 
not, Motorola shall have no further obligation with respect to 
such Motorola McSMR under this Agreement, including Section 4.1 
hereof and clause (ii) of this Section 4.9(b).

(ii) In the event that the terms applicable to any 
management agreement relating to a Motorola McSMR which was to 
have been assigned pursuant to Sections 4.1(a)(iii), or 
4.1(b)(iii) or 4.1(c)(iii) hereof, include conditions or 

-62-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

restrictions that prohibit such assignment without the consent 
of the licensee, and the licensee fails to grant such consent 
(or such consent is subject to conditions other than those 
permitted under clause (i)), then this Agreement shall not 
require the assignment of such agreement but, in lieu of such 
assignment, Motorola shall use reasonable efforts to establish 
and cause to be put and maintained in place such arrangements 
as may be necessary so that New Sub shall be placed in substan-
tially the same position (including, without limitation, as 
concerns the economic benefits and burdens, and the legal and 
other rights and obligations), that New Sub would have occupied 
had such assignment been made to New Sub in the absence of such 
conditions or restrictions; it being understood that (i) "rea-
sonable efforts" shall not require Motorola to incur additional 
costs or expenses in establishing such arrangements, or to 
challenge or defend any allegation by the licensee in connec-
tion with such arrangement and (ii) at or prior to Closing, New 
Sub and Motorola shall enter into an agreement (the "SMR 
Services Agreement") setting forth the rights and obligations 
of each of them in connection with such arrangement, such 
agreement to be substantially in the form of Exhibit G hereto 
which shall, among other things, provide for (A) Motorola 
and/or the applicable Motorola SMR Subsidiaries to continue to 
manage such Motorola McSMRs and (B) include an indemnity by New 
Sub of Motorola in connection with any Action by the licensee 
challenging such arrangement. Notwithstanding anything else to 
the contrary in Section 4.1(a), (b) or (c) or Section 6.16 
hereof, with respect to any Motorola McSMR subject to such an 
SMR Services Agreement, Motorola shall retain all assets relat-
ing to such Motorola McSMR of the types set forth in Sections 
4.1(a)(v), (vi) and (viii), 4.1(b)(iv), (v) and (vii) and 
4.1(c)(iv), (v) and (vii) hereof until such time as is other-
wise provided pursuant to the SMR Services Agreement.

4.10. Interim Restrictions on Holdback Shares. (a) 
During the period from the Closing Date through and including 
the first anniversary thereof, any Holdback Shares which have 
not, pursuant to Sections 4.5(b)(ix), 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8 hereof, 
been released from the restrictions set forth in this Section 
4.10 (the "Restricted Shares"), shall be held by Motorola and 
the applicable Motorola SMR Subsidiaries subject to the provi-
sions and restrictions set forth herein:

(i) Any and all dividends or other distributions 
paid by New Sub in respect of the Restricted Shares (whether 
payable in cash or other property, New Sub Shares or other se-
curities issued by New Sub) which are (A) ordinary dividends 
may be retained by Motorola and/or the Motorola SMR Subsidiar-
ies, but any such dividends and distributions (B) which are 
extraordinary will be held by Motorola and the applicable 

-63-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Motorola SMR Subsidiaries for the account of the Person (the 
"Distributee") either (x) which ultimately retains such New Sub 
Shares free of the restrictions hereunder or (y) to which such 
Restricted Shares are returned for cancellation (in each case 
in accordance with Sections 4.5(b)(ix), 4.6, 4.7 and 4.8 here-
of) and in the case of dividends covered by clause (B) of this 
Section 4.10(a)(i) shall be distributed (along with the pro-
ceeds or deemed proceeds of any investment thereof) to the Dis-
tributee along with any release or cancellation of the New Sub 
Shares (pro rata, in the case of a partial release of the New 
Sub Shares). Any cash portions of any such dividend or other 
distribution shall be deemed to bear interest at the average 
three-month Treasury Bill interest rate from the date of pay-
ment to the date of return. 

(ii) Such Restricted Shares may be voted by Motorola 
and/or the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries in any manner, whether at 
an annual or special meeting of New Sub stockholders, in con-
nection with any action by written consent of such stockholders 
without a meeting, or otherwise, except that Restricted Shares 
(if any) which are Clearnet Attributable Shares may not be 
voted.

(iii) Such Restricted Shares may not be sold, trans-
ferred, pledged, encumbered or otherwise disposed of except 
for:

(A) transfers pursuant to a tender offer for a 
majority of the then outstanding New Sub Shares; or

(B) transfers pursuant to a merger, consolida-
tion, share exchange, sale of substantially all the as-
sets, liquidation or other similar extraordinary trans-
action in which the then outstanding New Sub Shares are 
converted into, or exchanged for, cash, securities or 
other property;

provided that, in the case of clauses (iii)(A) and (B), the 
consideration received in respect of such Restricted Shares 
shall be held by Motorola and/or the applicable Motorola SMR 
Subsidiaries for the account of the Distributee (and, in the 
case of any such consideration which is cash, shall be deemed 
to bear interest at the rate set forth in clause (i)) and shall 
be distributed (along with the proceeds of any investment or 
deemed investment thereof) to the Distributee along with any 
release or cancellation of the New Sub Shares (pro rata, in the 
case of a partial release of the New Sub Shares).

(b) If (i) at any time the Clearnet Agreement is 
terminated without consummation of the transactions contem-
plated thereby or (ii) as of the first anniversary of the Clos-
ing Date the Clearnet Transaction has not been consummated, 
Motorola and the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries shall return the 
Clearnet Attributable Shares (if any) to New Sub for cancella-
tion.

diction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it 
or the nature of the business conducted by it makes such quali-

leased or operated by it or the nature of the business con-

individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse ef-
fect on the Business Condition of the Company and its Subsid-
iaries taken as a whole. The Company has heretofore provided

execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the 
Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated hereby and thereby in accordance with the terms

cancellation, acceleration of, or a right to put, or compel a 
tender offer for, outstanding securities under, or result in 
the imposition of any Encumbrance under, or require any consent

except where such violation, conflict or default, right of 
termination, cancellation or acceleration, put or similar 
right, imposition of an Encumbrance or failure to obtain such 
consent, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a 
material adverse effect on (i) the Business Condition of the 
Company and its Existing Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) 
the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under 
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

(b) The Company Disclosure Statement lists (i) all

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

other Persons to or by the Company and any of its Existing Sub-
sidiaries in connection with the consummation of the trans-
actions contemplated to occur at or prior to the Closing by 
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements other than those 
Authorizations, consents, approvals and waivers as to which the 
failure to make, file, give or obtain, individually or in the 
aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on (i) the 
Business Condition of the Company and its Existing Subsidiar-
ies, taken as a whole, or (ii) the ability of the Company and 
its Existing Subsidiaries to perform their obligations under 
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

5.6. Litigation. There are no Actions pending or, 
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by or before any 
Governmental Authority against the Company or any of its Exist-
ing Subsidiaries (or any Benefit Plan), or any property of the 
Company or any such Existing Subsidiary (including Intellectual 
Property), except Actions which, in the aggregate, are not rea-
sonably expected to have a material adverse effect on (a) the 
Business Condition of the Company and its Existing Subsidiaries 
taken as a whole or (b) the ability of the Company to perform 
its obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agree-
ments. There are no Orders against the Company or any of its 
Existing Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or 
businesses that are reasonably expected to have, individually 
or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the Business 
Condition of the Company and its Existing Subsidiaries taken as 
a whole or that prohibit the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

5.7. Employee Benefit Plans. (a) Except as dis-
closed in the Company Disclosure Statement, all Benefit Plans 
which are "employee benefit plans," as defined in Section 3(3) 
of ERISA, in all material respects are in compliance with and 
have been administered in all material respects in compliance 
with all applicable requirements under any Law, including but 
not limited to the Code and ERISA, and all contributions re-
quired to be made to each such plan under the terms of such 
plan, ERISA or the Code for all periods of time prior to the 
date hereof and the Closing Date have been or will be, as the 
case may be, made or accrued.

(b) Except as disclosed in the Company Disclosure 
Statement, with respect to any Benefit Plan which is intended 
to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code ("Pension Plan"), a 
favorable determination letter as to the qualification under 
Section 401(a) of the Code has been issued and the related 
trust has been determined to be exempt from taxation under Sec-
tion 501(a) of the Code and, to the Company's knowledge, no 
amendment made (or the failure of such amendment to be made) to 

-69-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

any Pension Plan subsequent to the date of such determination 
letter has adversely affected the qualified status of any such 
plan. The Company and its Subsidiaries have performed all ma-
terial obligations required to be performed by them under, and 
are not in default under or in violation of, the terms of any 
of the Pension Plans. Neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries 
nor any other "disqualified person" (as defined in Section 4975 
of the Code) has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as 
such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Code), which could 
subject any Pension Plan (or its related trust), the Company or 
any of its Subsidiaries or any officer, director or employee of 
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any material tax or 
penalty imposed under Section 4975 of the Code. No Pension 
Plan is a "defined benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(35) 
of ERISA or subject to Section 412 of the Code, Section 302 of 
ERISA or Title II of ERISA. No Benefit Plan is funded through 
a welfare benefit fund within the meaning of Section 419 of the 
Code, and no benefits under any Pension Plan are provided 
through a voluntary employees' beneficiary association within 
the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Existing Sub-
sidiaries is required to contribute to, or during the five-year 
period ending on the Closing Date will have been required to 
contribute to, any "multiemployer plan," as such term is de-
fined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, and neither the Company 
nor any of its Existing Subsidiaries is subject to any with-
drawal or partial withdrawal liability within the contemplation 
of Section 4201 of ERISA and will not become subject thereto as 
a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Neither the execution and delivery of this 
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements nor the consummation of 
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will (i) re-
sult in any payment (including, without limitation, severance, 
unemployment compensation, golden parachute or otherwise) be-
coming due to any director, officer, employee or other Affil-
iate of the Company or any of its Existing Subsidiaries under 
any Benefit Plan or otherwise, (ii) increase any benefits oth-
erwise payable by the Company or any Existing Subsidiary under 
any Benefit Plan or (iii) result in the acceleration of the 
time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.

(e) Except with respect to a Benefit Plan which is 
an "employee benefit plan" under ERISA, neither the Company nor 
any ERISA Affiliate has any material Controlled Group Liabil-
ity, nor do any circumstances exist that could result in any of 
them having any Controlled Group Liability. "Controlled Group 
Liability" means (i) any and all liabilities to the Pension 

-70-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Benefit Guarantee Corporation (other than for premium pay-
ments), to any "multiemployer plan", to any participant or to 
the Internal Revenue Service, under Title IV of ERISA, (ii) any 
and all liabilities with respect to withdrawal or partial with-
drawal from a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in clause (c) 
above) and (iii) any and all liabilities arising from viola-
tions of the requirements of (A) section 302 of ERISA (B) sec-
tions 412 and 4971 of the Code, and (C) the continuation cover-

tions for recognition of, a labor union or association as the 
exclusive bargaining agent for any of the employees of the Com-
pany or any of its Existing Subsidiaries; no such petitions 
have been pending at any time within two years of the date of 
this Agreement and, to the knowledge of the Company, there has 
not been any organizing effort by any union or other group 
seeking to represent any employees of the Company or any of its 
Existing Subsidiaries as their exclusive bargaining agent at 
any time within two years of the date of this Agreement. There 
are no labor strikes, work stoppages or other labor troubles, 
other than routine grievance matters, now pending, or, to the 
Company's knowledge, threatened, against the Company or any of 
its Existing Subsidiaries, nor have there been any such labor 
strikes, work stoppages or other labor troubles, other than 
routine grievance matters, with respect to the Company or any 
of its Existing Subsidiaries at any time within two years of 
the date of this Agreement.

5.8. Taxes. (a) All Tax Returns required to be 
filed by the Company or any Existing Subsidiary of the Company 
and all Tax Returns of any consolidated, combined or unitary 
group which includes the Company or any Existing Subsidiary of 
the Company have been timely and properly filed other than such 
Tax Returns which, if not filed or if not timely or properly 
filed, would not in the aggregate subject the Company and its 
Existing Subsidiaries to any material liability for Taxes.

(b) Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure 
Statement, all Taxes which are due and payable or which are 
required to be paid or withheld by the Company or any Existing 
Subsidiary of the Company have been duly paid or reserved for

the Company Financial Statements through the dates thereof or, 
if they first become due and payable after March 31, 1994 are

liability for Taxes materially in excess of the amounts so paid 
or so reserved.

Statement, (i) all Tax Returns with respect to Taxes that have 
been filed by or with respect to the Company or any Existing 
Subsidiary of the Company have been audited by the Internal 
Revenue Service or the appropriate Governmental Authority or

Tax Returns were required to be filed has expired, (ii) all 
deficiencies asserted or assessments made as a result of such 
examinations have been paid in full, (iii) no issues that have 
been raised by the relevant Governmental Authority in connec-
tion with the examination of any such Tax Returns are currently

pany or any Existing Subsidiary of the Company.

(d) Neither the Company nor any Existing Subsidiary 
of the Company will be obligated as a result of the transac-
tions contemplated by this Agreement to make a payment that 
would be a "parachute payment" to a "disqualified individual" 
as those terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code without 
regard to whether such payment is reasonable compensation for 
personal services performed or to be performed in the future.

(e) There are no federal, state or local Tax liens 
upon any property or assets of the Company or any Existing Sub-
sidiary of the Company other than (i) liens for Taxes which are 
not yet due and payable and (ii) Tax liens which, individually 
or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect 
on the Business Condition of the Company and its Existing Sub-
sidiaries, taken as a whole.

(f) For purposes of this Section 5.8, "Tax Returns" 
shall mean all returns, amended returns, declarations, reports, 
estimates, information returns and statements required or per-
mitted to be filed under any Law relating to Taxes by, or in-
cluding, the Company or any Existing Subsidiary of the Company. 

5.9. Intellectual Property. (a) The Company and 
its Existing Subsidiaries own, or have the defensible right to 
use, the Intellectual Property used in the Company's business, 
except where the failure to own or have the right to use such 
Intellectual Property, would not, individually or in the aggre-
gate, have a material adverse effect on the Business Condition 
of the Company and its Existing Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

(b) No claims which, individually or in the aggre-
gate, are reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect 

-72-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

on the Business Condition of the Company and its Existing Sub-
sidiaries taken as a whole have been asserted by any Person (i) 
challenging the ownership, validity or effectiveness of any 
Intellectual Property owned or used by the Company and its Ex-
isting Subsidiaries, (ii) to the effect that any activity of 
the Company or its Existing Subsidiaries infringes on any 
patent or (iii) against the use by the Company or its Existing 
Subsidiaries of any Intellectual Property necessary for the 
conduct of their business (provided that no representation is 
made under this Section 5.9 with respect to Intellectual Prop-
erty of Motorola relating to equipment sold by Motorola to the 
Company).

5.10. Reports and Financial Statements. (a) The 
Company has furnished to Motorola true and complete copies of 
each registration statement (in the form it became effective) 
filed by the Company under the Securities Act, since December 
1, 1992 together with each final prospectus thereunder. Each 
such registration statement, at the time it became effective, 
contained no untrue statement of material fact and did not omit 
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or 
necessary in order to make the statements therein not mislead-
ing; provided, that the representation and warranty contained 
in this Section shall not be deemed applicable to any informa-
tion (financial or otherwise) concerning Motorola and/or the 
Motorola SMR Subsidiaries, or (as the same may relate to any 
period prior to the Closing) New Sub, the Applicable SMR Busi-
ness, the Applicable SMR Assets, the Applicable SMR Liabili-
ties, the Contributed Assets or the Assumed Liabilities that is 
included or required to be included therein.

(b) The Company has filed all reports (including 
without limitation proxy statements) required to be filed with 
the SEC in the period from December 1, 1992 to the date hereof 
(collectively, the "Company SEC Reports"), and has furnished or 
made available to Motorola true and complete copies of all the 
Company SEC Reports. None of the Company SEC Reports, as of 
their respective dates (as amended through the date hereof), 
contained any untrue statement of material fact or omitted to 
state a material fact required to be stated therein or neces-
sary to make the statements therein, in light of the circum-
stances under which they were made, not misleading. All of the 
Company SEC Reports, as of their respective dates (as amended 
through the date hereof), complied in all material respects 
with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the applicable 
rules and regulations thereunder.

(c) The Company previously has delivered to Motorola 
correct and complete copies of its audited consolidated finan-
cial statements (including the balance sheet, statement of 

-73-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

operations and statement of cash flows, and, in each case, the 
related footnotes thereto) as of March 31, 1994 or for the fis-
cal year then ended, as appropriate (the "Audited Statements"), 
in the form contained in the Company's Annual Report to Stock-
holders for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1994. Each of the 
balance sheets included in such Audited Statements (collec-
tively, the "Company Financial Statements") present fairly, in 
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of 
the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates 
thereof, and each of the other related statements included in 
such Company Financial Statements present fairly, in all mate-
rial respects, the consolidated results of operations and cash 
flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the respective 
periods thereof, all in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles consistently applied during the periods 
involved except as otherwise noted therein.

(d) Except and to the extent reflected or reserved 
against in the Company Financial Statements, none of the Com-
pany nor any Existing Subsidiary of the Company has any li-
abilities or obligations (of the types that, in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles, are required to be 
reflected or reserved against in the Company Financial State-
ments) of any nature, whether absolute, accrued, contingent or 
otherwise, and whether due or to become due, for the periods 
covered thereby. The Company does not know or have reasonable 
grounds to know of any basis for the assertion against the Com-
pany or any Existing Subsidiary of the Company of any material 
claim or material liability (of the types that, in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, are required to 
be reflected or reserved against in the Company Financial 
Statements) of any nature or in any amount not fully reflected 
or reserved against in the Company Financial Statements for the 
periods provided, whether or not previously disclosed to 
Motorola.

5.11. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. Since 
March 31, 1994, there has not been any material adverse change 
in the Business Condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries 
taken as a whole, and, except as otherwise set forth in Section 
5.11 of the Company Disclosure Statement, neither the Company 
nor any Existing Subsidiary of the Company has:

(a) amended its certificate of incorporation or by 
laws in any way with respect to provisions regarding its 
capital stock or which would materially adversely affect 
(i) Motorola's rights as a stockholder upon consummation 
of the Nextel Merger; or (ii) the value or marketability 
of the New Sub Shares held by Motorola; provided, however,

taken as a whole or (ii) materially adversely affect 
Motorola's rights as a stockholder or the value or market-
ability of the New Sub Shares held by Motorola:

For purposes of this Section 5.11, references to a "material 
adverse effect on Motorola's rights as a stockholder or on the 
value or marketability of the New Sub Shares held by Motorola" 
are intended to refer to effects caused by the action or event 
in question and shall be deemed to exclude such effects (1) as 
a result solely of adverse developments in the Company's busi-
ness operations (which shall be covered, if at all, by the 
phrase "material adverse effect on the Business Condition of 
the Company and its Existing Subsidiaries, taken as a whole") 
and (2) solely as a result of general fluctuations or general 
volatility in the price of the Company Shares prior to Closing. 
It is expressly understood and agreed that Motorola may assert 
the existence of a "material adverse effect on Motorola's 
rights as a stockholder or on the value or marketability of the 
New Sub Shares held by Motorola" pursuant to this Section 5.11 
and/or in Section 5.19(b) only as a basis for not consummating 
the transactions contemplated hereunder as a result of the 
condition set forth in Section 8.2(a) failing to be satisfied, 
but after the Closing, New Sub (as successor by merger to the 
Company) shall have no liability or obligation to Motorola 
(including any Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 10.1(b) 
hereof) for any alleged or asserted breach of any 
representation and warranty set forth in this Section 5.11 and/
or Section 5.19(b) arising out of or resulting from any such 
"material adverse effect on Motorola's rights as a stockholder 
or on the value or marketability of the New Sub Shares held by 
Motorola".

5.12. Compliance with Laws. (a) To the knowledge 
of the Company, the conduct of the business of each of the Com-
pany and its Existing Subsidiaries complies with all Laws and 
Orders applicable thereto, except for violations or failures so 
to comply, if any, that would not have a material adverse ef-
fect on the Business Condition of the Company and its Existing 
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Except as set forth in the Com-
pany Disclosure Statement, as of the date hereof none of the 

-77-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Company or any of its Existing Subsidiaries has received any 
written communication from a Governmental Authority that al-
leges that the Company or any Existing Subsidiary is not in 
compliance with, or may be liable under, any such Law or Order 
other than instances of alleged non-compliance or alleged li-
ability that are not reasonably expected to have a material 
adverse effect on the Business Condition of the Company and its 
Existing Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(b) (i) Except as specifically set forth in the 
Company Disclosure Statement, on the date hereof the Company 
and the Company's Existing Subsidiaries have duly secured and 
possess, on the date hereof, all necessary Licenses and Autho-
rizations from, and have filed all material required registra-
tions, applications, reports and other documents with, the FCC, 
and, if applicable, any State public utility commission ("PUC") 
and any other Governmental Authority exercising jurisdiction 
over the Company or any Existing Subsidiary of the Company, 
including the SMR business, radio paging businesses and other 
radio communications businesses of the Company and the Com-
pany's Existing Subsidiaries as such businesses are being con-
ducted on the date hereof except where the failure to have such 
Licenses or Authorizations or the failure to make such filings 
could not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse 
effect on the Business Condition of the Company and its Exist-
ing Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Such Licenses and Authori-
zations are valid and in full force and effect without materi-
ally adverse conditions except for such conditions as are gen-
erally applicable to holders of such Licenses and Authoriza-
tions. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure State-
ment, and except systems under either a digital or wide area 
waiver, all loading requirements with respect to any 800 MHz 
SMR Licenses listed in the Company Disclosure Statement which 
are required to have been met as of the date hereof have been 
met, and the Company and the Company's Existing Subsidiaries 
have taken every reasonable action to cause the same to be 
loaded in compliance with FCC regulations and no material num-
ber of individual frequencies will be cancelled by the FCC 
prior to the Closing Date for failure to meet such loading re-
quirements.

(ii) The Company and its Existing Subsidiaries have 
not made any material misstatements of fact, or omitted to dis-
close any material fact, to any Governmental Authority, or 
taken or failed to take any action, which misstatements or 
omissions, actions or failures to act, individually or in the 
aggregate, subject any Licenses held by it to risk of revoca-
tion or failure to renew, except where the revocation or fail-
ure to renew would not have a material adverse effect on the 
Business Condition of the Company and its Existing Subsidiaries 

-78-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

taken as a whole. Neither the Company nor any of its Existing 
Subsidiaries is subject to any Order or pending or, to the 
knowledge of the Company, threatened, Action which affects or 
is reasonably expected to affect the validity of any Licenses 
held by it, or result in the revocation, termination, or ad-
verse modification thereof, or impair the renewal thereof, ex-
cept where the invalidity of such Licenses (individually or in 
the aggregate) or the revocation, termination, adverse modi-
fication or nonrenewal thereof would not have a material ad-
verse effect on the Business Condition of the Company and its 
Existing Subsidiaries taken as a whole. To the Company's 
knowledge, no event has occurred and is continuing that could 
reasonably be expected to (A) result in the revocation, termi-
nation or adverse modification of any License of the Company or 
any Existing Subsidiary of the Company or (B) materially and 
adversely affect any rights of the Company or any Existing Sub-
sidiary of the Company thereunder, except where the occurrence 
or existence of such event or effect described in the foregoing 
clauses (A) or (B) (individually or in the aggregate) would not 
have a material adverse effect on the Business Condition of the 
Company and its Existing Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; nei-
ther the Company nor any Existing Subsidiary of the Company has 
any reason to believe that any License of the Company or any 
Existing Subsidiary will not be renewed in the ordinary course, 
except where such nonrenewal (individually or in the aggregate) 
would not have a material adverse effect on the Business Condi-
tion of the Company and its Existing Subsidiaries, taken as a 
whole.

(c) None of the Company or any of its Existing Sub-
sidiaries has caused or taken any action that is reasonably 
expected to result in, and none of them is subject to, any ma-
terial liability or obligation under any Environmental Law re-
lating to (i) the environmental conditions on, under, or about 
any real property currently or formerly owned, leased or oper-
ated by the Company or its Existing Subsidiaries, including 
without limitation any contamination of soil or groundwater at 
such properties; or (ii) the past or present use, management, 
handling, transport, treatment, generation, storage, or release 
of any Hazardous Materials by the Company or its Existing Sub-
sidiaries.

Subsidiaries have paid all material franchise, license or other

gible personal property reasonably necessary for the conduct of 
the business of the Company or any Existing Subsidiary of the 
Company as presently conducted, or as proposed to be conducted, 
are in satisfactory operating condition and repair, subject to 
ordinary wear and tear, except in such instances where the

mutual agreement of the Company or its relevant Existing Sub-
sidiary and each other party thereto since the filing thereof), 
and (i) none of the Company or its Existing Subsidiaries or, to 
the Company's knowledge, any other party thereto, has breached

The transactions listed in clauses (i) through 
(viii), in accordance with the terms and conditions of the 
related agreements referred to therein, are herein referred to

It is understood and agreed that any effect on the 
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in this 
Article V that results or arises from the consummation of, or 
the termination or abandonment of, any of the Currently An-
nounced Transactions by means of a merger or other combination 
of the other party thereto directly with or into the Company, 
as opposed to the acquisition by the Company of a Subsidiary 
that would not be deemed to be an Existing Subsidiary, shall 
not constitute a breach of such representations or warranties 
or cause them to be or to become untrue in any material 
respect, except for any such breach that may exist (A) with 
respect to the representations and warranties of the Company 
set forth in Sections 5.11 and/or 5.19 which involves or 
relates to any of such Currently Announced Transactions or (B)

iary).

(b) Neither (i) the consummation by the Company of 
the Currently Announced Transactions, either individually or in

effect on the Business Condition of the Company and its 
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (B) materially adversely 
affect the rights of Motorola as a stockholder of New Sub or 
the value or marketability of New Sub Shares held by Motorola. 
For purposes of this Section 5.19(b), references to a "material 
adverse effect" on Motorola's rights as a stockholder or on the 
value or marketability of the New Sub Shares held by Motorola 
are intended to refer to effects caused by the action or event 
in question and shall be deemed to exclude such effects (1) as 
a result solely of adverse developments in the Company's busi-
ness operations (which shall be covered, if at all, by the 
phrase "material adverse effect on the Business Condition of 
the Company and its Existing Subsidiaries, taken as a whole") 
and (2) solely as a result of general fluctuations or 
volatility in the price of the Company Shares prior to Closing.

(c) The Company has certain contractual obligations 
to offer to Comcast and/or Comcast FCI the opportunity to ac-
quire Company Shares upon any issuance of Company Shares (i) to 
Motorola or any Subsidiary of Motorola in connection with the 
transactions contemplated in this Agreement (to the extent of 
up to 35,500,000 Company Shares constituting a portion of the 
Nextel Attributable Shares) and (ii) issuances of additional 
Company Shares, in excess of those referenced in the preceding 
clause (i), in connection with the transactions contemplated in 
this Agreement and in connection with the Currently Announced 
Transactions described in Sections 5.19(a)(ii), (iii), (v) and 
(vi) hereof, as well as in connection with the completed ac-
quisition of PowerFone Holdings Inc. by the Company (the 
"Comcast Anti-Dilutive Rights"). In connection with the obli-
gations arising under clause (i) of this subparagraph (c), the 
Company intends to propose to Comcast that Comcast be offered 
the opportunity to acquire the appropriate number and type of 
Company Shares and/or New Sub Shares, as the case may be, and 
if accepted by Comcast, that such acquisition will be consum-
mated, at a per share price equal to the closing sale price for 
a share of the Company Class A Common Stock as reported on the 
NASDAQ-NMS on November 8, 1993, which was the final trading day 
prior to the public announcement of the transactions contem-
plated by this Agreement. Motorola confirms its understanding 
that the Comcast Anti-Dilutive Rights may proceed on either (A) 
the terms set forth in the Comcast Stock Purchase Agreement (as 
in effect on the date hereof), (B) the terms set forth above 
with respect to clause (i) or (C) such other terms as may be 
agreed upon by the Company and Comcast provided that, in the 
case of clause (C), (1) the Company shall have received a writ-
ten opinion from an investment banking firm reasonably accept-
able to Motorola to the effect that the terms of such alterna-
tive arrangement with Comcast are fair to the Company and its 
stockholders and (2) the transaction shall not otherwise re-
quire Motorola's consent under Section 7.16 or 7.17 hereof (or 
Motorola's consent shall have been obtained). No waiver of, or 
failure by Comcast to exercise any of the Comcast Anti-Dilutive 
Rights shall require any consent or approval from Motorola, or 
confer any rights upon Motorola under this Agreement.

material adverse effect on the Business Condition of the Ap-
plicable SMR Business.

6.2. New Sub and ESMR Sub. (a) New Sub and ESMR 
Sub were heretofore formed by Motorola for the purpose of 
owning and operating the Applicable SMR Business-Nextel Ter-

tion necessary to ensure that at no time prior to the Closing

execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the 
Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the transactions

conflict with, constitute a default (with or without notice or 
the lapse of time) under, or give rise to a right of termina-
tion, cancellation, or acceleration of, or result in the impo-
sition of any Encumbrance under, or require any consent (other 
than such consents as are listed in the Motorola Disclosure 
Statement) under, any term of (i) the charter or by-laws of 
Motorola or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) any note, bond, 
debt instrument, mortgage, indenture or other agreement or in-
strument or, except as set forth in subparagraph (b), any Law 
or Order, by which Motorola or any of its Subsidiaries may be 
bound, except where such violation, conflict or default, right 
of termination, cancellation or acceleration, imposition of an 
Encumbrance or failure to obtain such consent, individually or 
in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on 
(i) the Business Condition of the Applicable SMR Business or 
(ii) the ability of Motorola and its Subsidiaries to perform 
their obligations under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agree-
ments.

(b) The Motorola Disclosure Statement lists (i) all

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

from any Governmental Authority in connection with the trans-
actions contemplated to occur at or prior to the Closing by 
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and (ii) all con-
sents, approvals and waivers required to be given by, or ob-
tained from, any other Persons to or by Motorola or any 
Motorola Subsidiary in connection with the formation of New Sub 
and ESMR Sub, the transfer and assignment of the Contributed 
Assets, the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities, the consum-
mation of the Nextel Merger, and the consummation of any of the 
other transactions contemplated to occur at or prior to the 
Closing by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, other 
than those Authorizations, consents, approvals and waivers as 
to which the failure to make, file, give or obtain, individu-
ally or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse 
effect on (i) the Business Condition of the Applicable SMR 
Business or (ii) the ability of Motorola and its Subsidiaries 
to perform their obligations under this Agreement and the 
Ancillary Agreements. Motorola will advise the Company in 
writing, prior to the Closing, of such authorizations, con-
sents, approvals and waivers that have been sought but have not 
been obtained by Motorola and/or New Sub.

6.6. Litigation. There are no Actions pending or, 
to the knowledge of Motorola, threatened by or before any Gov-
ernmental Authority against Motorola or any of its Subsidiar-
ies, or any property of Motorola or any such Subsidiary (in-
cluding Intellectual Property), except Actions which, in the 
aggregate, are not reasonably expected to have a material ad-
verse effect on (a) the Business Condition of the Applicable 
SMR Business or (b) the ability of Motorola and its Subsidiar-
ies to perform their obligations under this Agreement and the 
Ancillary Agreements. There are no Orders against Motorola or 
any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties 
or businesses that are reasonably expected to have, individu-
ally or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on the 
Business Condition of the Applicable SMR Business or that would 
prohibit the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and 
the Ancillary Agreements. The Motorola Disclosure Statement 
describes certain litigation relating to the Applicable SMR 
Business, which litigation (and any liability or obligation 
with respect thereto, to the extent New Sub or any Subsidiary 
thereof otherwise might be or become subject by reason of the 
Nextel Merger and/or the Closing) shall not be included among 
the Contributed Assets or among the Assumed Liabilities.

Motorola/Nextel Disclosure Statement sets forth (i) audited 
balance sheets, statements of operations and territory equity

equity and cash flows of the Applicable SMR Business-Nextel 
Territory for the three months ended March 31, 1994 (together 
with the audited financial statements, the "Applicable SMR 
Business Financial Statements-Nextel Territory"). Each of such 
balance sheets (including the related notes) presents fairly, 
in all material respects, the consolidated financial position 
of the Applicable SMR Business-Nextel Territory as of the 
respective dates thereof, and the other related statements 
(including the related notes) included therein present fairly, 
in all material respects, the consolidated results of opera-
tions and cash flows of the Applicable SMR Business-Nextel 
Territory for the respective periods or as of the respective 
dates set forth therein, all in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles consistently applied during the 
periods involved, except as otherwise noted therein (subject in 
the case of unaudited financial statements to normal year-end 
adjustments).

(b) Tab 10 of the Motorola/OneComm Disclosure State-
ment sets forth (i) audited balance sheets, statements of op-
erations and territory equity and statements of cash flows (in-
cluding in each case the related notes) of the Applicable SMR 
Business-OneComm Territory as of, or for the fiscal years ended 
on December 31, 1993 and December 31, 1992, respectively, and 
(ii) an unaudited balance sheet and unaudited statement of op-
erations and territory equity and cash flows of the Applicable 
SMR Business-OneComm Territory for the three months ended March 
31, 1994 (together with the audited financial statements, the 
"Applicable SMR Business Financial Statements-OneComm Terri-
tory"). Each of such balance sheets (including the related 
notes) presents fairly, in all material respects, the consoli-
dated financial position of the Applicable SMR Business-OneComm 
Territory as of the respective dates thereof, and the other 
related statements (including the related notes) included 
therein present fairly, in all material respects, the consoli-
dated results of operations and cash flows of the Applicable 
SMR Business-OneComm Territory for the respective periods or as 
of the respective dates set forth therein, all in conformity 
with generally accepted accounting principles consistently ap-
plied during the periods involved, except as otherwise noted 
therein (subject in the case of unaudited financial statements 
to normal year-end adjustments).

(c) Tab 3 of the Motorola/Dial Page Disclosure 
Statement sets forth (i) audited balance sheets, statements of 
operations and territory equity and statements of cash flows 
(including in each case the related notes) of the Applicable 
SMR Business-Dial Page Territory as of, or for the fiscal years 
ended on December 31, 1993 and December 31, 1992, respectively, 
and (ii) an unaudited balance sheet and unaudited statement of 

-93-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

operations and territory equity and cash flows of the Appli-
cable SMR Business-Dial Page Territory for the three months 
ended March 31, 1994 (together with the audited financial 
statements, the "Applicable SMR Business Financial Statements-
Dial Page Territory"). Each of such balance sheets (including 
the related notes) presents fairly, in all material respects, 
the consolidated financial position of the Applicable SMR 
Business-Dial Page Territory as of the respective dates there-
of, and the other related statements (including the related 
notes) included therein present fairly, in all material re-
spects, the consolidated results of operations and cash flows 
of the Applicable SMR Business-Dial Page Territory for the 
respective periods or as of the respective dates set forth 
therein, all in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles consistently applied during the periods involved, 
except as otherwise noted therein (subject in the case of 
unaudited financial statements to normal year-end adjustments).

(d) Except and to the extent reflected or reserved 
against in the Applicable SMR Business Financial Statements-
Nextel Territory, the Applicable SMR Business Financial 
Statements-OneComm Territory or the Applicable SMR Business 
Financial Statements-Dial Page Territory, New Sub does not have 
any liabilities or obligations (of the types that, in accor-
dance with generally accepted accounting principles, are re-
quired to be reflected or reserved against in such financial 
statements) of any nature, whether absolute, accrued, contin-
gent or otherwise, and whether due or to become due, for the 
periods covered thereby. Motorola does not know or have 
reasonable grounds to know of any basis for the assertion 
against New Sub of any material claim or material liability (of 
the types that, in accordance with generally accepted account-
ing principles, are required to be reflected or reserved 
against in such financial statements) of any nature or in any 
amount not fully reflected or reserved against in such finan-
cial statements for the periods provided, whether or not previ-

6.9. Compliance with Laws. (a) Except as set forth 
in the Motorola Disclosure Statement, the conduct of the Appli-
cable SMR Business by Motorola and New Sub complies with all 
Laws and Orders applicable thereto, except for violations or 
failures so to comply, if any, that would not have a material 
adverse effect on the Business Condition of the Applicable SMR 
Business. Except as set forth in the Motorola Disclosure 
Statement, none of Motorola or any of its Subsidiaries has re-
ceived any written communication from a Governmental Authority 
that alleges that Motorola or any Subsidiary is not in com-
pliance with, or may be liable under, any such Law or Order in 
connection with the Applicable SMR Business other than in-
stances of alleged non-compliance or alleged liability that are 
not reasonably expected to have a material adverse effect on 
the Business Condition of the Applicable SMR Business.

(b) (i) Except as specifically set forth in the 
Motorola Disclosure Statement, Motorola and Motorola's Subsid-
iaries have duly secured all necessary Licenses and Authoriza-
tions from, and have filed all required registrations, applica-
tions, reports and any other documents with, the FCC, and, if 
applicable, any PUC and any other Governmental Authority exer-
cising jurisdiction over Motorola or any Subsidiary of Motorola 
with respect to the Applicable SMR Business. Such Licenses and 
Authorizations are valid and in full force and effect without 
materially adverse conditions except for such conditions as are 
generally applicable to holders of such Licenses and Authoriza-
tions. Except as set forth in the Motorola Disclosure State-
ment, and except systems under either a digital or wide area 
waiver, all loading requirements with respect to any SMR Li-
censes listed in the Motorola Disclosure Statement which are 
required to have been met as of the date hereof have been met, 
and Motorola and Motorola's Subsidiaries have taken every rea-
sonable action to cause the same to be loaded in compliance 
with FCC regulations and no material number of individual fre-
quencies will be cancelled by the FCC prior to the Closing Date 
for failure to meet such loading requirements. Motorola has 
heretofore provided the Company with a list of the analog SMR 
Channel frequencies which may be exposed to cancellation for 
failure to meet loading requirements.

(ii) Motorola and its Subsidiaries have not made any 
misstatements of fact, or omitted to disclose any fact, to any 
Governmental Authority, or taken or failed to take any action, 
which misstatements or omissions, actions or failures to act, 
individually or in the aggregate, subject any such Licenses to 
risk of revocation or failure to renew, except where the revo-
cation or failure to renew would not have a material adverse 
effect on the Business Condition of the Applicable SMR Busi-
ness. Neither Motorola, New Sub, ESMR Sub nor any Motorola SMR 

-95-

Subsidiary is subject to any Order or pending or, to the knowl-
edge of Motorola, New Sub, ESMR Sub or any Motorola SMR Subsid-
iary, threatened, Action which affects or would be expected to 
affect the validity of any Licenses held by it in connection 
with the Applicable SMR Business, or result in the revocation, 
termination, or adverse modification thereof, or impair the 
renewal thereof, except where the invalidity of any License or 
the revocation, termination, adverse modification or nonrenewal 
thereof would not have a material adverse effect on the Busi-
ness Condition of the Applicable SMR Business. No event has 
occurred and is continuing that could reasonably be expected to 
(A) result in the revocation, termination or adverse modifica-
tion of any License of Motorola or any Subsidiary of Motorola 
in connection with the Applicable SMR Business or (B) materi-
ally and adversely affect any rights of Motorola or any Subsid-
iary of Motorola thereunder, except where the occurrence or 
existence of any such event or effect described in the fore-
going clauses (A) or (B) would not have a material adverse 
effect on the Business Condition of the Applicable SMR Busi-
ness; neither Motorola nor any Subsidiary of Motorola has any 
reason to believe that any License of Motorola or any Subsid-
iary of Motorola used in the Applicable SMR Business will not 
be renewed in the ordinary course except where such nonrenewal 
would not have a material adverse effect on the Business Condi-
tion of the Applicable SMR Business.

(c) None of Motorola or any of its Subsidiaries has 
caused or taken any action that is reasonably expected to re-
sult in, and none of them is subject to, any material potential 
liability or obligation under any Environmental Law relating to 
(i) the environmental conditions on, under, or about any real 
property currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by 
Motorola or its Subsidiaries in connection with the Applicable 
SMR Business, including without limitation any contamination of 
soil or groundwater at such properties; or (ii) the past or 
present use, management, handling, transport, treatment, gen-
eration, storage, or release of any Hazardous Materials by

session under all such material leases under which it operates 
and all material structures and other improvements located on 
such real property reasonably necessary for the conduct of the 
Applicable SMR Business as presently conducted, or as proposed 
to be conducted, are in satisfactory operating condition and

tion of the Applicable SMR Business.

ment/Prospectus. None of the information to be supplied by 
Motorola for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the S-4

rial fact or omit to state any material fact required to be 
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements 
therein not misleading or (b) in the case of the Proxy State-
ment/Prospectus, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy State-
ment/Prospectus and at the time of the Stockholders Meeting,

Motorola, any of its Subsidiaries or the Applicable SMR Busi-
ness shall occur which is required to be described in the Proxy 
Statement/Prospectus or the S-4 Registration Statement (or in

spectus or the S-4 Registration Statement), Motorola shall no-
tify the Company thereof by reference to this Section 6.14 and

beneficial ownership of any shares of the capital stock of the 
Company and/or of New Sub or any securities that are converti-
ble into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of capital 
stock of the Company and/or of New Sub other than: (a) those 
Company Shares issuable under and pursuant to warrant[s] issued

Motorola) following the OneComm Merger and (c) 62,000,000 New 
Sub Shares (subject to certain adjustments as set forth in this

4.1(a)(i) and (ii), 4.1(b)(i) and (ii) and 4.1(c)(i) and (ii) 
hereof, (ii) were either (x) Motorola Owned Licenses or (y) 
Motorola McSMR's and have become Acquired SMR Licenses at or 
prior to the Closing or have been actually assigned to New Sub 
or ESMR Sub at or prior to the Closing and (iii) have not been 
revoked or forfeited prior to Closing and as to which the FCC 
has not denied approval for transfer, are referred to in this 
Section 6.16 as "Transferred Motorola SMR Licenses." Any other

or in conjunction with the Closing and having a transmitter 
location in the Applicable Geographic Areas, including Substi-
tute SMR Licenses are referred to in this Section 6.16 as

-102-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Motorola SMR Licenses together with the Transferred Non-
Motorola SMR Licenses are referred to herein as the "Trans-
ferred SMR Licenses." Except as set forth in the Motorola Dis-
closure Statement, the Transferred Motorola SMR Licenses to-
gether with all Motorola McSMRs to be assigned pursuant to 
Sections 4.1(a)(iii), 4.1(b)(iii) or 4.1(c)(iii) hereof include

March 31, 1994 and (B) all SMR Licenses in the Applicable 
OneComm Geographic Areas and the Applicable Dial Page Geo-
graphic Areas owned or managed by Motorola or its Controlled

graphic Areas as to which Motorola or any of its Controlled 
Affiliates (including New Sub) has since March 31, 1994 ac-
quired, or will prior to Closing acquire, ownership rights, in 
each case other than any such SMR Licenses which are lost or 
revoked prior to Closing or as to which the FCC has denied ap-
proval for transfer (and as to which losses or forfeitures, or 
denials of approvals for transfers, Motorola shall have 
promptly notified the Company in writing). Except as set forth 
in the Motorola Disclosure Statement, the Applicable SMR 
Business has been conducted by the Motorola Land Mobile Prod-
ucts Sector since January 1, 1992.

(b) Property Interests.

(i) Dedicated Sites Relating to Transferred 
Motorola SMR Licenses.

(A) Real Property Interests. The Contributed 
Assets include interests in all real property which (1) as 
of the date hereof is used by Motorola, or any of its Con-
trolled Affiliates (including New Sub) and (2) all real 
property acquired for use by Motorola or any Controlled 
Affiliate of Motorola (including New Sub) prior to Clos-
ing, in each case as an antenna or equipment site solely 
in connection with the Transferred Motorola SMR Licenses 
(a "Dedicated Site"). In the case of such real property 
interests which were or will as of Closing be owned in 
fee, the Contributed Assets include fee interests in such 
real property and all fixtures and improvements thereon 
which are necessary to permit New Sub to carry on the Ap-
plicable SMR Business. In the case of such real property 
interests which are, or will as of Closing be, leased by 
Motorola or a Controlled Affiliate of Motorola (including 
New Sub) from a third party, the Contributed Assets in-
cluded an assignment of Motorola's rights therein to New 
Sub (subject to all the terms of any such lease including, 
without limitation, any condition or restriction on the 

-103-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

assignment thereof, and Motorola shall cooperate in at-
tempting to obtain any required consent of the landlord to 
such assignment or, if such consent cannot be obtained, 
Motorola shall sublease such leasehold interests to the 
extent permitted under the lease therefor). 

(B) Equipment Relating to Dedicated Sites. The 
Contributed Assets include all controllers, base station 
transmitters, RIB's, TRIB's, RAS 1100 alarms, MBX's, com-
biners, receivers, multicouplers, connectors, plugs and 
filters, cable, racks and brackets and other site related 
hardware used by Motorola or any of its Controlled 
Affiliates (including New Sub) in connection with each 
Transferred Motorola SMR License at a Dedicated Site but 
do not include repeaters for Motorola McSMRs which are not 
or do not become Acquired SMR Licenses, which repeaters 
are owned by the licensee under such McSMR.

(ii) Multiple Use Sites Relating to Transferred 
Motorola SMR Licenses.

(A) Real Property Interests. The Contributed 
Assets include (1) leasehold interests in all real 
property which as of the date hereof is used both (x) 
by Motorola or Controlled Affiliate of Motorola (in-
cluding New Sub) in connection with a Transferred 
Motorola SMR License and (y) in connection with other 
aspects of Motorola's business and (2) leasehold in-
terests acquired by Motorola or any Controlled Af-
filiate of Motorola (including New Sub) prior to 
Closing and so used both in connection with a Trans-
ferred Motorola License and other aspects of 
Motorola's business (a "Multiple Use Site"). Each 
such lease or sublease runs from Motorola or a 
Motorola Subsidiary to New Sub and will enable New 
Sub to continue to use such property as an SMR site 
in connection with the Transferred Motorola SMR Li-
cense upon the terms and subject to the conditions 
thereof. Each such lease or sublease between 
Motorola or a Motorola Subsidiary and New Sub is on 
Motorola's customary terms and conditions, with rent 
and other terms which are no less favorable to New 
Sub than for other lessees or sublessees on the par-
ticular site.

(B) Equipment Relating to Multiple Use Sites. 
The Contributed Assets include (1) all controllers, 
base station transmitters, RIB's, TRIB's, RAS 1100 
alarms, and MBX's used by Motorola or any of its 

-104-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Controlled Affiliates (including New Sub) in connec-
tion with each Transferred Motorola SMR License at a 
Multiple Use Site and (2) leases providing for the 
use of shared equipment including all combiners, re-
ceivers, multicouplers, connectors, plugs and fil-
ters, cable, racks and brackets used by Motorola's 
antenna site business or any of its Controlled 
Affiliates (including New Sub) in connection with 
each Transferred Motorola SMR License at a Multiple 
Use Site but do not include repeaters for Motorola 
McSMRs which are not or do not become Acquired SMR 
Licenses, which repeaters are owned by the licensee 
under such Motorola McSMR.

(iii) Property Relating to Transferred Non-
Motorola Licenses. The Contributed Assets include rights 
to acquire (A) ownership of, or leasehold interests in, 
real property constituting the site for each Transferred 
Non-Motorola License and (B) ownership of controllers, 
base station transmitters, RIB's, TRIB's, RAS 1100 alarms 
and MBX's for each such site and (C) ownership of, or 
leasehold interests in, combiners, receivers, multi-
couplers, connectors, plugs and filters, cable and racks 
and brackets, in each case used in connection with each 
Transferred Non-Motorola License. All such rights will be 
held by New Sub at Closing and neither Motorola nor any 
Controlled Affiliate of Motorola, other than New Sub, will 
have any such rights to acquire such ownership or lease-
hold interests from and after the Closing.

(iv) Customer Contracts. Subject to Section 
7.11(j) hereof, the contracts assumed pursuant to Section 
4.2 include all right, title and interest of Motorola and/
or any Controlled Affiliate of Motorola in and to all con-
tracts and agreements between Motorola or any Motorola SMR 
Subsidiary and any customer which is a user of a Trans-
ferred Motorola SMR License.

6.17. Bulk Sales. Either (a) the contribution of 
the Applicable SMR Assets to New Sub was not and will not be 
subject to any bulk sales statutes or similar Laws of any 
Governmental Authority within the Applicable Geographic Areas 
or (b) the Company waives compliance by Motorola with such laws 
in consideration of Motorola's agreeing hereby to indemnify and 
hold harmless the Company (and after the Closing, New Sub) from 
and against any and all liabilities which may be asserted by 
third parties against the Company and/or New Sub as a result of 
such non-compliance.

sure Statement contains an accurate and complete listing of all 
material contracts and agreements which have been assigned to, 
entered into or assumed by, New Sub, or to which New Sub is a 
party, relating to the Applicable SMR Business and to which 
Motorola or any Affiliate of Motorola is a party or is other-
wise bound (the "Affiliate Contracts").

sentatives, agents or Affiliates will, directly or indirectly, 
encourage, solicit or, except as required by law to permit the

with respect to any transaction of the type referred to in the

tions or discussions that are sought to be initiated with, the 
Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Nothing contained in this 
Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Company's Board of

the Company) concerning any merger, consolidation, sale of as-
sets or other transaction involving the transfer of ownership

that this representation shall not apply to New Sub Shares to 
be received by Motorola hereunder which may be transferred in 
accordance with Section 7.14 hereof). Motorola will notify the 
Company immediately of any inquiries or proposals with respect 
to any such transaction that are received by, or any such nego-
tiations or discussions that are sought to be initiated with, 
Motorola.

7.3. Meeting of Stockholders. (a) The Company will 
take all action necessary in accordance with applicable law and 
its Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws to convene a meet-
ing of its stockholders (the "Stockholders Meeting") as prompt-
ly as practicable to consider and vote upon the approval of the 
Nextel Merger and any other aspect of the transactions contem-
plated herein that require approval by vote of the Company's 
stockholders. Subject to the Company Fairness Opinion having 
been issued and not withdrawn or otherwise adversely modified, 
and to the fiduciary duties of the Company's Board of Directors 
under applicable law, the Board of Directors of the Company 
shall recommend and declare advisable such approval and the 
Company shall take all lawful action to solicit, and use all 
reasonable efforts to obtain, such approval.

7.4. Registration Statement. New Sub will, as 
promptly as practicable, prepare and file with the SEC a regis-
tration statement on Form S-4 (the "S-4 Registration State-
ment"), containing a proxy statement/prospectus, in connection 
with the registration under the Securities Act of the shares of 
New Sub Class A Common Stock and New Sub Class B Common Stock 
(a) issuable upon conversion of the shares of Company Class A 
Common Stock and Company Class B Common Stock in the Nextel 
Merger or (b) if so requested by Motorola, to be issued to 
Motorola and the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries in connection with 
the recapitalization of New Sub contemplated by Section 2.2(a) 
hereof. The Company shall be responsible for the payment of 
all registration fees relating to the New Sub Shares to be reg-
istered in accordance with clauses (a) of the preceding sen-
tence and Motorola shall be responsible for the payment of all 
registration fees relating to the New Sub Shares to be regis-
tered in accordance with clause (b) of the preceding sentence. 
The Company will, as promptly as practicable, prepare and file 
with the SEC a proxy statement that will be the same proxy 

-108-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

statement/prospectus contained in the S-4 Registration State-
ment and a form of proxy, in connection with the vote of the 
Company's stockholders with respect to the Nextel Merger (such 
proxy statement/prospectus, together with any amendments 
thereof or supplements thereto, in each case in the form or 
forms mailed to the Company's stockholders, is herein called 
the "Proxy Statement/Prospectus"). The Company, Motorola and 
New Sub will use all reasonable efforts to have, or cause, the 
S-4 Registration Statement to be declared effective as promptly 
as practicable, and also will take any other action required to 
be taken under federal or state securities laws, and the Com-
pany will use all reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy 
Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to stockholders of the Com-
pany at the earliest practicable date.

7.5. Reasonable Efforts. The Company, New Sub and 
Motorola shall and shall use all reasonable efforts to cause 
their respective Subsidiaries to: (i) promptly make all fil-
ings and seek to obtain all Authorizations required under all 
applicable Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated 
hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements and will cooperate with 
each other in all reasonable respects with respect thereto; 
(ii) use all reasonable efforts to promptly take, or cause to 
be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all 
other things necessary, proper or appropriate to satisfy the 
conditions set forth in Article VIII and to consummate and make 
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and 
by the Ancillary Agreements on the terms and conditions set 
forth herein and therein as soon as practicable (including 
seeking to remove promptly any injunction or other legal bar-
rier that may prevent such consummation); and (iii) subject to 
the fiduciary obligations of the Board of Directors of each of 
the respective parties, not take any action (including, without 
limitation, effecting or agreeing to effect or announcing an 
intention or proposal to effect, any acquisition, business com-
bination or other transaction) which would reasonably be ex-
pected to impair the ability of the parties to consummate the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the earliest 
practicable time including, without limitation, any action 
which would impair efforts to secure any required Authoriza-
tions for such transactions (regardless of whether such action 
would otherwise be permitted or not prohibited hereunder); pro-
vided, that the foregoing provisions of this Section 7.5 shall 
not (A) prevent the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, 
from taking any action reasonably necessary or appropriate to 
consummate any of the Currently Announced Transactions or (B) 
prevent the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or 
Motorola or any Subsidiary of Motorola, from taking any action 
reasonably required to comply with Law or to comply with or 
fulfill any contractual obligation of such party (in the case 

-109-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

of such contractual obligations, to the extent in existence as 
of the date hereof); and provided further, that in connection 
with any filing or submission required or action to be taken by 
the Company, New Sub or Motorola or any of their Subsidiaries 
to obtain any Authorization or otherwise to effect the trans-
actions contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements, 
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor Motorola 
nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to divest or hold 
separate or otherwise take or commit to take any action that 
limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to 
retain, (A) any material portion of the assets or existing (as 
of the date hereof) businesses or product lines of the Company 
or, in the case of Motorola, the Applicable SMR Business or (B) 
any of the New Sub Shares, and, finally, provided, that the 
Company acknowledges that the restriction in clause (iii) ap-
plies to Motorola only insofar as Motorola takes any action 
involving the Applicable SMR Business-Nextel Territory or SMR 
Licenses in the Applicable Nextel Geographic Areas.

7.6. Access to Information. (a) Subject to cur-
rently existing contractual and legal restrictions applicable 
to the Company or to Motorola (which the Company and Motorola 
are seeking in good faith to remove) and upon reasonable no-
tice, each of the Company and Motorola shall (and shall cause 
each of its Subsidiaries to) afford to officers, employees, 
counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives of 
the other party ("Respective Representatives") access, during 
normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effec-
tive Time to its properties, books and records (including, 
without limitation, the work papers of independent accountants) 
(in the case of Motorola, only insofar as such properties, 
books and records relate to the Applicable SMR Business and/or 
any of the Contributed Assets) and, during such period, shall 
(and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly 
to such Respective Representatives all information concerning 
its business, properties and personnel (in the case of 
Motorola, only insofar as such information relates to the Ap-
plicable SMR Business and/or any of the Contributed Assets) as 
may reasonably be requested, provided that no investigation 
pursuant to this Section 7.6 shall affect or be deemed to 
modify any of the respective representations or warranties made 
by the Company or Motorola. Each of the Company and Motorola 
agrees that it will not, and will cause its Respective Repre-
sentatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to 
this Section 7.6 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation 
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, 
that from and after the Closing, New Sub shall be under no fur-
ther restrictions regarding any information relating to the 
Applicable SMR Business and/or any of the Contributed Assets, 

-110-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

and Motorola shall not, and shall cause its respective Repre-
sentatives not to, use or otherwise disclose any information 
relating to the Applicable SMR Business and/or any of the Con-
tributed Assets for any purpose unrelated to the consummation 
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Subject to the requirements of law, each party 
hereto will keep confidential, and will cause its Respective 
Representatives to keep confidential, all information and docu-
ments obtained pursuant to this Section 7.6 except as otherwise 
consented to by the other party; provided, however, that nei-
ther the Company nor Motorola shall be precluded from making 
any disclosure which (based on advice of counsel) it deems re-
quired by law in connection with the transactions contemplated 
by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements. In the event 
any party is required to disclose any information or documents 
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, such party 
shall promptly give written notice of such disclosure that is 
proposed to be made to the other party so that the parties can 
work together to limit the disclosure to the greatest extent 
possible and, in the event that either party is legally com-
pelled to disclose any information, to seek a protective order 
or other appropriate remedy or both. Upon any termination of 
this Agreement, each of the Company and Motorola will collect 
and deliver to the other party all documents obtained pursuant 
to this Section 7.6 or otherwise from such party or its Respec-
tive Representatives by it or any of its Respective Representa-
tives then in their possession and any copies thereof. All 
requests for access to the Company or Motorola and their Sub-
sidiaries pursuant to this Section 7.6 shall be made through 
their Respective Representatives named in the Motorola Disclo-
sure Statement or the Company Disclosure Statement, as the case 
may be.

(c) Prior to the Closing, to the extent Motorola has 
knowledge of an event or circumstance which would constitute a 
breach of the representations set forth in Sections 6.6, 6.9(a) 
and (b), or 6.10(d) hereof but for the fact that such represen-
tations are qualified as to materiality, Motorola shall inform 
the Company of such events or circumstances it being understood 
that a breach by Motorola of this covenant will not create any 
right on the part of the Company not to close the transactions 
hereunder, or to any indemnity pursuant to Article X hereunder, 
but rather is only intended to assist the Company in planning 
with respect to the intended operation of the Applicable SMR 
Business from and after the Closing.

7.7. Treatment of Options, Warrants and Other Obli-
gations. (a) Each outstanding option to purchase Company 
Shares (each, an "Option") issued pursuant to the Company's 

-111-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

stock option plans set forth in the Company SEC Reports (col-
lectively, the "Company Stock Option Plans"), whether or not 
vested or exercisable, shall be assumed by New Sub and shall 
constitute an option to acquire, on the same terms and condi-
tions as were applicable under such assumed Option, a number of 
shares of New Sub Class A Common Stock or New Sub Class B Com-
mon Stock, as the case may be, equal to the number of shares of 
Company Class A Common Stock or Company Class B Common Stock, 
as the case may be, subject to such Option. In furtherance of 
the foregoing:

(i) From and after the Effective Time, the out-
standing option agreements shall, without any further 
action on the part of any Option holder, be deemed to rep-
resent the right to acquire shares of New Sub Class A Com-
mon Stock or New Sub Class B Common Stock, as the case may 
be, on the same terms and conditions as contained in the 
outstanding Options. New Sub shall comply with the terms 
of the Company Stock Option Plans as they apply to the 
Options assumed as set forth above.

(ii) New Sub shall take all corporate action 
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of 
shares of New Sub Class A Common Stock and New Sub Class B 
Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Options 
assumed in accordance with this Section 7.7. New Sub 
shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any 
successor form) or another appropriate form, effective as 
of the Effective Time, with respect to shares of New Sub 
Class A Common Stock and New Sub Class B Common Stock sub-
ject to such Options and shall use all reasonable efforts 
to maintain the effectiveness of such registration state-
ment or registration statements (and maintain the current 
status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained there-
in) for so long as such Options remain outstanding. With 
respect to those individuals who subsequent to the Nextel 
Merger will be subject to the reporting requirements under 
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, New Sub shall adminis-
ter the Company Stock Option Plans assumed pursuant to 
this Section 7.7 in a manner that complies with Rule 16b-3 
promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent the 
applicable Company Stock Option Plan complied with such 
rule prior to the Nextel Merger.

(b) Effective as of the Effective Time, pursuant to 
the terms of the agreements governing the Outstanding Company 
Warrants, New Sub shall assume all of the rights and obliga-
tions of the Company under all such warrant agreements and the 
parties hereto shall each take such action as may be necessary 
to enable each holder of such an Outstanding Company Warrant, 

-112-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

on and after the Effective Time, to exercise such warrant, sub-
ject to the terms and provisions thereof, for such number of 
shares of New Sub Class A Common Stock or New Sub Class B 
Common Stock which such holder would have been entitled to 
receive had such holder exercised such warrant and thereby re-
ceived shares of Company Class A Common Stock or Company Class 
B Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time includ-
ing, without limitation, the entry into a supplemental agree-
ment with each holder whereby New Sub assumes the due and punc-
tual performance and observance of each and every covenant and 
condition of the warrant agreement theretofore to be performed 
and observed by the Company.

(c) Effective as of the Effective Time, each supple-
mental indenture necessary to permit the Nextel Merger to be 
accomplished in compliance with the provisions of any inden-
tures (i) to which the Company is a party on the date hereof or 
(ii) to which the Company or its Subsidiaries become a party as 
a result of a Currently Announced Transaction shall have been 
executed by the Company and New Sub and the Company and/or New 
Sub, as appropriate, shall take or cause to be taken all other 
actions as the provisions of the relevant indentures may re-
quire in connection with such supplemental indentures in con-
nection with the Nextel Merger (it being understood that, in 
any such case, none of Motorola or any Affiliate of Motorola 
other than New Sub (or any Subsidiary of New Sub) shall have 
any obligation with respect to any such supplemental inden-
ture).

7.8. Registration and Listing of New Sub Shares. 
(a) Subject to Section 7.4 hereof, New Sub will use all rea-
sonable efforts to register the New Sub Shares to be issued (i) 
in connection with the consummation of the Nextel Merger (the 
"Merger Issuance") pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) subject to 
Motorola's payment of the applicable registration fees as pro-
vided in Section 7.4(b), to Motorola and the Motorola SMR Sub-
sidiaries in connection with the recapitalization contemplated 
by Section 2.2(a) hereof, (iii) upon exercise of Options 
granted to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and 
(iv) (to the extent the Company currently is obligated to do so 
pursuant to the terms of Outstanding Company Warrants) upon 
exercise of Outstanding Company Warrants, under the applicable 
provisions of the Securities Act.

(b) New Sub will use all reasonable efforts to cause 
the New Sub Shares issued pursuant to an effective registration 
statement under the applicable provisions of the Securities 
Act, as contemplated in Section 7.8(a), to be listed for trad-
ing on NASDAQ.

7.9. Right to Nominate a Director of New Sub. (a) 
The Company will take all actions reasonably within its power 
to provide that upon the fifth business day after the Closing, 
and thereafter subject only to the limitations set forth 
herein, the New Sub Board of Directors shall include one member 
who is designated by Motorola so long as Motorola owns 5% of 
the outstanding New Sub Shares. From and after the Closing, at 
each annual or special meeting of stockholders for the election 
of directors at which the director so designated by Motorola is 
up for election, so long as Motorola owns 5% of the outstanding 
New Sub Shares, Motorola shall be entitled to propose to the 
Board of Directors or the Nominating Committee of New Sub a 
nominee for election to such Board (the "Motorola Nominee"). 
New Sub shall cause such Motorola Nominee to be included in the 
slate of nominees recommended by such Board to the New Sub 
stockholders for election as a director at such annual or spe-
cial meeting of stockholders and shall use all reasonable ef-
forts to cause the election of such Motorola Nominee, including 
soliciting proxies in favor of the election of such person. In 
the event that any Motorola Nominee shall cease to serve as a 
director of New Sub for any reason (so long as Motorola is then 
entitled, in accordance with this Section 7.9, to propose a 
Motorola Nominee), the resulting vacancy shall be filled by the 
New Sub Board with a substitute individual nominated by 
Motorola. Each Motorola Nominee, regardless of whether to be 
appointed or elected, shall be reasonably satisfactory to New 
Sub. Should Motorola cease to own 5% of the outstanding New 
Sub Shares, Motorola shall cause the Motorola Nominee to resign 
from the New Sub Board of Directors promptly following a re-
quest to do so from New Sub. For purposes of this Article VII, 
Motorola shall be deemed to "own" New Sub Shares only if (i) 
Motorola is the "beneficial owner" of such New Sub Shares (as 
defined in Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) and (ii) such New 
Sub Shares are not subject to a definitive agreement providing 
for their Transfer (as defined in Section 7.14 hereof) to a 
Person which is not a Controlled Affiliate of Motorola, and 
(iii) such New Sub Shares were initially acquired by Motorola 
and the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries pursuant to or as contem-
plated by Article II of this Agreement, pursuant to the exer-
cise of antidilutive rights set forth in Section 7.13 or upon 
exercise of the warrants held by Motorola or its Subsidiaries 
as of the date hereof.

(b) If Motorola sells (in compliance with the appli-
cable provisions hereof relating to Transfers of New Sub 
Shares) New Sub Shares representing at least 5% of the then 
outstanding New Sub Shares to any one Person that is not a Con-
trolled Affiliate of Motorola, and prior to such transfer (and 
prior to seeking New Sub's consent to such transfer, if such 
consent is required) advises New Sub in writing that Motorola 

-114-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

intends that such Person be designated the "Motorola Trans-
feree", and New Sub consents to such Person's designation as 
the Motorola Transferee (which consent will not be unreasonably 
withheld and shall, in any event, include those Persons hereto-
fore approved pursuant to Section 7.14(a)(ii) hereof), then in 
addition to the rights held by Motorola pursuant to subpara-
graph (a), such Motorola Transferee shall have the right to 
cause the size of the New Sub Board of Directors to be in-
creased and to nominate one person to the New Sub Board in 
accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection (a) of 
this Section 7.9; and subject to the same agreements and con-
ditions as applicable to Motorola contained in Section 7.9(a); 
provided, however, that this subsection (b) shall apply to only 
one such Motorola Transferee.

7.10. Tax Matters. (a) Each party agrees to report 
(i) the Nextel Merger as a reorganization within the meaning of 
Section 368 of the Code and (ii) the Nextel Merger and the con-
tribution of assets by Motorola contemplated by Articles II and 
IV hereof as an overall transaction described in Section 351 of 
the Code, in each case, on all tax returns and other filings.

(b) Motorola shall pay and be solely liable for any 
and all sales, use and transfer taxes, including any interest 
or penalty, assessed against Motorola or any of its Subsidiar-
ies (including New Sub) as a result of the transactions contem-
plated by this Agreement, other than any stock transfer taxes 
that may be imposed on the issuance of New Sub Shares in the 
Nextel Merger or the OneComm Merger, which New Sub shall pay 
and be solely liable for from and after the Effective Time.

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company will provide 
Motorola with a list of stockholders which will be 5% Holders. 
At Closing, each such 5% Holder shall execute and deliver a 
certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit I hereto (the 
"Continuity of Interest Statement") and shall, by executing 
such certificate, represent and warrant that such party has no 
present plan or intention to Transfer any of the New Sub Shares 
to be received by such 5% Holder in the Merger, or the Stock 
Issuance other than to another Participant (as defined below). 
For purposes of this paragraph 7.10(c), a Participant shall 
mean a transferor of property or stock to New Sub in the trans-
actions described in Articles II, III and IV hereof in exchange 
for New Sub Shares constituting at least 5% of the outstanding 
New Sub Class A Common Stock or the New Sub Class B Common 
Stock immediately following the Closing. 

7.11. Other Post-Closing Actions. (a) New Sub will 
negotiate in good faith a roaming agreement with certain other 

-115-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

SMR operators (with respect to Digital Mobile Systems or net-
works located within the United States of America) which use 
MIRS equipment including, without limitation, Motorola (outside 
the Applicable Geographic Areas) and Dial Page.

(b) Motorola and New Sub intend to pursue, at an 
appropriate time in the future, a data business over SMR fre-
quencies and anticipate that either New Sub or a Subsidiary of 
New Sub would establish a Subsidiary for such purpose and make 
air time available for data transmissions at commercially rea-
sonable rates.

(c) In an effort to minimize disruption to custom-
ers, Motorola and New Sub intend to adopt a plan for the or-
derly migration of existing analog dispatch customers.

(d) New Sub will, in good faith, negotiate agree-
ments with the subscriber equipment dealers set forth in a list 
to be provided by Motorola prior to Closing. Such agreements 
shall include terms which are comparable to those offered to 
the Company's existing dealers.

(e) Motorola agrees that, for a period of three 
years after the Closing Date, and except with respect to SMR 
Licenses which are Motorola Owned Licenses or Motorola McSMRS 
but are not transferred or assigned to the Company, the 
Motorola Land Mobile Products Sector will not make use of the 
Customer List to solicit subscribers for any 800 MHz SMR com-
mercial mobile voice business owned or managed by the Motorola 
Land Mobile Products Sector in the Applicable Geographic Areas, 
nor will it divulge such Customer List to any other division of 
Motorola or any other person; provided, however, that notwith-
standing the foregoing nothing in the provisions of this Sec-
tion 7.11(e) shall restrict or prohibit (A) the Motorola Land 
Mobile Products Sector or any other division or organization of 
Motorola from soliciting any customer on the Customer List for 
subscriber, infrastructure or other equipment sales or mainte-
nance services; (B) subject to Section 7.11(f) hereof, the 
Motorola Land Mobile Products Sector or any other division or 
organization of Motorola from continuing to provide 900 MHz SMR 
service to any such customer or from soliciting any such cus-
tomer for 900 MHz SMR service; (C) any independent Motorola 
dealer from soliciting any such customer for service on any SMR 
system, whether owned or managed by Motorola so long as such 
dealer independently identifies such customer; or (D) the 
Motorola Land Mobile Products Sector or any other division or 
organization of Motorola or any independent Motorola dealer 
from soliciting any customer on the Customer List for any wire-
less communication or other service so long as the identity or 

-116-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

any other information concerning such customer is independently 
developed.

(f) Prior to the Closing, Motorola and the Company 
shall negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually acceptable 
arrangement to take such actions with respect to their owned 
and managed 900 MHz channels in the Applicable Geographic Areas 
as are necessary to secure the Authorizations required for the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, it being the in-
tention that the Company and Motorola share ratably (based on 
such factors as they may agree upon) in the benefits and bur-
dens of such arrangements. To the extent that Motorola retains 
owned and/or managed 900 MHz channels in the Applicable Nextel 
Geographic Area at the Closing, Motorola and the Company will 
negotiate in good faith to enter into management agreements as 
promptly as practicable following the Closing pursuant to which 
the Company or New Sub or its designee shall have the right and 
obligation to manage Motorola's remaining owned and managed 900 
MHz channels in the Applicable Nextel Geographic Area for a 
period of three years after the Closing Date. Such 900 MHz 
management arrangements shall be renewable for subsequent 
periods of two years unless terminated at any time during the 
renewal period by Motorola upon six months' notice. Motorola 
shall have the right to cancel any 900 MHz management arrange-
ment prior to its three year expiration to enable Motorola or a 
transferee to use such channels for new services or technology 
such as channels for campus dispatch systems and other busi-
nesses which are not competitive with New Sub's traditional 
analog dispatch SMR business and/or enhanced Digital Mobile SMR 
systems.

(g) So long as Motorola shall own at least 5% of the 
outstanding New Sub Shares, Motorola shall have the right, dur-
ing normal business hours and upon not less than seven (7) days 
written notice, to inspect books and records of New Sub, in-
cluding but not limited to accounting books and records and New 
Sub shall make available to Motorola for discussion of the 
business, financial condition and prospects of New Sub as 
Motorola deems pertinent to its shareholding in New Sub, per-
sonnel of New Sub who are familiar with such matters for New 
Sub. New Sub shall also permit the Motorola Nominee to meet 
with and discuss such matters with the independent accountants 
and auditors of New Sub on as favorable terms and conditions as 
those applied to any other Board Members of New Sub.

(h) Upon the Closing and quarterly thereafter 
through the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Motorola 
shall identify in writing to New Sub which of the Motorola 
McSMRs which were to have been assigned to New Sub pursuant to 
Sections 4.1(a)(iii), 4.1(b)(iii) and 4.1(c)(iii) hereof (that 

-117-

have not subsequently become Acquired SMR Licenses) Motorola 
does not intend to arrange for New Sub to acquire (the "Non-
Targeted McSMRs"). During such period, neither New Sub nor its 
Controlled Affiliates shall, independently of Motorola, attempt 
to acquire any Motorola McSMR other than the Non-Targeted 
McSMRs. New Sub may request Motorola or the applicable 
Motorola SMR Subsidiaries to execute and deliver to New Sub 
such documents as are necessary to effect the waiver and 
termination by Motorola or the applicable Motorola SMR Sub-
sidiaries of all management rights, rights of first refusal and 
any and all other rights of any nature whatsoever held by them 
with respect to the Non-Targeted McSMRs that are acquired by 
New Sub or its Controlled Affiliates, or owned by any other 
third party (to the extent New Sub consummates the purchase 
thereof within six months of the date of such waiver request 
and effective only upon such consummation) (it being understood 
that such waivers and terminations shall (i) be effective only 
to the extent that the licensee of such Motorola McSMR 
similarly agrees to terminate such agreements and that the 
documents to be executed by Motorola and/or the Motorola SMR 
Subsidiaries shall be substantially in the form of the 
Management Termination Agreements attached hereto as Exhibit E 
and (ii) be subject to the provisions of Section 7.11(j) 
hereof). 

(i) In connection with a proposed private sale of 
New Sub Shares by Motorola, upon the written request of 
Motorola which shall include a representation that Motorola has 
a good faith intention to negotiate a definitive agreement with 
the proposed transferee for such proposed sale, New Sub shall 
afford such proposed transferee in accordance with Section 
7.14(a)(ii) access to information of the type contemplated by 
Section 7.6(a) hereof, subject to the confidentiality require-
ments contemplated by Section 7.6(b) hereof and subject to a 
written acknowledgment of such transferee that New Sub has pro-
vided such information subject to the express understanding 
that such transferee is not relying on the accuracy, complete-
ness or currency of any of such information in making any in-
vestment decision with regard to New Sub Shares and that New 
Sub shall have absolutely no liability or obligation of any 
type whatsoever to such transferee by reason of providing such 
access to such information.

(j) With respect to sites at which the Company or 
OneComm owns or has agreed to acquire one or more SMR Licenses 
which are, or will prior to Closing be, operated on a control-
ler shared with, a licensee under a Motorola McSMR, or a Person 
which is not an Affiliate of the Company or OneComm to which 
Motorola intends to transfer one or more SMR Licenses, prior to 
the Closing, the Company (and OneComm to the extent the OneComm 

-118-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Merger has occurred) will enter into agreements providing for, 
among other things, (i) an equitable allocation (as between the 
Company or OneComm on the one hand and the licensee or trans-
feree, on the other hand) sharing the controller) of the cus-
tomers being provided service as of the Closing Date on such 
controller and (ii) the installation by Motorola (at Motorola's 
expense) of a second controller at each such site.

(k) In connection with the provision of transition 
services to the Company after the Closing Motorola shall (i) 
provide the Company with access to billing and customer care 
records of Motorola for two months prior to Closing; (ii) pro-
vide billing and customer care services for a period of up to 
six months following the Closing until New Sub is ready to 
assume such responsibilities; (iii) negotiate in good faith to 
provide for an orderly transition of system maintenance respon-
sibilities and to reach an agreement regarding maintenance ser-
vices to be provided by Motorola to New Sub subsequent to the 
Closing; (iv) negotiate in good faith revised site lease agree-
ments with respect to Motorola owned sites which shall provide 
that (A) if any such lease is currently scheduled to expire 
prior to December 31, 1995, it shall be extended until then, 
(B) all such leases shall be cancellable on three months' 
notice (by the Company prior to December 31, 1995 and by the 
Company and Motorola thereafter) and (C) New Sub shall have the 
benefit during the term of such leases of a 10% discount from 
the prevailing rate in the market for each such site, with 
price increases limited to the CPI and (v) identify employees 
of Motorola who will serve as primary contacts with the Company 
(and New Sub after the Closing) in connection with questions 
with respect to transition services.

(l) The Company will negotiate in good faith with 
Racotek, Inc. ("Racotek") to provide for a nationwide reseller 
arrangement to sell air time to Racotek for resale by Racotek 
to end users on New Sub's SMR systems and ESMR systems for data 
and voice transmission in conjunction with the use of Racotek 
products and Racotek software.

7.12. Limitation on Certain Actions. Until the 
third anniversary of the Closing Date, except as specifically 
contemplated by this Agreement, Motorola agrees that it shall 
not, directly or indirectly, and shall cause any Person con-
trolled by it not to except as authorized in advance in the 
specific case by the Board of Directors of New Sub by the af-
firmative vote of not less than a majority of the directors 
then in office, acquire, or offer to acquire, by purchase, any 
New Sub Shares or any interest therein (or any other equity 
security of New Sub or any direct or indirect rights or options 
to acquire any New Sub Shares or any other equity securities of 
New Sub), if such acquisition would result in the ownership by 
Motorola of in excess of a percentage of the Fully Diluted 

-119-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Shares as of such date equal to the percentage of the Fully 
Diluted Shares owned immediately following the Closing Date 
(taking into account the warrant to purchase Company Shares 
currently owned by Motorola); it being understood that any New 
Sub Shares which Motorola may be "deemed" to acquire by virtue 
of having filed a Schedule 13D as a "group" (as such term is 
used in Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act) with another stock-
holder of New Sub shall not be considered "acquired" for pur-
poses of this Section 7.12; provided, that, from the date 
hereof until the third anniversary of the Closing, Motorola 
shall not (and shall cause its Controlled Affiliates not to) be 
or become a member of any "group," to the extent that the 
existence of, or any actions taken or proposed to be taken by, 
such group (including Motorola and/or its Controlled Affili-
ates) would result in a "Change of Control" (as such term is 
defined in any of the Relevant Indentures on the date hereof). 
The term "Relevant Indentures," for purposes of this Section 
7.12, means any indenture to which the Company or New Sub now 
is or becomes, in connection with consummation of a Currently 
Announced Transaction, a party, or by which either of them now 
is, or becomes in connection with a Currently Announced Trans-
action, otherwise bound. It is expressly understood and agreed 
that the covenants in this Section 7.12 are for the sole and 
exclusive benefit of the Company and New Sub (including their 
successors and assigns as expressly contemplated in Section 
11.5 hereof), and is not intended for the benefit of and shall 
not be enforceable by, any other Person including, without lim-
itation, any stockholder or creditor of the Company or New Sub.

7.13. Anti-Dilutive Right. (a) From the date here-
of until the third anniversary of the Closing Date, in the 
event of any proposed public or private issuances (a "Proposed 
Issuance") of shares of (i) New Sub Class A Common Stock, (ii) 
New Sub Class B Common Stock or (iii) any other capital stock 
of New Sub or any other security convertible into or exercis-
able for New Sub Class A Common Stock, New Sub Class B Common 
Stock or other capital stock of New Sub (it being understood 
that, for purposes of this Section 7.13, public or private is-
suances of Company Class A Common Stock, Company Class B Common 
Stock or any other capital stock of the Company or any other 
security convertible into or exercisable for Company Class A 
Common Stock, Company Class B Common Stock or other capital 
stock of the Company occurring from the date hereof until the 
Closing Date ("Interim Proposed Issuances") shall be deemed to 
be issuances of an identical number and type of capital stock 
or other security of New Sub into which the shares or other 
securities issued in such Interim Proposed Issuance would be 
converted upon consummation of the Nextel Merger as contem-
plated herein) (excluding issuances of shares of New Sub Class 
A Common Stock (A) upon conversion of New Sub Class B Common 
Stock, (B) in connection with the Currently Announced Trans-
actions or (C) upon exercise of Outstanding Company Warrants 

-120-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

and Options outstanding as of the date hereof (or any options 
or warrants issued in replacement or substitution thereof 
("Replacement Options or Warrants") so long as the exercise of 
such Replacement Options or Warrants will not result in the 
issuance of a greater number of New Sub Shares or the payment 
per share of a lesser amount of consideration for the issuance 
of New Sub Shares; provided that non-cash payments made in 
accordance with "cashless exercise" procedures in substance and 
operation comparable in all material respects to the "cashless 
exercise" procedures contained in the Company's Incentive 
Equity Plan on the date hereof shall not be deemed such "lesser 
amount" and (D) issuances approved by the Company's Board of 
Directors until the Closing Date and by New Sub's Board of 
Directors on or after the Closing Date, in either case pursuant 
to employee stock option plans, restricted stock plans and 
similar arrangements (the excluded issuances in clauses (A) 
through (D) being referred to as "Excluded Issuances")) the 
Company (in the case of all Interim Proposed Issuances) or New 
Sub (in the case of all other Proposed Issuances) shall send 
written notice thereof to Motorola not less than forty-five 
(45) days prior to such Interim Proposed Issuance or Proposed 
Issuance, as the case may be, which notice shall set forth all 
material terms of the Interim Proposed Issuance or Proposed 
Issuance, as the case may be, including, without limitation, 
the manner of sale, the per share sale price or the amount and 
type of other consideration to be received by the Company or 
New Sub, as the case may be.

(b) Motorola shall have the right, by sending irre-
vocable written notice thereof to the Company or New Sub, as 
the case may be, within twenty (20) days after receipt of the 
Company's or New Sub's notice, to purchase at the same price 
sold to the public or in the private issuance or, if the sale 
is not for cash, at the fair market value of the property or 
other consideration received by the Company or New Sub (as de-
termined by an independent third party appraiser selected by 
Comcast and reasonably acceptable to Motorola (or by Motorola, 
if none is selected by Comcast), it being understood that the 
price determined by such appraiser for Comcast and/or Comcast 
FCI and Motorola shall be the same with respect to such issu-
ance but that any price separately agreed to by Comcast and the 
Company or New Sub, as the case may be, shall not bind 
Motorola), such number of shares of New Sub Class A Common 
Stock, New Sub Class B Common Stock or other capital stock of 
New Sub, (or, in the case of Interim Proposed Issuances, the 
Company) as the case may be, as is necessary to maintain its 
Voting Power Ownership Percentage or its Fully Diluted Owner-
ship Percentage (whichever is greater) (or, in the case of In-
terim Proposed Issuances, its Expected Voting Ownership Per-
centage or its Expected Fully Diluted Ownership Percentage 
(whichever is greater)) as they existed immediately prior to 
such issuance; provided, however, that if such Proposed 

-121-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Issuance occurs prior to the completion of the Currently 
Announced Transactions, then the Voting Power Ownership Per-
centage and Fully Diluted Ownership Percentage, for purposes of 
this Section 7.13, may not exceed the Voting Power Ownership 
Percentage and Fully Diluted Ownership Percentage which would 
be in effect upon the assumed completion of the Currently 
Announced Transactions; provided, further, that if such issu-
ance occurs subsequent to any Transfers pursuant to Section 
7.14(a)(ii), (iii) or (iv), the Voting Ownership Percentage and 
Fully Diluted Ownership Percentage, for purposes of this Sec-
tion 7.13, may not exceed the lowest Voting Ownership Percent-
age and Fully Diluted Ownership Percentage in effect imme-
diately following such Transfers.

(c) A closing for the purchase of New Nextel Class A 
Common Stock, New Sub Class B Common Stock or other capital 
stock of New Sub (or, in the case of Interim Proposed Issu-
ances, the Company), as the case may be, pursuant to this Sec-
tion 7.13 shall, subject to the receipt of any necessary Autho-
rizations, occur on the later of (i) the date on which such 
public or private issuance occurs, as the case may be, and (ii) 
such later date as may be agreed to by Motorola and the Company 
or New Sub, as the case may be, at a time and place specified 
by Motorola in a notice provided to New Sub at least ten (10) 
days prior to the closing. In connection with such closing, 
the Company or New Sub, as the case may be, and Motorola shall 
provide such customary closing certificates and opinions as 
Motorola and the Company or New Sub, as appropriate, shall rea-
sonably request.

(d) Any election by Motorola to exercise its right 
to purchase shares hereunder by reason of any Interim Proposed 
Issuance shall take effect only upon the closing of the trans-
actions contemplated by this Agreement, and Motorola shall then 
have the right and obligation to purchase, pursuant to the 
terms of this Section 7.13, such number of shares of New Sub 
Class A Common Stock, New Sub Class B Common Stock or any other 
capital stock of New Sub as the case may be, as is necessary to 
maintain its Expected Voting Ownership Percentage or Expected 
Fully Diluted Ownership Percentage (whichever is greater) cal-
culated as provided in Section 7.13(b).

7.14. Transfer of New Sub Shares. (a) Prior to the 
second anniversary of the Closing Date, neither Motorola nor 
any Motorola Subsidiary may sell, transfer, pledge, encumber or 
otherwise dispose, or agree to dispose, of ("Transfer") the New 
Sub Shares acquired in connection with the formation of New Sub 
and as contemplated by this Agreement (the "Motorola New Sub 
Shares") except for:

-122-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

(i) Transfers to any corporation, partnership 
or other entity that is controlled by or under common con-
trol with Motorola and which agrees in writing, prior to 
such Transfer, to hold the New Sub Shares so transferred 
subject to identical restrictions on subsequent Transfers 
thereof to those set forth in this Section 7.14;

(ii) Transfers to transferees provided that such 
transferees are consented to by New Sub (whose consent (A) 
has been given with respect to the list of potential 
transferees heretofore submitted by Motorola listed in 
Tab 22 of the Motorola/Nextel Disclosure Statement and (B) 
may be obtained in advance with respect to any other 
potential transferee and will not, in any event, be un-
reasonably withheld) (which transfers shall not be subject 
to the limitations in clause (iv) or Section 7.14(b) 
below);

(iii) Transfers pursuant to a tender offer, 
merger, recapitalization or other similar extraordinary 
transaction, whether or not such transaction is approved 
or endorsed by the New Sub Board of Directors; provided 
that if such transaction has not been approved or endorsed 
by the New Sub Board of Directors, Motorola will not, ex-
cept as required by law, make any statement of intent or 
commitment to effect any such Transfer, and no such Trans-
fer may be made by Motorola prior to twenty-four hours 
before the last date on which New Sub Shares may be sur-
rendered in connection with such offer or other transac-
tion; or

(iv) (A) transfers completed during the period 
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the first 
anniversary of the Closing Date which in the aggregate 
represent no greater than 25% of the number of Motorola 
New Sub Shares initially owned by Motorola; (B) Transfers 
completed during the period beginning on the first busi-
ness day following the first anniversary of the Closing 
Date and ending on the second anniversary of the Closing 
Date which when added to the Transfers made pursuant to 
clause (A) represent no greater than 50% of the number of 
Motorola New Sub Shares initially owned by Motorola; and 
(C) Transfers completed at any time following the second 
anniversary of the Closing Date which when added to the 
Transfers made pursuant to clauses (A) and (B) represent 
up to 100% of the number of Motorola New Sub Shares ini-
tially owned by Motorola.

-123-

<PAGE>

(b) In the event that Motorola or any Motorola Sub-
sidiary shall desire to Transfer Motorola New Sub Shares repre-
senting in excess of: 

(i) 1,000,000 shares in any given quarter prior 
to the first anniversary of the Closing;

(ii) 1,500,000 shares in any given quarter after 
the first anniversary and prior to the second anniversary 
of the Closing;

(iii) 2,000,000 shares in any given quarter after 
the second anniversary and prior to the third anniversary 
of the Closing;

(iv) 2,500,000 shares in any given quarter after 
the third anniversary and prior the fourth anniversary of 
the Closing; and

(v) 3,000,000 shares in any given quarter after 
the fourth anniversary and prior to the fifth anniversary 
of the Closing;

under the circumstances referred to in clause (iv) of Section 
7.14(a) pursuant to a public distribution at any time prior to 
the fifth anniversary of the Closing, Motorola shall give New 
Sub notice of its intent to sell such New Sub Shares specifying 
the number of New Sub Shares to be sold, and if Nextel provides 
the necessary management participation in the selling effort 
(including participation in "road shows") shall agree to sell 
such shares only pursuant to an underwritten offering by an 
underwriter selected by Motorola reasonably acceptable to New 
Sub.

7.15. Technology Agreements. Contemporaneously with 
the execution of this Agreement, Motorola and the Company have 
executed an Equipment Purchase Agreement Amendment in the form 
attached hereto as Exhibit C.

7.16. Certain Consent Rights of Motorola. (a) From 
and after the date of this Agreement through the Closing and 
thereafter until the earlier of (i) the fifth anniversary of 
the Closing and (ii) such time as Motorola owns less than 7.5% 
of the Fully Diluted Shares, the Company will not, and will not 
agree to, grant superior governance rights (in the form of any 
supermajority voting or consent rights as a stockholder or 
director or disproportionate Board representation, or other-
wise), directly or indirectly, to any third party (other than 
Comcast, to the extent (but only to the extent) of its rights 

-124-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

under the original Comcast Stock Purchase Agreement dated Sep-
tember 14, 1992, as amended through December 31, 1993 but 
including that certain Amendment dated August 4, 1994) with 
respect to the Company, New Sub or its or their businesses 
("Superior Governance Rights") (any Person to whom the Company 
(or, after the Closing, New Sub) proposes to grant such Gover-
nance Rights being referred to herein as a "Strategic Inves-
tor") except in accordance with the following conditions:

(A) Motorola and the Company acknowledge that the letter 
agreement dated February 27, 1994 among the Company, 
MCI and Comcast (the "MCI Agreement") provided for 
the granting of certain governance rights to MCI 
which would have been effective had the Company/MCI/
Comcast transaction closed prior to the execution of 
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is 
expressly understood that (1) MCI's consent is not 
required for the Company to enter into this agreement 
and shall not be required for the Company to consum-
mate the transactions provided for in this Agreement 
and (2) MCI may become an investor, or be granted, or 
contract to obtain, Superior Governance Rights, in 
the Company or New Sub only with Motorola's consent. 
Motorola agrees to discuss with MCI and/or Comcast 
the terms upon which Motorola might grant its consent 
which would include a discussion of the price and 
terms on which Motorola would sell some or all of its 
New Sub Shares to MCI and such other terms (if any) 
as are intended to govern the matters covered by 
Sections 7.16 and 7.17 hereof. No party shall be 
required to enter into such an arrangement unless the 
terms and agreements are in form and substance agree-
able to it. It is understood that each party will 
have sole discretion to agree as to any terms of such 
arrangement, and that failure to reach agreement for 
any reason will in no event give rise to any liabil-
ity of Motorola or the Company to the other, nor 
affect any other provision of this Agreement (includ-
ing, without limitation, the second sentence of this 
clause (A)) or the consummation of the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement. 

(B) With respect to any third party other than MCI, no 
Superior Governance Rights will be granted unless (1) 
there is a Liquidity Event which is accepted by 
Motorola and closes or (2) there is a Liquidity Event 
which is rejected by Motorola and the Company (or New 
Sub, as the case may be) closes its transaction with 
the Strategic Investor. In case (2), Motorola will 
retain the rights set forth in Section 7.9 hereof, 
but the rights set forth in Section 7.13 hereof, and 

-125-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

the restrictions set forth in Sections 7.12 and 7.14, 
will terminate upon the closing of the transaction 
between the Company (or New Sub, as the case may be) 
and the Strategic Investor;

provided, however, that nothing in this Section 7.16 shall pro-
hibit the Company or New Sub, in the context of a bona fide 
debt financing (including refinancing) transaction, from pro-
viding to the lenders or holders of debt issued therein rights 
to exert influence as a creditor over the Company in circum-
stances and on terms substantially comparable to those terms 
contained in the material loan agreements, notes or indentures 
to which the Company, New Sub or any entity contemplated to be 
acquired by the Company or to become a Subsidiary of the Com-
pany in any of the Currently Announced Transactions is a party 
so long as, in each case, such debt is held by or issued to 
bona fide financial institutions (including insurance compa-
nies, pension funds and other comparable institutional inves-
tors, but excluding MCI) regularly engaged in the business of 
lending money or purchasing publicly traded or privately issued 
debt securities and such terms are otherwise customary for debt 
financings of such type.

(b) A Liquidity Event will be defined to have oc-
curred (a "Liquidity Event") only if the following conditions 
are satisfied. The Strategic Investor to which the Company (or 
New Sub, as the case may be) proposes to grant Superior Gover-
nance Rights shall submit a written offer to the Company (or 
New Sub, as the case may be) specifying a number of shares to 
be purchased from the Company (or New Sub, as the case might 
be) (and/or a stockholder of the Company or New Sub, as the 
case may be), the proposed purchase price and the specific 
terms of the proposed Superior Governance Rights to be granted 
by the Company or New Sub, as the case may be. The Company or 
New Sub, as the case may be, shall give written notice 
("Notice") to Motorola of such offer, attaching the terms pro-
posed by the Strategic Investor, and certifying the Company's 
(or New Sub's) intention to close such transaction on such 
terms. Such notice shall be accompanied by a bona fide, fully-
financed offer (in cash, or in securities or a combination of 
cash and securities, with any such securities acceptable to 
Motorola) to Motorola of the opportunity to sell at least 62.5% 
of the Motorola New Sub Shares (including 50% of any New Sub 
Shares theretofore sold by Motorola) to the Company (or New 
Sub, as the case may be) and/or the proposed Strategic Investor 
at a price at least equal to the greatest of:

(i) for the first six months following the date of 
this Agreement, the average of the closing 
prices of the Company Shares (or the New Sub 

-126-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Shares, as and when applicable) over the 30 
trading days preceding the date of this Agree-
ment, and

(ii) 110% of the average of the closing prices of the 
Company Shares (or the New Sub Shares, as and 
when applicable) over the 30 trading days pre-
ceding the public announcement of a letter of 
intent or definitive agreement (whichever is 
earlier) providing for the investment by the 
Strategic Investor; 

provided that, if the price per Company Share (or New Sub 
Share) to be paid by the Strategic Investor to the Company for 
newly issued shares (calculated as the best average price, if 
in tranches) (the "reference per share price") represents a 
premium to the per share price determined under the highest of 
the formulas in clauses (b)(i) or (b)(ii) (giving effect to the 
110% in (b)(ii)) above, Motorola shall also be entitled to 50% 
of such per share premium for each share purchased from 
Motorola in the Liquidity Event.

(c) Motorola must notify the Company or New Sub, as 
the case may be, of its election to accept or reject the offer 
specified in the Notice within 30 days of receipt of the 
Notice.

(i) If Motorola rejects the offer specified in 
the Notice, the Company (or New Sub, as the case may be) must 
close the transaction with the proposed Strategic Investor on 
substantially the same terms as were specified in the Notice to 
Motorola (by means of a definitive agreement within six months, 
and a closing within 18 months, of the Notice) in order to be 
free to grant the specified Superior Governance Rights. If 
such closing does not occur in accordance with the preceding 
sentence, the procedure set forth above must be complied with 
again, in full.

(ii) If Motorola accepts the offer specified in 
the Notice, and if within one year of its original investment, 
the Strategic Investor subsequently increases its ownership by 
means of a purchase of shares from the Company or New Sub, as 
the case may be, and the price per share paid for such in-
creased investment (the "new per share price") is greater than 
the price per share paid to Motorola in the original Liquidity 
Event in connection with the initial investment (the "initial 
per share price"), the Company shall compute the per share 
price that would have been required to be paid to Motorola in 
the original Liquidity Event ("recomputed per share price"), in 
accordance with clause (b) above, but substituting the new per 

-127-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

share price for the reference per share price, and the dif-
ference between that higher recomputed per share price and the 
initial per share price will be paid with respect to any shares 
purchased from Motorola in the original Liquidity Event.

(d) If a Notice with respect to a proposed Strategic 
Investor is delivered to Motorola by the Company between the 
date of this Agreement and the Closing, Motorola will comply 
with the procedures as if it then owned New Sub Shares, but the 
investment by the Strategic Investor shall not close, and the 
Liquidity Event shall not be deemed to have occurred, until 
after the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement has occurred.

(e) So long as a Liquidity Event has not occurred, 
neither the Company nor New Sub will take any action that would 
result in or facilitate an investment in excess of 5% of the 
Fully Diluted Shares by another equipment manufacturer.

7.17. Switch in Technology.

(a) The Company and New Sub may not effect a Switch 
in Technology (as defined in the Equipment Purchase Agreement 
Amendment) within five years of the Closing if a Strategic 
Investor has theretofore made an investment in accordance with 
Section 7.16 hereof unless (i) there is a Second Liquidity 
Event (as defined below, a "Second Liquidity Event") which is 
either accepted by Motorola and closes or is rejected by 
Motorola and (ii) the other conditions below are met.

(A) A Second Liquidity Event will be defined to 
have occurred if a bona fide, fully-
financed offer (in cash or securities, or a 
combination of cash or securities, with any 
such securities acceptable to Motorola in 
its sole discretion) has been made to 
Motorola by the Company (or New Sub) and/or 
such Strategic Investor of the opportunity 
to sell the remaining Motorola New Sub 
Shares to New Sub and/or the Strategic In-
vestor at a price at least equal to 110% of 
the average of the closing prices of the 
Company Shares (or the New Sub Shares, as 
and when applicable) over the 30 trading 
days preceding the public announcement by 
the Company (or New Sub) of the intention 
to implement a Switch in Technology. 

-128-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

(B) Upon the earlier of an announcement or the 
implementation by the Company or New Sub of 
a Switch in Technology, Motorola's rights 
set forth in Section 7.13 hereof shall 
terminate, and all restrictions applicable 
to Motorola set forth in Sections 7.12 and 
7.14 shall terminate, but Motorola shall 
retain the rights set forth in Section 7.9.

ment from and after the Closing, the Company and New Sub may 
not implement a Switch in Technology until the fifth anniver-
sary of the Closing unless the conditions below are met:

(i) Motorola's rights set forth in Section 7.13 
hereof shall terminate; and

(ii) no Switch in Technology may be implemented 
until six months after the later of (A) the announce-
ment of the intended switch and (B) the waiver by 
Nextel of all restrictions applicable to Motorola set 
forth in Sections 7.12 and 7.14 hereof; and

(iii) Motorola shall retain the rights set forth 
in Section 7.9.

7.18. Affiliated Party Transactions. So long as 
Motorola has the rights set forth in Section 7.9, (a) trans-
actions between New Sub and an interested third party will 
require approval by a committee of independent directors of New 
Sub (the composition of which may be changed from time to time, 
subject to Motorola's Board designee being a member of any such 
committee) and (b) Motorola will have the right to veto changes 
in New Sub's "fundamental business" (which is defined as wire-
less communications worldwide) during the five years following 
the Closing.

unacceptable to either Motorola or the Company in its rea-
sonable judgment.

tions, consents or approvals would not (A) have a material 
adverse effect on the Business Condition of (i) the Com-
pany and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or (ii) the 
Applicable SMR Business or the Contributed Assets, or (B) 
would not materially impair the ability of the Company, 
Motorola, New Sub or ESMR Sub to perform its obligations 
under this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements.

site parties shall have executed each of the Ancillary

Motorola's reasonable judgment).

obligations of the Company to consummate the transactions con-
templated by this Agreement are subject to the fulfillment at 
or prior to the Effective Time of each of the following condi-
tions, any or all of which may be waived in whole or in part by

(a) Representations and Warranties True. The repre-
sentations and warranties of Motorola and its Subsidiaries 
shall have been true in all material respects when made

tations and warranties had been made at such time, except

<PAGE>

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancil-
lary Agreements and (ii) for representations and warran-
ties that speak as of a specific date other than the Clos-

Prudential Securities Incorporated, dated respectively the 
date hereof and the date on which the Company's proxy 
materials are first distributed to the Company's stock-
holders (and such latter opinion shall not have been 
withdrawn on or before the Closing Date) to the effect 
that as of the dates thereof, the conversion ratio of 
Company Shares into New Sub Shares (taking into account 
the proposed issuances of New Sub Shares 

-134-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

to Motorola and the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries as contem-
plated by Section 4.3) is fair to the holders of Company

Opinion").

after the approval by holders of Company Shares, either by the 
mutual written consent of Motorola and the Company, or by 
mutual action of their respective Boards of Directors.

plated hereby may be abandoned by action of the Board of Direc-
tors of either Motorola or the Company if (a) the Nextel Merger

fill any obligation under this Agreement has been the cause of 
or resulted in the failure of the Nextel Merger to occur on or 
before such date) or (b) any Governmental Authority shall have

9.3. Effect of Termination and Abandonment. In the 
event of termination of this Agreement and abandonment of the

ARTICLE X

INDEMNIFICATION

10.1. Indemnification Relating to the Agreement. 
(a) Except with respect to Taxes, which shall be governed by 
the Tax Allocation Agreement, Motorola shall indemnify New Sub 
and each of its Subsidiaries, and each director, officer, suc-
cessor and assign of New Sub and its Subsidiaries, from and 
against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages (in-
cluding punitive, consequential or treble damages), obliga-
tions, liens, assessments, judgments, awards and fines (includ-
ing without limitation those arising out of any pending or 
threatened Action, including any settlement or compromise 
thereof) and any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses 
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and 
expenses incurred in connection with any pending or threatened 
Action) ("Losses") resulting or arising from:

(i) any breach by Motorola of any representa-
tion or warranty of Motorola set forth in this Agreement;

(ii) any failure of Motorola to comply with or 
non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement of Motorola 
set forth in this Agreement to be performed by it prior to 
Closing; 

(iii) any liabilities or obligations (A) not con-
stituting Assumed Liabilities to which New Sub or any of 
the Contributed Assets is subject at the Closing as speci-
fied in Section 4.2(d) hereof or (B) which arise out of or 
result from events, conditions or circumstances relating 
to the ownership, use or operation of any assets or busi-
ness by Motorola, any of the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries, 
New Sub or ESMR Sub (or their respective predecessors in 
interest) at any time prior to the Closing; and

(iv) any untrue statement or alleged untrue 
statement, or omission or alleged omission, of a material 
fact in the S-4 Registration Statement or the Proxy State-
ment/Prospectus, that was based upon and in conformity 

-136-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

with information furnished to New Sub concerning Motorola, 
the Motorola SMR Subsidiaries or the Applicable SMR Busi-
ness.

(b) Except with respect to Taxes, which shall be 
governed by the Tax Allocation Agreement, New Sub shall indem-
nify Motorola and each of its Subsidiaries, and each director, 
officer, successor and assign of Motorola and its Subsidiaries, 
from and against all Losses resulting or arising from:

(i) any breach by the Company of any represen-
tation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agree-
ment; 

(ii) any failure of the Company to comply with 
or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement of the 
Company set forth in this Agreement to be performed by it 
prior to Closing; 

(iii) any liabilities and/or obligations which 
(i) arise from the failure to satisfy or discharge in ac-
cordance with their respective terms any of the Assumed 
Liabilities including, without limitation, all obligations 
coming due for performance after the Closing under the 
applicable terms of any contract assumed by New Sub pursu-
ant to Article IV or (ii) arise from or relate to the own-
ership of the Contributed Assets or the operation of the 
Applicable SMR Business by New Sub and its Subsidiaries 
from and after the Closing on the Closing Date; and

(iv) any untrue statement or alleged untrue 
statement of a material fact contained in the S-4 Regis-
tration Statement or the Proxy Statement Prospectus, or 
the omission or alleged omission to state therein a mate-
rial fact required to be stated therein or necessary to 
make the statements therein not misleading (except for any 
statement or omission based upon and in conformity with 
information furnished to New Sub concerning Motorola, the 
Motorola SMR Subsidiaries or the Applicable SMR Business). 

(c) Except with respect to Taxes, which shall be 
governed by the Tax Allocation Agreement, Motorola and the Com-
pany agree that, notwithstanding Sections 4.1(a)(iv), 
4.1(b)(x), 4.2(a)(iv), 4.2(b)(i), 10.1(a)(iii) and 10.1(b)(iii) 
hereof, (i) all current assets and current liabilities arising 
out of the Applicable SMR Business prior to the Closing and 
attributable to the pre-Closing period shall be for the benefit 
of, or the responsibility of (as the case may be), Motorola and 
(ii) all current assets and current liabilities arising out of 
the Applicable SMR Business after the Closing and attributable 

-137-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

to the post-Closing period shall be for the benefit of, or the 
responsibility of (as the case may be), New Sub. Within 30 
days after the Closing Date, Motorola shall prepare a statement 
which summarizes (A) the amount of current assets and current 
liabilities associated with the Applicable SMR Business which 
existed as of the Closing Date, and (B) the portions of such 
current assets and current liabilities attributable to the pe-
riods prior to, and following the Closing, respectively, after 
giving effect to the fact that various income statement items 
are received or paid in advance or in arrears. To the extent 
that Motorola receives cash in respect of a current asset at-
tributable to the post-Closing period, Motorola shall remit 
such cash to New Sub. To the extent that New Sub receives cash 
in respect of a current asset attributable to the pre-Closing 
period, New Sub shall remit such cash to Motorola. To the ex-
tent Motorola or New Sub expends cash with respect to a current 
liability relating to the post-Closing or pre-Closing period, 
respectively, then the other party shall reimburse the amount 
so remitted. New Sub and Motorola agree to cooperate from and 
after the Closing in settling the cash obligations hereunder in 
accordance with the principle set forth in the first sentence 
hereof.

10.2. Indemnification Procedures. 

(a) Procedures for Indemnification of Third Party 
Claims.

(i) If an Indemnitee shall receive notice or 
otherwise learn of the assertion by a Person (including, with-
out limitation, any Governmental Authority) who is not a party 
to this Agreement, or to the Ancillary Agreements, of any claim 
or of the commencement by any such Person of any Action (a 
"Third Party Claim") with respect to which an Indemnifying 
Party may be obligated to provide indemnification pursuant to 
Section 10.1 of this Agreement, such Indemnitee shall give such 
Indemnifying Party written notice thereof promptly after becom-
ing aware of such Third Party Claim and in no event later than 
the second anniversary of the Closing Date; provided that the 
failure of any Indemnitee to give notice as provided in this 
Section 10.2(a) (so long as such notice is prior to the second 
anniversary of the Closing Date) shall not relieve the related 
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Article X, 
except to the extent that such Indemnifying Party is prejudiced 
by such failure to give notice. Such notice shall describe the 
Third Party Claim in reasonable detail and, if ascertainable, 
shall indicate the amount (estimated if necessary) of the Loss 
that has been or may be sustained by such Indemnitee.

-138-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

(ii) An Indemnifying Party may elect to defend 
or to seek to settle or compromise, at such Indemnifying 
Party's own expense and by such Indemnifying Party's own coun-
sel, any Third Party Claim. Within 30 days of the receipt of 
notice from an Indemnitee in accordance with Section 10.2(a)(i) 
(or sooner, if the nature of such Third Party Claim so re-
quires), the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnitee of 
its election whether the Indemnifying Party will assume respon-
sibility for defending such Third Party Claim, which election 
shall specify any reservations or exceptions. After notice 
from an Indemnifying Party to an Indemnitee of its election to 
assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, such Indemnifying 
Party shall not be liable to such Indemnitee under this Article 
X for any legal or other expenses (except expenses approved in 
advance by the Indemnifying Party) subsequently incurred by 
such Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof; pro-
vided that if, in any Indemnitee's reasonable judgment, a con-
flict of interest between one or more of such Indemnitees and 
such Indemnifying Party exists in respect of such claim, such 
Indemnitees shall have the right to employ separate counsel to 
represent such Indemnitees at their own expense who shall be 
entitled to participate in such defense. If an Indemnifying 
Party elects not to assume responsibility for defending a Third 
Party Claim, or fails to notify an Indemnitee of its election 
as provided in this Section 10.2(a)(ii), such Indemnitee may 
defend or (subject to the remainder of this Section 10.2(a)(ii) 
and Section 10.2(a)(iv)) seek to compromise or settle such 
Third Party Claim at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. 
Neither an Indemnifying Party nor an Indemnitee shall consent 
to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of any 
Third Party Claim which does not include as an unconditional 
term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such 
Indemnitee, in the case of a consent or settlement by an Indem-
nifying Party, or the Indemnifying Party, in the case of a con-
sent or settlement by the Indemnitee, of a written release from 
all liability in respect of such Third Party Claim.

(iii) If an Indemnifying Party chooses to defend 
or to seek to compromise or settle any Third Party Claim, the 
related Indemnitee shall make available to such Indemnifying 
Party (in a manner that will not unreasonably interfere with 
the conduct of the Indemnitee's business) any personnel or any 
books, records or other documents within its control or which 
it otherwise has the ability to make available that are neces-
sary or appropriate for such defense, settlement or compromise, 
and shall otherwise cooperate in the defense, settlement or 
compromise of such Third Party Claim.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 
10.2(a) to the contrary, (A) neither an Indemnifying Party nor 

-139-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

an Indemnitee shall, without the written consent of the other 
party, settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any 
judgment with respect to any Action or Third Party Claim if the 
effect thereof is to admit any criminal liability by, or to 
permit any injunctive relief or other order providing non-
monetary relief to be entered against, the other party and (B) 
other than as provided in clause (A), neither an Indemnifying 
Party nor an Indemnitee may settle or compromise any claim 
without the consent of the other which shall not be unreason-
ably withheld. Subject to clause (A) of this paragraph (iv), 
if an Indemnifying Party notifies the related Indemnitee in 
writing of such Indemnifying Party's desire to settle or com-
promise a Third Party Claim on the basis set forth in such no-
tice (provided that such settlement or compromise includes as 
an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or 
plaintiff of a written release of the Indemnitee from all li-
ability in respect thereof) and the Indemnitee shall notify the 
Indemnifying Party in writing that such Indemnitee declines to 
accept any such settlement or compromise, such Indemnitee may 
continue to contest such Third Party Claim, free of any par-
ticipation by such Indemnifying Party, at such Indemnitee's 
sole expense. In such event, the obligation of such Indemnify-
ing Party to such Indemnitee with respect to such Third Party 
Claim shall be equal to (1) the costs and expenses of such In-
demnitee prior to the date such Indemnifying Party notifies 
such Indemnitee of the offer to settle or compromise (to the 
extent such costs and expenses are otherwise indemnifiable 
hereunder) plus (2) the lesser of (x) the amount of any offer 
of settlement or compromise which such Indemnitee declined to 
accept and (y) the actual out-of-pocket amount such Indemnitee 
is obligated to pay subsequent to such date as a result of such 
Indemnitee's continuing to pursue such Third Party Claim.

(v) In the event of payment by an Indemnifying 
Party to any Indemnitee in connection with any Third Party 
Claim, such Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to and shall 
stand in the place of such Indemnitee as to any events or cir-
cumstances in respect of which such Indemnitee may have any 
right or claim relating to such Third Party Claim against any 
claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third Party Claim or 
against any other Person. Such Indemnitee shall cooperate with 
such Indemnifying Party in a reasonable manner, and at the cost 
and expense of such Indemnifying Party, in prosecuting any sub-
rogated right or claim.

(b) Other Procedures for Indemnification.

(i) Any claim on account of a Loss which does 
not result from a Third Party Claim shall be asserted by writ-
ten notice given by the Indemnitee to the related Indemnifying 

-140-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Party, in no event later than the second anniversary of the 
Closing Date. Such Indemnifying Party shall have a period of 
30 days after the receipt of such notice within which to re-
spond thereto. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond 
within such 30 day period, such Indemnifying Party shall be 
deemed to have refused to accept responsibility to make pay-
ment. If such Indemnifying Party does not respond within such 
30 day period or rejects such claim in whole or in part, such 
Indemnitee shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be 
available to such party under this Agreement or under appli-
cable law.

(ii) If the amount of any Liability shall, at 
any time subsequent to the payment required by this Agreement, 
be reduced by recovery, settlement or otherwise, the amount of 
such reduction, less any expenses incurred in connection there-
with, shall promptly be repaid by the Indemnitee to the Indem-
nifying Party.

10.3. Limitation on Indemnity. (a) None of New Sub 
or its Affiliates shall have any claim for indemnity against 
Motorola under Section 10.1(a) hereof with respect to any Owned 
Channel, Motorola McSMR or other Acquired SMR License which is 
not ultimately included among the Owned Channels and Acquired 
SMR Licenses shown as delivered on the Channel Delivery Status 
Statements, or any facilities or equipment solely relating 
thereto, it being the intention of the parties that the cumula-
tive channel delivery requirements and the penalty provisions 
contemplated by Sections 4.5 through 4.10 hereof be the sole 
economic adjustment between Motorola and New Sub relating to 
defects in, or non-delivery of, SMR Channels or facilities or

apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for specific perfor-
mance or injunctive or such other relief as such court may deem

stitute a waiver by such party of its right to exercise any

ance.

Indemnified Party) or a permitted assign or successor to such

11.11. Public Announcements. Motorola and the Com-
pany will agree upon the timing and content of the initial 
press release to be issued describing the execution of this

quested by either party, each party will thereafter consult 

-144-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

with and provide reasonable cooperation to the other in connec-
tion with the issuance of further press releases or other pub-
lic documents describing the transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement.

11.12. Governing Law. This Agreement and all dis-
putes hereunder shall be governed by and construed and enforced 
in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware, 
without regard to principles of conflict of laws.

11.13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed 
in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to 
be an original, but all of which together shall constitute one 
instrument. Each counterpart may consist of a number of copies 
each signed by less than all, but together signed by all, the 
parties hereto.

11.14. Knowledge. The term "knowledge" and any de-
rivatives thereof when applied to any party to this Agreement 
shall refer only to the actual knowledge of that party (or in 
the case of a corporation, partnership or other entity, the 
actual knowledge of its executive officers), but no information 
known by any other employee, or any attorney, accountant or 
other representative, of such party shall be imputed to such 
party except that, with respect to Motorola's knowledge with 
respect to the Applicable SMR Business, the Applicable SMR As-
sets, the Contributed Assets and the Assumed Liabilities such 
terms also shall refer to the knowledge of those persons who 
hold positions or discharge functions that would be held or 
discharged by persons acting as executive officers of the 
Applicable SMR Business if it were a separately incorporated 
entity.

11.15. Transactions Contemplated by this Agreement. 
The terms "transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the 
Ancillary Agreements" or "transactions contemplated by this 
Agreement" are not intended, and do not, include any trans-
action that is or forms a part of the Currently Announced 
Transactions.

11.16. Dispute Resolution. In the event of any dis-
pute arising with respect to this Agreement, prior to commenc-
ing any litigation, the parties will attempt to resolve the 
matter through good faith consultations and negotiations. If 
those attempts fail, any party may demand mediation (the "De-
mand Party") of such dispute by written notice (the "Mediation 
Notice") to the other party (the "Selecting Party"). (For pur-
poses of this Section 11.16, Motorola and its Controlled Af-
filiates shall be deemed one party and shall act together and 
the Company and its Controlled Affiliates shall be deemed one 

-145-
<PAGE>
<PAGE>

party and shall act together.) Within 15 days of receipt of 
the Mediation Notice the Selecting Party shall, by written no-
tice to the Demand Party, propose a mediator. The Demand Party 
may not unreasonably withhold consent to such selection of a 
mediator, and both parties will share the cost of mediation 
equally. The parties may also agree to replace mediation with 
some other form of alternative dispute resolution ("ADR"), such 
as neutral fact finding or mini trial. If any dispute cannot 
be resolved by the parties through negotiation, mediation or 
other form of ADR within three months of the Mediation Notice, 
the dispute may be submitted to a Delaware court for resolu-
tion. The use of any ADR procedures will not be construed un-
der the doctrine of laches, waiver or estoppel to adversely 
affect the rights of any party. Nothing in this Section 11.16 
will prevent either party from commencing formal litigation 
proceedings if (a) good faith efforts to resolve the dispute 
under these procedures have been unsuccessful, or (b) any delay 
resulting from efforts to mediate such dispute could result in 
serious and irreparable injury to such party.
