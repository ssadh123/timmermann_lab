GUARANTEE

of

CHEMICAL BANKING CORPORATION

FOR VALUE RECEIVED, CHEMICAL BANKING CORPORATION, a corporation duly
organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the
"Guarantor"), hereby unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees the due and
punctual payment of (i) all amounts of interest on the $150,000,000 aggregate
principal amount of 6-3/4% Notes due June 15, 2000 (the "Notes") of Margaretten
Financial Corporation (the "Issuer") issued under the Indenture, dated as of
May 15, 1993 (the "Indenture"), between the Issuer and The Bank of New York, as
trustee, when, where and as the same shall become due and payable and (ii) all
amounts of principal on the Notes at the stated final maturity thereof or upon
acceleration thereof upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in
the Indenture) in respect of the Notes (including, in each case, payment of any
additional amounts required to be paid on the Notes), according to the terms
thereof.

In the event of the failure of the Issuer, or any corporation which may
have assumed the obligations of the Issuer under the Notes, punctually to pay
the principal of and interest on the Notes (including, in each case, any
additional amounts required to be paid on the Notes), the Guarantor hereby
agrees to cause any such payment to be made punctually when and as the same
shall become due and payable and as if such payment were made by the Issuer.

The Guarantor hereby agrees that its obligations hereunder shall be
unconditional and irrevocable, irrespective of the validity, regularity or
enforceability of the Notes, the absence of any action to enforce the same, any
waiver or consent by the holders of the Notes with respect to any provisions
thereof, the recovery of any judgment against the Issuer or any action to
enforce the same, or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a
legal or equitable discharge or defense of a guarantor. The Guarantor hereby
waives diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court
in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Issuer, any right to require a
proceeding first against the Issuer, protest, notice and all demands whatsoever
and covenants that this Guarantee will not be discharged except by complete
performance of the obligations contained in the Notes and in this Guarantee.

The Guarantor shall be subrogated to all rights of the holders of the
Notes against the Issuer in respect of any amounts paid by the Guarantor
pursuant to the provisions of this Guarantee; provided, however, that the
Guarantor shall not be entitled to enforce or to receive any payments arising
out of, or based upon, such rights of subrogation until the principal of,
interest on and all other amounts payable under all of the Notes shall have
been paid in full.

This Guarantee shall not be construed to apply to any series of
debentures, notes or other indebtedness issued under the Indenture other than
the $150,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 6-3/4% Notes due June 15, 2000.

This Guarantee shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York.
