Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On March 17, 1994, Harman International Industries, Incorporated
("Harman"), through its wholly owned subsidiary Harman Investment
Company, Incorporated, completed its acquisition and acquired from
Motor-Columbus AG and its affiliates ("Motor-Columbus") 100% of Studer
Revox AG ("Studer Revox"), a leading company in the professional audio
field, with particular strength in the recording and broadcast areas. 
Motor-Columbus retained the Revox Consumer Products division and the
rights to use the Revox name. 

Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement dated February 3,
1994 by and among Harman, Motor-Columbus and Studer Revox, as amended,
Harman paid 100 Swiss Francs (approximately US $70.00) for all of the
issued and outstanding stock in Studer Revox. Harman assumed post-
acquisition indebtedness of Studer Revox of approximately 23 million
Swiss Francs (approximately US $16 million).

Studer Revox, which was founded in 1948, is headquartered in
Regensdorf, Switzerland. The company manufactures analog and digital
tape recorders, mixing consoles, switching systems, digital audio
workstations, professional compact disc players and recorders and
turnkey broadcasting studios. Its principal subsidiaries are located in
France, the United States, Canada, Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan,
Singapore and Austria. Harman currently intends to continue to use
Studer Revox's facilities for the same purposes as they were previously
used.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits

The financial statements required by Items 7 (a) and (b) are filed
as a part of this Current Report on Form 8-K/A. The pro forma combined
results of operations for Studer Revox and Harman are provided for the
twelve month period ending December 31, 1993. The statement of
operations data for Harman for the twelve month period ended December
31, 1993 has been derived from quarterly unaudited consolidated
financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. The
financial data for the Studer Revox statement of operations for the
three month period ending March 31, 1994 and the balance sheet as of
March 31, 1994 are included in the Company's Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements filed today in the Company's SEC Report on Form 10-
Q. Prior to the acquisition, Studer Revox reported on a calendar
fiscal year and due to the practices in existence for interim reporting
at Studer Revox and the sale of assets by Studer Revox prior to the
acquisition, the preparation of interim period pro forma financial
statements is not practicable.

TOGETHER WITH AUDITORS' REPORT

<PAGE>

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT

To the Board of Directors of
Studer Revox AG

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Studer
Revox AG (a Swiss corporation) and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993,
and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity
and cash flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audit
provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fair-
ly, in all material respects, the financial position of Studer Revox AG
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the year then ended in accordance
with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.

STUDER REVOX AG AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1993
(in thousands of Swiss Francs unless otherwise stated)

1. Operations and ownership

The Company's predominant business is the design, manufacture and
distribution of high fidelity audio and video products for the con-
sumer electronics and professional studio markets. Products are
manufactured and distributed in Switzerland and internationally
under the "Studer" and "Revox" brand names.

The Company is wholly owned by Motor-Columbus AG, Baden,
Switzerland as of December 31, 1993. As more fully described in
Note 17, the Company subsequently sold its Revox Consumer
Electronics business and the Swiss real estate to other companies
owned by Motor-Columbus. At the same time, the Company was
recapitalized and sold to Harman International Industries Inc.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies

Presentation of the financial statements
----------------------------------------
In connection with the acquisition of the Company by Harman
International Industries Inc., the Company is required to present
consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles. Such consolidated financial
statements have been prepared for the first time at December 31,
1993. For this reason, no comparative financial information is
available.

Consolidation principles
------------------------
The consolidated balance sheet and income statement of Studer Revox
AG includes all majority owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
balances and transactions as well as intercompany profit in
inventories have been eliminated. Minority interests in Studer
Revox Japan are shown separately in the consolidated balance sheet
and income statement.

Foreign currency translation
----------------------------
Assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated to
Swiss Francs at the foreign exchange rate in effect at the balance
sheet date. Income statements of foreign subsidiaries are
translated at the average rate for the year. Translation gains and
losses resulting from the application of this method in 1993 are
shown in a separate component of shareholders' equity. Cumulative 
14
<PAGE>
- 2 -

translation adjustments from previous years have not been
separately calculated.

Income recognition
------------------
Revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods. For certain long term
contracts, revenue is also recognized upon specific and identified
partial shipments being made.

Marketable securities
---------------------
Marketable securities are stated at cost which approximates market
values.

Inventories
-----------
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is
determined principally by the first-in, first-out method. Reserves
for slow moving and obsolete articles are provided by using a
systematic reserve calculation based on production dates or other
appropriate procedures.

Property, plant and equipment
-----------------------------
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost or in case of
major capital leases at the present value of the minimum future
lease payments.

Depreciation and amortization is provided primarily using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
property.

Excess of cost over fair value of assets acquired
-------------------------------------------------
Goodwill resulting from an acquisition in the United States is
amortized over a period of 40 years, using the straight line
method.

Income taxes
------------
Income taxes payable are currently provided for based on the
taxable results reported by each individual subsidiary. Deferred
taxes are provided on timing differences between the results
reported for tax and financial purposes using the liability method.
No deferred taxes are recognized for future benefits resulting from
net operating losses because the realizability is highly uncertain
due to the history of losses. No deferred taxes are accrued
relating to undistributed earnings of S.Fr. 7 Mio. from foreign
subsidiaries because the Company has no intention to repatriate
such earnings in the foreseeable future.

other plans exist in other countries. Net assets of such plans are
not included in the amount stated above. Total contributions to
governmental and other pension schemes for the year ended December

15. Committments and contingencies

The Company and its subsidiaries are involved in several legal
actions out of normal operations with customers, suppliers and
former employees. The outcome of these actions cannot be predicted
at this moment. However, management, based on legal advice,
believes such actions are either without merit or do not represent
a material liability in excess of amounts specifically reserved for
such cases.

16. Related party transactions

For the year ended December 31, 1993, the Company has been charged
with a management fee of S.Fr. 1.3 Mio. by its parent company.

On March 17, 1994, Motor-Columbus AG has sold the Company to Harman
International Industries Inc. (Harman) effective January 1, 1994.
The agreement includes the following major provisions:

- Harman acquires the Company's world wide professional studio
business (Studer operations). The Revox consumer electronics
business, primarily represented by the Company's subsidiary in
Germany (Studer Revox GmbH) will be transferred to a new subsidiary
owned by Motor-Columbus AG.

- The Swiss real estate owned by the Company together with the
respective mortgages have also been transferred to another company
owned by Motor-Columbus AG. A lease agreement has been concluded
with Studer Revox AG for one part of the real estate. The agreement
provides for a 5 year lease term. For the first 3 years no rent is
due by the Company.

- The Company is recapitalized by Motor-Columbus AG by an amount of
S.Fr. 17 Mio. through the waiver of the balance of the parent
company loan after the transactions explained in the two preceding
paragraphs.

The consolidated balance sheet of the Company after such
transactions at January 1, 1994, can be summarized as follows:

Current assets S.Fr. 80,301 
Non-current assets 16,653 
Current liabilities (61,198)
Non-current liabilities (8,163)
---------------- 
Equity (incl. minorities) S.Fr. 27,593

preliminary estimates by the Company. The actual amount of these
adjustments may vary from these estimates, and will not be determined until
the Company completes its review of Studer's business and valuation of
assets and liabilities. The Company believes that the actual amount of
these adjustments, in the aggregate, will not vary materially from these
estimates. Swiss Francs were converted to U.S. dollars based on the
average exchange rate for the period.
