Exhibit 99.a

PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

On January 27, 1994, BankAmerica Corporation ("BAC") and Continental
Bank Corporation ("Continental") entered into a definitive agreement to merge
(the "Merger"), as more fully explained in Note A of the Notes to Pro Forma
Combined Financial Information.

The following unaudited Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet as of
June 30, 1994 combines the historical consolidated balance sheets of BAC and
subsidiaries and Continental and subsidiaries as if the Merger had been
effective on June 30, 1994 after giving effect to the purchase accounting
adjustments described in the Notes to Pro Forma Combined Financial Information.
The unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of Operations present the combined
results of operations of BAC and subsidiaries and Continental and subsidiaries
for the six months ended June 30, 1994 and for the year ended December 31, 1993
as if the Merger had been effective on January 1, 1993 after giving effect to
the purchase accounting adjustments described in the accompanying notes. These
pro forma combined financial statements do not give effect to the proposed BAC
acquisitions of Liberty Bank and United Mortgage Holding Company and
subsidiaries as these transactions were not considered significant to BAC 
and subsidiaries.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements and accompanying
notes reflect the application of the purchase method of accounting. Under this
method of accounting, the purchase price will be allocated to the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the
effective time of the Merger (the "Effective Time"). As described in the
accompanying notes, estimates of the fair values of Continental and
subsidiaries' assets and liabilities have been combined with the recorded values
of the assets and liabilities of BAC and subsidiaries. However, changes to the
adjustments included in the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements
are expected as evaluations of assets and liabilities are completed and as
additional information becomes available. In addition, the results of
operations of Continental subsequent to June 30, 1994 will affect the
allocation of the purchase price. Accordingly, the final pro forma combined
amounts will differ from those set forth in the unaudited pro forma combined
financial statements.

The unaudited pro forma combined financial statements are intended for
informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of the future
financial position or future results of operations of the combined company, or
of the financial position or results of operations of the combined company that
would have actually occurred had the Merger been in effect as of the date or for
the periods presented.

These unaudited pro forma combined financial statements and the
accompanying notes should be read in conjunction with and are qualified in
their entirety by the consolidated financial statements, including accompanying
notes, of BAC in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
1993 and in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30,
1994. These unaudited pro forma combined financial statements and the
accompanying notes should also be read in conjunction with and are also
qualified in their entirety by the consolidated financial statements, including
the accompanying notes, of Continental in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 1993 and in its quarterly report on Form 10-Q for
the quarter ended June 30, 1994. Portions of Continental's quarterly report on
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 1994 are incorporated by 
reference and filed as part of BAC's report on Form 8-K, which includes this 
Exhibit, dated August 11, 1994.

CONTINENTAL BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

NOTE A: BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of January 27, 1994
(the "Merger Agreement") provides that, at the Effective Time and subject to
the election and allocation procedures provided for therein, each share of
Continental common stock, par value $4 per share ("Continental Common Stock")
outstanding at the Effective Time (other than shares for which appraisal rights
are perfected), subject to certain exceptions, will be converted into either a
number of shares of common stock of BAC, par value $1.5625 per share (the
"Stock Consideration") or an amount in cash without interest (the "Cash
Consideration").

Under the Merger Agreement, the aggregate number of shares of common 
stock of BAC, par value $1.5625 per share (the "BAC Common Stock") to be issued
in the Merger (the "Stock Amount") is equal to the product of (x) 0.8152 and
(y) 51% of the total number of shares of Continental Common Stock outstanding
on the tenth calendar day prior to the anticipated Effective Time (the
"Determination Date"). The Merger Agreement also provides that if, at the
Effective Time of the Merger, more shares of Continental Common Stock are
outstanding than are contemplated to be outstanding or subject to option
pursuant to the representations and warranties of Continental in the Merger
Agreement, then, at BAC's election, the Stock Amount, the Cash Consideration
and the Stock Consideration will be adjusted downward to reflect the greater
number of shares outstanding. In the unaudited Pro Forma Combined Balance
Sheet, the Stock Amount is assumed to be approximately 21,450,000 shares of BAC
Common Stock which, in turn, assumes that the number of shares outstanding as
of the Determination Date is the same as the approximately 51,600,000 shares of
Continental Common Stock outstanding as of June 30, 1994. Under the Merger
Agreement, in addition to the impact of the number of shares of Continental
Common Stock outstanding or subject to option at the Determination Date, the
Stock Amount (i) will not change if the average of the closing prices per share
of BAC Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE")
composite transactions tape for the ten consecutive days on which shares of BAC
Common Stock are traded on the NYSE ending on the Determination Date (such
average price, the "Final BAC Stock Price") is between $36.16 (the "Floor
Price") and $55.84 (the "Ceiling Price"), (ii) will be adjusted downward if
the Final BAC Stock Price is greater than the Ceiling Price, and (iii) is
subject to possible adjustment upward if the Final BAC Stock Price is less than
the Floor Price and if BAC elects to make the per share stock and cash
adjustments set forth in the Merger Agreement.

Under the Merger Agreement, the aggregate cash payable by BAC to holders of
record of Continental Common Stock ("Continental Common Stockholders") pursuant
to the Merger will equal a fixed amount regardless of the Final BAC Stock Price
(except for immaterial changes due to rounding) and will vary only according to
the total number of shares of Continental Common Stock outstanding at the
Determination Date. For example, if there are 51,600,000 shares of Continental
Common Stock outstanding at the Determination Date, then the aggregate cash
payable by BAC to Continental Common Stockholders who are to receive cash
will equal approximately $948 million and this will not change (except for
immaterial changes due to rounding) regardless of changes in the Final BAC
Stock Price.

Under the Merger Agreement, if the Final BAC Stock Price is less than the
Floor Price, Continental will have the ability to terminate the Merger Agreement
prior to the Effective Time unless BAC, within five days of Continental's
election to terminate the Merger Agreement, exercises its option to adjust
upward the Stock Consideration, the Cash Consideration and the Stock Amount so
that the Stock Amount will be increased and the Stock Consideration and the Cash
Consideration will be at least equal in value to the per share stock and cash
consideration that would have been received if the Final BAC Stock Price had
been equal to the Floor Price. This adjustment will only be made, at BAC's
option, if the Final BAC Stock Price is less than the Floor Price, and may be
made whether or not Continental has exercised its rights to terminate the Merger
Agreement. If BAC elects to increase the Cash Consideration, the Stock
Consideration and the Stock Amount, then such right of Continental to terminate
the Merger Agreement will be extinguished.

Under the Merger Agreement, if the Final BAC Stock Price is greater than
the Ceiling Price, then the Cash Consideration, the Stock Consideration and the
Stock Amount will be decreased so that the value of the per share cash and stock
consideration that would be receivable by Continental Common Stockholders will
be the same as if the Final BAC Stock Price were equal to the Ceiling Price.
Under the Merger Agreement, such downward adjustment in the Cash Consideration,
the Stock Consideration and the Stock Amount will automatically be made if the
Final BAC Stock Price is greater than the Ceiling Price.

At the Effective Time, subject to certain exceptions, each outstanding
share of Continental Adjustable Rate Preferred Stock, Series 1, $50 stated
value (the "Continental Series 1 Preferred Stock"), and Continental Adjustable
Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 2, $100 stated value (the "Continental
Series 2 Preferred Stock," and collectively with the Continental Series 1
Preferred Stock, the "Continental Preferred Stock") 
5

will be converted into one share of BAC Adjustable Rate Preferred
Stock, Series 1, $50 stated value (the "BAC Series 1 Preferred Stock") and one
share of BAC Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series 2, $100 stated
value (the "BAC Series 2 Preferred Stock," and together with the BAC Series 1
Preferred Stock, the "BAC Mirror Preferred"), respectively. The BAC Series 1
Preferred Stock and the BAC Series 2 Preferred Stock will have substantially
the same terms as the Continental Series 1 Preferred Stock and the Continental
Series 2 Preferred Stock, respectively.

BAC currently anticipates that, after the Effective Time, it may redeem
all or a portion of the BAC Mirror Preferred. The decision to redeem, and the
amount of BAC Mirror Preferred to be so redeemed, are dependent upon receipt of
regulatory approval, interest rates at the time such decision is made and the
aggregate amount of cash and the aggregate value of shares of BAC Common Stock 
to be issued in the Merger, among other things.

The following summarizes the total purchase price:

</TABLE>
The closing of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction of certain 
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. The parties presently
anticipate that the closing will take place on or about August 31, 1994.

The Merger will be accounted for by BAC under the purchase method of
accounting in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 16, 
"Business Combinations" ("APB No. 16"), and accordingly, this method has been
applied in the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements. Under this
method of accounting, the purchase price will be allocated to assets acquired
and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the Effective
Time. Estimates of the fair values of Continental and subsidiaries' assets and
liabilities as of June 30, 1994 have been combined with the recorded
June 30, 1994 values of the assets and liabilities of BAC and subsidiaries
in the unaudited pro forma combined financial statements. However, purchase
accounting adjustment amounts included in these unaudited pro forma combined
financial statements will change as additional information becomes available.
Based upon the available information, management of BAC currently estimates
that the combined company's results of operations in any of the next five 
years will not be significantly affected as a result of purchase accounting.

The unaudited Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet is based on the
consolidated balance sheet of BAC and subsidiaries and on the consolidated
balance sheet of Continental and subsidiaries as of June 30, 1994. The
unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of Operations are based on the
consolidated statements of operations of BAC and subsidiaries and of
Continental and subsidiaries for the six months ended June 30, 1994 and for the
year ended December 31, 1993. In addition, the unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 1993 presents 
Continental's income before cumulative effect of accounting change for 
income taxes.

NOTE B: ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE

The purchase price has been allocated as described in the table below.

Net assets of Continental at June 30, 1994...................... $1,980

-------

Unallocated portion of the purchase price....................... 616
-------
Total purchase price.................................. $2,349
-------
-------
</TABLE>

Each of the allocations in the table above is described in more detail in
the following Notes to Pro Forma Combined Financial Information.

As explained in Note A, purchase accounting adjustments will change as
additional information becomes available, which will have an effect on the
ultimate allocation of the purchase price. Accordingly, the allocation of the
purchase price has not been finalized and the unallocated portion of the
purchase price of $616 million has been separately disclosed in the unaudited
Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet. In addition, the unallocated portion of the
purchase price will change as a result of Continental's results of operations
for periods subsequent to June 30, 1994.

When the ultimate allocation of the purchase price is made, identifiable
intangible assets and goodwill will be recorded and the unallocated portion of
the purchase price will be eliminated from the unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Balance Sheet. For purposes of calculating the amortization of identifiable
intangibles and goodwill, BAC's management has preliminarily estimated that the
amount of identifiable intangibles, including customer list intangibles, will be
approximately $200 million. The remaining amount of the current unallocated
portion of the purchase price has been considered goodwill.

Amortization expense of $20 million for the six months ended June 30, 
1994 and $43 million for the year ended December 31, 1993 related to the 
unallocated portion of the purchase price has been included in the unaudited 
Pro Forma Combined Statements of Operations. These amounts were calculated 
based on an accelerated method of amortization over a 10-year life for the
estimated identifiable intangible balance and on the straight-line method of
amortization over a 25-year life for the estimated goodwill balance. However,
the final amounts and periods of benefit of intangible assets, as well as the
final methods of amortization, have not been determined. An increase in the
amount of the unallocated portion of the purchase price will result in a greater
final allocation to goodwill, which will have a corresponding impact on
amortization expense and will reduce tangible common equity. Accordingly, pro
forma combined income from continuing operations for the six months ended 
June 30, 1994 and for the year ended December 31, 1993 and the related pro 
forma combined per share amounts will change.

NOTE C: AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES

Continental's available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, 
primarily debt securities, have been valued at their estimated fair values 
as of June 30, 1994, resulting in a discount on held-to-maturity securities 
of $4 million from their recorded values. The amortization of this discount 
has been included in the unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statement of Operations 
based on the remaining maturities of the held-to-maturity securities as of 
June 30, 1994.

<PAGE> 8

NOTES TO PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)

NOTE D: LOANS

Continental's carrying value of loans has been adjusted to its estimated
fair value based on interest rates as of June 30, 1994, resulting in a
discount of $59 million.

The discount related to changes in interest rates includes the
effect resulting from futures contracts and interest rate swaps used to hedge
certain loans. The total fair value discount resulting from changes in interest
rates has been amortized to interest income on loans over the estimated
remaining maturities of the related loans, which range from one to seven years.

NOTE E: ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, and consistent with generally 
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and Securities and Exchange Commission 
("SEC") accounting procedures, Continental's reserving policies and practices
will be modified prior to the Effective Time to the degree necessary to make
them consistent with those of BAC. Any resulting adjustments to Continental's
allowance for credit losses are not expected to be significant, will be
recognized in Continental's statement of operations prior to the Effective Time
and, therefore, have not been included in the pro forma combined financial
statements. The pro forma combined allowance for credit losses will also be
affected by other provisions for credit losses or net charge-offs of loans
recorded by BAC or Continental subsequent to June 30, 1994 but prior to the
Effective Time.

NOTE F: OTHER ASSETS

Continental's other assets have been adjusted as described in the table
below.

</TABLE>

A fair value adjustment for trading account assets of $6 million was
recorded for those trading account assets that are traded in illiquid markets.
These trading account assets were generally carried by Continental at the lower
of cost or market value as of June 30, 1994. In addition, a fair value
adjustment for equity investments of $48 million was recorded for those equity
investments that are traded in illiquid markets. As of June 30, 1994,
Continental generally carried these equity investments at cost.

Continental's owned premises have been adjusted to their estimated fair 
values as of June 30, 1994 based on preliminary appraisals, valuations and other
review procedures. Occupancy expense in the unaudited Pro Forma Combined
Statements of Operations has been decreased by $1 million for the six months
ended June 30, 1994 and by $2 million for the year ended December 31, 1993 to
reflect amortization of the fair value adjustment to owned premises using the
straight-line method over 33 years.

A net deferred tax asset was recorded related to the book and tax bases
differences of assets acquired and liabilities assumed that resulted from
purchase accounting adjustments. Also, additional deferred tax assets were
recorded for previously unrecognized

NOTES TO PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)

tax benefits of Continental that are expected to be realized in the future from
the combined results of operations.

NOTE G: DEPOSITS

Continental's total deposits have been adjusted to their estimated fair
values as of June 30, 1994 based on interest rates as of that date. The
estimated fair value premium of $97 million relates to both domestic and
foreign deposits and includes futures contracts and interest rate swaps used to
hedge certain of these deposits. The premium has been amortized to offset
interest expense over the estimated lives of the deposits, which range from one
to ten years.

NOTE H: OTHER LIABILITIES

Other liabilities have been adjusted as described in the table below.

</TABLE>

A liability of $104 million was recorded for the intrinsic value of
Continental stock options outstanding at June 30, 1994. This liability 
represents the total of the differences between the option exercise prices 
and the value of the anticipated per share consideration to be received by 
Continental Common Stockholders in the Merger. This liability will be adjusted 
downward at the Effective Time to reflect the number of Continental stock 
options outstanding that will be converted to BAC stock options.

The accrual of the pension and postretirement benefit liability represents
the recognition of the existing benefit obligation related to Continental's
supplemental retirement plan and postretirement healthcare plan.

Continental's lease commitments have been adjusted to their estimated
fair values based on market rental rates as of June 30, 1994. The fair
value adjustment resulted in a liability of $12 million related to leased
premises. The fair value adjustment related to these leased premises has been
amortized to offset occupancy expense using the straight-line method over the
remaining lives of the respective lease terms, which range from one to twenty
years. A reduction to occupancy expense of $4 million for the six months ended
June 30, 1994 and of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 1993 has been 
included in the unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of Operations related 
to the estimated amortization of this fair value adjustment.

In addition, a liability for Continental Merger-related costs of $24 
million has been recorded in the unaudited Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet, 
reflecting management's best estimate of separation and benefits costs related
to Continental employees and employment assistance costs for separated 
Continental employees.

NOTE I: LONG-TERM DEBT AND SUBORDINATED CAPITAL NOTES

Continental's long-term debt has been adjusted to its estimated fair value
as of June 30, 1994 based on interest rates as of that date. The estimated
fair value premium of $65 million includes the effect of futures

9
<PAGE> 10

NOTES TO PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)

contracts and interest rate swaps used to hedge certain long-term debt
instruments. The total fair value premium has been amortized to offset interest
expense over the estimated lives of the instruments, which range from one to ten
years.

NOTE J: STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

Continental's stockholders' equity balances have been eliminated.

At the Effective Time, the Continental Preferred Stock will be converted 
into an equal number of shares of BAC Mirror Preferred. The BAC Mirror
Preferred is included in the unaudited Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet at its
estimated market value as of January 27, 1994. The fair value premium of $26
million over the $389 million stated value of the BAC Mirror Preferred has been
included in additional paid-in capital.

As explained in Note A, Continental's Common Stock will be converted
into approximately 21,450,000 shares of BAC Common Stock at the Effective Time
at an aggregate market value of approximately $981 million based on the market
price of BAC Common Stock as of January 27, 1994. In addition, BAC repurchased
approximately 11,780,000 shares of BAC Common Stock for $500 million prior to
June 30, 1994. The unaudited Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet assumes these
treasury shares will be issued, resulting in a decrease to treasury stock of
$500 million and an increase to additional paid-in capital of $39 million.
After consideration of treasury stock, the number of shares of newly issued BAC
Common Stock will be reduced to approximately 9,670,000 shares. Common stock
and additional paid-in capital have been increased by $15 million and $427
million, respectively, representing the value of the approximately 9,670,000
shares of newly issued BAC Common Stock.

BAC's retained earnings have been reduced by $18 million for BAC
Merger-related expenses, net of applicable income taxes (see Note K).

NOTE K: BAC MERGER-RELATED EXPENSES

A Merger-related liability of $30 million has been recorded in the 
unaudited Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet to reflect management's best 
estimate of separation and benefits costs related to BAC employees, employment
assistance costs for separated BAC employees, systems conversion costs, and 
other expenses of BAC associated with the Merger. This liability resulted in a
$18 million charge (after applicable income tax effects of $12 million) to 
retained earnings in the unaudited Pro Forma Combined Balance Sheet (see Notes
F, H, and J). These BAC Merger-related expenses are subject to change as 
further information becomes available. BAC Merger-related expenses will be
recorded at or immediately prior to the Effective Time and have not been
included in the unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of Operations.

NOTE L: PROVISION FOR (BENEFIT FROM) INCOME TAXES

The provision for (benefit from) income taxes has been increased by $50
million for the six months ended June 30, 1994 and by $121 million for the year
ended December 31, 1993 in the unaudited Pro Forma Combined Statements of 
Operations to remove tax benefits that would not be reflected in the
statement of operations under purchase accounting and to reflect the tax
provision for purchase accounting adjustments and for state tax expense on
Continental's results of operations if the Merger had been effective
on January 1, 1993. The related tax provision for the amortization of fair value
adjustments for the six months ended June 30, 1994 and for the year ended 
December 31, 1993 has been included in the unaudited Pro Forma Combined 
Statements of Operations.

NOTE M: EARNINGS PER SHARE

Primary earnings per share are computed by dividing income from continuing
operations applicable to common shareholders (income from continuing operations
reduced by dividends on preferred stock) by the

10
<PAGE> 11

NOTES TO PRO FORMA COMBINED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (CONTINUED)

total of the average number of common shares outstanding and the additional
dilutive effect of the stock options and warrants outstanding during the period.
The dilutive effect of the stock options and warrants is computed using the
average market price of BAC Common Stock for the period.

Fully-diluted earnings per share are computed based on the average number
of common shares outstanding during the period and the additional dilutive
effect of stock options and warrants outstanding during the period. The dilutive
effect of outstanding stock options and warrants is computed using the greater
of the closing market price or the average market price of BAC Common Stock for
the period. In addition, fully-diluted earnings per share for the six months 
ended June 30, 1994 and for the year ended December 31, 1993 for BAC included 
the additional dilution that would result if BAC's outstanding shares of 6 1/2% 
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series G (the "BAC Series G Preferred")
had been converted at the beginning of the period. Correspondingly, income 
from continuing operations applicable to common stock was adjusted for 
dividends declared on the BAC Series G Preferred.

As explained in Note A, Continental's Common Stock will be converted into
approximately 21,450,000 shares of BAC Common Stock at the Effective Time. In
addition, BAC repurchased approximately 11,780,000 shares of BAC Common Stock 
for $500 million prior to June 30, 1994. The unaudited Pro Forma Combined 
Balance Sheet assumes that these treasury shares will be issued to Continental 
Common Stockholders. After consideration of treasury stock, the number of 
shares of newly issued BAC Common Stock will be reduced to approximately 
9,670,000 shares.

BANKAMERICA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES AND
CONTINENTAL BANK CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
HISTORICAL AND PRO FORMA COMBINED RATIOS OF EARNINGS
TO FIXED CHARGES AND RATIOS OF EARNINGS TO
COMBINED FIXED CHARGES AND PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS

The ratio of earnings to fixed charges is computed by dividing earnings by
fixed charges. The ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred
stock dividends is computed by dividing earnings by the sum of fixed charges
and preferred stock dividend requirements. Earnings consist primarily of income
(loss) before income taxes adjusted for fixed charges. Fixed charges consist
primarily of interest expense on short- and long-term borrowings and one-third
(the portion deemed representative of the interest factor) of net rents under
long-term leases.

The following table sets forth (i) the historical ratios of earnings to 
fixed charges and the ratios of earnings to combined fixed charges and
preferred stock dividends for the periods indicated for BankAmerica Corporation
and its consolidated subsidiaries ("BAC") and for Continental Bank Corporation
and its consolidated subsidiaries ("Continental") and (ii) the pro forma
combined ratios of earnings to fixed charges and ratios of earnings to combined
fixed charges and preferred stock dividends for the periods indicated, giving
effect to the merger provided for in the Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger
dated as of January 27, 1994 between BAC and Continental (the "Merger") as if
it had been consummated on January 1, 1993. The pro forma combined ratios do
not give effect to the proposed BAC acquisitions of Liberty Bank and United
Mortgage Holding Company and subsidiaries as these transactions were not
considered significant to BAC and subsidiaries. The pro forma combined ratios
have been calculated using the pro forma combined financial information for the
six months ended June 30,1994 and for the year ended December 31, 1993, and
should be read in conjunction with and are qualified in their entirety by such
pro forma combined financial information at Exhibit 99.a of BAC's report on
Form 8-K dated August 11, 1994, and the consolidated financial statements,
including the accompanying notes, of BAC and Continental included in their
respective 1993 Form 10-Ks and second quarter 1994 Form 10-Qs and elsewhere in
BAC's report on Form 8-K dated August 11, 1994. Pro forma adjustments made to
arrive at the pro forma combined ratios are based on the purchase method of
accounting and a preliminary allocation of the purchase price. However, changes
to the adjustments already included in the pro forma combined ratios set forth
on the following pages are expected as evaluations of assets and liabilities
are completed and additional information becomes available. In addition, the
results of operations of Continental subsequent to June 30, 1994 will affect
the allocation of the purchase price. Accordingly, the final pro forma combined 
ratios are expected to differ from those set forth on the following pages.

The pro forma combined ratios are intended for informational purposes and
are not necessarily indicative of the future ratios of earnings to fixed
charges and ratios of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock
dividends of the combined company or the ratios of earnings to fixed charges
and ratios of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends
of the combined company that would have actually occurred had the Merger been
effective on January 1, 1993.
