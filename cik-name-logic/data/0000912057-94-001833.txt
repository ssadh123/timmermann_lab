ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

LEEWARDS CREATIVE CRAFTS, INC. ACQUISITION

On May 10, 1994, Michaels Stores, Inc. ("Michaels" or the "Company")
announced that it had signed a definitive merger agreement (the "Agreement and
Plan of Merger") for the acquisition (the "Leewards Acquisition") of Leewards
Creative Crafts, Inc. ("Leewards"), an Illinois-based arts and crafts retailer
with approximately 100 stores located primarily in the midwestern and
northeastern United States (the "Merger"). Following the Leewards Acquisition,
the Company expects to close approximately 20 Leewards stores and four Company
stores due to overlapping locations.

The Agreement and Plan of Merger provides for an aggregate merger
consideration not to exceed 1,550,000 shares of the Michaels common stock, par
value $.10 per share ("Michaels Common Stock"). The aggregate consideration is
(i) subject to certain downward adjustments and (ii) payable, in part, in cash
in lieu of shares with respect to the net value of outstanding options to
purchase Leewards common stock, par value $.01 per share. Upon consummation of
the Merger, the Company will also repay the indebtedness under Leewards' bank
credit facility and subordinated notes. The Agreement and Plan of Merger
provides that if the Company consummates an underwritten offering of Michaels
Common stock on or before the closing of the Merger (a "Common Stock Offering")
resulting in either: (i) net proceeds per share of at least $42.00, the total
number of shares of Michaels Common Stock to be issued in connection with the
Merger shall be reduced by a number of shares (the "Reduced Share Number") equal
to 25% of the total number of shares sold in such offering excluding the
underwriters overallotment option (not to exceed 750,000 shares), and, in lieu
thereof, cash equal to the net proceeds per share multiplied by the Reduced
Share Number shall be distributed in connection with the Merger or (ii) net
proceeds per share of at least $39.00, the total number of shares of Michaels
Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger shall be reduced by a
number of shares (the "Alternate Reduced Share Number") equal to 25% of the
total number of shares sold in such offering excluding the underwriters
overallotment option (not to exceed 500,000 shares), and, in lieu thereof, cash
equal to the net proceeds per share multiplied by the Alternate Reduced Share
Number shall be distributed in connection with the Merger. The determination
of whether (i) or (ii) above applies to the Common Stock Offering shall be
determined by notice from Leewards to the Company on or before June 5, 1994.
If Leewards fails to provide such notice, Leewards shall be deemed to have
elected (ii) above. The Company has filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3
(No. 33-53639), which contemplates a public offering of Michaels Common Stock.
Consummation of the Merger is subject to customary conditions to closing,
including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, there having occurred no
material adverse changes in the condition (financial or otherwise), operations,
assets or liabilities of the Company or Leewards and approval of the Merger by
Leewards' shareholders (including termination of certain Leewards stockholders
agreements and warrants). The transaction is expected to close on or before
July 31, 1994.

OTHER ACQUISITIONS

In February 1994, the Company acquired Treasure House Stores, Inc., a
chain of nine arts and crafts stores operating primarily in the Seattle market,
for 280,000 shares of Michaels Common Stock. In April 1994, the Company
acquired the affiliated arts and crafts store chains of Oregon Craft & Floral,
with eight stores located primarily in the Portland, Oregon area, and H&H
Craft & Floral, with eight stores located in southern California, for a total
of 455,000 shares of Michaels Common Stock. All of these acquired stores will
be converted to the Michaels format with grand openings scheduled for May
through August of this year.

pre-opening costs deferred by Leewards consistent with the Company's

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

Board of Directors
Leewards Creative Crafts, Inc.
Elgin, Illinois

We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Leewards Creative Crafts,
Inc. as of January 30, 1994 and January 31, 1993 and the related statements of
operations, of redeemable preferred stock and common stockholders' equity, and
of cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Leewards Creative Crafts, Inc. as of January
30, 1994 and January 31, 1993 and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for the years then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

As discussed in Note 11, the Company has entered into an Agreement and Plan
of Merger (the "Agreement") whereby it will become a wholly owned subsidiary of
Michaels Stores, Inc. ("Michaels"). The Agreement also provides that
simultaneously with the merger closing, Michaels shall cause the Company to
repay its long-term debt.

1. SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

OPERATIONS AND RESTRUCTURING

The Company engages in the retail sale of craft and home decor products. The
Company maintained the following number of Company-operated and franchised
stores at:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
COMPANY-
OPERATED FRANCHISES TOTAL
-------- ---------- -----
<S> <C> <C> <C>
January 30, 1994............................... 99 3 102
January 31, 1993............................... 85 2 87
</TABLE>

During the year ended January 31, 1993, the Company effected a restructuring
of its debt (Note 4), capital structure (Note 6) and ongoing operations. Costs
associated with these efforts, other than those directly associated with the
debt and capital restructurings, are included in restructuring expenses. Such
expenses include store closing, severance and other costs incurred in connection
with these efforts.

FISCAL YEAR-END -- The Company's fiscal year-end is the Sunday closest to
January 31.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS -- Cash and cash equivalents include cash; amounts
due from major credit card companies, which are collected within 1 to 2 days
after date of sale; and highly liquid investments which, at time of purchase,
have maturities of three months or less.

MERCHANDISE INVENTORIES -- Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower
of last-in, first-out (LIFO) cost or market. During the year ended January 31,
1993, LIFO inventories were reduced from levels at the beginning of the year.
These reductions resulted in liquidation of LIFO inventory quantities carried at
the lower costs prevailing in the prior year as compared with the cost of the
current year's purchases. At January 30, 1994 and January 31, 1993, inventory
was valued at market which was lower than LIFO cost.

PRE-OPENING COSTS -- Pre-opening costs incurred for the opening of retail
locations are deferred and amortized over 12 months, commencing in the month
after the location opens. Unamortized deferred pre-opening costs included in
prepaid expenses were $2,208,000 and $97,000 at January 30, 1994 and January 31,
1993, respectively.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT -- Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation and amortization are provided on the straight-line method over the
estimated useful lives of the respective assets, which are as follows:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Buildings and improvements.................. 25-30 years
Leasehold improvements...................... Shorter of lease term or 10 years
Machinery and equipment..................... 3-10 years
</TABLE>

INTANGIBLE ASSETS -- Intangible assets, primarily the trade name, and
favorable lease agreements, are reported net of accumulated amortization. The
assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over their useful lives
which range from 3 to 40 years.

INCOME TAXES -- The Company adopted SFAS No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes," in the year ended January 31, 1993 and, accordingly, computes deferred
taxes using the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recorded based on differences between the financial statements and income tax
basis of assets and liabilities and the tax rate in effect when these
differences are expected to reverse.

</TABLE>

(a) In August 1988, the Company entered into a secured revolving credit and
term loan agreement (the "agreement") which enabled the Company to borrow up to
a maximum of $25,000,000. On June 13, 1990, the Company restructured the
agreement to provide for additional borrowings up to $32,000,000 through August
19, 1993. On April 2, 1993 the borrowing limit was reduced to $29,920,000.

Borrowings outstanding under the agreement are (in 000's):

Total.................................................................... $ 15,525 $ 7,348
----------- -----------

</TABLE>

The borrowings under the agreement are collateralized by the assets of the
Company. Interest is payable monthly based on the rate of interest publicly
announced by Citibank in New York, New York as Citibank's "base rate" ("Base
Rate"). In the year ended January 30, 1994, the interest rate was

F-10
<PAGE>
LEEWARDS CREATIVE CRAFTS, INC.
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
YEARS ENDED JANUARY 30, 1994 AND JANUARY 31, 1993

4. LONG-TERM DEBT (CONTINUED)
Base Rate plus 2% for the period from February 1, 1993 to April 2, 1993 and Base
Rate plus 1.75% for the period from April 3, 1993 to January 30, 1994. During
the prior year ended January 31, 1993, the interest rate was Base Rate plus 5%
for the period from February 3, 1992 to June 22, 1992 and Base Rate plus 2% for
the period from June 23, 1992 to January 31, 1993. In the year ended January 30,
1994, the interest rate fluctuated between 7.75% and 8.0% and was 7.75% at
year-end; in the prior year, the rate fluctuated between 8.0% and 11.5% and was
8.0% at year-end.

Under the revolving credit loan, as restructured, the full availability of
this credit line is contingent on the cost of collateralized inventory, less
certain adjustments. Commitment fees on the revolving loan are one-half of one
percent of the average daily unused portion of the total facility, payable
monthly.

The term loan, as restructured, requires quarterly principal payments of
$413,750 and the balance on August 19, 1994.

The Company is in the preliminary stages of negotiating a new and expanded
credit facility.

In consideration for expanding the credit facility, the Company paid a
one-time fee of $200,000 and issued warrants to Citicorp to purchase 3,250
shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share, subject to adjustment
under certain antidilution provisions. The warrants are exercisable from the
date of issuance at $141.65 per share and expire the later of June 13, 1995 or
upon full payment of the credit facility.

The agreement has covenants providing for mandatory prepayment provisions
and requiring the Company to meet specified financial ratios and income tests.
Such tests include, but are not limited to, net worth and earnings before
interest, depreciation and taxes. The covenants impose limitations on, among
other things, the amount of capital expenditures for each year, creating or
incurring liens, and selling assets or granting guarantees, and prohibit
declaring or paying dividends on common stock unless specifically permitted
under the terms of the agreement. The Company has received waivers for all
events of noncompliance with such covenants during the fiscal year ended January
31, 1993. The Company was not in compliance with all covenants at January 30,
1994. Accordingly, at that date, all amounts outstanding under the agreement are
due on demand (See Note 11).

(b) In August 1988, the Company sold $14,884,000 of subordinated debentures
to a related party. Interest is payable semi-annually at 13.5%. Annual principal
payments of $3,742,000 begin May 15, 1997 and the remaining balance is due May
15, 2000. Included in interest expense are $2,285,000 and $2,137,000 for the
years ended January 30, 1994 and January 31, 1993, respectively, for the
indebtedness.

The debentures contain covenants, including limitations on indebtedness,
liens, and the incurrence of other subordinated indebtedness, and restrict
payments such as dividends on common stock. The Company has received waivers for
all events of noncompliance with such covenants during the fiscal year ended
January 31, 1993. At January 30, 1994, because of cross default provisions with
respect to the agreement referred to in (a) above, all amounts outstanding at
that date under the subordinated debentures also are due on demand and have been
classified as currently payable (See Note 11).

(c) RESTRUCTURING -- On June 22, 1992, the subordinated debentures were
restructured and amended to provide, among other things, for the interest
payments due on May 15 and November 15, 1992 to be made in the form of
additional promissory notes ("accrual notes") in the principal amount of the
interest payable at each date. The accrual notes will bear interest at 13.5% per
annum, payable semi-annually, and $1,038,000 is due on March 15, 1994 with the
balance due on November 15, 1994.

4. LONG-TERM DEBT (CONTINUED)
In addition, an acquirer of the Class C Senior Convertible Stock (Note 6)
acquired $5,000,000 of the subordinated debentures.

Scheduled principal maturities of long-term debt classified as current for
fiscal years subsequent to January 30, 1994 are as follows (in 000's):

</TABLE>

Unamortized deferred financing costs of $656,000 and $892,000 at January 30,
1994 and January 31, 1993, respectively, consist of professional and commitment
fees incurred in connection with the Company's revolving and term loan facility
and subordinated debentures. Such costs are being amortized on a straight-line
basis over the terms of the related debt.

5. PENSION PLAN
The Company has a defined benefit pension plan for its hourly workers with
benefits based on a fixed dollar rate per year of service. The plan assets are
invested primarily in short-term bonds and in equity securities. The Company's
funding policy is to contribute annually the minimum amount required by the
applicable Internal Revenue Code regulation. In April 1992, as part of a series
of cost reductions, the Company froze the hourly pension plan. As a result,
there will be no new entrants to the plan and no additional benefits accruing to
current participants beyond those earned as of the date the plan was frozen.

The following presents the funded status of the plan (in 000's):
