FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
- ---------------------

THE CIT GROUP REPORTS RECORD 1993 NET INCOME OF $182.3 MILLION,
---------------------------------------------------------------

12.3 PERCENT INCREASE OVER 1992
-------------------------------

NEW YORK, NEW YORK, JANUARY 13, 1994 --- The CIT Group Holdings, Inc.,
one of the nation's leading asset-based finance companies, today announced
record 1993 net income of $182.3 million, an increase of 12.3 percent
compared with $162.3 million in 1992. The current year results represent
the third consecutive year of record earnings and are the highest earnings
in the Corporation's eighty-six year history.

"CIT had an outstanding year in 1993," said Albert R. Gamper, Jr.,
president and CEO. "In a year in which we were challenged by high start-up
costs associated with our consumer finance operation and the significant
impact from the change in our Federal income tax rate, we were able to
record our sixth consecutive year of earnings growth," he added.
<PAGE>
"CIT's asset growth in 1993 was strong and our credit quality was
excellent. Perhaps more importantly, our profitability was broad-based,
confirming the validity of our strategy to continue to develop an
organization along multiple business lines. At the end of all the
analysis, it still comes down to the quality of people, and the 2500 CIT
employees turned out a tremendous effort in 1993. That effort resulted in
the growth, the credit quality and the overall performance of CIT," said
Gamper. "We are entering 1994 with a good deal of momentum," he continued.

Other financial highlights for 1993 include:
- Finance receivables and equipment under operating lease totaled
a record $13.4 billion at December 31, 1993, up 9.3 percent from
$12.2 billion at year-end 1992. The Corporation's operating units,
particularly Industrial Financing and Credit Finance, experienced
strong middle market growth in 1993 including a portfolio purchase
of approximately $264 million by Industrial Financing in December
1993.
- Net interest revenue of $673.9 million rose 8.2 percent from
$622.8 million in 1992, reflecting the strong growth in financing
and leasing assets, and higher fee income in several operating
units.
- Gains on asset sales were $23.9 million in 1993 reflecting a
third quarter gain from the securitization of manufactured housing
<PAGE>
receivables and the sale of assets coming off lease. In 1992, such
gains were $13.9 million.
- Net charge-offs declined to $94.4 million, or .77 percent of
average finance receivables, compared to $98.3 million, or .84
percent of average finance receivables in 1992.
- Operating expenses before the provision for credit losses
amounted to $282.2 million, or 2.30 percent of average earning
assets, compared to $261.6 million, or 2.30 percent of average
earning assets in 1992, reflecting the introduction of the consumer
finance operation and normal expense increases. Excluding the
consumer finance unit, operating expenses as a percent of average
earning assets declined to 2.20 percent in 1993 from 2.28 percent
last year, reflecting the corporation's commitment to expense
control coupled with the strong asset growth in 1993.
- Finance receivables past due 60 days or more were $216.1 million
(1.71 percent of finance receivables) at December 31, 1993, down
from $335.8 million (2.85 percent of finance receivables) at year-
end 1992. Past due receivables on nonaccrual status totaled $139.9
million (1.11 percent of finance receivables) at December 31, 1993,
compared to $234.2 million (1.99 percent of finance receivables) at
year-end 1992.
- Assets received in the settlement of loans declined to
$87.0 million at December 31, 1993, from $93.8 million at December
31, 1992.
