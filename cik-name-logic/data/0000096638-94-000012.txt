Item 5. Other Events.

On July 20, 1994 Advanta Corp. announced record quarterly
earnings for the second quarter 1994 with net income of $25.8
million and earnings per share of $.63, increases of 39% and 37%,
respectively, over the $18.5 million and $.46 per share (before
extraordinary item) results for the second quarter 1993. Earnings
for the first quarter 1994 totalled $24.9 million or $.61 per
share. From June 1993, the Company's portfolio of managed
receivables increased by $1.8 billion or 44% to $5.9 billion at
June 30, 1994. Earnings per share for all periods reflect the
October 15, 1993 three-for-two stock split.

During the quarter, the Company sold $150 million of credit card
relationships. The gain on the transaction was fully offset by an
increase in marketing and developmental expenditures and an increase 
in the general loan loss reserves.

Highlights for the second quarter include the following items:

Managed credit card receivables at June 30 of $4.5 billion
posted a 55% increase over the $2.9 billion level last June.

The managed credit card 30+ day delinquency rate fell to 2.0%,
from 2.9% in the second quarter last year.

The charge-off rate on managed credit cards dropped to 2.7%,
compared to 4.0% a year ago.

The Company added over 344,000 new credit card accounts during
the quarter compared to 249,000 in the second quarter of 1993.

The managed net interest margin for the quarter fell to 6.95%
from 7.38% in the first quarter, and 7.72% in the comparable
period of 1993 due to introductory pricing on credit cards and
a lag in the repricing from the multiple changes in the prime
rate during the quarter.
