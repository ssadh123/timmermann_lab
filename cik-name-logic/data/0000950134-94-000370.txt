Item 5. Other Events

On April 4, 1994, the Trust Managers adopted amendments to the Second
Amended and Restated By-Laws of the Trust which eliminate the requirement that
the Trust furnish to its shareholders summary reports by an independent
appraisal firm disclosing the results of year-end appraisals of the current
fair market value of the Trust's real estate investments. The amendments are
effective as of January 1, 1994. The Trust Managers believe that the
elimination of the appraisal requirement is consistent with real estate
investment trust industry practice and that the expeditures for these
appraisals were unnecessary due to the removal of the limited term restriction
from the Declaration of Trust, which was approved by the affirmative vote of
81.2% of the shareholders on October 22, 1993.
