Item 5. Other Events.

a. Beginning on August 1, 1994, work stopped at James River
Corporation of Virginia's ("James River") Lexington,
Kentucky, manufacturing plant as a result of a strike by the
local union following the expiration of the existing labor
contract. During August, negotiations were conducted and the
union voted to return to work. Normal operations resumed at
the Lexington mill on August 22, 1994.

b. James River has been sued in Morgan County, Alabama, in a
purported class action brought on behalf of certain former
holders of James River's 10-3/4% Debentures due October 1,
2018. Most of these Debentures were retired by means of a
tender offer to all holders commenced on September 18, 1992.
The remainder were redeemed on November 2, 1992. Merrill
Lynch & Co., which acted as James River's dealer manager for
the tender, is also named as a defendant. The complaint
alleges violations of a covenant prohibiting use of lower
cost borrowed funds to redeem the Debentures before October
1, 1998, and of various disclosure obligations, and seeks
damages in excess of $50 million plus punitive damages of at
least $500 million. James River believes that these claims
are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously.

c. On September 3, 1994, the Inlandboatman's Union of the
Columbia River Region, representing 270 hourly employees at
James River's Western Transportation facilities, rejected
management's offer addressing wages and health care benefits
and went on strike. These operations provide warehouse space
and tug and barge systems that serve multiple customers.
Salaried employees, retirees, and temporary workers are
being utilized to continue to provide these services during
the strike period. As of September 14, 1994, the strike is
still underway.
