SALOMON INC TO REPORT A NET LOSS FOR THE 1994 THIRD QUARTER

New York, October 6, 1994 - Salomon Inc today announced that
it will report an aftertax loss of approximately $100
million for the 1994 third quarter. Final quarterly results
will be released on or about October 20. The majority of
the loss was attributable to adverse results for Salomon
Brothers' Proprietary Trading Businesses which historically
have tended to be volatile. Salomon Brothers' Client-Driven
Businesses which continued to be affected by weakness in
underwriting volume and customer trading activity will also
report a loss, although results improved significantly from
the second quarter. The Phibro Division, the Company's
commodities trading business, will also report a modest
pretax loss this quarter.

Given the difficult market environment for its Client-Driven
Businesses, Salomon Brothers is closely reviewing the pace
of new initiatives.
