Item 5. Other Events

On August 5, 1994, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, in a 2-1
vote, denied Idaho Power's request for $11.5 million in interim
rate relief.

In its general rate case application filed June 30, 1994, the
Company included major capital improvements at two hydroelectric
facilities (Milner and Swan Falls) and indicated its desire to
begin recovering these additional costs through interim rates.

The Commission Staff and Intervenors presented testimony that
interim rate relief is extraordinary relief to be used only in
extraordinary situations.

Two of the three commissioners supported the Staff's and
Intervenors' contention that a financial emergency or immediate
need must be shown before allowing Idaho Power interim rate
relief. They contended that the timing of the rate case filing
was in the Company's control; that the power cost adjustment
mechanism sufficiently insulates the Company from power cost
fluctuations; and determined that recovery on the Milner and Swan
Falls investments should occur through the usual process in
considering the Company's request for permanent rate relief. One
of the three commissioners voted to approve the interim increase.

The Company intends to proceed as planned in its general rate
case. This order denying interim rate relief should have no
bearing or impact on that effort. The Commission has tentatively
set the week of October 10, 1994 for cross-examination of the
Company witnesses. The Idaho PUC Staff and Intervenors will pre-
file testimony on November 22, 1994 with hearings commencing on
December 12, 1994.
