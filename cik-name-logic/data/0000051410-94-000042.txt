Report of Independent Accountants

July 29, 1994

To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of
Leprino Foods Company

In our opinion, the accompanying balance sheet and the related 
statements of income and of cash flows present fairly, in all material 
respects, the financial position of Leprino Foodservice Distribution 
(a division of Leprino Foods Company) at June 4, 1994, October 30, 
1993, and October 31, 1992, and the results of its operations and its 
cash flows for the 31 weeks ended June 4, 1994 and for each of the two 
years in the period ended October 30, 1993, in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles. These financial statements 
are the responsibility of the Division's management; our 
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements 
based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in 
accordance with generally accepted auditing standards which require 
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance 
about whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, 
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates 
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement 
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for the opinion expressed above.

(A DIVISION OF LEPRINO FOODS COMPANY)

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1:

General Information

Leprino Foodservice Distribution (FSD, a division of Leprino Foods 
Company) serves customers in the foodservice industry through a full-
line foodservice distribution network which supplies primarily pizza and 
select limited menu multi-unit establishments.

On June 17, 1994, Leprino Foods Company (LFC) and its principal 
shareholder (Shareholder) signed an agreement in principle (Agreement) 
providing for the sale of substantially all of the net assets of LFC's 
foodservice distribution business to a wholly-owned subsidiary of 
International Multifoods Corporation. The Agreement also calls for the 
sale by the Shareholder of three distribution warehouses owned by the 
Shareholder and currently leased by FSD. Additionally, the Agreement 
provides for certain other definitive agreements which include a cheese 
supply agreement that sets forth the buyer's minimum purchase 
obligations for LFC's cheese products over a five-year period and a non-
compete agreement precluding LFC from re-entering the foodservice 
distribution business in the United States for a minimum of five years.

Sales to a significant franchise concept represented 25.9% of FSD's 
sales in 1994, 25.0% in 1993 and 22.9% in 1992. No individual 
franchisee accounted for sales in excess of 10% in any period presented.

Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation: The accompanying financial statements present 
FSD as if it had existed as a company separate from LFC and includes the 
historical assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses that are directly 
related to LFC's foodservice distribution business.

FSD's financial statements include all the direct costs of operating the 
business. General and administrative expenses specifically incurred by 
LFC on behalf of FSD were included while costs which were not incurred 
specifically for any of LFC's divisions were allocated to FSD based on 
relative assets employed during each period. Management believes the 
foregoing allocations were made on a reasonable basis. Nonetheless, the 
financial information included herein may not necessarily reflect the 
financial position and results of operations of FSD in the future or 
what the financial position or results of operations of FSD would have 
been as a separate, stand-alone company during the periods presented.

Fiscal year: LFC and FSD utilize a 52 or 53 week convention, with each 
year ending on the Saturday nearest October 31. Fiscal years 1992 and 
1993 were both 52 weeks. Financial information presented for 1994 is 
for the 31 week period ended June 4, 1994. Due to the seasonal nature 
of FSD's business, the results of operations for the 31 weeks ended June 
4, 1994 are not necessarily representative of such results for a full 
fiscal period.

Accounts receivable and accounts payable: The carrying amount of the 
accounts receivable and accounts payable balances approximate their fair 
value.

Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, 
with cost determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method.

Interdivisional payable: The interdivisional payable balance reflects 
the interdivisional financing requirements necessary to reflect FSD as a 
separate entity assuming no interdivisional balances were outstanding at 
June 4, 1994. No provision for interest has been made on such 
interdivisional balances.

Property, plant and equipment: Land, building, and equipment are 
capitalized at cost. Depreciation is provided on the straight-line 
method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Ordinary repair 
and maintenance are expensed as incurred.

Debt: None of the indebtedness of LFC has been secured or 
collateralized by the assets employed in FSD, and accordingly, there 
were no debt instruments or interest costs reflected.

Cash: The only cash allocated to FSD were the nominal petty cash 
balances maintained at the distribution centers.

NOTE 2 - Receivables

Receivables consist of the following (in thousands):

June 4, October 30, October 31,
1994 1993 1992

Trade $23,076 $20,112 $17,412
Other 761 1,114 440
Allowance for
doubtful accounts (1,111) (1,084) (2,798)

$22,726 $20,142 $15,054

In 1991, FSD established a $2.4 million reserve for the possible bad 
debt from a major customer. Due to improved circumstances, a portion of 
this reserve was reversed in 1993, resulting in an increase to net 
income of $1.9 million.

NOTE 3 - Inventories

Inventories consist of the following (in thousands):

June 4, October 30, October 31,
1994 1993 1992

Resale products $22,057 $21,249 $16,988
Supplies 313 295 312

$22,370 $21,544 $17,300

NOTE 4 - Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment consist of the following (in thousands):

Less - accumulated
depreciation (12,507) (11,756) (11,382)

$19,083 $17,748 $18,735

NOTE 5 - Income taxes

LFC is taxed as an S Corporation under the Internal Revenue Code. As 
such, it is not directly liable for federal and, with certain 
exceptions, state income taxes. Rather, LFC's income, deductions, 
losses and credits pass directly through to its stockholders and such 
amounts are included in their individual income tax returns. The 
provision for income taxes for FSD is based upon managements' estimate 
of those state income taxes applicable to FSD.

NOTE 6 - Commitments

LFC leases certain transportation equipment, distribution warehouses, 
and computer equipment applicable to FSD. These leases are accounted 
for as operating leases. The transportation equipment leases expire at 
various times over the next one to seven years and provide for month-to-
month renewals at the end of the primary terms. The facility leases 
generally contain renewal options and escalation clauses and expire over 
the next three years. Minimum gross rental commitments under these 
leases at October 30, 1993 are as follows (in thousands):

1994 $2,905
1995 1,620
1996 1,142
1997 901
1998 503
Thereafter 109

$7,180

Three of the FSD warehouses are leased from the Shareholder. These 
leases expire in 1994. Rental expense under these leases was $516,000 
in 1994, $906,000 in 1993, and $988,000 in 1992. 

Aggregate rental expense under all operating leases was $1,541,000 in 
1994, $2,484,000 in 1993, and $1,960,000 in 1992.

NOTE 7 - Employee benefit plans

All full-time employees who have at least one year of continuous 
employment are eligible to participate in the LFC's profit sharing plan. 
LFC's contribution is determined annually by its Board of Directors. 
The portion of the contribution allocated to the employees supporting 
FSD was $1,214,000 in 1993, and $839,000 in 1992. FSD has accrued 
$510,000 in the 1994 results of operations. LFC's policy is to fund 
amounts accrued. The Company may terminate this plan at any time.

LFC has a deferred compensation plan for certain key employees which 
provides long-term incentives and an opportunity to participate in the 
equity appreciation of LFC. Awards under the plan are based upon a 
combination of measured individual performance and financial performance 
of LFC. Vested benefits at the time of retirement, death, disability or 
severance of employment are payable in ten annual installments at the 
time of retirement. The expense for this plan associated with the 
eligible employees engaged directly in FSD totaled $76,000 in 1994, 
$129,000 in 1993, and $102,000 in 1992. Such amounts have not been 
funded. The deferred compensation plan has specific provisions for the 
sale of a division. Upon completion of the sale of FSD, the affected 
key employees will no longer be participants of the plan and their 
balances will be fully vested and the associated liability may be 
funded. LFC has not determined the additional cost of this occurrence 
but the amount is not expected to be significant.

LFC established a retirement savings plan (401(k) Plan) on January 1, 
1993, under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Employees who 
are at least 21 years old and who have completed one year of eligible 
service may become "participants" in the 401(k) Plan. LFC matches 50% 
of the participant's contribution to the 401(k) plan not to exceed 3% of 
the participant's annual compensation or $1,500, if less. The amounts 
expensed for LFC's matching contributions to the 401(k) Plan for 
employees supporting FSD were $129,000 in 1994 and $173,000 for 1993.

The financial statements for the 31 weeks ended June 4, 1994 include 
charges for the portion of LFC's annual budgeted expenses related to the 
profit sharing plan, deferred compensation plan, 401(k) Plan and 
employee bonuses applicable to this period.

In December 1990, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards (FAS) No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement 
Benefits Other Than Pensions". There is no postretirement benefit 
obligation associated with the foodservice distribution business.

In November 1992, the FASB issued FAS No. 112 "Employers' Accounting for 
Postemployment Benefits". LFC does not believe that the amount of the 
liability, if any, will be material.

NOTE 8 - Related party transaction

FSD purchases mozzarella cheese products from LFC. During 1994, 1993 
and 1992 FSD purchased $17.9 million, $27.1 million and $30.6 million, 
respectively, for resale to customers.

INTERNATIONAL MULTIFOODS CORPORATION
Introduction to Pro Forma Consolidated
Condensed Financial Information (Unaudited)

As described in Item 2, on August 22, 1994, the Company completed 
the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Leprino Foods 
Company's specialty foodservice distribution business ("Leprino 
Distribution Business").

As discussed in the Company's Form 8-K dated June 1, 1994, the 
Company completed the divestiture of its Frozen Specialty Foods business 
on June 1, 1994 and its Meats business on May 2, 1994. The divestiture 
of the Frozen Specialty Foods business resulted in a net gain which will 
be reported in the Company's results of operations in the quarter ended 
August 31, 1994.

The following unaudited pro forma financial statements reflect the 
impact of the transactions described above, in the manner described in 
the accompanying notes, to the historical statement of earnings for the 
three months ended May 31, 1994, the statement of operations for the 
year ended February 28, 1994 and the balance sheet as of May 31, 1994.

The pro forma financial information is not intended to reflect the 
results of operations or financial position of the Company which 
actually would have resulted had these transactions occurred on the 
assumed dates.

The pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction 
with the accompanying notes which follow and the historical financial 
statements of the Company included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for 
the year ended February 28, 1994 and its quarterly report on Form 10-Q 
for the three months ended May 31, 1994.

</TABLE>

(a) The pro forma adjustments assume that the Frozen Specialty Foods 
divestiture and the Leprino Distribution Business acquisition took place 
on May 31, 1994. The Meats business divestiture was completed on May 2, 
1994 and, accordingly, the historical balance sheet reflects the effects 
of this transaction. The Frozen Specialty Foods divestiture adjustments 
reflect the application of proceeds, the elimination of assets 
transferred to and liabilities assumed by the buyer, and accruals for 
estimated additional costs directly attributable to the divestiture. The 
application of proceeds from the divestiture are assumed to reduce debt 
obligations. The Leprino Distribution Business acquisition adjustments 
reflect the purchase of assets and assumption of liabilities, the use of 
the Frozen Specialty Foods divestiture proceeds to fund the purchase and 
the recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets.

(b) Goodwill and other assets represent an estimate of the intangible 
assets associated with the acquisition.

</TABLE>

(a) The pro forma statement of earnings for the three months ended May 
31, 1994 assumes that the Frozen Specialty Foods and Meats businesses 
divestitures and the Leprino Distribution Business acquisition took 
place on March 1, 1994. The pro forma divestitures adjustments include 
the elimination of net sales and expenses of the businesses. The net 
gain on the divestiture of the Frozen Specialty Foods business has not 
been included. The pro forma acquisition adjustments include the net 
sales and expenses of the acquired business for the three months ended 
May 31, 1994, amortization of goodwill, depreciation and other 
adjustments based on the allocated purchase price of net assets 
acquired, and calculation of income taxes based on the Company's tax 
rate. The pro forma adjustments do not include the benefits from 
synergies the Company anticipates realizing in the future from the 
integration of the acquired business and the Company's pizza restaurant 
distribution business. The pro forma adjustments also do not include 
charges the Company will report in the second quarter ended August 31, 
1994 for integrating these businesses. The Company is currently in the 
process of estimating the costs associated with the integration, which 
will include the closing of duplicate facilities of the Company.

(b) The pro forma adjustment to reduce interest expense from the 
divestitures is the result of net proceeds which were used to reduce 
debt obligations. Net proceeds represent the aggregate sales price 
reduced by additional costs directly attributable to the divestiture 
transactions, including taxes.

(c) The acquisition pro forma adjustment results in an increase to 
interest expense as a result of debt obligations incurred to fund the 
purchase price.

(a) The pro forma statement of operations for the year ended February 
28, 1994 assumes that the Frozen Specialty Foods and Meats businesses 
divestitures and the Leprino Distribution Business acquisition took 
place on March 1, 1993. The pro forma divestitures adjustments include 
the elimination of net sales and expenses of the businesses. The impact 
on the net loss per share from the write-down of the Meats business net 
assets was $.67 which is included in the historical statement of 
operations and has not been eliminated in the pro forma results. The pro 
forma acquisition adjustments include the net sales and expenses of the 
acquired business for the fiscal year ended November 30, 1993, 
amortization of goodwill, depreciation and other adjustments based on 
the allocated purchase price of net assets acquired, and calculation of 
income taxes based on the Company's tax rate. The pro forma adjustments 
do not include the benefits from synergies the Company anticipates 
realizing in the future from the integration of the acquired business 
and the Company's pizza restaurant distribution business. The pro forma 
adjustments also do not include charges the Company will report in the 
second quarter ended August 31, 1994 for integrating these businesses. 
The Company is currently in the process of estimating the costs 
associated with the integration, which will include the closing of 
duplicate facilities of the Company.

(b) The pro forma adjustment to reduce interest expense from the 
divestitures is the result of net proceeds which were used to reduce 
debt obligations. Net proceeds represent the aggregate sales price 
reduced by additional costs directly attributable to the divestiture 
transactions, including taxes.

(c) The acquisition pro forma adjustment results in an increase to 
interest expense as a result of debt obligations incurred to fund the 
purchase price.
