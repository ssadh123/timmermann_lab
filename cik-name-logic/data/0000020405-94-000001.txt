Item 5. Other Events
- ---------------------

On January 18, 1994 Citicorp reported record net income of
$2.2 billion for the year 1993, or $4.11 per common share fully
diluted. For the fourth quarter, net income was $575 million, or
$1.06 per share.

These results, estimated January 13, compare with net income
of $722 million, or $1.35 per share, in 1992 and net income of $280
million, or $0.53 per share, in the 1992 fourth quarter.

Citicorp's previous record for annual net income was $1.9
billion in 1988. 

John S. Reed, chairman, said: "The year's record earnings
reflect strong business results and substantial improvement in 
credit costs -- two themes that should underlie our accomplishments
going forward into 1994-95. Global Finance had its best year ever
in 1993 in Europe and good gains in North America. The Global
Consumer business continued outstanding earnings growth."

"The 1993 results also show how much we have strengthened the
balance sheet -- in capital, ratios and reserves," he added.

The Tier 1 capital ratio was estimated at 6.5%, up from 6.2%
at September 30, 1993. Total regulatory capital at December 31,
1993, rose to $23.2 billion, estimated to be 11.2% of risk-adjusted
assets. A year earlier the Tier 1 ratio was 4.9% and the total
capital ratio was 9.6%.

Return on common equity increased to 19.9% for the quarter and
17.7% for the year, compared with 10.7% and 6.5% for the same 1992
periods. Return on total stockholders' equity was 16.7% in the
fourth quarter and 15.3% in 1993. (The 1993 annual return excludes
the effect of the previously announced accounting change for income
taxes.)

Total adjusted revenues increased to $4.5 billion in the
quarter, up 7% from the same 1992 quarter and 3% from the 1993
third quarter. The gains came chiefly from businesses in the
developing economies. 

Trading revenues from foreign exchange, securities and
derivatives totaled $427 million in the quarter, compared with $299
million in the same 1992 quarter and with $478 million in the 1993
third quarter. Foreign exchange revenues of $158 million and
securities trading revenues of $269 million compared with $245
million and $233 million, respectively, in the 1993 third quarter
and $264 million and $35 million, respectively, in the 1992 fourth
quarter.

Adjusted operating expenses increased 7% from the 1992 fourth
quarter and 4% from the 1993 third quarter. The increase from the
third quarter was due largely to marketing costs in the U.S. 

Page 2

consumer businesses and business expansion in developing economies. 
Also affecting the year-to-year increase were compensation accruals
partly related to strong trading revenues. 

Both commercial and consumer credit costs declined. 
Commercial credit costs decreased for the eighth straight quarter,
to $126 million, from $233 million in the 1993 third quarter and
from $478 million in the 1992 fourth quarter. Commercial cash-
basis loans and Other Real Estate Owned together dropped by $1.1
billion in the quarter to $5.3 billion. Consumer credit costs
declined to $651 million in the quarter from $665 million in the
1993 third quarter and from $836 million in the 1992 fourth
quarter.

Loan loss reserves increased in the quarter to $4.4 billion at
1993 year-end. The consumer reserve was built by $63 million in
the quarter to $1.6 billion, compared with $1.3 billion a year
earlier, and the commercial reserve by $63 million in the quarter
to $2.5 billion, compared with $2.2 billion a year earlier.

In its announcement on January 13, Citicorp said that in the
1993 fourth quarter it took restructuring charges of $425 million
($0.50 per share after tax) for cost-management programs to improve
productivity, principally in U.S. markets, and business writedowns
of $179 million ($0.21 per share after tax), as well as gains of
$107 million ($0.14 per share after tax) from the sale of Brazilian
bonds. Also in the fourth quarter, the company recognized $200
million ($0.39 per share) of deferred tax benefits.

On the restructuring charges, Mr. Reed said: "We arrived at
these charges through plans submitted by line business units during
our annual planning process, not through a corporate-level effort. 
We approved those proposals that will have a positive effect in the
current year and achieve full payback by the end of 1995."

The business writedowns are principally in the Quotron
subsidiary and cover costs associated with the disposition of the
market data services business. It has been announced that Citicorp
reached an agreement in principle to sell that business to Reuters
America Holdings Inc., subject to completion of a definitive
agreement and government approvals.

The 1993 full year results included the previously reported
recognition, as of January 1, 1993, of $300 million ($0.58 per
share) as the cumulative effect of adopting Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes."

RESULTS OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS

Global Consumer

Net income for the Global Consumer businesses was $1.4 billion
in 1993, compared with $969 million in 1992, excluding after-tax
restructuring charges of $143 million in 1993 and $82 million in
1992. Fourth quarter net income, excluding restructuring charges,
was $378 million, compared with $263 million in the same 1992
quarter. Results for the year and the quarter reflected
significantly lower credit losses in North America, along with
continued strong revenue growth in the developing economies and in
private banking. 

Global Consumer adjusted revenues of $2.8 billion in the
quarter were up approximately 1% from the same year-earlier quarter
and 1.6% from the 1993 third quarter. Operating expenses were
$1.55 billion in the quarter, compared with $1.5 billion in the
same 1992 quarter and in the 1993 third quarter.

Net income in the consumer businesses in North America, Europe
and Japan, excluding restructuring charges, was $804 million for
1993 and $228 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $513
million and $154 million in the respective 1992 periods. Revenues
were $8.7 billion for 1993 and $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter,
compared with $8.9 billion and $2.3 billion in the respective 1992
periods. Throughout the year, substantially lower net credit
losses in the U.S. card business more than offset soft revenues. 
Operating expenses in the North America, Europe and Japan
businesses for the fourth quarter were 2% higher than the same 1992
quarter but were unchanged for 1993 compared with 1992. A
significant portion of the fourth-quarter restructuring charge is
targeted to further increase efficiencies in the U.S. consumer
businesses.

Net income in the developing economies businesses, excluding
restructuring charges, was $560 million in the year and $150
million in the fourth quarter, compared with $456 million and $109
million in the respective 1992 periods. Revenue growth of 20% in
the year and 21% in the fourth quarter (compared with the same 1992
periods) reflected continued business expansion and was balanced
between the Asian and Latin American regions. Operating expenses,
excluding restructuring charges, rose 13% in both the year and the
fourth quarter, compared with the same 1992 periods, in support of
the business expansion.

Consumer loans on the balance sheet that are delinquent 90
days or more improved to approximately $3.6 billion from $3.7
billion at the end of the 1993 third quarter and $3.9 billion at
1992 year-end.

Page 4

Global Finance

Net income for the year in the Global Finance businesses was
$1.8 billion, compared with $1.2 billion in 1992, excluding after-
tax restructuring charges of $95 million in 1993 and $49 million in
1992. Fourth quarter net income was $522 million, compared with
$305 million in the same 1992 quarter, excluding after-tax
restructuring charges of $95 million and $22 million in 1993 and
1992, respectively. 

Global Finance adjusted revenues in the quarter were $1.6
billion, a 17% increase from the same 1992 quarter and 6% from the
1993 third quarter. The revenue increase from the 1992 fourth
quarter was due primarily to strong results from trading-related
activities, principally in Europe and North America and from
business expansion in developing economies. The increase from the
1993 third quarter resulted from activities in developing
economies.

Revenues from derivative products, most of which are
categorized as securities trading and the balance as net interest
revenue, were higher in 1993 and the fourth quarter (compared with
the same 1992 periods) and reflected Citicorp's broadly based
franchise, customer demand for risk-management products,
proprietary activities and volatile market conditions during the
year. Derivative products include financial futures, interest rate
and currency swaps, options and equity and commodity contracts.

Operating expenses in the year and in the quarter rose 8% and
10% over the respective 1992 periods. Higher expenses for the
quarter reflected business expansion in developing economies, while
the increase for the year included investment spending, higher
incentive compensation related to trading activity, and charges
taken in the year for the withdrawal from the portfolio management
business for customers in India. 

Credit costs were $195 million in the year, and a negative $8
million in the fourth quarter, the latter reflecting a recovery on
an Australian property. These results compare with $740 million in
1992 and $168 million in that year's fourth quarter. Cash-basis
loans of $755 million compare with $1.4 billion a year ago and $1.1
billion at the end of the 1993 third quarter. 

Net income in the Global Finance businesses in North America,
Europe and Japan, excluding restructuring charges, was $992 million
for the year and $275 million for the fourth quarter, compared with
$521 million and $189 million in the respective 1992 periods. Both
the quarter's and the year's results benefited from strong
securities and foreign exchange trading activities, higher fee-
based revenues and improved credit costs in North America and
Europe.

Page 5

Revenues for North America, Europe and Japan were $4.0 billion
in 1993 and $987 million in the fourth quarter, compared with $3.6
billion and $944 million in the respective 1992 periods. Expenses
were $2.2 billion for the year and $574 million in the fourth
quarter, compared with $2.1 billion for 1992 and $541 million in
the 1992 fourth quarter. 

Net income in the developing economies businesses, excluding
restructuring charges, was $773 million for the year and $247
million for the fourth quarter, up from $661 million and $116
million in the respective 1992 periods, on solid revenue growth. 
The increases came despite continuing investment spending and the
India charge. Revenues for the year were $2.2 billion and $606
million for the fourth quarter, compared with $1.9 billion in 1992
and $413 million in the 1992 fourth quarter. Expenses for the year
were $1.1 billion and $283 million for the quarter, compared with
$937 million in 1992 and $236 million in the same 1992 quarter. 

North America Commercial Real Estate

Citicorp Real Estate reported continued significant declines
in the troubled portfolio. Cash-basis loans and OREO decreased by
$634 million in the fourth quarter to $4.1 billion. This reduction
was due to multiple initiatives, including restructuring of loans,
sales, paydowns, writeoffs and writedowns. Cash-basis loans of
$1.7 billion were down from $2.7 billion at year-end 1992 and from
$2.1 billion at the end of the 1993 third quarter. OREO property
decreased to $2.4 billion, down from $2.9 billion at the 1992 year-
end and $2.5 billion at the end of the 1993 third quarter. The
reduction in cash-basis loans and OREO includes $576 million of
asset sales during 1993, the majority being commercial properties
and loans sold at a average of approximately 62% of their original
loan value.

Consistent with the reduction of the problem credits, total
exposure was reduced by $1.1 billion during the quarter to $13.6
billion, down 20%, or $3.4 billion, from the $17 billion reported
at the end of 1992.

North America Commercial Real Estate reported a net loss for
1993 of $621 million, half the 1992 loss of $1.3 billion. The net
loss in the fourth quarter was $114 million, compared with a loss
of $230 million in the same 1992 quarter. Reduced credit costs
were a key factor, as net writeoffs and writedowns for the year
were $688 million, down significantly from the $1.4 billion
reported for 1992. For the fourth quarter, net writeoffs and
writedowns were $105 million, down from $236 million in the same
1992 quarter.

Cross-Border Refinancing Portfolio

The cross-border refinancing portfolio's net income for the
year was $92 million, compared with $403 million in 1992, when the
results benefited from the release of $253 million of credit
reserves. The 1993 results also included $97 million of interest
on Brazilian medium- and long-term outstandings, compared with $130
million in 1992.

Medium- and long-term exposure to refinancing countries was
$2.9 billion at year-end, compared with $3.3 billion at year-end
1992 and $3.0 billion at the end of the 1993 third quarter.

The restructuring of Brazil's medium- and long-term commercial
bank debt continues. Representatives of the Government of Brazil
and creditors began signing the external-debt financing package on
November 29, and to date creditors holding more than 96% of the
eligible debt have signed. The restructuring agreement, when
completed, would have generally positive future effects on the
company's earnings, but the timing and amounts cannot yet be
determined.

CAPITAL

The Tier 1 capital ratio at December 31, 1993, was an
estimated 6.5%, compared with 6.2% at September 30, 1993, and 4.9%
at December 31, 1992. Tier 1 capital rose approximately $563
million in the fourth quarter to $13.4 billion, compared with $12.8
billion at September 30, 1993, and $10.3 billion at December 31,
1992. The estimated combined Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital ratio at
December 31, 1993, was 11.2%, compared with 10.7% at September 30,
1993, and 9.6% at December 31, 1992.

OTHER ITEMS

Due to a favorable reassessment of future earnings
expectations, the valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets
was reduced by $200 million in the fourth quarter, with a
corresponding decrease in tax expense. Excluding this tax benefit,
income taxes in the fourth quarter would have been $185 million,
bringing the effective tax rate for the year to 40%, compared with
42% for the first nine months of 1993 and 49% for full-year 1992. 
The reduction in the effective tax rate reflects improvements in
the level and mix of earnings. 

Total employment was 81,500 at year-end 1993, compared with
81,000 a year earlier.
