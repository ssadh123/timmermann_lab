ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS
- --------------------
1. RATINGS DOWNGRADE. For background and earlier developments related to this
topic, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations" in the Companies' Annual Reports on Form 10-K for
the year ended Decemeber 31, 1993 ("Form 10-K") and Note 7 in the Companies'
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 1994.

On August 26, 1994, Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") downgraded the
credit ratings of certain securities of the Operating Companies. The preferred
stock of both Operating Companies was downgraded from "b1" to "b2" and Toledo
Edison's debentures were downgraded from "Ba3" to "B1". Moody's noted that the
Operating Companies recently amended bank facilities provide the participating
banks with second mortgages on the assets of the Operating Companies,
thereby creating a new level of priority above the classes of securities that
Moody's downgraded.

2. RETAIL WHEELING. For background related to this topic, see "Item 7.
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" in the Form 10-K.

House Bill No. 676 was introduced in February 1994 in the Ohio General Assembly
which, if enacted, would provide for retail wheeling of electric power in Ohio
for large energy users and limited retail wheeling for certain smaller energy
users. This bill has not been referred to a standing subject committee. The
Companies cannot predict whether this bill or any similar legislation which
might be proposed in the future will be enacted.

3. GARFIELD HEIGHTS. For background and earlier developments relating to this
topic, see "Item 1. Business-Operations-Competitive Conditions-Cleveland
Electric" in the Form 10-K.

Cleveland Electric has filed a complaint and appeal with The Public Utilities
Commission of Ohio ("PUCO") regarding a March 1994 Garfield Heights ordinance
relating to rates charged by Cleveland Electric. That ordinance mandated a 30%
across-the-board rate reduction in Cleveland Electric's current tariff rates to
all electric customers located within the City of Garfield Heights. Such rates
would not take effect until the PUCO has ruled on Cleveland Electric's
complaint and appeal. Cleveland Electric has also filed with the PUCO evidence
supporting its position that its current tariff rates are just and reasonable
and that the Garfield Heights ordinance rates are unjust and unreasonable. The
PUCO's staff has initiated an investigation into this matter. Cleveland
Electric expects the PUCO's staff to issue its Staff Report of Investigation by
the end of 1994.

Although the City Council of Garfield Heights previously approved an ordinance
to place on the November 8, 1994 ballot an issue with regard to the creation of
a department of public utilities for the City of Garfield Heights, on August
29, 1994 the City Council enacted a resolution effectively removing that issue
from the ballot.

In 1993, Cleveland Electric derived about 1% of its total revenues and
Centerior Energy derived about 0.5% of its total revenues from sales to the
13,000 customers located in Garfield Heights.

4. REPLACEMENT OF TRUSTEE FOR CLEVELAND ELECTRIC MORTGAGE.
Effective September 14, 1994, Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York
resigned as Trustee, Paying Agent and Transfer Agent under the Mortgage and
Deed of Trust, dated July 1, 1940, from Cleveland Electric to Guaranty Trust
Company of New York, as supplemented and amended ("Mortgage"), and The Chase
Manhattan Bank (National Association) was appointed successor Trustee, Paying
Agent and Transfer Agent. Cleveland Electric's First Mortgage Bonds are issued
under the Mortgage.

including the First Mortgage or any Prior Lien and irrespective of any
modification of the First Mortgage or any Prior Lien or any of the First
Mortgage Bonds or prior lien bonds or the issuance of any additional First
Mortgage Bonds or prior lien bonds. In the event of a merger of the Company
into Toledo, the lien of this Indenture (1) shall be subordinate and junior in
priority to Permitted Liens as such term is defined in the Toledo Subordinate
Indenture, and (2) shall not be considered a "prior lien" as defined in the
First Mortgage (in this context, as such term is used in the Toledo Subordinate
Indenture).

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5 of Article IX hereof,
any proceeds realized from the sale or other disposition of the mortgaged
property, any part thereof or any interest therein, upon foreclosure of the
First Mortgage or any Prior Lien and this Indenture shall be applied as
follows:

First: to the payment of all sums and amounts due and

Lien, including, but not limited to, the payment
in full of all of the First Mortgage Bonds and
any prior lien bonds;

Second: the balance, if any, to the payment of all sums 
------ and amounts due and owing and secured by this 
Indenture.

In the event that, in violation of the foregoing paragraph, any
payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or
securities, shall be received by the Trustee before the First Mortgage Bonds or
prior lien bonds are paid in full, or provisions made for such payment in
accordance with the terms of the First Mortgage Bonds and the First Mortgage
and the Prior Liens and prior lien bonds, such payment or distribution shall be
held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered to the
trustee under the First Mortgage and Prior Lien for application to the payment
of all payments on the First Mortgage Bonds and prior lien bonds remaining
unpaid to the extent necessary to make all such payments on the First Mortgage
Bonds and prior lien bonds in full in accordance with the terms thereof after
giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to the holders of the
First Mortgage Bonds and the prior lien bonds, or to the trustee under the
First Mortgage for the benefit of holders of the First Mortgage Bonds or under
the Prior Lien for the benefit of holders of prior lien bonds. For purposes of
this Section, the Trustee may rely conclusively upon, and shall be fully
protected in relying upon, a certificate of the trustee under the First
Mortgage with respect to the outstanding balance of the First Mortgage Bonds or
any prior lien bonds.

SECTION 2. Further Assurances. The Trustee from time to time
will, upon reasonable request, execute and deliver such further instruments and
do such further acts as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of this
Indenture, especially to make the lien hereof subordinate and junior in
priority (1) to Permitted Liens, including the First Mortgage Lien and any
Prior Liens, and (2) in the event of a merger of the Company into Toledo, to
Permitted Liens as such term is defined in the Toledo Subordinate Indenture.

such tax, assessment, lien or charge to be paid or any such requirement to be
complied with so long as the validity thereof shall be contested in good faith,
unless thereby, in the opinion of the Trustee or of counsel selected or
approved by the Trustee, any of such property may be lost or forfeited. The
Trustee is under no duty to render its opinion or to obtain the opinion of
counsel referred to in the preceding sentence, unless requested by any Agent or

any of the covenants contained in Sections 2, 3 and 4 of this Article, the
Trustee, or any receiver appointed hereunder, may make, but is under no duty to
make, advances to perform the same in its behalf; and the Company hereby agrees
to repay all sums so advanced in its behalf, on demand, with interest at six
percent (6%) per annum after demand, and all sums so advanced, with interest as

priority to the indebtedness evidenced by the Obligations but subordinate and

opinion of such counsel such action has been taken with respect
to the recording, filing, re-recording and re-filing of this
Indenture and of each supplemental indenture as is necessary to
maintain the lien thereof, and reciting the details of such
action, or stating that in the opinion of such counsel no such

SECTION 7. Further Assurances. That the Company will, upon
reasonable request, execute and deliver such further instruments and do such

purposes of this Indenture, especially to make subject to the lien hereof any
property agreed to be subjected hereto, or intended so to be, to transfer to
any new trustee or trustees the trust estate, powers, instruments and funds
held in trust hereunder and to confirm the lien of this Indenture with respect
to any Obligation.

SECTION 8. Subordination of Subsequent Mortgages. That in case
the Company shall hereafter create any mortgage upon, or pledge of, the
mortgaged property or any part thereof, other than Permitted Liens, such
mortgage or pledge shall be and shall be expressed, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Trustee, to be subject to first, Permitted Liens, including
the prior lien of the First Mortgage for the security of all First Mortgage
Bonds then authenticated and delivered or thereafter to be authenticated and

prior lien bonds then authenticated and delivered or thereafter to be
authenticated and delivered under Prior Liens, and second, the Prior Lien of
this Indenture for the security of the Obligations. That, subject to the
provisions of Article XII, in case the Company shall hereafter acquire or own
any property (other than property of the nature specifically excepted by the
terms of the granting clauses of this Indenture) which is not subject to a
Prior Lien (but which in any event will be subject to the First Mortgage Lien)
and with respect to which it has the power to subject either to the lien of
this Indenture or to a Prior Lien as a superior lien, it will subject such
property to the lien of this Indenture as a superior lien (but which lien in
any event will be subordinate to the First Mortgage Lien).

POSSESSION, USE AND RELEASE OF PROPERTY

SECTION 1. Possession Until Default. Unless an Event of Default
shall have happened and be continuing, the Company shall be suffered and
permitted to possess, use and enjoy all the property and appurtenances,
franchises and rights conveyed by this Indenture, and to receive and use the
rents, issues, income, products and profits thereof, with power in the ordinary
course of business, freely and without let or hindrance on the part of the
Trustee, to use and consume materials and supplies, deal with choses in action,
leases (other than leases subject to the lien of this Indenture) and

contracts, exercise the rights and powers conferred upon it thereby, alter and
repair its buildings and structures, change the position of any of its
buildings, structures, plants, poles, wires, conduits or other property
whatsoever and replace and renew any of its equipment, machinery or other
property, except that the position of none of the mortgaged property may be
changed so as to impair the lien of this Indenture thereon unless such property
is sold, abandoned or otherwise disposed of as permitted by this Section 1 or
Section 2 of this Article VII or released as provided in Section 3 of this
Article VII.

SECTION 2. Disposition Without Consent. The Company may at any
time and from time to time, without any release or consent by the Trustee:

(a) Sell or otherwise dispose of, free from the lien
of this Indenture, any machinery or equipment, which has become
worn out, unserviceable, undesirable or unnecessary for use in
the conduct of its business, upon replacing the same with, or
substituting for the same, new machinery or equipment, or other
property of a value at least equal to the original cost of such
things so disposed of, which new machinery, equipment or other
property shall without further action become subject to the lien
of this Indenture, subject to Permitted Liens;

(b) Abandon any property, if in the opinion of the
Board of Directors the abandonment of such property is desirable
in the proper conduct of the business and in the operation of the
properties of the Company, or is otherwise in the best interests
of the Company;

(c) Modify or amend any lease which shall be a part
of the trust estate provided that the Company shall forthwith
assign to and mortgage with the Trustee the modified or amended
lease, subject to Permitted Liens;

(d) Surrender or assent to the modification of any
franchise, license, authority or permit which it may hold, or
under which it may be operating, provided that the Company shall
have the right, in the opinion of counsel, under the modified
franchise, license, authority or permit, or under a new
franchise, license, authority or permit received in exchange in
the event of any such surrender, or under some other franchise,
license, authority or permit, to conduct the same or an extended
business in the same or an extended territory during the same or
an extended or unlimited or indeterminate or indefinite period of
time. For the purposes of this Subdivision (d) and of any
opinion to be rendered under it, any right of any municipality to
terminate a permit, license or franchise by purchase, shall not
be deemed to abridge or affect its duration; and

(e) Surrender or assent to or procure a modification
of any franchise, license, authority or permit under which it
operates any of its properties, which it may now or hereafter
hold or under which it may now or hereafter operate, if, in the
opinion of the Board of Directors, it is no

- 27 -

<PAGE> 33
longer necessary or desirable in the profitable conduct of the
Company's business or in the best interests of the Company to
operate such properties or to comply with the terms and
provisions of such franchise, license, authority or permit and,
if the value and utility generally of all of its properties as an
entirety and the value of the security for the Obligations will
not thereby be impaired.

SECTION 3. Disposition upon Release under First Mortgage and
Prior Liens. From time to time hereafter the Company may transfer or otherwise
dispose of any property constituting a part of the trust estate, and the
Trustee shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5 of Article VII hereof,
release the same from the lien of this Indenture, but only upon receipt by it
of:

(a) A certified resolution requesting such release;

(b) A copy of the documents delivered by the Company
to the First Mortgage Trustee or holder of a Prior Lien in
connection therewith;

(c) A copy of the instrument executed by the First
Mortgage Trustee or holder of a Prior Lien releasing that
property from the First Mortgage Lien or such Prior Lien; and

(d) An opinion of counsel and an officer's
certificate stating that such disposition and release does not
violate any covenants hereof.

SECTION 4. No Duty to Investigate. In no event shall any
purchaser or purchasers in good faith of any property purported to be released
hereunder be bound to ascertain the authority of the Trustee to execute the
release; or to inquire as to any facts required by the provisions hereof for
the exercise of such authority; or to see to the application of the purchase
moneys. Nor shall any purchaser of machinery or equipment or tools or
implements or materials or supplies be under obligation to ascertain or inquire
into the occurrence of the event on which any such sale is hereby authorized.

SECTION 5. Obligations and Powers of Trustee. The Trustee shall
not be required under any of the provisions of this Article VII to release any
part of the mortgaged property from the lien hereof at any time when to the
knowledge of the Trustee the Company shall be in default hereunder, but
notwithstanding any such default the Trustee may release from the lien hereof
any part of the mortgaged property, upon compliance by the Company with the
other conditions specified in this Article VII in respect thereof, if the
Trustee shall have received the consent of the Designated Holders provided
however that the consent of a Bank with respect to its Bank Obligations under a
Credit Agreement initially secured hereunder as identified in Exhibit B-1
hereof shall not be deemed effective unless all of the Banks which are a party
to such Credit Agreement shall have given their consent. In case the trust
estate shall be in the possession of one or more receivers lawfully appointed
or of a trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings (including a
trustee or trustees appointed

- 28 -

<PAGE> 34
under the provisions of the bankruptcy laws of the United States) or of
assignees for the benefit of creditors, the powers by this Article VII
conferred upon the Company may be exercised by such receivers, trustees or
assignees, with the approval of the Trustee, regardless of whether or not the
Company is in default hereunder, and in such event a writing signed by such
receivers, trustees or assignees, may be received by the Trustee in lieu of any
certified resolution required by the provisions of this Article.

REMEDIES UPON DEFAULT

SECTION 1. Events of Default. In case any one or more of the
following events (herein called "Events of Default") shall happen and be
continuing, that is to say:

(a) Default shall be made by the Company in the
performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or
conditions on its part in this Indenture or any indenture
supplemental hereto, and such default shall continue for a period
of sixty days after written notice to the Company by the Trustee;
or

(b) The occurrence of an "event of default" under
the First Mortgage which has resulted in a declaration that the
principal amount of all of the First Mortgage Bonds is
immediately due and payable; or

(c) Any proceeding shall be instituted by or against
the Company seeking to adjudicate it a bankrupt or insolvent, or
seeking liquidation, winding up, reorganization, arrangement,
adjustment, protection, relief, or composition or arrangement
with creditors, a readjustment of its debts, in each case under
any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or
relief of debtors, or seeking the entry of an order for relief or
the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or other
similar official for it or for any substantial part of its
property and, in the case of any such proceeding instituted
against it (but not instituted or acquiesced in by it), either
such proceeding shall remain undismissed or unstayed for a period
of 60 consecutive days, or any of the actions sought in such
proceeding (including, without limitation, the entry of an order
for relief against, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee,
custodian or other similar official for, it or for any
substantial part of its property) shall occur; or

(d) A Notice of Actionable Event shall have been
given to a responsible officer of the Trustee and shall remain

- 29 -

<PAGE> 35
An Event of Default and its consequences may be waived at any
time prior to the sale of the trust estate by an instrument delivered to the
Trustee and signed by (i) the Designated Holders in the case of an Event of
Default arising under subsections (a), (b) or (c) above or (ii) each Agent or
Representative which delivered the Notice of Actionable Event in the case of an
Event of Default arising under subsection (d) above. No such waiver shall
extend to or affect any subsequent default or impair or exhaust any right or
power consequent thereon. An Event of Default arising under subsection (d)
above shall no longer be continuing once such Notice of Actionable Event has
been rescinded.

SECTION 2. Sale of Trust Estate. If an Event of Default shall
happen and be continuing, then, and in every such case, the Trustee may in its
sole discretion, and upon the written request of the Control Party, shall, if
and to the extent permitted by law, by such officer or agent as it may appoint,
sell, subject to Permitted Liens, the trust estate as an entirety or in such
parcels as the Trustee may in its sole discretion determine, at public auction
at some convenient place in the City of Cleveland, Ohio, or at such other place
or places as may be required by law, having first published notice of such sale
in an authorized newspaper in the City of Cleveland, Ohio, at least once in
each of four successive calendar weeks preceding such sale, and having given
any other notice which may be required by law; and from time to time to adjourn
such sale in its discretion by announcement at the time and place appointed for
such sale or for such adjourned sale or sales without further notice except
such as may be required by law; and upon such sale to make or deliver to the
purchaser or purchasers a good and sufficient deed or deeds for the same,
subject to Permitted Liens. The Trustee and its successors are hereby
irrevocably appointed the true and lawful attorneys of the Company, in its name
and stead, to make all necessary conveyances, assignments and transfers of
property thus sold, subject to Permitted Liens; and for that purpose it and
they may execute all necessary deeds, bills of sale and instruments of
assignment and transfer, and may substitute one or more persons, firms or
corporations with like power, the Company hereby ratifying and confirming all
that its said attorneys, or such substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do
by virtue hereof. Nevertheless, if so requested by the Trustee or by any
purchaser, the Company shall ratify and confirm any such sale or transfer by
executing and delivering to the Trustee or to such purchaser or purchasers all
proper conveyances, assignments, instruments of transfer, and releases as may
be designated in any such request, subject to Permitted Liens.

SECTION 3. Foreclosure. If an Event of Default shall happen and
be continuing, then, and in every such case, the Trustee may in its sole
discretion, and upon the written request of the Control Party, shall, proceed
by suit or suits at law or in equity or by any other appropriate remedy to
foreclose this mortgage and to sell, subject to Permitted Liens, the trust
estate under a judgment or decree of a court or courts of competent
jurisdiction, or by the enforcement of any other appropriate legal or equitable
remedy as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of
its rights or any of the rights of the Secured Parties.

SECTION 4. Manner of Sale. Upon any sale, whether made under
the power of sale hereby given or by virtue of judicial proceedings, the whole
of the trust estate

- 30 -

<PAGE> 36
shall be sold in one parcel as an entirety, unless such sale as an entirety, in
the sole discretion of the Trustee, shall be impracticable by reason of some
statute or other cause, or unless the Control Party shall in writing request
the Trustee to cause the trust estate to be sold in parcels, in which case the
sale shall be made in such parcels and in such order as may be specified in
such request, but, if not so specified, as the Trustee in its sole discretion
shall deem most expedient in the interest of the Secured Parties, but every
such sale shall be subject to Permitted Liens. The Company, to the full extent
that it may lawfully do so, for itself, and for all who may claim through or
under it, hereby expressly waives and releases all right to have the trust
estate or any part thereof marshalled upon any foreclosure, sale or other
enforcement hereof, and the Trustee, or any court in which the foreclosure of
this Indenture or the administration of the trust hereby created is sought,
shall have the right as aforesaid to sell the entire trust estate as a whole in
a single parcel, but every such sale shall be subject to Permitted Liens.

Upon any sale, whether made under the power of sale hereby given
or by virtue of judicial proceedings, any Secured Party may bid for and
purchase the mortgaged property, and upon compliance with the terms of sale,
may hold, retain and possess and dispose of such property in his or their own
absolute right without further accountability subject to Permitted Liens.

Upon any sale, whether made under the power of sale hereby given
or by virtue of judicial proceedings, the receipt of the Trustee, or of the
officer making a sale under judicial proceedings, shall be a sufficient
discharge to the purchaser or purchasers at any sale for his or their purchase
money, and such purchaser or purchasers, his or their assigns or personal
representative, shall not, after paying such purchase money and receiving such
receipt of the Trustee or of such officer therefor, be obliged to see to the
application of such purchase money, or be in any wise answerable for any loss,
misapplication or non-application thereof.

Any such sale, whether under any power of sale hereby given or by
virtue of judicial proceedings, shall operate to divest all right, title,
interest, claim and demand whatsoever, either at law or in equity, of the
Company, in and to the property sold, and shall be a perpetual bar both at law
and in equity, against the Company, its successors and assigns, and against any
and all persons claiming or to claim the property sold or any part thereof
from, through or under the Company, its successors or assigns, except the
holders and beneficiaries of Permitted Liens.

SECTION 5. Application of Proceeds. The proceeds of any sale,
whether made under any power of sale herein granted or pursuant to judicial
proceedings, together with any other sums which then may be held by the Trustee
under any of the provisions of this Indenture as part of the trust estate,
shall be applied as follows:

First: To the payment of the costs and expenses of such
sale, including a reasonable compensation to the Trustee, its
agents, attorneys and counsel, and of all necessary or proper
expenses and advances made or incurred by the Trustee under this
Indenture (including any unpaid fees or

- 31 -
<PAGE> 37
expenses of the Trustee), and to the payment of all taxes,
assessments or liens superior to the lien of this Indenture
(including, without limitation, the First Mortgage Lien and any
Prior Liens), except any taxes, assessments or other superior
liens (including, without limitation, the First Mortgage Lien and
any Prior Liens) subject to which such sale shall have been made;

Second: To the payment of the whole amount then owing or
unpaid upon the Obligations for principal and interest, with
interest at the rate specified in such Obligations on overdue
principal and overdue installments of interest, and, in case such
proceeds shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amount so
due and unpaid upon the Obligations, then to the payment of such
principal and interest ratably, without preference or priority of
principal over interest, or of interest over principal, or of any
instalment of interest over any other instalment of interest.
Such payments shall be made on the date fixed therefor by the
Trustee;

Third: To the payment of any fees and expenses arising
pursuant to the Obligations and which are then due, owing and
unpaid to the Secured Parties; and

Fourth: All surplus then remaining to the Company, its
successors or assigns, or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled
to receive the same, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may
direct.

SECTION 6. Appointment of Receiver. If an Event of Default
shall happen and be continuing and upon filing a bill in equity or other
commencement of judicial proceedings to enforce the rights of the Trustee and
of the Secured Parties, the Trustee as a matter of right shall, to the extent
permitted by law and subject to the rights of holders or beneficiaries of
Permitted Liens, be entitled to the appointment of a receiver or receivers of
the trust estate and of the income, rents, issues and profits thereof pending
such proceedings, with such powers as the court making such appointment shall
confer, but notwithstanding the appointment of any receiver the Trustee shall
be entitled to retain possession and control of any property deposited or
pledged with it hereunder or agreed or provided to be delivered or deposited or
pledged with it hereunder, subject to the rights of holders or beneficiaries of
Permitted Liens.

SECTION 7. Waiver by Company. The Company agrees, to the
full extent that it may lawfully so agree, that in case of a default on its
part, as aforesaid, neither the Company nor any one claiming through or under
it shall or will set up, claim or seek to take advantage of any appraisement,
valuation, stay, extension or redemption laws now or hereafter in force in any
locality where any property subject to the lien hereof may be situated, in
order to prevent or hinder the enforcement or foreclosure of this Indenture,
the absolute sale of the trust estate or any portion thereof, or the final and
absolute putting into possession thereof, immediately after such sale, of the
purchaser or purchasers thereat, and the Company, to the full extent that it
may lawfully do so, for itself, and all who may claim through or under it,
hereby waives the benefit of all such laws.

- 32 -

<PAGE> 38
SECTION 8. Direction by the Control Party. Subject to the
provisions of Section 1 of Article XIII, the Control Party shall have the
right, by an instrument in writing executed and delivered to the Trustee, to
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
open to the Trustee, and of exercising any power or trust conferred upon the
Trustee under this Indenture.

SECTION 9. Restoration to Former Position. In case the Trustee
shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture by foreclosure,
entry or otherwise and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or
abandoned for any reason, or shall have been determined adversely to the
Trustee, then, and in every such case, the Company and the Trustee shall be
restored to their former positions and rights hereunder in respect to the trust
estate, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Trustee shall continue as
though no such proceedings had been taken.

SECTION 10. Suits in Name of Trustee. Any such suits or
proceedings instituted by the Trustee pursuant to this Indenture shall be
brought in its own name for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, subject
to the provisions of this Indenture.

SECTION 11. No Waiver. No delay or omission of the Trustee to
exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any
such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such default or
acquiescence therein; and every right and power given by this Article to the
Trustee may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed
expedient by the Trustee.

CONSOLIDATION, MERGER AND SALE

SECTION 1. No Bar. Nothing in this Indenture contained shall
prevent the consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the Company
into, any other corporation or prevent the sale or lease by the Company of its
property as an entirety or substantially as an entirety upon the terms
hereinafter set forth; provided that:

(a) any such consolidation or merger or sale or
lease shall be on such terms as not to impair the lien and
security of this Indenture upon any part of the trust estate or
any of the rights and powers of the Trustee;

(b) upon any such consolidation, merger or sale,
subject to the provisions of Section 3 of this Article, if the
Company is not the surviving corporation, the due and punctual
performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions of
this Indenture shall, by supplemental indenture and as a
condition of any such consolidation or merger or as a
consideration for any such sale, be expressly assumed in an
instrument in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee by
the successor corporation formed by or resulting from any such
merger or consolidation or to which such sale shall have been
made; and

(c) any such lease shall be made expressly subject
to immediate termination by the Trustee, subject to the rights of

property so leased at any sale thereof hereunder, whether such
sale be made under the power of sale hereby conferred or under
judicial proceedings, subject to the rights of holders or

SECTION 2. Successor Corporation. Every successor corporation
resulting from a consolidation of the Company with another corporation or a
merger of the Company into another corporation or the sale by the Company of
all or substantially all of its property as an entirety to another corporation,

its discretion, shall subject the same to the lien hereof. The foregoing
provisions of this Section 3 notwithstanding, this Indenture shall, after such

consolidation, merger or sale and upon all additions, extensions, improvements,
repairs and replacements to or about the plants or properties included in the

additions, extensions, improvements, repairs and replacements to or about the
plants or properties appurtenant to the plants or properties of the successor
corporation and additional plants or properties thereafter acquired by the

lessen the extent of the lien of this Indenture upon the property of the
Company hereafter acquired, by reason of the acquisition by the Company of all
or substantially all of the property of another corporation.

THE TRUSTEE

SECTION 1. The Trustee Generally. The Trustee accepts the
trusts created by this Indenture upon the terms and conditions hereof,
including the following:

(a) The Trustee shall be entitled to reasonable
compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder (which
compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in
regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust), and
such compensation, as well as the reasonable compensation of its
counsel, and all other reasonable expenses incurred by the
Trustee hereunder, and all taxes which may have been assessed
against the Trustee as such or against any funds on deposit with
it hereunder which the Trustee may be required or permitted by
law to deduct from such deposit and to pay, the Company agrees to
pay promptly on demand from time to time as such services shall
be rendered and as such expenses shall be incurred. In default
of such payment by the Company, the Trustee shall have a lien
therefor on the property subject to the lien of this Indenture
and the proceeds thereof prior to the lien of this Indenture, but
subject to Permitted Liens, and a lien therefor on any moneys
held by the Trustee hereunder prior to any rights in such moneys
of the Secured Parties. The Company also agrees to indemnify the
Trustee for, and to hold it harmless

- 35 -

<PAGE> 41
against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without
negligence or bad faith on the part of the Trustee, arising out
of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of this
trust, as well as the costs and expenses of defending against any
claim of liability in the premises.

(b) The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or
powers hereof and perform any duty hereunder either directly or
by or through its agents or attorneys.

(c) The Trustee shall not be responsible in any
manner whatsoever for the correctness of the recitals herein, all
of which are made by the Company solely; and the Trustee shall
not be responsible or accountable in any manner whatsoever for or
with respect to the validity or execution or sufficiency of this
Indenture, or of any indenture supplemental hereto, or for the
value of the property subject to the lien of this Indenture or
any part thereof, or for the title of the Company thereto, or for
the security afforded thereby and hereby, and the Trustee makes
no representation with respect thereto. The Trustee shall not be
accountable for the use or application by the Company of any
moneys paid over by it in accordance with any provision of this
Indenture.

(d) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to
exercise any of the trusts or powers hereof at the request, order
or direction of any of the Agents or the Designated Holders,
pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee
shall be under no duty to foreclose, take possession of, or
otherwise control or act with respect to any real property which
is part of the mortgaged property, unless such Agents or
Designated Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or
indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and
liabilities (including any potential liabilities under
environmental laws) to be incurred therein or thereby; upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default (which has not been cured), the
Trustee shall use the same degree of care and skill in the
exercise of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture
as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in
the conduct of his own affairs.

(e) The Trustee may consult with counsel, and, to
the extent permitted by Section 2 of this Article XIII, the
opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization
and protection in respect of any action taken or suffered by it
hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the opinion of
such counsel.

(f) The Trustee, to the extent permitted by Section
2 of this Article XIII, may rely upon the certificate of the
Secretary or one of the Assistant Secretaries of the Company, as
to the adoption of any resolution by its Board or stockholders.

- 36 -

<PAGE> 42
(g) Any action taken by the Trustee pursuant to any
provision hereof at the request or with the consent of any Person
who at the time is a Secured Party shall be conclusive and
binding in respect of all future holders of the Obligations then
held by such Secured Party, whether or not such Obligations shall
have noted thereon the fact that such request or consent had been
made or given.

(h) The Trustee shall not be personally liable in
case of entry by it upon the mortgaged property for debts
contracted or liability or damages incurred in the management or
operation of said property.

(i) The Trustee, to the extent permitted by Section
2 of this Article XIII, may rely and shall be protected in acting
upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion,
report, notice, request, consent, order, or other paper or
document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties.

(j) All moneys received by the Trustee under or
pursuant to any provision of this Indenture shall constitute
trust funds for the purposes for which they were paid or are
held, but need not be segregated in any manner from any other
moneys and may be deposited by the Trustee, under such conditions
as may be prescribed by law, in its general banking department,
and the Trustee shall not be liable for any interest thereon,
except that, so long as the Company is not in default hereunder,
it will allow and credit to the Company interest, if any, upon
such moneys at such rate as may then be customary for similar
deposits.

(k) The Trustee shall be under no duty to advance 
its own funds in enforcing this Indenture.

SECTION 2. Liability. None of the provisions of this Indenture
shall be construed as relieving the Trustee from liability for its own
negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own wilful
misconduct, except that, anything in this Indenture contained to the contrary
notwithstanding:

(1) unless and until an Event of Default specified
in Section 1 of Article IX hereof shall have happened which at
the time is subsisting,

(a) the Trustee shall not be liable except
for the performance of such duties as are specifically
set out in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or
obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the
Trustee, whose duties and obligations shall be determined
solely by the express provisions of this Indenture; and

(b) the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to
the truth of the statements and the correctness of the
opinions expressed therein, in the absence of bad faith
on the part of the Trustee, upon resolutions,

- 37 -

<PAGE> 43
certificates, statements, opinions, reports, orders or other
instruments furnished to it pursuant to the express provisions of
this Indenture; but in the case of any such resolutions,
certificates, statements, opinions, reports, orders or other
instruments which, by the provisions of this Indenture, are
specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee
shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or
not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture;

(2) the Trustee shall not be liable to any Secured
Party or to any other Person for any error of judgment made in
good faith by a responsible officer or officers of the Trustee,
unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in
ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

(3) the Trustee shall not be liable to any Secured
Party or to any other Person with respect to any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it in good faith, in accordance with the
direction of a Secured Party, relating to the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to it
or exercising any trust or power conferred upon it by this
Indenture.

If an Event of Default specified in Section 1 of Article IX
hereof shall have happened, then, so long as the same shall be subsisting, the
Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this
Indenture, and shall use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise,
as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct
of his own affairs.

Notwithstanding any provisions of this Indenture authorizing the
Trustee conclusively to rely upon any resolutions, certificates, statements,
opinions, reports, orders or other instruments, the Trustee may but, to the
extent permitted by this Section 2 of this Article XIII, need not, require any
further evidence or make any further investigation as to the facts or matters
stated therein which it may, in good faith, deem reasonable in the
circumstances; and the Trustee shall, if requested in writing so to do by an
Agent or a Secured Party, require such further evidence or make such further
investigation, provided, however, that, if the payment within a reasonable time
to the Trustee of the cost, expenses and liabilities likely to be incurred by
it in making such investigation is not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the
security afforded to it by the terms of this Indenture, the Trustee may require
reasonable indemnity against such expense or liability as a condition to so
proceeding.

If the Trustee shall determine or shall be requested, as
aforesaid, to make such further investigation, it shall be entitled to examine
the books, records and premises of the Company; and unless satisfied, with or
without such investigation, of the truth and accuracy of the matters stated in
such resolutions, certificates, statements, opinions, reports, orders or other
instruments, it shall be under no obligation to grant any application or take
or permit any action hereunder. The reasonable expense of every such
examination shall be paid by the Company, or, if paid

- 38 -

<PAGE> 44
by the Trustee, shall be repaid by the Company, upon demand, with interest at
the rate of six per cent (6%) per annum, and until such repayment shall be
secured by a lien on the property subject to the lien of this Indenture and the
proceeds thereof prior to the lien of the Obligations but subject to Permitted
Liens.

SECTION 3. Notice. The Trustee shall give to the Secured
Parties notice by first class mail of the happening of all defaults known to it
within ten days after the occurrence thereof, but in the case of any default of
the character specified in Subdivision (a) of Section 1 of Article IX, no such
notice shall be given until at least sixty days after the occurrence thereof.
For the purposes of this Section 3, the term "default" shall mean any Event of
Default specified in Section 1 of Article IX, not including in the case of the
defaults specified in paragraph (a) thereof any periods of grace provided for
therein.

Nothing herein contained shall require the Trustee to ascertain
or inquire as to the observance or performance of any covenants, agreements or
obligations, on the part of the Company hereunder or as to the existence of any
Event of Default hereunder other than such an Event of Default known to it or
as to which it has received written notice from any Secured Party.

Nothing herein contained shall require the Trustee to give any
notice of any default which has been cured.

SECTION 4. Cessation. If the Trustee shall at any time cease to
be a bank or trust company in good standing organized and doing business under
the laws of the United States or of any State and having a combined capital and
surplus of not less than $25 million which is authorized under the laws of the
jurisdiction of incorporation to exercise corporate trust powers and is subject
to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority, then the Trustee
shall resign within thirty days thereafter, such resignation to become
effective upon the appointment of a successor Trustee and such successor's
acceptance of such appointment. If the Trustee publishes reports of condition
at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid
supervising or examining authority, the combined capital and surplus of the
Trustee shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in
its most recent report of condition so published.

SECTION 5. Resignation. The Trustee may resign and be
discharged from the trust hereby created by giving notice thereof to the
Company specifying the date when such resignation shall take effect, and by
giving notice thereof by first class mail to the Secured Parties. Such
resignation shall take effect on the date specified in such notice unless
previously a successor Trustee shall have been appointed as hereinafter
provided, in which event such resignation shall take effect upon the
appointment of such successor Trustee.

The Trustee may be removed at any time by an instrument or
instruments in writing delivered to the Trustee and to the Company, and a
successor Trustee may be appointed by an instrument or instruments in writing
delivered to such successor

- 39 -

<PAGE> 45
Trustee and to the Company, in either case signed by the Designated Holders or
by their duly authorized attorneys-in-fact; but, until a new Trustee shall be
appointed by the Designated Holders or a court of competent jurisdiction as
herein authorized, the Company, by an instrument executed by order of its Board
of Directors, shall appoint a Trustee to fill the vacancy. Every such
successor Trustee so appointed by the Designated Holders, by a court of
competent jurisdiction or by the Company shall be a bank or trust company in
good standing organized and doing business under the laws of the United States
or of any State and having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $25
million, which is authorized under the laws of the jurisdiction of
incorporation to exercise corporate trust powers and is subject to supervision
or examination by a Federal or State authority. If such successor Trustee
publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the
requirements of said supervising or examining authority, the combined capital
and surplus of such successor Trustee shall be deemed to be its combined
capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so
published.

If in a proper case no appointment of a successor Trustee shall
be made pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Article within six months
after a vacancy shall have occurred in the office of trustee, a Secured Party
or the retiring Trustee may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to
appoint a successor Trustee. Said court may thereupon, after such notice, if
any, as such court may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor Trustee.

SECTION 6. Successor Trustee. Any successor Trustee appointed
under any of the methods herein provided shall execute, acknowledge and deliver
to its predecessor Trustee and to the Company an instrument in writing
accepting such appointment hereunder and thereupon such successor Trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully vested with the
estates, properties, rights, powers and trusts of its predecessor in the trust
hereunder with like effect as if originally named as Trustee hereunder; but the
predecessor Trustee shall, nevertheless, at the written request of the
successor Trustee, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to the
successor Trustee all the estates, properties, rights, powers and trusts of the
predecessor Trustee hereunder and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all
property and moneys held by it to its successor. Should any instrument in
writing from the Company be required by any successor Trustee for more fully
and effectually vesting in and confirming to it all estates, properties,
rights, powers and duties as Trustee hereunder, the Company, upon the request
of such successor Trustee, shall make, execute and deliver the same. The
Company shall promptly give notice of the appointment of such successor Trustee
to the Secured Parties by first class mail.

SECTION 7. Merger. Any corporation into which the Trustee or
any successor to it in the trust created by this Indenture may be merged, or
with which it or any successor to it may be consolidated, or any corporation
resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Trustee or any
successor to it shall be a party, shall be the successor Trustee under this
Indenture without the execution or filing of any instruments or any further act
on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding.

- 40 -

<PAGE> 46
SECTION 8. Trustee as Secured Party. The Trustee may be a
Secured Party and otherwise deal with the Company in the same manner and to the
same extent and with like effect as though it were not Trustee hereunder.

SECTION 9. Appointment of a Co-Trustee. It is the purpose
of this Indenture that there shall be no violation of any law of any
jurisdiction denying or restricting the right of banking corporations or
associations to transact business as trustees in such jurisdiction. It is
recognized that in case of litigation under this Indenture, and, in particular,
in case of the enforcement hereof upon an Event of Default, or in case the
Trustee deems that by reason of any present or future law of any jurisdiction
it may not exercise any of the powers, rights or remedies granted herein to the
Trustee or hold title to the properties, in trust, as herein granted, or take
any other action which may be desirable or necessary in connection therewith,
it may be necessary that the Trustee appoint, with the consent of the Company
(to the extent that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing
hereunder), an additional individual or institution as a separate trustee or
co-trustee. The following provisions of this Section are adapted to these
ends.

In the event that the Trustee appoints an additional individual
or institution as a separate trustee or co-trustee, in the event of the
incapacity or lack of authority of the Trustee, by reason of any present or
future law of any jurisdiction, to exercise any of the rights, powers, trusts
and remedies herein granted to the Trustee or to hold title to the trust estate
or to take any other action which may be necessary or desirable in connection
therewith, each and every remedy, power, right, obligation, claim, demand,
cause of action, immunity, estate, title, interest and lien expressed or
intended by this Indenture to be imposed upon, exercised by or vested in or
conveyed to the Trustee with respect thereto shall be imposed upon, exercisable
by and vest in such separate trustee or co-trustee, but only to the extent
necessary to enable such separate trustee or co-trustee to exercise such
powers, rights, trusts and remedies, and every covenant and obligation
necessary to the exercise thereof by such separate trustee or co-trustee shall
run to and be enforceable by either of them. Such separate trustee or
co-trustee shall deliver an instrument in writing acknowledging and accepting
its appointment hereunder to the Trustee and the Company.

Should any instrument in writing from the Company reasonably be
required by the separate trustee or co-trustee so appointed by the Trustee for
more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to him or it such
properties, rights, powers, trusts, duties and obligations, any and all such
instruments in writing shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged and
delivered by the Company. If the Company shall fail to deliver the same within
thirty days of such request, the Trustee is hereby appointed attorney-in-fact
for the Company to execute, acknowledge and deliver such instruments in the
Company's name and stead. In case any separate trustee or co-trustee, or a
successor to either, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be
removed, all the estates, properties, rights, powers, trusts, duties and
obligations of such separate trustee or co-trustee, so far as permitted by law,
shall vest in and be exercised by the Trustee until the appointment of a new
trustee or successor to such separate trustee or co-trustee.

ARTICLE XIV

SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES

SECTION 1. Supplemental Indentures Without Consent of Secured
Parties. In addition to any supplemental indenture otherwise authorized by
this Indenture, the Company, when authorized by resolution of its Board and the
Trustee, from time to time and at any time, subject to the conditions and
restrictions in this Indenture contained, may without the consent of, or notice
to, any of the Secured Parties enter into an indenture or indentures
supplemental hereto and which thereafter shall form a part hereof for any one
or more or all of the following purposes:

(a) to close this Indenture against, or to restrict,
in addition to the limitations and restrictions herein contained,
the securing of additional Obligations hereunder by imposing
additional conditions and restrictions to be thereafter observed,
whether applicable in respect of all Obligations, or otherwise;

(b) to add to the covenants and agreements of the
Company in this Indenture contained, other covenants and
agreements thereafter to be observed and which do not conflict
with the then existing covenants and agreements of the Company
contained in this Indenture and to surrender any right or power
herein reserved to or conferred upon the Company although the
freedom of action of the Company may be materially restricted
thereby;

(c) to convey, transfer and assign to the Trustee,
and to subject to the lien of this Indenture, but in all cases
subject to Permitted Liens, including the First Mortgage Lien and
any Prior Liens, with the same force and effect as though
included in the granting clauses hereof, additional properties
hereafter acquired by the Company, whether through consolidation,
merger or by purchase or otherwise and to correct or amplify the
description of any properties at any time subject to the lien of
this Indenture;

(d) to make such provisions in regard to matters or
questions arising under this Indenture as may be necessary or
desirable and not inconsistent with this Indenture;

(e) to modify any of the provisions of this
Indenture or to relieve the Company from any of the obligations,
conditions or restrictions herein contained, provided that no
such modification shall be or become operative or effective which
shall in any manner impair any of the rights of the Secured
Parties or of the Trustee, while any Obligations which are then
secured hereunder prior to the execution of such supplemental
indenture shall remain outstanding; and provided, also, that the
Trustee may in its uncontrolled discretion decline to enter into
any such supplemental indenture which in its

- 42 -

<PAGE> 48
opinion may not afford adequate protection to the Trustee when
the same shall become operative;

(f) to achieve compliance of this Indenture with any
applicable federal securities law, including, but not limited to,
The Trust Indenture Act of 1939;

(g) to confirm that any additional Obligations to be
secured hereunder pursuant to the provisions of Article III
hereof are or will be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture;
and

(h) for any other purpose not inconsistent with the
terms of this Indenture, or for the purpose of curing any
ambiguity or curing, correcting or supplementing any defect or
inconsistent provision contained in this Indenture or any
supplemental indenture, or in order to more specifically identify
and describe those parcels of land in Exhibit A hereto which were
not owned by the Company on the date hereof and which were
therefore not intended to be part of the mortgaged property or
trust estate.

SECTION 2. Supplemental Indentures with Consent of Designated
Holders and Agents. With the consent of (i) the Designated Holders and (ii)
the Agent under each Credit Agreement, the Company and the Trustee may, from
time to time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the
purpose of adding any provision to or changing in any manner or eliminating any
of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of
modifying in any manner the rights of the Secured Parties hereunder; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that no such supplemental indenture shall amend the definition of
Designated Holders (or any of the related defined terms) or any other provision
hereof so as to reduce the required percentages of holders of the Obligations
the consent of which is required for the taking of any Act hereunder or amend
this Section 2 or Section 5 of Article VII or modify any other provision hereof
intended to provide for the ratable securing of all the Obligations, without in
each case the consent of all of the Secured Parties.

SECTION 3. Parties To Supplemental Indenture. The Trustee is
hereby authorized to join with the Company in the execution of any supplemental
indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture, and to make
the further agreements and stipulations which may be therein contained.
Thereafter, that supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture;
all terms and conditions contained in that supplemental indenture as to any
provision authorized to be contained therein shall be deemed to be a part of
the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes; this
Indenture shall be deemed to be modified and amended in accordance with that
supplemental indenture; and the respective rights, duties and obligations under
this Indenture of the Company, the Trustee and the Secured Parties then
outstanding shall be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder in a manner
which is subject in all respects to those modifications and amendments made by
that supplemental indenture. The Trustee shall not be required to enter into
any

- 43 -

<PAGE> 49
supplemental indenture which alters, amends, modifies or adversely affects the
rights, remedies or duties of the Trustee hereunder.

ARTICLE XV
CANCELLATION AND DISCHARGE OF LIEN OF THIS INDENTURE

SECTION 1. Cancellation and Discharge of Lien. If no Event of
Default hereunder, and no event that with the giving of notice or the passage
of time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default hereunder, shall have
happened and be continuing and the Trustee has received either (a) a
certificate from each Agent stating that all outstanding Bank Obligations have
been paid in full and each Agent shall have confirmed to the Trustee in writing
that the Bank(s) have no Commitments under the Credit Agreement to which such
Agent is a party or (b) an officer's certificate stating that the ratings
assigned by Moody's and S&P to the Company's senior secured debt (being its
First Mortgage Bonds) are "Baa3" or higher by Moody's and "BBB-" or higher by
S&P, together with instruments from Moody's and S&P evidencing such ratings
then, in either instance, these presents and the estate and rights hereby
granted shall cease, determine and be void, and thereupon the Trustee shall,
upon the request of the Company, cancel and discharge the lien of this
Indenture, and execute and deliver to the Company such deeds and other
instruments as shall be requisite to satisfy the lien hereof, and reconvey to
the Company the trust estate and title hereby conveyed, and assign and deliver
to the Company any property at the time subject to the lien of this Indenture
which may then be in its possession.

The cancellation and discharge of this Indenture, however, shall
be without prejudice to the right of the Trustee to be paid any compensation
then due it hereunder, and to be protected and saved harmless by the Company
from any and all losses, liabilities, costs and expenses, including counsel
fees, at any time incurred by the Trustee hereunder or connected with any
Obligation and from which, if this Indenture had not been canceled and
discharged, the Company would have been obligated by the terms of this
Indenture to protect and save the Trustee harmless, and the Company hereby
covenants to protect and save the Trustee harmless from any and all such
losses, liabilities, costs and expenses.

ARTICLE XVI
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

SECTION 1. No Benefit to Third Parties. Nothing in this
Indenture, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer
upon, or to give to, any person, firm or corporation, other than the parties
hereto, and the Secured Parties, any right, remedy or claim under or by reason
of this Indenture or any covenant, condition or stipulation hereof; and the
covenants, stipulations and agreements in this Indenture contained are and
shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties hereto, their
successors and assigns, and the Secured Parties.

SECTION 2. Invalidity. In case any one or more of the
provisions contained in this Indenture should be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect, the validity,

- 44 -

<PAGE> 50
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and
therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

SECTION 3. Date. Although this Indenture, for convenience and
for the purpose of reference is dated June 1, 1994, the actual date of
execution by the Company and by the Trustee is as indicated by their respective
acknowledgments hereto annexed.

SECTION 4. Certification; Notice; Opinion. The same officer or
officers of the Company, or the same counsel or other person, as the case may
be, may, but need not, certify to all the matters required to be certified
under any Article, Section, Subdivision or other portion hereof, but different
officers, counsel or other persons may certify to different facts,
respectively. Where any person or persons are required to make, give or
execute two or more orders, requests, certificates, opinions or other
instruments under this Indenture, any such orders, requests, certificates,
opinions or other instruments may, but need not, be consolidated and form one
instrument.

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Indenture, or in
any indenture supplemental hereto, any request, opinion, consent, demand,
notice, order, appointment, or other direction required or permitted to be made
or given by the Company, shall be deemed to have been sufficiently made or
given if executed on behalf of the Company by its President or any of its Vice
Presidents and its Secretary or any of its Assistant Secretaries or its
Treasurer or any of its Assistant Treasurers.

Any opinion of counsel required to be furnished pursuant to any
of the provisions of this Indenture may, in lieu of stating the facts required
by the provisions hereof, state that the required conditions will be fulfilled
on the execution and delivery of designated instruments, which instruments
shall be delivered in form approved by such counsel prior to or concurrently
with the taking or suffering by the Trustee of the action as a condition
precedent to which such opinion is required to be furnished under the terms of
this Indenture.

Upon any application by the Company to the Trustee to take any
action under any of the provisions of this Indenture, the Company shall furnish
to the Trustee an officers' certificate and opinion of counsel, each stating
that all conditions precedent provided for in this Indenture (including any
covenants compliance with which constitutes a condition precedent) with respect
to such application have been complied with, whether or not the furnishing of
such documents shall be actually required by the provisions of this Indenture
relating to such particular application.

Each certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a
condition or covenant provided for in this Indenture shall include (1) a
statement that the person making such certificate or opinion has read such
covenant or condition; (2) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the
examination or investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in
such certificate or opinion are based; (3) a statement that, in the opinion of
such person, he has made such examination or investigation as is necessary to
enable him to express an informed opinion as to

- 45 -

<PAGE> 51
whether or not such covenant or condition has been complied with; and (4) a
statement as to whether or not, in the opinion of such person, such condition or
covenant has been complied with.

Any notice to or demand upon the Trustee may be served or
presented, and such demand may be made, at the principal office of the Trustee.
Any notice to or demand upon the Company shall be deemed to have been
sufficiently given or served by the Trustee, for all purposes, by being
deposited, postage prepaid, in a post-office letter box addressed to the
Company, c/o Centerior Energy Corporation, P.O. Box 94661, Cleveland, Ohio
44101-4661, or to the Company at such other address as may be filed in writing
by the Company with the Trustee.

SECTION 5. Successors. Subject to the provisions of Articles
XII and XIII, whenever in this Indenture any of the parties hereto is named or
referred to, the successors and assigns of such party shall be deemed to be
included, and all the covenants, promises and agreements in this Indenture
contained by or on behalf of the Company, or by or on behalf of the Trustee,
shall bind and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns,
whether so expressed or not.

SECTION 6. Counterparts. This Indenture may be simultaneously
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and
delivered shall be an original; but such counterparts shall together constitute
but one and the same instrument.

SECTION 7. Exclusion of Certain Further Permitted Obligations
Under Certain Circumstances. If, subsequent to the date of this Indenture
either: (a) any letter of credit issued pursuant to the reimbursement agreement
described on Exhibit B-2 to this Indenture is surrendered to the issuer thereof
without having been drawn upon, or (b) an order for relief is entered following
the filing of a bankruptcy petition by or against the Company, which order for
relief is entered within one (1) year following the issuance of such letter of
credit, then, immediately upon that surrender of such letter of credit or the
entering of the order for relief, as applicable, the reimbursement obligation
with respect to such letter of credit shall, automatically and without any
further action of any person, cease to be a Further Permitted Obligation and
cease to be an Obligation for purposes of this Indenture. It is anticipated
that the beneficiary of the surrendered letter of credit will deliver written
notice of such surrender to the Trustee; however, the failure of the
beneficiary to provide such notice shall not negate or limit the effect of the
first sentence of this Section 7.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, said The Cleveland Electric Illuminating
Company has caused this Indenture to be executed on its behalf by one of its
Vice Presidents and its corporate seal to be hereto affixed and said seal and
this Indenture to be attested by one of its Assistant Secretaries; and said

under the First Mortgage and any Prior Liens securing the payment of any prior
lien bonds including any extension, recast, replacement, amendment, supplement,
restatement or renewal of Permitted Liens, including the First Mortgage or any
Prior Lien and irrespective of any modification of the First Mortgage or any
Prior Lien or any of the First Mortgage Bonds or prior lien bonds or the

used in the CEI Subordinate Indenture).

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5 of Article IX hereof,
any proceeds realized from the sale or other disposition of the mortgaged
property, any part thereof or any interest therein, upon foreclosure of the
First Mortgage or any Prior Lien and this Indenture shall be applied as
follows:

First: to the payment of all sums and amounts due and
----- owing under the First Mortgage or such Prior
Lien, including, but not limited to, the payment
in full of all of the First Mortgage Bonds and
any prior lien bonds;

Second: the balance, if any, to the payment of all sums 
------ and amounts due and owing and secured by this 
Indenture.

In the event that, in violation of the foregoing paragraph, any
payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or
securities, shall be received by the Trustee before the First Mortgage Bonds or
prior lien bonds are paid in full, or provisions made for such payment in
accordance with the terms of the First Mortgage Bonds and the First Mortgage
and the Prior Liens and prior lien bonds, such payment or distribution shall be
held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered to the
trustee under the First Mortgage and Prior Lien for application to the payment
of all payments on the First Mortgage Bonds and prior lien bonds remaining
unpaid to the extent necessary to make all such payments on the First Mortgage
Bonds and prior lien bonds in full in accordance with the terms thereof after
giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to the holders of the
First Mortgage Bonds and the prior lien bonds, or to the trustee under the
First Mortgage for the benefit of holders of the First Mortgage Bonds or under
the Prior Lien for the benefit of holders of prior lien bonds. For purposes of
this Section, the Trustee may rely conclusively upon, and shall be fully
protected in relying upon, a certificate of the trustee under the First
Mortgage with respect to the outstanding balance of the First Mortgage Bonds or
any prior lien bonds.

SECTION 2. Further Assurances. The Trustee from time to time
will, upon reasonable request, execute and deliver such further instruments and
do such further acts as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of this
Indenture, especially to make the lien hereof subordinate and junior in
priority (1) to Permitted Liens, including the First Mortgage Lien and any
Prior Liens, and (2) in the event of a merger of the Company into CEI, to
Permitted Liens as such term is defined in the CEI Subordinate Indenture.

possessed of all the mortgaged property; that it has good right and lawful
authority to mortgage the same as provided in this Indenture; and that the

which any part of such property is held; and that the Company will not suffer
any mechanics', laborers', statutory or other similar lien or charge to be
hereafter created or remain upon such property or any part thereof, or the
income therefrom. However, nothing contained in this Section shall require any
such tax, assessment, lien or charge to be paid or any such requirement to be
complied with so long as the validity thereof shall be contested in good faith,
unless thereby, in the opinion of the Trustee or of counsel selected or
approved by the Trustee, any of such property may be lost or forfeited. The
Trustee is under no duty to render its opinion or to obtain the opinion of
counsel referred to in the preceding sentence, unless requested by any Agent or
Representative.

mortgaged property in the amount and with the coverage required by the First
Mortgage, as in effect on the date hereof, and on each such insurance policy
will cause the Trustee to be named as an additional insured and loss payee as

SECTION 5. Advances. That, if the Company shall fail to perform
any of the covenants contained in Sections 2, 3 and 4 of this Article, the
Trustee, or any receiver appointed hereunder, may make, but is under no duty to
make, advances to perform the same in its behalf; and the Company hereby agrees
to repay all sums so advanced in its behalf, on demand, with interest at six
percent (6%) per annum after demand, and all sums so advanced, with interest as
aforesaid, shall be secured hereby having the benefit of the lien hereof in
priority to the indebtedness evidenced by the Obligations but subordinate and
junior in priority to the First Mortgage Lien and any Prior Liens; but no such
advances shall be deemed to relieve the Company from any default hereunder.

SECTION 6. Recordation. That the Company will cause this
Indenture and any and all supplemental indentures and instruments of further
assurance at all times to be kept recorded and filed in such manner and in such
places as may in the opinion of counsel be required by law in order fully to

action, or stating that in the opinion of such counsel no such
action is necessary to make such lien effective; and

the year 1995, an opinion of counsel either stating that in the
opinion of such counsel such action has been taken with respect
to the recording, filing, re-recording and re-filing of this

action, or stating that in the opinion of such counsel no such
action is necessary to maintain such lien.

reasonable request, execute and deliver such further instruments and do such
further acts as may be necessary or proper to carry out more effectually the
purposes of this Indenture, especially to make subject to the lien hereof any
property agreed to be subjected hereto, or intended so to be, to transfer to
any new trustee or trustees the trust estate, powers, instruments and funds
held in trust hereunder and to confirm the lien of this Indenture with respect
to any Obligation.

SECTION 8. Subordination of Subsequent Mortgages. That in case
the Company shall hereafter create any mortgage upon, or pledge of, the
mortgaged property or any part thereof, other than Permitted Liens, such
mortgage or pledge shall

<PAGE> 31
be and shall be expressed, in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee,
to be subject to first, Permitted Liens, including the prior lien of the First

delivered or thereafter to be authenticated and delivered under the First
Mortgage and Prior Liens for the security of all prior lien bonds then
authenticated and delivered or thereafter to be authenticated and delivered
under Prior Liens, and second, the Prior Lien of this Indenture for the
security of the Obligations. That, subject to the provisions of Article XII,
in case the Company shall hereafter acquire or own any property (other than
property of the nature specifically excepted by the terms of the granting

any event will be subject to the First Mortgage Lien) and with respect to which
it has the power to subject either to the lien of this Indenture or to a Prior
Lien as a superior lien, it will subject such property to the lien of this
Indenture as a superior lien (but which lien in any event will be subordinate

That the Company will faithfully perform or cause to be performed all the
terms, covenants and conditions to be performed by the Company under the First

secured thereby, including the principal of any outstanding First Mortgage
Bonds or of any prior lien bonds.

SECTION 10. Corporate Existence. That the Company will, subject
to the provisions of Article XII, at all times maintain its corporate existence

maintain, preserve and renew, all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises
owned by it.

SECTION 11. Compliance with Laws. That the Company will comply
in all material respects with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and

property, such compliance to include, without limitation, all federal, state
and local laws relating in any way to the protection of the environment, except
to the extent compliance with any of the foregoing is then being contested in
good faith unless thereby, in the opinion of the Trustee or of counsel selected
or approved by the Trustee, any mortgaged property may be lost or forfeited.

counsel referred to in the preceding sentence, unless requested by any Agent or

POSSESSION, USE AND RELEASE OF PROPERTY

SECTION 1. Possession Until Default. Unless an Event of Default
shall have happened and be continuing, the Company shall be suffered and
permitted to possess, use and enjoy all the property and appurtenances,
franchises and rights conveyed by this Indenture, and to receive and use the
rents, issues, income, products and profits thereof, with power in the ordinary
course of business, freely and without let or hindrance on the part of the
Trustee, to use and consume materials and supplies, deal with choses in action,
leases (other than leases subject to the lien of this Indenture) and contracts,
exercise the rights and powers conferred upon it thereby, alter and repair its
buildings and structures, change the position of any of its buildings,
structures, plants, poles, wires, conduits or other property whatsoever and
replace and renew any of its equipment, machinery or other property, except
that the position of none of the mortgaged property may be changed so as to
impair the lien of this Indenture thereon unless such property is sold,
abandoned or otherwise disposed of as permitted by this Section 1 or Section 2
of this Article VII or released as provided in Section 3 of this Article VII.

SECTION 2. Disposition Without Consent. The Company may at any
time and from time to time, without any release or consent by the Trustee:

(a) Sell or otherwise dispose of, free from the lien
of this Indenture, any machinery or equipment, which has become
worn out, unserviceable, undesirable or unnecessary for use in
the conduct of its business, upon replacing the same with, or
substituting for the same, new machinery or equipment, or other
property of a value at least equal to the original cost of such
things so disposed of, which new machinery, equipment or other
property shall without further action become subject to the lien
of this Indenture, subject to Permitted Liens;

(b) Abandon any property, if in the opinion of the
Board of Directors the abandonment of such property is desirable
in the proper

- 26 -

<PAGE> 33
conduct of the business and in the operation of the properties of
the Company, or is otherwise in the best interests of the
Company;

(c) Modify or amend any lease which shall be a part
of the trust estate provided that the Company shall forthwith
assign to and mortgage with the Trustee the modified or amended
lease, subject to Permitted Liens;

(d) Surrender or assent to the modification of any
franchise, license, authority or permit which it may hold, or
under which it may be operating, provided that the Company shall
have the right, in the opinion of counsel, under the modified
franchise, license, authority or permit, or under a new
franchise, license, authority or permit received in exchange in
the event of any such surrender, or under some other franchise,
license, authority or permit, to conduct the same or an extended
business in the same or an extended territory during the same or
an extended or unlimited or indeterminate or indefinite period of
time. For the purposes of this Subdivision (d) and of any
opinion to be rendered under it, any right of any municipality to
terminate a permit, license or franchise by purchase, shall not
be deemed to abridge or affect its duration; and

(e) Surrender or assent to or procure a modification
of any franchise, license, authority or permit under which it
operates any of its properties, which it may now or hereafter
hold or under which it may now or hereafter operate, if, in the
opinion of the Board of Directors, it is no longer necessary or
desirable in the profitable conduct of the Company's business or
in the best interests of the Company to operate such properties
or to comply with the terms and provisions of such franchise,
license, authority or permit and, if the value and utility
generally of all of its properties as an entirety and the value
of the security for the Obligations will not thereby be impaired.

SECTION 3. Disposition upon Release Under First Mortgage and
Prior Liens. From time to time hereafter the Company may transfer or otherwise
dispose of any property constituting a part of the trust estate, and the
Trustee shall, subject to the provisions of Section 5 of Article VII hereof,
release the same from the lien of this Indenture, but only upon receipt by it
of:

(a) A certified resolution requesting such release;

(b) A copy of the documents delivered by the Company
to the First Mortgage Trustee or holder of a Prior Lien in
connection therewith;

(c) A copy of the instrument executed by the First

property from the First Mortgage Lien or such Prior Lien; and

- 27 -

<PAGE> 34

certificate stating that such disposition and release does not
violate any covenants hereof.

SECTION 4. No Duty to Investigate. In no event shall any
purchaser or purchasers in good faith of any property purported to be released
hereunder be bound to ascertain the authority of the Trustee to execute the
release; or to inquire as to any facts required by the provisions hereof for
the exercise of such authority; or to see to the application of the purchase
moneys. Nor shall any purchaser of machinery or equipment or tools or
implements or materials or supplies be under obligation to ascertain or inquire
into the occurrence of the event on which any such sale is hereby authorized.

SECTION 5. Obligations and Powers of Trustee. The Trustee shall
not be required under any of the provisions of this Article VII to release any
part of the mortgaged property from the lien hereof at any time when to the
knowledge of the Trustee the Company shall be in default hereunder, but
notwithstanding any such default the Trustee may release from the lien hereof
any part of the mortgaged property, upon compliance by the Company with the
other conditions specified in this Article VII in respect thereof, if the
Trustee shall have received the consent of the Designated Holders provided
however that the consent of a Bank with respect to its Bank Obligations under a
Credit Agreement initially secured hereunder as identified in Exhibit B-1
hereof shall not be deemed effective unless all of the Banks which are a party
to such Credit Agreement shall have given their consent. In case the trust
estate shall be in the possession of one or more receivers lawfully appointed
or of a trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization proceedings (including a
trustee or trustees appointed under the provisions of the bankruptcy laws of
the United States) or of assignees for the benefit of creditors, the powers by
this Article VII conferred upon the Company may be exercised by such receivers,
trustees or assignees, with the approval of the Trustee, regardless of whether
or not the Company is in default hereunder, and in such event a writing signed
by such receivers, trustees or assignees, may be received by the Trustee in
lieu of any certified resolution required by the provisions of this Article.

- 28 -

<PAGE> 35
(a) Default shall be made by the Company in the
performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or
conditions on its part in this Indenture or any indenture
supplemental hereto, and such default shall continue for a period
of sixty days after written notice to the Company by the Trustee;
or

(b) The occurrence of an "event of default" under
the First Mortgage which has resulted in a declaration that the
principal amount of all of the First Mortgage Bonds is
immediately due and payable; or

(c) Any proceeding shall be instituted by or against
the Company seeking to adjudicate it a bankrupt or insolvent, or
seeking liquidation, winding up, reorganization, arrangement,
adjustment, protection, relief, or composition or arrangement
with creditors, a readjustment of its debts, in each case under
any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or
relief of debtors, or seeking the entry of an order for relief or
the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or other
similar official for it or for any substantial part of its
property and, in the case of any such proceeding instituted
against it (but not instituted or acquiesced in by it), either
such proceeding shall remain undismissed or unstayed for a period
of 60 consecutive days, or any of the actions sought in such
proceeding (including, without limitation, the entry of an order
for relief against, or the appointment of a receiver, trustee,
custodian or other similar official for, it or for any
substantial part of its property) shall occur; or

(d) A Notice of Actionable Event shall have been
given to a responsible officer of the Trustee and shall remain
outstanding.

An Event of Default and its consequences may be waived at any
time prior to the sale of the trust estate by an instrument delivered to the
Trustee and signed by (i) the Designated Holders in the case of an Event of
Default arising under subsections (a), (b) or (c) above or (ii) each Agent or
Representative which delivered the Notice of Actionable Event in the case of an
Event of Default arising under subsection (d) above. No such waiver shall
extend to or affect any subsequent default or impair or exhaust any right or
power consequent thereon. An Event of Default arising under subsection (d)
above shall no longer be continuing once such Notice of Actionable Event has
been rescinded.

SECTION 2. Sale of Trust Estate. If an Event of Default shall
happen and be continuing, then, and in every such case, the Trustee may in its
sole discretion, and upon the written request of the Control Party, shall, if
and to the extent permitted by law, by such officer or agent as it may appoint,
sell, subject to Permitted Liens, the trust estate as an entirety or in such
parcels as the Trustee may in its sole discretion determine, at public auction
at some convenient place in the City of Toledo, Ohio, or at such other place or
places as may be required by law, having first published notice of such sale in
an authorized newspaper in the City of Toledo, Ohio, at least once in

- 29 -

<PAGE> 36
each of four successive calendar weeks preceding such sale, and having given
any other notice which may be required by law; and from time to time to adjourn
such sale in its discretion by announcement at the time and place appointed for
such sale or for such adjourned sale or sales without further notice except
such as may be required by law; and upon such sale to make or deliver to the
purchaser or purchasers a good and sufficient deed or deeds for the same,
subject to Permitted Liens. The Trustee and its successors are hereby
irrevocably appointed the true and lawful attorneys of the Company, in its name
and stead, to make all necessary conveyances, assignments and transfers of
property thus sold, subject to Permitted Liens; and for that purpose it and
they may execute all necessary deeds, bills of sale and instruments of
assignment and transfer, and may substitute one or more persons, firms or
corporations with like power, the Company hereby ratifying and confirming all
that its said attorneys, or such substitute or substitutes, shall lawfully do
by virtue hereof. Nevertheless, if so requested by the Trustee or by any
purchaser, the Company shall ratify and confirm any such sale or transfer by
executing and delivering to the Trustee or to such purchaser or purchasers all
proper conveyances, assignments, instruments of transfer, and releases as may
be designated in any such request, subject to Permitted Liens.

SECTION 3. Foreclosure. If an Event of Default shall happen and
be continuing, then, and in every such case, the Trustee may in its sole
discretion, and upon the written request of the Control Party, shall, proceed
by suit or suits at law or in equity or by any other appropriate remedy to
foreclose this mortgage and to sell, subject to Permitted Liens, the trust
estate under a judgment or decree of a court or courts of competent
jurisdiction, or by the enforcement of any other appropriate legal or equitable
remedy as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of
its rights or any of the rights of the Secured Parties.

SECTION 4. Manner of Sale. Upon any sale, whether made under
the power of sale hereby given or by virtue of judicial proceedings, the whole
of the trust estate shall be sold in one parcel as an entirety, unless such
sale as an entirety, in the sole discretion of the Trustee, shall be
impracticable by reason of some statute or other cause, or unless the Control
Party shall in writing request the Trustee to cause the trust estate to be sold
in parcels, in which case the sale shall be made in such parcels and in such
order as may be specified in such request, but, if not so specified, as the
Trustee in its sole discretion shall deem most expedient in the interest of the
Secured Parties, but every such sale shall be subject to Permitted Liens. The
Company, to the full extent that it may lawfully do so, for itself, and for all
who may claim through or under it, hereby expressly waives and releases all
right to have the trust estate or any part thereof marshalled upon any
foreclosure, sale or other enforcement hereof, and the Trustee, or any court in
which the foreclosure of this Indenture or the administration of the trust
hereby created is sought, shall have the right as aforesaid to sell the entire
trust estate as a whole in a single parcel, but every such sale shall be
subject to Permitted Liens.

Upon any sale, whether made under the power of sale hereby given
or by virtue of judicial proceedings, any Secured Party may bid for and
purchase the

- 30 -

<PAGE> 37
mortgaged property, and upon compliance with the terms of sale, may hold,
retain and possess and dispose of such property in his or their own absolute
right without further accountability subject to Permitted Liens.

Upon any sale, whether made under the power of sale hereby given
or by virtue of judicial proceedings, the receipt of the Trustee, or of the
officer making a sale under judicial proceedings, shall be a sufficient
discharge to the purchaser or purchasers at any sale for his or their purchase
money, and such purchaser or purchasers, his or their assigns or personal
representative, shall not, after paying such purchase money and receiving such
receipt of the Trustee or of such officer therefor, be obliged to see to the
application of such purchase money, or be in any wise answerable for any loss,
misapplication or non-application thereof.

Any such sale, whether under any power of sale hereby given or by
virtue of judicial proceedings, shall operate to divest all right, title,
interest, claim and demand whatsoever, either at law or in equity, of the
Company, in and to the property sold, and shall be a perpetual bar both at law
and in equity, against the Company, its successors and assigns, and against any
and all persons claiming or to claim the property sold or any part thereof
from, through or under the Company, its successors or assigns, except the
holders and beneficiaries of Permitted Liens.

SECTION 5. Application of Proceeds. The proceeds of any sale,
whether made under any power of sale herein granted or pursuant to judicial
proceedings, together with any other sums which then may be held by the Trustee
under any of the provisions of this Indenture as part of the trust estate,
shall be applied as follows:

First: To the payment of the costs and expenses of such
sale, including a reasonable compensation to the Trustee, it
agents, attorneys and counsel, and of all necessary or proper
expenses and advances made or incurred by the Trustee under this
Indenture (including any unpaid fees or expenses of the Trustee),
and to the payment of all taxes, assessments or liens superior to
the lien of this Indenture (including, without limitation, the
First Mortgage Lien and any Prior Liens), except any taxes,
assessments or other superior liens (including, without
limitation, the First Mortgage Lien and any Prior Liens) subject
to which such sale shall have been made;

Second: To the payment of the whole amount then owing or
unpaid upon the Obligations for principal and interest, with
interest at the rate specified in such Obligations on overdue
principal and overdue installments of interest, and, in case such
proceeds shall be insufficient to pay in full the whole amount so
due and unpaid upon the Obligations, then to the payment of such
principal and interest ratably, without preference or priority of
principal over interest, or of interest over principal, or of any
instalment of interest over any other instalment of interest.
Such payments shall be made on the date fixed therefor by the
Trustee;

- 31 -

<PAGE> 38
Third: To the payment of any fees and expenses arising
pursuant to the Obligations and which are then due, owing and
unpaid to the Secured Parties; and

Fourth: All surplus then remaining to the Company, its
successors or assigns, or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled
to receive the same, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may
direct.

SECTION 6. Appointment of Receiver. If an Event of Default
shall happen and be continuing and upon filing a bill in equity or other
commencement of judicial proceedings to enforce the rights of the Trustee and
of the Secured Parties, the Trustee as a matter of right shall, to the extent
permitted by law and subject to the rights of holders or beneficiaries of
Permitted Liens, be entitled to the appointment of a receiver or receivers of
the trust estate and of the income, rents, issues and profits thereof pending
such proceedings, with such powers as the court making such appointment shall
confer, but notwithstanding the appointment of any receiver the Trustee shall
be entitled to retain possession and control of any property deposited or
pledged with it hereunder or agreed or provided to be delivered or deposited or
pledged with it hereunder, subject to the rights of holders or beneficiaries of
Permitted Liens.

SECTION 7. Waiver by Company. The Company agrees, to the
full extent that it may lawfully so agree, that in case of a default on its
part, as aforesaid, neither the Company nor any one claiming through or under
it shall or will set up, claim or seek to take advantage of any appraisement,
valuation, stay, extension or redemption laws now or hereafter in force in any
locality where any property subject to the lien hereof may be situated, in
order to prevent or hinder the enforcement or foreclosure of this Indenture,
the absolute sale of the trust estate or any portion thereof, or the final and
absolute putting into possession thereof, immediately after such sale, of the
purchaser or purchasers thereat, and the Company, to the full extent that it
may lawfully do so, for itself, and all who may claim through or under it,
hereby waives the benefit of all such laws.

SECTION 8. Direction by the Control Party. Subject to the
provisions of Section 1 of Article XIII, the Control Party shall have the
right, by an instrument in writing executed and delivered to the Trustee, to
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
open to the Trustee, and of exercising any power or trust conferred upon the
Trustee under this Indenture.

SECTION 9. Restoration to Former Position. In case the Trustee
shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this Indenture by foreclosure,
entry or otherwise and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or
abandoned for any reason, or shall have been determined adversely to the
Trustee, then, and in every such case, the Company and the Trustee shall be
restored to their former positions and rights hereunder in respect to the trust
estate, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Trustee shall continue as
though no such proceedings had been taken.

- 32 -

<PAGE> 39
SECTION 10. Suits in Name OF Trustee. Any such suits or
proceedings instituted by the Trustee pursuant to this Indenture shall be
brought in its own name for the ratable benefit of the Secured Parties, subject
to the provisions of this Indenture.

SECTION 11. No Waiver. No delay or omission of the Trustee to
exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any
such right or power or shall be construed to be a waiver of any such default or
acquiescence therein; and every right and power given by this Article to the
Trustee may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed
expedient by the Trustee.

Indenture.

ARTICLE XII

CONSOLIDATION, MERGER AND SALE

SECTION 1. No Bar. Nothing in this Indenture contained shall
prevent the consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the Company
into, any other corporation or prevent the sale or lease by the Company of its
property as an entirety or substantially as an entirety upon the terms
hereinafter set forth; provided that:

(a) any such consolidation or merger or sale or
lease shall be on such terms as not to impair the lien and
security of this Indenture upon any part of the trust estate or
any of the rights and powers of the Trustee;

- 33 -

<PAGE> 40
(b) upon any such consolidation, merger or sale,
subject to the provisions of Section 3 of this Article, if the
Company is not the surviving corporation, the due and punctual
performance and observance of all the covenants and conditions of
this Indenture shall, by supplemental indenture and as a
condition of any such consolidation or merger or as a
consideration for any such sale, be expressly assumed in an
instrument in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee by
the successor corporation formed by or resulting from any such
merger or consolidation or to which such sale shall have been
made; and

(c) any such lease shall be made expressly subject
to immediate termination by the Trustee, subject to the rights of

property so leased at any sale thereof hereunder, whether such
sale be made under the power of sale hereby conferred or under
judicial proceedings, subject to the rights of holders or
beneficiaries of Permitted Liens.

SECTION 2. Successor Corporation. Every successor corporation
resulting from a consolidation of the Company with another corporation or a
merger of the Company into another corporation or the sale by the Company of
all or substantially all of its property as an entirety to another corporation,
all on the terms set forth in Section 1 of this Article XII, shall upon

its discretion, shall subject the same to the lien hereof. The foregoing
provisions of this Section 3 notwithstanding, this Indenture shall, after such
consolidation, merger or sale constitute a lien of the rank herein provided
upon all properties and franchises acquired by such successor corporation from
the Company, which were subject to the lien hereof immediately prior to such
consolidation, merger or sale and upon all additions, extensions, improvements,
repairs and replacements to or about the plants or properties included in the

constituted (as distinguished from the additions, extensions, improvements,
repairs and replacements to or about the plants or properties appurtenant to
the plants or properties of the successor corporation and additional plants or
properties thereafter acquired by the successor corporation which shall not be
subject to the lien of this Indenture). Nothing contained in this Article XII,
however, shall affect or lessen the extent of the lien of this Indenture upon
the property of the Company hereafter acquired, by reason of the acquisition by
the Company of all or substantially all of the property of another corporation.

THE TRUSTEE

SECTION 1. The Trustee Generally. The Trustee accepts the
trusts created by this Indenture upon the terms and conditions hereof,
including the following:

(a) The Trustee shall be entitled to reasonable
compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder (which
compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in
regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust), and
such compensation, as well as the reasonable compensation of its
counsel, and all other reasonable expenses incurred by the
Trustee hereunder, and all taxes which may have been assessed
against the Trustee as such or against any funds on deposit with
it hereunder which the Trustee may be required or permitted by
law to deduct from such deposit and to pay, the Company agrees to
pay promptly on demand from time to time as such services shall
be rendered and as such expenses shall be incurred. In default
of such payment by the Company, the Trustee shall have a lien
therefor on the property subject to the lien of this Indenture
and the proceeds thereof prior to the lien of this Indenture, but
subject to Permitted Liens, and a lien therefor on any moneys
held by the Trustee hereunder prior to any rights in such moneys
of the Secured Parties. The Company also agrees to indemnify the
Trustee for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability
or expense incurred without negligence or bad faith on the part
of the Trustee, arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of this trust, as well as the costs
and expenses of defending against any claim of liability in the
premises.

(b) The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or
powers hereof and perform any duty hereunder either directly or
by or through its agents or attorneys.

(c) The Trustee shall not be responsible in any
manner whatsoever for the correctness of the recitals herein, all
of which are made by the Company solely; and the Trustee shall
not be responsible or accountable in

- 35 -

<PAGE> 42
any manner whatsoever for or with respect to the validity or
execution or sufficiency of this Indenture, or of any indenture
supplemental hereto, or for the value of the property subject to
the lien of this Indenture or any part thereof, or for the title
of the Company thereto, or for the security afforded thereby and
hereby, and the Trustee makes no representation with respect
thereto. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or
application by the Company of any moneys paid over by it in
accordance with any provision of this Indenture.

(d) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to
exercise any of the trusts or powers hereof at the request, order
or direction of any of the Agents or the Designated Holders,
pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee
shall be under no duty to foreclose, take possession of, or
otherwise control or act with respect to any real property which
is part of the mortgaged property, unless such Agents or
Designated Holders shall have offered to the Trustee security or
indemnity satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and
liabilities (including any potential liabilities under
environmental laws) to be incurred therein or thereby; upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default (which has not been cured), the
Trustee shall use the same degree of care and skill in the
exercise of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture
as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in
the conduct of his own affairs.

(e) The Trustee may consult with counsel, and, to
the extent permitted by Section 2 of this Article XIII, the
opinion of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization
and protection in respect of any action taken or suffered by it
hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the opinion of
such counsel.

(f) The Trustee, to the extent permitted by Section
2 of this Article XIII, may rely upon the certificate of the
Secretary or one of the Assistant Secretaries of the Company, as
to the adoption of any resolution by its Board or stockholders.

(g) Any action taken by the Trustee pursuant to any
provision hereof at the request or with the consent of any Person
who at the time is a Secured Party shall be conclusive and
binding in respect of all future holders of the Obligations then
held by such Secured Party, whether or not such Obligations shall
have noted thereon the fact that such request or consent had been
made or given.

(h) The Trustee shall not be personally liable in
case of entry by it upon the mortgaged property for debts
contracted or liability or damages incurred in the management or
operation of said property.

- 36 -

<PAGE> 43
(i) The Trustee, to the extent permitted by Section
2 of this Article XIII, may rely and shall be protected in acting
upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion,
report, notice, request, consent, order, or other paper or
document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or
presented by the proper party or parties.

(j) All moneys received by the Trustee under or
pursuant to any provision of this Indenture shall constitute
trust funds for the purposes for which they were paid or are
held, but need not be segregated in any manner from any other
moneys and may be deposited by the Trustee, under such conditions
as may be prescribed by law, in its general banking department,
and the Trustee shall not be liable for any interest thereon,
except that, so long as the Company is not in default hereunder,
it will allow and credit to the Company interest, if any, upon
such moneys at such rate as may then be customary for similar
deposits.

(k) The Trustee shall be under no duty to advance 
its own funds in enforcing this Indenture.

SECTION 2. Liability. None of the provisions of this Indenture
shall be construed as relieving the Trustee from liability for its own
negligent action, its own negligent failure to act, or its own wilful
misconduct, except that, anything in this Indenture contained to the contrary
notwithstanding:

(1) unless and until an Event of Default specified
in Section 1 of Article IX hereof shall have happened which at
the time is subsisting,

(a) the Trustee shall not be liable except
for the performance of such duties as are specifically
set out in this Indenture, and no implied covenants or
obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the
Trustee, whose duties and obligations shall be determined
solely by the express provisions of this Indenture; and

(b) the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to
the truth of the statements and the correctness of the
opinions expressed therein, in the absence of bad faith
on the part of the Trustee, upon resolutions,
certificates, statements, opinions, reports, orders or
other instruments furnished to it pursuant to the express
provisions of this Indenture; but in the case of any such
resolutions, certificates, statements, opinions, reports,
orders or other instruments which, by the provisions of
this Indenture, are specifically required to be furnished
to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to
examine the same to determine whether or not they conform
to the requirements of this Indenture;

- 37 -

<PAGE> 44
(2) the Trustee shall not be liable to any Secured
Party or to any other Person for any error of judgment made in
good faith by a responsible officer or officers of the Trustee,
unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in
ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

(3) the Trustee shall not be liable to any Secured
Party or to any other Person with respect to any action taken or
omitted to be taken by it in good faith, in accordance with the
direction of a Secured Party, relating to the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to it
or exercising any trust or power conferred upon it by this
Indenture.

If an Event of Default specified in Section 1 of Article IX
hereof shall have happened, then, so long as the same shall be subsisting, the
Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this
Indenture, and shall use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise,
as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct
of his own affairs.

Notwithstanding any provisions of this Indenture authorizing the
Trustee conclusively to rely upon any resolutions, certificates, statements,
opinions, reports, orders or other instruments, the Trustee may but, to the
extent permitted by this Section 2 of this Article XIII, need not, require any
further evidence or make any further investigation as to the facts or matters
stated therein which it may, in good faith, deem reasonable in the
circumstances; and the Trustee shall, if requested in writing so to do by an
Agent or a Secured Party, require such further evidence or make such further
investigation, provided, however, that, if the payment within a reasonable time
to the Trustee of the cost, expenses and liabilities likely to be incurred by
it in making such investigation is not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the
security afforded to it by the terms of this Indenture, the Trustee may require
reasonable indemnity against such expense or liability as a condition to so
proceeding.

If the Trustee shall determine or shall be requested, as
aforesaid, to make such further investigation, it shall be entitled to examine
the books, records and premises of the Company; and unless satisfied, with or
without such investigation, of the truth and accuracy of the matters stated in
such resolutions, certificates, statements, opinions, reports, orders or other
instruments, it shall be under no obligation to grant any application or take
or permit any action hereunder. The reasonable expense of every such
examination shall be paid by the Company, or, if paid by the Trustee, shall be
repaid by the Company, upon demand, with interest at the rate of six per cent
(6%) per annum, and until such repayment shall be secured by a lien on the
property subject to the lien of this Indenture and the proceeds thereof prior
to the lien of the Obligations but subject to Permitted Liens.

SECTION 3. Notice. The Trustee shall give to the Secured
Parties notice by first class mail of the happening of all defaults known to it
within ten days after the occurrence thereof, but in the case of any default of
the character specified in

- 38 -

<PAGE> 45
Subdivision (a) of Section 1 of Article IX, no such notice shall be given until
at least sixty days after the occurrence thereof. For the purposes of this
Section 3, the term "default" shall mean any Event of Default specified in
Section 1 of Article IX, not including in the case of the defaults specified in
paragraph (a) thereof any periods of grace provided for therein.

Nothing herein contained shall require the Trustee to ascertain
or inquire as to the observance or performance of any covenants, agreements or
obligations, on the part of the Company hereunder or as to the existence of any
Event of Default hereunder other than such an Event of Default known to it or
as to which it has received written notice from any Secured Party.

Nothing herein contained shall require the Trustee to give any
notice of any default which has been cured.

SECTION 4. Cessation. If the Trustee shall at any time cease to
be a bank or trust company in good standing organized and doing business under
the laws of the United States or of any State and having a combined capital and
surplus of not less than $25 million which is authorized under the laws of the
jurisdiction of incorporation to exercise corporate trust powers and is subject
to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority, then the Trustee
shall resign within thirty days thereafter, such resignation to become
effective upon the appointment of a successor Trustee and such successor's
acceptance of such appointment. If the Trustee publishes reports of condition
at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid
supervising or examining authority, the combined capital and surplus of the
Trustee shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in
its most recent report of condition so published.

SECTION 5. Resignation. The Trustee may resign and be
discharged from the trust hereby created by giving notice thereof to the
Company specifying the date when such resignation shall take effect, and by
giving notice thereof by first class mail to the Secured Parties. Such
resignation shall take effect on the date specified in such notice unless
previously a successor Trustee shall have been appointed as hereinafter
provided, in which event such resignation shall take effect upon the
appointment of such successor Trustee.

The Trustee may be removed at any time by an instrument or
instruments in writing delivered to the Trustee and to the Company, and a
successor Trustee may be appointed by an instrument or instruments in writing
delivered to such successor Trustee and to the Company, in either case signed
by the Designated Holders or by their duly authorized attorneys-in-fact; but,
until a new Trustee shall be appointed by the Designated Holders or a court of
competent jurisdiction as herein authorized, the Company, by an instrument
executed by order of its Board of Directors, shall appoint a Trustee to fill
the vacancy. Every such successor Trustee so appointed by the Designated
Holders, by a court of competent jurisdiction or by the Company shall be a bank
or trust company in good standing organized and doing business under the laws

- 39 -

<PAGE> 46
of the United States or of any State and having a combined capital and surplus
of not less than $25 million, which is authorized under the laws of the
jurisdiction of incorporation to exercise corporate trust powers and is subject
to supervision or examination by a Federal or State authority. If such
successor Trustee publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to
law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, the
combined capital and surplus of such successor Trustee shall be deemed to be
its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of
condition so published.

If in a proper case no appointment of a successor Trustee shall
be made pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Article within six months
after a vacancy shall have occurred in the office of trustee, a Secured Party
or the retiring Trustee may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction to
appoint a successor Trustee. Said court may thereupon, after such notice, if
any, as such court may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor Trustee.

SECTION 6. Successor Trustee. Any successor Trustee appointed
under any of the methods herein provided shall execute, acknowledge and deliver
to its predecessor Trustee and to the Company an instrument in writing
accepting such appointment hereunder and thereupon such successor Trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully vested with the
estates, properties, rights, powers and trusts of its predecessor in the trust
hereunder with like effect as if originally named as Trustee hereunder; but the
predecessor Trustee shall, nevertheless, at the written request of the
successor Trustee, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to the
successor Trustee all the estates, properties, rights, powers and trusts of the
predecessor Trustee hereunder and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver all
property and moneys held by it to its successor. Should any instrument in
writing from the Company be required by any successor Trustee for more fully
and effectually vesting in and confirming to it all estates, properties,
rights, powers and duties as Trustee hereunder, the Company, upon the request
of such successor Trustee, shall make, execute and deliver the same. The
Company shall promptly give notice of the appointment of such successor Trustee
to the Secured Parties by first class mail.

SECTION 7. Merger. Any corporation into which the Trustee or
any successor to it in the trust created by this Indenture may be merged, or
with which it or any successor to it may be consolidated, or any corporation
resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Trustee or any
successor to it shall be a party, shall be the successor Trustee under this
Indenture without the execution or filing of any instruments or any further act
on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding.

SECTION 8. Trustee as Secured Party. The Trustee may be a
Secured Party and otherwise deal with the Company in the same manner and to the
same extent and with like effect as though it were not Trustee hereunder.

- 40 -

<PAGE> 47
SECTION 9. Appointment of a Co-Trustee. It is the purpose
of this Indenture that there shall be no violation of any law of any
jurisdiction denying or restricting the right of banking corporations or
associations to transact business as trustees in such jurisdiction. It is
recognized that in case of litigation under this Indenture, and, in particular,
in case of the enforcement hereof upon an Event of Default, or in case the
Trustee deems that by reason of any present or future law of any jurisdiction
it may not exercise any of the powers, rights or remedies granted herein to the
Trustee or hold title to the properties, in trust, as herein granted, or take
any other action which may be desirable or necessary in connection therewith,
it may be necessary that the Trustee appoint, with the consent of the Company
(to the extent that no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing
hereunder), an additional individual or institution as a separate trustee or
co-trustee. The following provisions of this Section are adapted to these
ends.

In the event that the Trustee appoints an additional individual
or institution as a separate trustee or co-trustee, in the event of the
incapacity or lack of authority of the Trustee, by reason of any present or
future law of any jurisdiction, to exercise any of the rights, powers, trusts
and remedies herein granted to the Trustee or to hold title to the trust estate
or to take any other action which may be necessary or desirable in connection
therewith, each and every remedy, power, right, obligation, claim, demand,
cause of action, immunity, estate, title, interest and lien expressed or
intended by this Indenture to be imposed upon, exercised by or vested in or
conveyed to the Trustee with respect thereto shall be imposed upon, exercisable
by and vest in such separate trustee or co-trustee, but only to the extent
necessary to enable such separate trustee or co-trustee to exercise such
powers, rights, trusts and remedies, and every covenant and obligation
necessary to the exercise thereof by such separate trustee or co-trustee shall
run to and be enforceable by either of them. Such separate trustee or
co-trustee shall deliver an instrument in writing acknowledging and accepting
its appointment hereunder to the Trustee and the Company.

Should any instrument in writing from the Company reasonably be
required by the separate trustee or co-trustee so appointed by the Trustee for
more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to him or it such
properties, rights, powers, trusts, duties and obligations, any and all such
instruments in writing shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged and
delivered by the Company. If the Company shall fail to deliver the same within
thirty days of such request, the Trustee is hereby appointed attorney-in-fact
for the Company to execute, acknowledge and deliver such instruments in the
Company's name and stead. In case any separate trustee or co-trustee, or a
successor to either, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be
removed, all the estates, properties, rights, powers, trusts, duties and
obligations of such separate trustee or co-trustee, so far as permitted by law,
shall vest in and be exercised by the Trustee until the appointment of a new
trustee or successor to such separate trustee or co-trustee.

SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES

SECTION 1. Supplemental Indentures Without Consent of Secured
Parties. In addition to any supplemental indenture otherwise authorized by
this Indenture, the Company, when authorized by resolution of its Board and the
Trustee, from time to time and at any time, subject to the conditions and
restrictions in this Indenture contained, may without the consent of, or notice
to, any of the Secured Parties enter into an indenture or indentures
supplemental hereto and which thereafter shall form a part hereof for any one
or more or all of the following purposes:

(a) to close this Indenture against, or to restrict,
in addition to the limitations and restrictions herein contained,
the securing of additional Obligations hereunder by imposing
additional conditions and restrictions to be thereafter observed,
whether applicable in respect of all Obligations, or otherwise;

(b) to add to the covenants and agreements of the
Company in this Indenture contained, other covenants and
agreements thereafter to be observed and which do not conflict
with the then existing covenants and agreements of the Company
contained in this Indenture and to surrender any right or power
herein reserved to or conferred upon the Company although the
freedom of action of the Company may be materially restricted
thereby;

(c) to convey, transfer and assign to the Trustee,
and to subject to the lien of this Indenture, but in all cases
subject to Permitted Liens, including the First Mortgage Lien and

included in the granting clauses hereof, additional properties
hereafter acquired by the Company, whether through consolidation,
merger or by purchase or otherwise and to correct or amplify the
description of any properties at any time subject to the lien of
this Indenture;

questions arising under this Indenture as may be necessary or
desirable and not inconsistent with this Indenture;

Indenture or to relieve the Company from any of the obligations,
conditions or restrictions herein contained, provided that no
such modification shall be or become operative or effective which
shall in any manner impair any of the rights of the Secured
Parties or of the Trustee, while any Obligations which are then
secured hereunder prior to the execution of such supplemental
indenture shall remain outstanding; and provided, also, that the
Trustee may in its uncontrolled discretion decline to enter into
any such supplemental indenture which in its

- 42 -

<PAGE> 49
opinion may not afford adequate protection to the Trustee when
the same shall become operative;

(f) to achieve compliance of this Indenture with any
applicable federal securities law, including, but not limited to,
The Trust Indenture Act of 1939;

(g) to confirm that any additional Obligations to be

hereof are or will be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture;
and

(h) for any other purpose not inconsistent with the

ambiguity or curing, correcting or supplementing any defect or
inconsistent provision contained in this Indenture or any
supplemental indenture, or in order to more specifically identify
and describe those parcels of land in Exhibit A hereto which were
not owned by the Company on the date hereof and which were
therefore not intended to be part of the mortgaged property or
trust estate.

SECTION 2. Supplemental Indentures With Consent of Designated
Holders and Agents. With the consent of (i) the Designated Holders and (ii)
the Agent under each Credit Agreement, the Company and the Trustee may, from
time to time enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for the
purpose of adding any provision to or changing in any manner or eliminating any
of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of
modifying in any manner the rights of the Secured Parties hereunder; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that no such supplemental indenture shall amend the definition of
Designated Holders (or any of the related defined terms) or any other provision
hereof so as to reduce the required percentages of holders of the Obligations
the consent of which is required for the taking of any Act hereunder or amend
this Section 2 or Section 5 of Article VII or modify any other provision hereof
intended to provide for the ratable securing of all the Obligations, without in
each case the consent of all of the Secured Parties.

SECTION 3. Parties to Supplemental Indenture. The Trustee is
hereby authorized to join with the Company in the execution of any supplemental
indenture authorized or permitted by the terms of this Indenture, and to make
the further agreements and stipulations which may be therein contained.
Thereafter, that supplemental indenture shall form a part of this Indenture;
all terms and conditions contained in that supplemental indenture as to any
provision authorized to be contained therein shall be deemed to be a part of
the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes; this
Indenture shall be deemed to be modified and amended in accordance with that
supplemental indenture; and the respective rights, duties and obligations under
this Indenture of the Company, the Trustee and the Secured Parties then
outstanding shall be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder in a manner
which is subject in all respects to those modifications and amendments made by
that supplemental indenture. The Trustee shall not be required to enter into
any

- 43 -

<PAGE> 50
supplemental indenture which alters, amends, modifies or adversely affects the
rights, remedies or duties of the Trustee hereunder.

ARTICLE XV
CANCELLATION AND DISCHARGE OF LIEN OF THIS INDENTURE

SECTION 1. Cancellation and Discharge of Lien. If no Event of
Default hereunder, and no event that with the giving of notice or the passage
of time, or both, would constitute an Event of Default hereunder, shall have
happened and be continuing and the Trustee has received either (a) a
certificate from each Agent stating that all outstanding Bank Obligations have
been paid in full and each Agent shall have confirmed to the Trustee in writing
that the Bank(s) have no Commitments under the Credit Agreement to which such
Agent is a party or (b) an officer's certificate stating that the ratings
assigned by Moody's and S&P to the Company's senior secured debt (being its
First Mortgage Bonds) are "Baa3" or higher by Moody's and "BBB-" or higher by
S&P, together with instruments from Moody's and S&P evidencing such ratings
then, in either instance, these presents and the estate and rights hereby
granted shall cease, determine and be void, and thereupon the Trustee shall,
upon the request of the Company, cancel and discharge the lien of this
Indenture, and execute and deliver to the Company such deeds and other
instruments as shall be requisite to satisfy the lien hereof, and reconvey to
the Company the trust estate and title hereby conveyed, and assign and deliver
to the Company any property at the time subject to the lien of this Indenture
which may then be in its possession.

The cancellation and discharge of this Indenture, however, shall
be without prejudice to the right of the Trustee to be paid any compensation
then due it hereunder, and to be protected and saved harmless by the Company
from any and all losses, liabilities, costs and expenses, including counsel
fees, at any time incurred by the Trustee hereunder or connected with any
Obligation and from which, if this Indenture had not been canceled and
discharged, the Company would have been obligated by the terms of this
Indenture to protect and save the Trustee harmless, and the Company hereby
covenants to protect and save the Trustee harmless from any and all such
losses, liabilities, costs and expenses.

ARTICLE XVI
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

SECTION 1. No Benefit to Third Parties. Nothing in this
Indenture, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer
upon, or to give to, any person, firm or corporation, other than the parties
hereto, and the Secured Parties, any right, remedy or claim under or by reason
of this Indenture or any covenant, condition or stipulation hereof; and the
covenants, stipulations and agreements in this Indenture contained are and
shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties hereto, their
successors and assigns, and the Secured Parties.

SECTION 2. Invalidity. In case any one or more of the

unenforceable in any respect, the validity,

- 44 -

<PAGE> 51
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained herein and
therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby.

SECTION 3. Date. Although this Indenture, for convenience and
for the purpose of reference is dated June 1, 1994, the actual date of
execution by the Company and by the Trustee is as indicated by their respective
acknowledgments hereto annexed.

SECTION 4. Certification; Notice; Opinion. The same officer or
officers of the Company, or the same counsel or other person, as the case may
be, may, but need not, certify to all the matters required to be certified
under any Article, Section, Subdivision or other portion hereof, but different
officers, counsel or other persons may certify to different facts,
respectively. Where any person or persons are required to make, give or
execute two or more orders, requests, certificates, opinions or other
instruments under this Indenture, any such orders, requests, certificates,
opinions or other instruments may, but need not, be consolidated and form one
instrument.

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Indenture, or in
any indenture supplemental hereto, any request, opinion, consent, demand,
notice, order, appointment, or other direction required or permitted to be made
or given by the Company, shall be deemed to have been sufficiently made or
given if executed on behalf of the Company by its President or any of its Vice
Presidents and its Secretary or any of its Assistant Secretaries or its
Treasurer or any of its Assistant Treasurers.

Any opinion of counsel required to be furnished pursuant to any
of the provisions of this Indenture may, in lieu of stating the facts required
by the provisions hereof, state that the required conditions will be fulfilled
on the execution and delivery of designated instruments, which instruments
shall be delivered in form approved by such counsel prior to or concurrently
with the taking or suffering by the Trustee of the action as a condition
precedent to which such opinion is required to be furnished under the terms of
this Indenture.

Upon any application by the Company to the Trustee to take any
action under any of the provisions of this Indenture, the Company shall furnish
to the Trustee an officers' certificate and opinion of counsel, each stating
that all conditions precedent provided for in this Indenture (including any
covenants compliance with which constitutes a condition precedent) with respect
to such application have been complied with, whether or not the furnishing of
such documents shall be actually required by the provisions of this Indenture
relating to such particular application.

Each certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a
condition or covenant provided for in this Indenture shall include (1) a
statement that the person making such certificate or opinion has read such
covenant or condition; (2) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the
examination or investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in
such certificate or opinion are based; (3) a statement that, in the opinion of
such person, he has made such examination or investigation as is necessary to
enable him to express an informed opinion as to

- 45 -

<PAGE> 52
whether or not such covenant or condition has been complied with; and (4) a
statement as to whether or not, in the opinion of such person, such condition
or covenant has been complied with.

Any notice to or demand upon the Trustee may be served or
presented, and such demand may be made, at the principal office of the Trustee.
Any notice to or demand upon the Company shall be deemed to have been
sufficiently given or served by the Trustee, for all purposes, by being
deposited, postage prepaid, in a post-office letter box addressed to the
Company, c/o Centerior Energy Corporation, P.O. Box 94661, Cleveland, Ohio
44101-4661, or to the Company at such other address as may be filed in writing
by the Company with the Trustee.

SECTION 5. Successors. Subject to the provisions of Articles
XII and XIII, whenever in this Indenture any of the parties hereto is named or
referred to, the successors and assigns of such party shall be deemed to be
included, and all the covenants, promises and agreements in this Indenture
contained by or on behalf of the Company, or by or on behalf of the Trustee,
shall bind and inure to the benefit of the respective successors and assigns,
whether so expressed or not.

SECTION 6. Counterparts. This Indenture may be simultaneously
executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and
delivered shall be an original; but such counterparts shall together constitute
but one and the same instrument.

SECTION 7. Exclusion of Certain Further Permitted Obligations
Under Certain Circumstances. If, subsequent to the date of this Indenture
either: (a) any letter of credit issued pursuant to the reimbursement agreement
described on Exhibit B-2 to this Indenture is surrendered to the issuer thereof
without having been drawn upon, or (b) an order for relief is entered following
the filing of a bankruptcy petition by or against the Company, which order for
relief is entered within one (1) year following the issuance of such letter of
credit, then, immediately upon that surrender of such letter of credit or the
entering of the order for relief, as applicable, the reimbursement obligation
with respect to such letter of credit shall, automatically and without any
further action of any person, cease to be a Further Permitted Obligation and
cease to be an Obligation for purposes of this Indenture. It is anticipated
that the beneficiary of the surrendered letter of credit will deliver written
notice of such surrender to the Trustee; however, the failure of the
beneficiary to provide such notice shall not negate or limit the effect of the
first sentence of this Section 7.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, said The Toledo Edison Company has caused
this Indenture to be executed on its behalf by one of its Vice Presidents and
its corporate seal to be hereto affixed and said seal and this Indenture to be
attested by its Assistant Secretaries; and said Bank One, Columbus, N.A., in
