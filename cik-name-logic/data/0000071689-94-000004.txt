New York, New York
February 15, 1994

To the Representatives

hereto of the Underwriters
named in Schedule II hereto

Dear Sirs:

New York Telephone Company, a New York corporation ("Company"), may issue 
and sell from time to time series of its debt securities registered under the 
registration statements referred to in Paragraph 1(a) hereof ("Securities" 
and individually "Security"). The Company proposes to sell to the 
underwriters named in Schedule II hereto ("Underwriters") for whom you are 
acting as representatives ("Representative"), a series of Securities, of the 
designation, with the terms and in the aggregate principal amount specified 
in Schedule I hereto ("Underwritten Securities" and individually 
"Underwritten Security"). If the firm or firms listed in Schedule II hereto 
include only the firm or firms listed in Schedule I hereto, then the terms 
"Underwriters" and "Representative" shall each be deemed to refer to such 
firm or firms.

1. The Company represents, warrants and agrees that:

(a) Registration statements on Form S-3 with respect to the Securities 
have been prepared by the Company in conformity with the requirements of 
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Act"), and the rules and 
regulations ("Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange 
Commission ("Commission") thereunder and has become effective. As used in 
this Agreement, (i) "Registration Statement" means that such registration 
statement, as amended and supplemented to the date hereof; 
(ii) "Preliminary Prospectus" means each prospectus (including all 
documents incorporated therein by reference) included in the Registration 
Statement, or amendments or supplements thereof, before it became effective 
under the Act, including any prospectus filed with the Commission pursuant 
to Rule 424(a) of the Rules and Regulations; (iii) "Basic Prospectus" means 
the prospectus (including all documents incorporated therein by reference) 
included in the Registration Statement; and (iv) "Prospectus" means the 
Basic Prospectus, together with any prospectus amendment or supplement 
(including in each case all documents incorporated therein by reference) 
specifically relating to the Underwritten Securities, as filed with the 
Commission pursuant to paragraph (b) of Rule 424 of the Rules and 
Regulations. The Commission has not issued any order preventing or 
suspending the use of any Prospectus.

<PAGE>

(b) The Registration Statement and each Prospectus contain, and (in 
the case of any amendment or supplement to any such document, or any 
material incorporated by reference in any such document, filed with the 
Commission after the date as of which this representation is being made) 
will contain at all times during the period specified in Paragraph 7(c) 
hereof, all statements which are required by the Act, the Securities 
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act"), the Trust Indenture Act 
of 1939, as amended ("Trust Indenture Act"), and the rules and regulations 
of the Commission under such Acts; the indenture, including any amendments 
and supplements thereto, pursuant to which the Underwritten Securities will 
be issued ("Indenture") will conform with the requirements of the Trust 
Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; 
and the Registration Statement and each Prospectus does not, and (in the 
case of any amendment or supplement to any such document, or any material 
incorporated by reference in any such document, filed with the Commission 
after the date as of which this representation is being made) will not, at 
any time during the period specified in Paragraph 7(c) hereof, contain any 
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact 
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein 
not misleading; provided that the Company makes no representation or 
warranty as to information contained in or omitted from the Registration 
Statement or any Prospectus in reliance and based upon information 
furnished to the Company through the Representative by or on behalf of any 
Underwriter, or as to any statements in or omissions from the Statement of 
Eligibility of the Trustee under the Indenture.

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries (as defined in 
Paragraph 14 hereof) is in violation of its corporate charter or by-laws or 
in default under any agreement, indenture or instrument, the effect of 
which violation or default would be material to the Company or the Company 
and its subsidiaries taken as a whole; the execution, delivery and 
performance of this Agreement and any Delayed Delivery Contracts (as 
defined in Paragraph 3 hereof) and compliance by the Company with the 
provisions of the Underwritten Securities and the Indenture will not 
conflict with, result in the creation or imposition of any lien, charge or 
encumbrance upon any of the assets of the Company or any of its 
subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of, or constitute a default under, any 
agreement, indenture or instrument, or result in a violation of the 
corporate charter or by-laws of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or 
any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency having 
jurisdiction over the Company, any of its subsidiaries or their respective 
properties; and except as required by the Act, the Trust Indenture Act, the 
Exchange Act and applicable state securities laws and except as set forth 
in Paragraph 1(l) hereof, no consent, authorization or order of, or filing

Contracts, if any, and the Indenture.

Statement and each Prospectus, there has not been any material adverse 
change in, or any adverse development which materially affects, the 
business, properties, financial condition, results of operations or

whole from the dates as of which information is given in the Registration 
Statement and each Prospectus.

Rules and Regulations.

Indenture will have been validly authorized, executed and delivered by the 
Company and will constitute the legally binding obligation of the Company, 
(ii) the Underwritten Securities will have been validly authorized and, 
upon payment therefor as provided in this Agreement, will be validly issued 
and outstanding, and will constitute legally binding obligations of the 
Company entitled to the benefits of the Indenture and (iii) the 
Underwritten Securities and the Indenture will conform to the descriptions 
thereof contained in the Prospectus.

(g) The Company and each of its consolidated subsidiaries have been 
duly incorporated, are validly existing and in good standing under the laws 
of their respective jurisdictions of incorporation, are duly qualified to 
do business and in good standing as foreign corporations in each 
jurisdiction in which their respective ownership of properties or the 
conduct of their respective businesses requires such qualification, and 
have power and authority necessary to own or hold their respective 
properties and to conduct the businesses in which they are engaged.

(h) Except as described in each Prospectus, there is no material 
litigation or governmental proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the 
Company, threatened against the Company or any of its consolidated 
subsidiaries which might result in any material adverse change in the 
financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects of the 
Company or of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a 
whole or which is required to be disclosed in the Registration Statement.

Statement or included in any Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus present,

material incorporated by reference in any such document, filed with the 
Commission after the date as of which this representation is being made)

hereof, fairly, the financial condition and results of operations of the 
entities purported to be shown thereby, at the dates and for the periods 
indicated, and have been, and (in the case of any amendment or supplement

document, filed with the Commission after the date as of which this 
representation is being made) will be at all times during the period

<PAGE>

(j) The documents incorporated by reference into any Preliminary 
Prospectus or Prospectus have been, and (in the case of any amendment or 
supplement to any such document, or any material incorporated by reference 
in any such document, filed with the Commission after the date as of which 
this representation is being made) will be at all times during the period 
specified in Paragraph 7(c) hereof, prepared by the Company in conformity 
with the applicable requirements of the Act and the Rules and Regulations 
and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission 
thereunder and such documents have been, or (in the case of any amendment 
or supplement to any such document, or any material incorporated by 
reference in any such document, filed with the Commission after the date as 
of which this representation is being made) will be at all times during the 
period specified in Paragraph 7(c) hereof, timely filed as required thereby.

(k) There are no contracts or other documents which are required to be 
filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement by the Act or by the Rules 
and Regulations, or which were required to be filed as exhibits to any 
document incorporated by reference in any Prospectus by the Exchange Act or 
the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder, which have not been 
filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement or to such document or 
incorporated therein by reference as permitted by the Rules and Regulations 
or the rules and regulations of the Commission under the Exchange Act as 
required.

(l) The Company has filed a petition or petitions with the Public 
Service Commission of the State of New York ("PSC") with respect to the 
issue and sale of the Underwritten Securities. The PSC has authorized the 
issue and sale thereof but upon the express condition that the Company 
shall have fulfilled certain obligations, such authority being subject to 
abrogation by order issued by one or more Commissioners of the PSC within 
the period of time after the fulfillment of such obligations as may have 
been specified by the PSC in its order granting such authorization, unless 
prior to the expiration of such period the Company shall be advised by the 
Director of the Office of Accounting and Finance of the PSC or his designee 
that the applicable conditions have been met and that such authority is not 
to be abrogated.

(m) The Company and each of its consolidated subsidiaries have good 
and valid title to all or substantially all of their respective properties, 
except as otherwise indicated in the Prospectus, subject only to the lien 
of the Refunding Mortgage as set forth in the Prospectus.

2. Subject to the terms and conditions and in reliance upon the 
representations and warranties herein set forth, the Company agrees to sell 
to each Underwriter, severally and not jointly, and each Underwriter agrees, 
severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at the purchase 
price and on the other terms set forth in Schedule I hereto, the principal 
amount of the Underwritten Securities set forth opposite its name in Schedule 
II hereto.

<PAGE>

3. Any offer to purchase Underwritten Securities by institutional 
investors solicited by the Underwriters for delayed delivery shall be made 
pursuant to contracts substantially in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto, 
with such changes therein as the Company and the Representative may approve 
("Delayed Delivery Contracts"). The Company shall have the right, in its 
sole discretion, to approve or disapprove each such institutional investor. 
Underwritten Securities which are subject to Delayed Delivery Contracts are 
herein sometimes called "Delayed Delivery Underwritten Securities" and 
Underwritten Securities which are not subject to Delayed Delivery Contracts 
are herein sometimes called "Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities".

Contemporaneously with the purchase on the Delivery Date by the 
Underwriters of the Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities pursuant to 
this Agreement, the Company will pay to the Representative, for the account 
of the Underwriters, the compensation specified in Schedule I hereto for 
arranging the sale of Delayed Delivery Underwritten Securities. The 
Underwriters shall have no responsibility with respect to the validity or 
performance of any Delayed Delivery Contracts.

For the purpose of determining the principal amount of Immediate Delivery 
Underwritten Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter, there shall be 
deducted from the principal amount of Underwritten Securities to be purchased 
by such Underwriter as set forth in Schedule II hereto that portion of the 
aggregate principal amount of Delayed Delivery Underwritten Securities that 
the principal amount of Underwritten Securities to be purchased by such 
Underwriter as set forth in Schedule II hereto bears to the aggregate 
principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth there to be purchased 
by all of the Underwriters (in each case as adjusted by the Representative to 
avoid fractions of the minimum principal amount in which the Underwritten 
Securities may be issued), except to the extent that the Representative 
determines, in its discretion, that such deduction shall be otherwise than in 
such proportion and so advises the Company.

4. The Company shall not be obligated to deliver any Underwritten 
Securities except upon payment for all Immediate Delivery Underwritten 
Securities to be purchased pursuant to this Agreement as hereinafter provided.

5. If any Underwriter defaults in the performance of its obligations 
under this Agreement, the remaining non-defaulting Underwriters shall be 
obligated to purchase the Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities which 
the defaulting Underwriter agreed but failed to purchase in the respective 
proportions which the principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth 
in Schedule II hereto to be purchased by each remaining non-defaulting 
Underwriter set forth therein bears to the aggregate principal amount of 
Underwritten Securities set forth therein to be purchased by all the 
remaining non-defaulting Underwriters; provided that the remaining 
non-defaulting Underwriters shall not be obligated to purchase any Immediate 
Delivery Underwritten Securities if the aggregate principal amount of 
Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities which the defaulting Underwriter 

5

<PAGE>

or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase exceeds 9.09% of the total 
principal amount of Underwritten Securities, and any remaining non-defaulting 
Underwriter shall not be obligated to purchase more than 110% of the 
principal amount of Underwritten Securities set forth in Schedule II hereto 
to be purchased by it. If the foregoing maximums are exceeded, the remaining 
non-defaulting Underwriters, or those other underwriters satisfactory to the 
Representative who so agree, shall have the right, but shall not be 
obligated, to purchase, in such proportion as may be agreed upon among them, 
all the Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities. If the remaining 
Underwriters or other underwriters satisfactory to the Representative do not 
elect to purchase the Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities which the 
defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters agreed but failed to purchase, this 
Agreement shall terminate without liability on the part of any non-defaulting 
Underwriter or the Company, except that the Company will continue to be 
liable for the payment of expenses as set forth in Paragraph 7(k) hereof.

Nothing contained in this Paragraph 5 shall relieve a defaulting 
Underwriter of any liability it may have to the Company for damages caused by 
its default. If other underwriters are obligated or agree to purchase the 
Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities of a defaulting or withdrawing 
Underwriter, either the Representative or the Company may postpone the 
Delivery Date for up to seven full business days in order to effect any 
changes that in the opinion of counsel for the Company or counsel for the 
Underwriters may be necessary in the Registration Statement, any Prospectus 
or in any other document or arrangement.

6. Delivery of and payment for the Immediate Delivery Underwritten 
Securities shall be made at such address, date and time as may be specified 
in Schedule I hereto. This date and time are sometimes referred to as the 
"Delivery Date". On the Delivery Date the Company shall deliver the 
Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities to the Representative for the 
account of each Underwriter against payment to or upon the order of the 
Company of the purchase price by certified or official bank check or checks 
payable in next-day funds settled through the New York Clearing House. Time 
shall be of the essence, and delivery at the time and place specified 
pursuant to this Agreement is a further condition of the obligation of each 
Underwriter hereunder. Upon delivery, the Immediate Delivery Underwritten 
Securities shall be in such form or forms (which forms may include bearer or 
fully registered form) and in such denominations as may be set forth on 
Schedule I. Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities in registered form 
Underwriter hereunder. Upon delivery, the Immediate Delivery Underwritten 
Securities shall be in such form or forms (which forms may include bearer or 
fully registered form) and in such denominations as may be set forth on 
Schedule I. Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities in registered form 
shall be in such authorized denominations and registered in such names as the 
Representative shall request in writing not less than two full business days 
prior to the Delivery Date. For the purpose of expediting the checking 

6

<PAGE>

and packaging of the Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities, the Company 
shall make the Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities available for 
inspection by the Representative in New York, New York or, in the case of 
Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities in bearer form, at another 
location acceptable to the Representative, in either case not later than 2:00 
P.M., local time, on the business day prior to the Delivery Date.

7. The Company agrees:

Underwriters a conformed copy of the Registration Statement as originally 
filed and each amendment or supplement thereto filed prior to the date

(c) To file with the Commission, during such period following the date

unreasonably exercised, by the Representative;

(e) To advise the Representative promptly (i) when any post-effective

Registration Statement (insofar as the amendment or supplement relates to 
or covers the Underwritten Securities), to any Prospectus, to any document 
incorporated by reference in any of the foregoing or for any additional 
information, (iii) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order 
suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or any order 
directed to any Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by

notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the 
Underwritten Securities for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or

Registration Statement (insofar as the Registration Statement relates to or 
covers the Underwritten Securities) or any Prospectus or which requires the 
making of a change in the Registration Statement or any Prospectus in order 
to make any material statement therein not misleading;

(f) If, during the period referred to in (c) above, the Commission 
shall issue a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration 
Statement, to make every reasonable effort to obtain the lifting of that 
order at the earliest possible time;

(g) As soon as practicable, to make generally available to its 
security holders and to deliver to the Representative an earnings

(i) To endeavor to qualify the Underwritten Securities for offer and

may reasonably request;

(j) To use its best efforts to obtain the listing of the Underwritten

listing to be continued so long as any amount of the Securities remains 
outstanding; to furnish from time to time any and all documents, 
instruments, information and undertakings that may be necessary in order to 
effect such listing; and to maintain the same until none of the 
Underwritten Securities is outstanding or until such time as payment of 
principal of and premium, if any, and interest on all the Underwritten 
Securities has been duly provided for, whichever is earlier; provided that 
if the Company can no longer reasonably maintain such listing, the Company 
shall use its best efforts to obtain and maintain the quotation for, or 
listing of, the Underwritten Securities on such other securities exchange 
or exchanges as the Company may, with the approval of the Representative, 
determine;

the time required by the Act, and the untrue statement or alleged untrue 
statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a 
material fact in such Preliminary Prospectus was corrected in such 
Prospectus, unless such failure resulted from non-compliance by the Company 
with Paragraph 7(b) hereof. For purposes of the second proviso to the 
immediately preceding sentence, the term Prospectus shall not be deemed to 
include the documents incorporated therein by reference, and no Underwriter 
shall be obligated to send or give any supplement or amendment to any 
document incorporated by reference in any Preliminary Prospectus or any 
Prospectus to any person other than a person to whom such Underwriter has 
delivered such incorporated documents in response to a written request 
thereof. The foregoing indemnity agreement is in addition to any liability 
which the Company may otherwise have to any Underwriter or controlling person.

(b) Each Underwriter shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, 
each of its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration 
Statement and any person who controls the Company within the meaning of the 
Act from and against any loss, claim, damage or liability, joint or several, 
and any action in respect thereof, to which the Company or any such director, 
officer or controlling person may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, 
insofar as such loss, claim, damage, liability or action, arises out of, or 
is based upon, any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material 
fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, the Registration Statement or 
any Prospectus, or arises out of, or is based upon, the omission or alleged 
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or 
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but in each case 
only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or 
omission or alleged omission was made in reliance and based upon written 
information furnished to the Company through the Representative by or on 
behalf of that Underwriter, and shall reimburse the Company for any legal and 
other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company or any such director, 
officer or controlling person in investigating or defending or preparing to 
defend against any such loss, claim, damage, liability or action as such 
expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity 

10

<PAGE>

agreement is in addition to any liability which any Underwriter may otherwise 
have to the Company or any of its directors, officers or controlling persons.

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this 
Paragraph 8 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the 
indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against 
the indemnifying party under this Paragraph, notify the indemnifying party in 
writing of the claim or the commencement of that action, provided that the 
failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any 
liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this 
Paragraph 8. If any such claim or action shall be brought against an 
indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the 
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein, and, to the 
extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying 
party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the 
indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the 
indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or 
action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party 
under this Paragraph for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by 
the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than 
reasonable costs of investigation; provided that the Representative shall 
have the right to employ one counsel to represent the Representative, those 
other Underwriters and their respective controlling persons who may be 
subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity 
may be sought by the Underwriters against the Company under this Paragraph 8 
if, in the reasonable judgment of the Representative, it is advisable for the 
Representative, those Underwriters and controlling persons to be represented 
by separate counsel, and in that event the fees and expenses of such separate 
counsel shall be paid by the Company. The indemnifying party shall not be 
liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written 
consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for 
the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified 
party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or 
judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an 
indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the 
indemnified party for fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this 
Section 8, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any 
settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent if (i) such 
settlement is entered into more than 60 days after receipt by such 
indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party 
shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such 
request prior to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, 
without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any 
settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any 
indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been 
sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes 
an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on 
claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

11

<PAGE>

(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Paragraph 8 shall for 
any reason be unavailable to an indemnified party under Paragraph 8(a) or 
8(b) hereof in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action 
in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall, 
in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid 
or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such loss, claim, damage 
or liability, or action in respect thereof, in such proportion as shall be 
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the 
one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the 
Underwritten Securities and the relative fault of the Company on the one hand 
and the Underwriters on the other with respect to the statements or omissions 
which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect 
thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The 
relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the 
Underwriters on the other with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be 
in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the 
Underwritten Securities (before deducting expenses) received by the Company 
bear to the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the 
Underwriters with respect to such offering. The relative fault shall be 
determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of 
a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact 
relates to information supplied by the Company or the Underwriters, the 
intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and 
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount 
paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, 
damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this 
Paragraph 8(d) shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Paragraph 
8(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified 
party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or 
claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Paragraph 8(d) no Underwriter 
shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which 
the total price at which the Underwritten Securities underwritten by it and 
distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of 
any damages which such Underwriter has otherwise paid or become liable to pay 
by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged 
omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the 
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from 
any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The 
Underwriters' obligations to contribute as provided in this Paragraph 8(d) 
are several in proportion to their respective underwriting obligations and 
not joint.

(e) The indemnity agreements contained in this Paragraph and the 
representations, warranties and agreements of the Company in Paragraph 1 and 
Paragraph 7 hereof shall survive the delivery of the Underwritten Securities 
and shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or 
cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of 
any indemnified party.

12

<PAGE>

9. The obligations of the Underwriters under this Agreement may be 
terminated by the Representative, in its absolute discretion, by notice given 
to and received by the Company prior to the delivery of and payment for the 
Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities, if, during the period beginning 
on the date hereof to and including the Delivery Date, (a) trading in 
securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. is suspended, or 
minimum prices are established on that Exchange, or (b) a banking moratorium 
is declared by either Federal or New York State authorities, or (c) trading 
of any securities of the Company shall have been suspended on any exchange or 
in any over-the-counter market, or (d) there shall have occurred any outbreak 
or material escalation of hostilities or other calamity or crisis the effect 
of which on the financial markets of the United States is such as to make it, 
in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriters, impracticable to market such 
Underwritten Securities, or (e) any change, or any development involving a 
prospective change, in or affecting the business or properties of the Company 
and its consolidated subsidiaries taken as a whole shall have occurred the 
effect of which is, in the reasonable judgment of the Underwriters, so 
material and adverse as to make it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed 
with the delivery of the Underwritten Securities, or (f) any rating of any of 
the Company's unsecured senior debt securities shall have been lowered by any 
nationally recognized statistical rating organization (as defined in Rule 
15c3-1 under the Exchange Act).

10. The respective obligations of the Underwriters under the Agreement 
with respect to the Underwritten Securities are subject to the accuracy, on 
the date hereof and on the Delivery Date, of the representations and 
warranties of the Company contained herein, to performance by the Company of 
its obligations hereunder, and to each of the following additional terms and 
conditions applicable to the Underwritten Securities:

(a) At or before the Delivery Date, no stop order suspending the 
effectiveness of the Registration Statement nor any order directed to any 
document incorporated by reference in any Prospectus shall have been issued 
and prior to that time no stop order proceeding shall have been initiated 
or threatened by the Commission and no challenge shall have been made to 
the accuracy or adequacy of any document incorporated by reference in any 
Prospectus; any request of the Commission for inclusion of additional 
information in the Registration Statement or any Prospectus or otherwise 
shall have been complied with; and after the date hereof the Company shall 
not have filed with the Commission any amendment or supplement to the 
Registration Statement or any Prospectus (or any document incorporated by 
reference therein) that shall have been disapproved by the Representative.

(b) No Underwriter shall have discovered and disclosed to the Company 
on or prior to the Delivery Date that the Registration Statement or any 
Prospectus contains an untrue statement of a fact which, in the opinion of 
counsel for the Underwriters, is material or omits to state a fact which, 
in the opinion of such counsel, is material and is required to be stated 
therein or is necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

13

<PAGE>

(c) All corporate proceedings and other legal matters incident to the 
authorization, form and validity of this Agreement, the Underwritten 
Securities and the Indenture and the form of the Registration Statement, 
each Prospectus (other than financial statements and other financial data) 
and all other legal matters relating to this Agreement and the transactions 
contemplated hereby shall be satisfactory in all respects to Simpson 
Thacher & Bartlett, counsel for the Underwriters, and the Company shall 
have furnished to such counsel all documents and information that such 
counsel may reasonably request to enable it to pass upon such matters.

(d) The Vice President and General Counsel to the Company shall have 
furnished to the Representative his opinion addressed to the Underwriters 
and dated the Delivery Date, as Vice President and General Counsel to the 
Company, to the effect that:

(i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing 
and in good standing under the laws of the State of New York;

(ii) The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good 
standing as a foreign corporation in all jurisdictions in which its 
ownership of property or the conduct of its business requires such 
qualification (except where the failure to so qualify would not have a 
material adverse effect upon the Company), and has all power and 
authority necessary to own its properties and conduct the business in 
which it is engaged as described in the Prospectus;

(iii) The Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered 
by the Company and duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and, 
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the 
Trustee, constitutes a valid and legally binding instrument of the 
Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms;

(iv) The Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities have been duly 
authorized, executed and issued by the Company and, assuming due 
authentication thereof by the Trustee and upon payment and delivery in 
accordance with this Agreement, will constitute valid and legally 
binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in accordance with 
their terms and entitled to the benefits of the Indenture;

(v) The Delayed Delivery Underwritten Securities, if any, have 
been duly authorized and, when executed and issued by the Company, and 
assuming due authentication thereof by the Trustee and upon payment 
and delivery by the respective purchasers thereof in accordance with 
the terms of the related Delayed Delivery Contracts, will constitute 
valid and legally binding obligations of the Company, enforceable in 
accordance with their terms and entitled to the benefits of the 
Indenture;

(vi) The Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, have been duly 
authorized, executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due

<PAGE>

(vii) The statements made in each Prospectus under the caption 
"Description of Securities" (or a comparable caption), insofar as they 
purport to constitute summaries of the documents referred to therein, 
constitute accurate summaries of the terms of such documents in all 
material respects;

(viii) The Registration Statement is effective under the Act and, to 
the knowledge of such counsel, no stop order suspending its 
effectiveness has been issued, and no proceeding for that purpose is 
pending or threatened by the Commission;

(ix) No order issued by the Commission directed to any document 
incorporated by reference in any Prospectus has been issued and, to 
the knowledge of such counsel, no challenge has been made by the 
Commission to the accuracy or adequacy of any such document;

(x) Such counsel does not know of any litigation or any 
governmental proceeding pending or threatened against the Company 
which would affect the subject matter of this Agreement or is required 
to be disclosed in any Prospectus (including the documents 
incorporated by reference therein) which is not disclosed and 
correctly summarized therein;

(xi) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, the Company is not in 
violation of its corporate charter or by-laws, or in default under any 
material agreement, indenture or instrument;

(xii) This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and 
delivered by the Company;

(xiii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and 
the Delayed Delivery Contracts, if any, and compliance by the Company 
with the provisions of the Underwritten Securities and the Indenture 
will not conflict with, or result in the creation or imposition of any 
lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the assets of the Company 
pursuant to the terms of, or constitute a default under, any 
agreement, indenture or instrument known to such counsel, or result in 
a violation of the corporate charter or by-laws of the Company or any 
order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency having 
jurisdiction over the Company or its property; and

(xiv) All legally required proceedings in connection with the 
authorization, issue and validity of the Underwritten Securities and

other public boards or bodies have been obtained.

In giving such opinion, such counsel may rely on the opinion of 
Connecticut counsel satisfactory to counsel for the Underwriters as to 
matters of Connecticut law. In giving such opinion, such counsel need not

approval which may be legally required pursuant to any state securities law.

Such counsel may state that the opinions set forth in paragraphs 
(iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) above are subject to the effects of bankruptcy, 
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other 
similar laws relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, general 
equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) 
and an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

Such opinion shall also state that the Registration Statement and each 
Prospectus as of their respective effective and issue dates complied as to 
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Act and the Trust 
Indenture Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission under said Acts 
(except that no opinion need be expressed as to the financial statements and 
other financial data contained therein) and each document incorporated by 
reference in each Prospectus as filed under the Exchange Act complied when so 
filed as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of 
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder 
(except that no opinion need be expressed as to the financial statements and 
other financial data contained therein).

Such opinion shall also contain a statement that such counsel has no 
reason to believe that (i) the Registration Statement, as of its effective 
date (or, with respect to the Registration Statement, if the Company has 
filed an Annual Report on Form 10-K since its effective date, the date of the 
Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K), contained any untrue 
statement of a material fact or omitted to state any material fact required 
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not 
misleading, or (ii) the Prospectus contains any untrue statement of a 
material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary in order to make 
the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they 
were made, not misleading.

(e) the Company shall have furnished to the Representative on the 
Delivery Date a certificate, dated the Delivery Date, of its Chairman of the 
Board, its President or a Vice President and its Treasurer or an Assistant 
Treasurer stating that:

(i) The representations, warranties and agreements of the Company 
in Paragraph 1 hereof are true and correct as of the Delivery Date;

the conditions set forth in Paragraphs 10(a), 10(j) and 10(k) hereof 
have been fulfilled;

(ii) They have carefully examined the Registration Statement and 
each Prospectus and, in their opinion, (A) as of the date of each 
Prospectus, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus did not 
include any untrue statement of a material fact and did not omit to 
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to 
make the statements therein not misleading, and (B) since the date of 
each Prospectus, no event has occurred which should have been set 
forth in a supplement or amendment of the Prospectus which has not 
been set forth in such a supplement or amendment.

16
<PAGE>

(f) If Underwritten Securities in bearer form are being delivered by 
the Company on the Delivery Date, the Company shall have furnished to the 
Representative a letter of its United States tax counsel addressed to the 
Underwriters and dated the Delivery Date to the effect that (i) the 
Underwriters may rely on the opinion of such counsel filed as an exhibit to 
the Registration Statement to the same extent as though it were dated the 
date of such letter authorizing reliance, and (ii) such counsel has reviewed 
the other statements in the Prospectus under the caption "United States Tax 
Matters" and, insofar as they are, or refer to, statements of United States 
law or legal conclusions, such statements are accurate in all material 
respects.

(g) If Underwritten Securities in bearer form are being delivered by 
the Company on the Delivery Date in a jurisdiction other than the United 
States, the Company shall have furnished to the Representative such legal 
opinion or opinions as the Representative may reasonably request addressed to 
the Underwriters and dated the Delivery Date, with respect to matters 
relating to the offering, sale and delivery of the Underwritten Securities in 
such jurisdiction.

since the respective dates as of which specified financial information is 
given in the Prospectus, as of a date not more than five days prior to the 
date of such letter) the conclusions and findings of such firm with respect 
to the financial information and other matters covered by its letter referred 
to in subclause (i) above, confirming in all material respects the 
conclusions and findings set forth in such prior letter.

(i) Simpson Thacher & Bartlett shall have furnished the Representative 
its opinion addressed to the Underwriters and dated the Delivery Date, as 
counsel for the Underwriters, covering the matters set forth in Paragraph 
10(d), except clauses (ii), (viii), (ix), (x), (xi) and (xiii) thereof.

(j) The PSC shall have granted authorization, and on the Delivery Date 
such authorization shall be in full force and effect, permitting the issuance

hereunder set forth or contemplated and containing no provision unacceptable

of the Office of Accounting and Finance of the PSC or his designee that such

11. If the Company shall fail to tender the Immediate Delivery 
Underwritten Securities for delivery to the Underwriters for any reason under 
this Agreement, or if the Underwriters shall decline to purchase the 
Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities for any reason permitted under 
this Agreement (other than pursuant to Paragraph 5 hereof), the Company shall 
reimburse the Underwriters for the reasonable fees and expenses of their 
counsel and for such other out-of-pocket expenses as shall have been incurred 
by them in connection with this Agreement and the proposed purchase of 
Immediate Delivery Underwritten Securities, and the solicitation of any 
purchases of the Delayed Delivery Underwritten Securities, and upon demand

reimburse any defaulting Underwriter on account of those expenses.

[Date]

NEW YORK TELEPHONE COMPANY
1095 Avenue of the Americas
New York, New York 10036

Dear Sirs:

The undersigned hereby agrees to purchase from New York Telephone 
Company, a New York corporation ("Company"), and the Company hereby agrees to 
sell to the undersigned,
$
principal amount of the Company's above-captioned securities ("Securities"), 
offered by the Company's prospectus dated , 19 , as supplemented by 
the prospectus supplement dated , 19 (collectively, the 
"Prospectus"), receipt of a copy of which is hereby acknowledged, at a 
purchase price of % of the principal amount thereof plus accrued interest 
from , 19 to the Delivery Date (as defined in the next paragraph) 
and on the further terms and conditions set forth in this Contract.

Payment for and delivery of the Securities to be purchased by the 
undersigned shall be made on , 19 , herein called the "Delivery

<PAGE>

This Contract will terminate and be of no further force and effect 
after , 19 , unless (i) on or before such date it shall have been 
executed and delivered by both parties hereto or (ii) the Company shall have 
sold to the Underwriters named in the Prospectus the Immediate Delivery 
Underwritten Securities (as defined in the Underwriting Agreement referred to 
in the Prospectus) and the Company shall have mailed or delivered to the 
undersigned at its address set forth below a notice to that effect, stating 
the date of the occurrence thereof, accompanied by copies of the opinion of 
counsel for the Company delivered to such Underwriters pursuant to Paragraph

The obligation of the undersigned to accept delivery of and make payment 
for the Securities on the Delivery Date will be subject to the condition that 
the Securities shall not, on the Delivery Date, be an investment prohibited 
by the laws of the jurisdiction to which the undersigned is subject, the 
undersigned hereby representing that such an investment is not so prohibited 
on the date hereof.

This Contract will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the 
parties hereto and their respective successors but will not be assignable by 
either party hereto without the written consent of the other.

limitations of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the 
Trustee, the Company and the holders (the words "holders", "holder", 
"Securityholders" or "Securityholder" meaning the registered holders or 
registered holder) of the Securities.

The Securities may be issued in one or more series, which different series 
may be issued in various aggregate principal amounts, may mature at different 
times, may bear interest, if any, at different rates, may be subject to 
different redemption provisions, if any, may be subject to different sinking 
funds, if any, may be subject to additional covenants and Events of Default and

of Securities designated as the Year % Notes, due of the 
Company and such series is limited in aggregate principal amount to $ 
. References herein to Notes shall mean the Notes of said series.

In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have 
occurred and be continuing, the principal hereof may be declared, and upon such 
declaration shall become, due and payable, in the manner, with the effect and 
subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the Trustee, 
with the written consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of 
the outstanding Securities of each series affected by a supplemental indenture 
(with each series voting as a class), to enter into a supplemental indenture to 
add any provisions to or to change or eliminate any provisions of the Indenture 
or of any supplemental indenture or to modify, in each case in any manner not 
covered by provisions in the Indenture relating to amendments and waivers 
without the consent of holders, the rights of the Securityholders of each such 
series. The holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding 
Securities of each series affected by such waiver (with each series voting as a 
class), by notice to the Trustee, may waive compliance by the Company with any 
provision of the Indenture, any supplemental indenture or the Securities of any 
such series except a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on 
any Security. However, without the consent of each Securityholder affected, an 
amendment or waiver may not: (1) reduce the amount of Securities whose holders 
must consent to an amendment or waiver;

Security; (3) change the principal of or change the fixed maturity of any 
Security; (4) waive a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on 
any Security; (5) make any Security payable in money other than that stated in 
the Security; or (6) make any change in the provisions of the Indenture 
(i) with respect to the right of the holders of a majority in principal amount 
of any series of Securities by notice to the Trustee to waive an existing 
default with respect to that series and its consequences except a default in 
the payment of the principal of or interest on any Security; (ii) with respect 
to the right of any holder of a Security to receive payment of principal and 
interest on the Security, on or after the respective due dates expressed in the 
Security, the right of any holder of a coupon to receive payment of interest 
due as provided in such coupon, or to bring suit for the enforcement of any 
such payment on or after such respective dates; and (iii) contained in this 
sentence.

The Notes are issuable as registered Notes without coupons in denominations 
of $1,000 and any multiple of $1,000. The Notes are not subject to redemption 
prior to maturity.

Where Notes are presented to the registrar with a request to register their 
transfer or to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Notes of other 
authorized denominations, the registrar shall register the transfer or make the 
exchange if its requirements for such transactions are met. The Company will 
not make any charge for any registration of transfer or exchange but may 
require the payment by the party requesting such registration of transfer or 
exchange of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge 
payable in connection therewith.

Ownership of Notes shall be proved by the register for the Notes kept by 
the registrar. The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company may treat 
the person in whose name a Note is registered as the absolute owner thereof for 
all purposes.

No director, officer, employee or stockholder, as such, of the Company 
shall have any liability for any obligations of the Company under this Note or 
the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such 
obligations or their creation. Each holder by accepting this Note waives and 
releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the 
consideration for the issue of the Note.

The laws of the State of New York shall govern the Indenture and this Note.
