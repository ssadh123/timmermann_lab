ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

The following information relating to indemnification of directors and officers
and certain undertakings is provided for incorporation by reference into
Apache's active registration statements:

INDEMNIFICATION OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, inter alia, 
authorizes a corporation to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is
threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action,
suit or proceeding (other than an action by or in the right of the corporation)
because such person is or was a director, officer, employee or agent of the
corporation or was serving at the request of the corporation as a director,
officer, employee or agent of another corporation or other enterprise, against
expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in
settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him in connection with such suit
or proceeding if he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed
to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation, and, with
respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reason to believe his
conduct was unlawful. Similar indemnity is authorized for such persons against
expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably incurred in
defense or settlement of any such pending, completed or threatened action or
suit by or in the right of the corporation if such person acted in good faith
and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the corporation, and provided further that (unless a court of
competent jurisdiction otherwise provides) such person shall not have been
adjudged liable to the corporation. Any such indemnification may be made only
as authorized in each specific case upon a determination by the stockholders or
disinterested directors that indemnification is proper because the indemnitee
has met the applicable standard of conduct.

Section 145 further authorizes a corporation to purchase and maintain
insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer, employee
or agent of the corporation, or is or was serving at the request of the
corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation or
enterprise, against any liability asserted against him and incurred by him in
any such capacity, or arising out of his status as such, whether or not the
corporation would otherwise have the power to indemnify him. Apache
Corporation (the "Company") maintains policies insuring its and its
subsidiaries' officers and directors against certain liabilities for actions
taken in such capacities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of
1933.

Article VII of the Company's bylaws provides, in substance, that
directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company shall be indemnified
to the extent permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law.
Additionally, Article Seventeen of the Company's Restated Certificate of
Incorporation eliminates in certain circumstances the monetary liability of
directors of the Company for a breach of their fiduciary duty as directors.
These provisions do not eliminate the liability of a director (i) for a breach
of the director's duty of loyalty to the corporation or its stockholders; (ii)
for acts or omissions by the director not in good faith; (iii) for acts or
omissions by a director involving intentional misconduct or a knowing violation
of the law; (iv) under Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
(relating to the declaration of dividends and purchase or redemption of shares
in violation of the Delaware General Corporation Law); and (v) for transactions
from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

UNDERTAKINGS

The undersigned hereby undertakes as follows:

(1) That, for purposes of determining any liability under the
Securities Act of 1933, each post-effective amendment to the Company's
Registration Statement on Form S-8 (Registration No. 33-31407)(the
"Registration Statement") shall be deemed to be a new registration statement
relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities
at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.

(2) To remove from registration by means of a post-effective amendment
any of the securities registered pursuant of the Registration Statement which
remain unsold at the termination of the offering.

(3) Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the
Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling
persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise,
the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and
Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed
in the Securities Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a
claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by
the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or
controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action,
suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person
in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless
in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling
precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether
such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the
Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.

SIGNATURES

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of
1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by
the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.

APACHE CORPORATION
