COMPASS GROUP PLC ANNOUNCES ACQUISITION OF CANTEEN CORPORATION

SPARTANBURG, S.C., Apr. 27 -- Compass Group PLC today
announced that it was further strengthening its catering business
with the acquisition of the Canteen food and vending operations
from Flagstar Companies, Inc., for a total consideration of $450
million.

Francis Mackay, chief executive Compass Group, in announcing
the acquisition, said, "Our aim is to encourage and support the 
best food service businesses in the world, which is why we are
delighted to announce this agreement between Compass Group and
Flagstar. We believe that this is the right move for Canteen, its
employees and its clients."
Canteen, part of Flagstar, provides food service and vending
for a wide range of clients -- from major business and industry
locations to hospitals, retirement centers and correctional
institutions. Canteen employs over 20,000 people to serve over
12,000 accounts, a $1 billion business. 
"We have made a strategic decision to concentrate on our core
restaurant businesses," said Jerome J. Richardson, chairman and
chief executive officer of Flagstar. "The sale of our Canteen food
and vending business will enable us to begin to reduce debt and
focus our growth capital on our Denny's, Hardee's, Quincy's and El
Pollo Loco brands."
Not included in the sale are Canteen's Volume Services and TW
Recreational Services businesses.
Francis Mackay added, "As part of our agreement with Flagstar,
we are also pleased to confirm that we will be strengthening our 
portfolio of high quality food service brands. Not only will we be
able to offer our exclusive 'owned' brands such as Dixie's Donuts
to the American markets, but we will be exclusively able to
develop, for a franchise fee, the Denny's and Quincy's brands in 
our European food service market sectors."
"Flagstar has built excellent restaurant brands which are an
'ideal fit' with our existing portfolio. This will enable us to
widen our offer to current clients and open up new opportunities in
our existing catering markets," he said.
Flagstar noted that the intent to find the right buyer for its
food service and vending businesses had been an important issue. 
"With a strong track record in the food service business, Compass
Group is in an excellent position to build Canteen's business in
the United States," Richardson said. "We are also looking forward
to a continuing relationship with Compass Group for the franchising
of our restaurant brands in their food service locations in the
United States and Europe."
In making the announcement, both companies were keen to
emphasize the value they placed on being able to confirm that it
was "business as usual."
"All of the Canteen senior management are joining us. In
particular, I am pleased to welcome Joe Aprile, president, food
service and vending, Canteen Corporation, and his immediate team. 
Joe will be reporting to Mike Bailey, who is appointed chief
executive, United States catering operations for the Group," said
Francis Mackay.
Compass Group and Flagstar anticipate that the transaction
will be completed by mid-June 1994.
