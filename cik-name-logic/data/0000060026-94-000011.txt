Item 5. Other Events.
------------

By letter dated August 18, 1994, the Acting Assistant Secretary, Department
of State, Bureau of Political-Military Affairs ("State Department") advised
Lockheed Corporation that it would be the State Department's policy
prospectively to deny defense related export privileges to Lockheed
Aeronautical Systems Company (LASC), a division of Lockheed Corporation. The
State Department, referring to Sections 38, 39, and 42 of the Arms Export
Control Act (22 U.S.C. Sections 2778, 2779, and 2791), announced that its
action arose from the June 22, 1994, indictment of the Corporation alleging
that it had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by making prohibited
payments to a member of the Egyptian Parliament. The State Department
announced that its action is confined to LASC and does not affect any other
Division or subsidiaries of Lockheed. Moreover, the State Department
announced that the action does not apply to any approvals granted to
LASC programs before June 22, 1994, but, rather, to future export license
applications. LASC may seek exceptions to the announced policy on a
case-by-case basis at the discretion of the State Department, Office of
Defense Controls, which must consider United States foreign policy and
national security interests, as well as law enforcement concerns.

The Company is disappointed that action has been taken against LASC in
spite of the presumption of innocence, on the basis of an indictment
containing unproven allegations. As was stated at the time of the indictment,
Lockheed emphatically denies the allegations in the indictment and intends
to vigorously defend itself against the charges. In the meantime, Lockheed
intends to continue cooperating fully with the State Department and to seek
exceptions for LASC programs which are vital to national security and
foreign policy interests.
