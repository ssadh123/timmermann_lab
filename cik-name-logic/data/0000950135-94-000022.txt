________________________________________________________________

ANNEX A

The following is a summary of the modifications to the leases and mortgages
between Meditrust and Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. and to the ongoing
relationship of the two companies.

MODIFICATIONS TO ALL LEASES AND MORTGAGES

o All of the Meditrust/Sun mortgages and lease will be guaranteed
by Sun Healthcare Group, Inc., and The Mediplex Group Inc., and
shall be cross defaulted and/or cross collaterized.

o All existing Meditrust/Mediplex mortgages and leases and all new
Meditrust/Sun transactions will have an automatic annual 2.5%
increase to the rent or interest payments. The annual payment
will be calculated as follows:

o Total individual facility rent or mortgage payments to
Meditrust (after any rate adjustments as provided
below) calculated on an annualized basis as of the
closing date .... times 1.025 equal rent or interest
for the following twelve months. A similar calculation
would be made annually.

o All existing Meditrust/Mediplex leases and mortgages will have
their terms extended to between 11 and 13 years (or less to meet
operating lease criteria) from the merger closing date. The
properties will be grouped under master leases and mortgages
totaling approximately $56 million each. Each group will expire
at six moth intervals during years 11 through 13. Attached is a
proposed schedule detailing the terms of all leases and
mortgages.

o Additional modifications and clarifications to the existing
Meditrust/Mediplex leases and mortgages such as reporting
requirements, access to records, and advance monthly payments
will be documented at the time of closing.

NEW YORK PROPERTIES

o Sun will provide Meditrust with $20 million to be applied
against Conifer Park. In addition, Meditrust will reduce its
initial investment basis by an additional $9 million in Conifer
Park. The existing lease will be terminated and
<PAGE> 10
replaced by a mortgage on the facility for $31 million. The
mortgage will be for a term of eleven years with a 25 year 
amortization, and a base rate of 10.5%. Sun will have the
typical rights of substitution of property throughout the term
of the mortgage.

o Meditrust's investment in Arms Acres will be reduced by $11
million. The lease will be terminated and a mortgage put in
place for $23 million under the same terms and conditions as the
Conifer mortgage.

o Meditrust will receive an $11 million mortgage on the Denver
Rehab facility. The term of the loan will be for ten years and
all other terms and conditions will be the same as the Conifer
and Arms mortgages.

o Sun will make a $10 million payment to Meditrust to reduce its
investment in Holliswood Hospital. The lease will be terminated
and a new mortgage for $20 million will be established. The
term of the mortgage will be for ten years and all other terms
and conditions will be the same as the Conifer, Arms and Denver
mortgages.

CRS WASHINGTON

o Sun will enter into a lease agreement for the CRS Washington
facility in an amount of $5,861,000. The term of the lease will
be for twelve years and all other terms and conditions will be
similar to the previously mentioned mortgages.

NEW MEDICO PROPERTIES

o A master lease will be entered into for Holyoke, Lowell, Lynn,
Arkansas, Michigan and CRS Cortland. The term of the leases
will be 12 years (or less to meet operating lease criteria), all
termination options will be eliminated, the base rate will be
10.5% and Sun will have a right of substitution.

o Any potential Mediplex contingent obligation to provide
Meditrust with base rate payments on $9.7 million of financing
relating to New Medico will be eliminated.

o The four remaining New Medico properties: Darien, River Glen,
Mediplex of Southern Connecticut (Golden Hill), and Mediplex of
North Hampton (Pioneer Valley) will be operated by Sun and
Meditrust will provide mortgage financing under similar terms
and conditions as described in this document. Sun may request
that Meditrust convert the mortgages to sale leasebacks and if
not converted by Meditrust, may repay the mortgage financing
without penalty.

-2-
<PAGE> 11

ADDITIONAL FINANCING

o An additional $80 million of property will also be provided to
Meditrust by Sun for sale/leaseback or mortgage financing.
Approximately $30 million of the total will be credited at the
closing date for sale/leaseback financing for the Bowling Green,
Milford, CT and Bristol facilities at a 10.5% rate under the
same terms and conditions as previously described. The
financing of Darien, River Glen, Golden Hill and Pioneer Valley
will be credited against the remaining $50 million and the
balance will be made available to Meditrust based on a right of
first refusal. Sun will provide this option to Meditrust on all
property financing entered into by Sun during the 24 month
period following the closing.

ANNEX B

DRAFT

January 19, 1994

Mr. Bruce Broussard
Chief Financial Officer
Sun Healthcare Group, Inc.
5600 Wyoming Blvd. N.E., Suite 140
Albuquerque, NM 87109

Dear Mr. Broussard:

Based on (i) our discussion concerning a proposed senior debt facility
with a maturity date of three years in the approximate amount of $125,000,000
(the "Facility") for the proposed acquisition (the "Acquisition") of 100% of the
capital stock of The Mediplex Group, Inc. ("Mediplex") and (ii) the information
regarding the Acquisition that you have provided us to date, NationsBank of
Texas, N.A. (the "Bank") is pleased to confirm that it is willing to provide the
Facility for Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. (the "Company"), subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Summary of Proposed Terms and
Conditions, which is attached as Exhibit A hereto, subject to negotiation
incorporating such other terms and conditions as are customary for credit
facilities of the type contemplated hereby.

Any funding under the Facility will be subject to (i) satisfactory due
diligence and review of financial projections, (ii) final credit approval, (iii)
receipt of all documents related to the Acquisition in form and substance
satisfactory to the Bank, (iv) the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of mutually acceptable loan documentation, on the terms and conditions
mutually agreeable to the Company and the Bank, and (v) the absence of any event
of default, or event which with the giving of notice or lapse of time or both
wold be an event of default under the Company's existing credit facility with
the Bank or any material adverse change in the business, condition (financial or
otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of the Company from
September 30, 1993.

The Bank shall have the right to employ the services of NationsBanc
Capital Markets, Inc. ("NCMI") in providing the Facility and to allocate, in
whole or in part, to NCMI certain fees payable to the Bank in such manner as
NCMI and the Bank agree.

<PAGE> 15

Our obligations to provide the Facility will terminate on August 15,
1994 or any date prior to such date on which the Company advises us that the
results of its due diligence are unsatisfactory.

Because the Bank is incurring costs and expenses, regardless of whether
any of the transactions are consummated or any loan documents are agreed to and
signed, the Company acknowledges its obligation to pay such costs and expenses
including reasonable attorneys' fees (whether incurred before or after the date
of this letter). The Company also agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Bank and NCMI, their directors, officers, employees, agents and affiliates (each
being an "Indemnified Party"), from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages and liabilities related to or arising out of any matters related to this
letter or the Facility, unless there is a final determination that such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities related from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of an Indemnified Party.

This letter constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and
supersedes and cancels any prior agreements between the parties as to the
matters covered in this letter.

Please sign in the space below to evidence your agreement with the terms
of this letter and return a copy of this letter and an executed copy of the
enclosed fee letter to the undersigned no later than January 28, 1994. If an
executed copy of this letter and the enclosed fee letter are not returned by
such date, the commitment by the Bank herein shall terminate.

Very truly yours,

NationsBank of Texas, N.A.
