On May 6, 1994, Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, Inc. (the "Company") entered
into a Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement") with Nestle
Holdings, Inc. (the "Purchaser") pursuant to which the Purchaser agreed to
purchase from the Company three million shares of Common Stock, par value $1.00
per share (the "Common Stock"), for a price of $32 per share, and three-year
warrants to purchase one million shares for a price of $32 per share and five-
year warrants to purchase one million shares for a price of $32 per share, the
aggregate purchase price for such warrants being $10 million. A copy of the
Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.1, and is incorporated herein by
reference. The Warrant Agreement is attached thereto as Exhibit A to the
Agreement; the forms of Right of First Refusal Agreements, pursuant to which
Gary Rogers, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and
William Cronk, the President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, as
well as certain of their related entities, have granted a right of first
refusal to the Purchaser on the shares of Common Stock owned by them, are
attached as Exhibits B and C to the Agreement; the Distributor Agreement,
pursuant to which the Company will distribute the Purchaser's frozen novelty
and ice cream products in certain markets beginning in 1995, is attached as
Exhibit D to the Agreement; a proposed amendment to the GECC Registration
Rights Agreement is attached thereto as Exhibit E to the Agreement; an
amendment to the Company's Rights Agreement, to allow the Purchaser to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Agreement without becoming an
"Acquiring Person" as defined in the Rights Agreement, is attached as Exhibit F
to the Agreement; and the Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which the
Purchaser will have certain rights to request the Company to cause its shares
to be registered, is attached as Exhibit G to the Agreement. A copy of a press
release (the "Press Release") issued by the Company on May 6, 1994 in
connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement is attached
hereto as Exhibit 99.1. Capitalized terms used herein without definition have
the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement.

As described in the Press Release, the Agreement contains provisions
providing the Purchaser with certain board representation and creating certain
standstill arrangements.

As described in the Press Release, the Company is embarking on a five-
year plan to accelerate the sale of its branded products by greatly increasing
its consumer marketing efforts and expanding its distribution system into
additional markets. Under the plan, the Company will increase the amount of
its spending for advertising and consumer promotion from a level of
approximately $12 million in 1993 to $40 million in 1994 and plans to spend
approximately $50 million annually on these marketing activities from 1995
through 1998.

The Company also announced that its board of directors has authorized
a program to repurchase up to 5 million shares through open market purchases
and negotiated transactions. The timing and amount of such purchases will
depend upon, among other things, market conditions, availability of shares for
purchase and the prices at which such shares may be available.

2. Representations and Warranties of the Company

The Company represents and warrants as of the Effective Date and as of
the Closing Date as follows:

2.1 Organization and Qualification. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized and existing in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated and has the
power and authority to own its respective property and to carry on its
respective business as now being conducted. Each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business and in
good standing in every jurisdiction in which the nature of the respective
business conducted or property owned by it makes such qualification necessary,
except where the failure so to qualify would not have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company. The Company has heretofore delivered to the Purchaser true and
correct copies of its, and each of its Subsidiaries', Charter Documents, all as
presently in effect, and has identified on Schedule 2.1 hereto all
jurisdictions in which it and its Subsidiaries are qualified or licensed to do
business as a foreign corporation.

2.2 Due Authorization. The Company has all right, power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and each of the Collateral Agreements
and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement and each of the Collateral Agreements
and the issuance and sale of the Securities and Warrant Shares by the Company
and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby (i) have (or, with respect to the Warrant Shares, will have) been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on behalf of the Company and (ii)
do not or will not require the approval or consent of the stockholders of the
Company (including, without limitation, any consents or approvals of the
stockholders of the Company that may be required for qualification of the
Common Shares on the Nasdaq National Market System). This Agreement and each
of the Collateral Agreements have been (or, when executed and delivered, will
have been) duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitute (or, when
executed and delivered, will constitute) valid and binding agreements of the
Company, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except that (i)
such enforcement may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to
creditors' rights, and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive
and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to
the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be
brought. The Board of Directors has unanimously approved of (i) the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and each of the Collateral Agreements and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (ii) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each of the Collateral
Agreements and the Right of First Refusal Agreements, which transactions will
result in each of the Purchaser, its affiliates and associates becoming an
"interested stockholder" within the meaning of Sections 203(a)(1) and
203(c)(1), (2) and (5) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
and (iii) the Purchaser (as well as any Affiliates to which any Common Shares
may be transferred as permitted by this Agreement) becoming "Substantial
Stockholders" within the meaning of Articles TENTH and ELEVENTH of the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company. The Board of Directors has duly
adopted resolutions approving of the items described in the

6
<PAGE> 12
preceding sentence and such resolutions are in full force and effect and have
not been amended or otherwise modified.

2.3 Subsidiaries. The Company has identified on Schedule 2.3
hereto (i) the name and jurisdiction of incorporation of each Subsidiary and
(ii) the number of shares of capital stock and other equity securities and the
percentage of the issued and outstanding capital stock and other equity
securities (including rights, warrants and options to acquire such capital
stock) of each such Subsidiary owned or to be owned by the Company following
the Closing Date. All such shares of capital stock and other equity securities
have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are (except
for directors' qualifying shares) owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries or,
after the Closing Date, will be owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries, free
and clear of any Lien.

Except as set forth on Schedule 2.3 hereto, no Subsidiary of
the Company has, and after the Closing Date, no Subsidiary will have,
outstanding capital stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any shares of its capital stock, nor does it have outstanding
any rights to subscribe for or to purchase, or any options for the purchase of,
or any agreement providing for the issuance (contingent or otherwise) of, or
any calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to, any shares of
its capital stock or any securities convertible into or exchangeable or
exercisable for any shares of its capital stock.

2.4 SEC Reports. The Company has filed all proxy statements,
reports and other documents required to be filed by it under the Exchange Act
since January 1, 1992; and the Company has furnished the Purchaser copies of
its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 1993, and
all proxy statements and reports and other documents under the Exchange Act
filed by the Company after such date, each as filed with the Commission
(collectively, the "SEC Reports"). Each SEC Report complied with the
requirements of the Exchange Act. As of their respective dates, each SEC
Report (including all information incorporated therein by reference) did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
and as of the Effective Date, there are no facts required to be disclosed in
the SEC Reports which are not disclosed as required.

2.5 Financial Statements; No Material Undisclosed Liabilities;
Absence of Material Changes. The financial statements (including any related
schedules and/or notes) included or incorporated by reference in each SEC
Report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles consistently followed (except as indicated in the notes thereto)
throughout the periods involved and fairly present the consolidated financial
position and results of operations and changes in financial position of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and for the periods ended
on such dates (in each case subject, as to interim statements, to changes
resulting from normal year-end adjustments, none of which will be material in
amount or effect). The Company has no material liabilities or obligations
(individually or in the aggregate), whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise, and whether due or to become due, not reflected in the Company's
balance sheet as of December 25, 1993, except for such matters as may be
disclosed in the SEC Reports, other than any such

7
<PAGE> 13
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business since December 25,
1993. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.5 hereto, since December 25, 1993, the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries have operated their respective businesses
only in the ordinary course and have experienced no changes or events
reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect, other than changes or
events disclosed or referred to in the SEC Reports or the Schedules hereto, and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have (i) incurred any
indebtedness for borrowed money, assumed, guaranteed, endorsed or otherwise
become responsible for obligations of any other Person, or made any loans or
advances to any Person, except in the ordinary course of business and
consistent with past practice, (ii) made any changes in accounting principles
or methods, (iii) issued any shares of its capital stock, or any other
securities, or any securities convertible into or exchangeable for, or options
or warrants to purchase, shares of its capital stock or any other securities
except pursuant to options and warrants outstanding prior to the Effective Date
or (iv) made any change to its Charter Documents.

2.6 Actions Pending; Compliance with Laws. Except as set forth on
Schedule 2.6 hereto, there is no action, suit, investigation or proceeding
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened by any Person against
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets by or before any court, arbitrator or governmental body, department,
commission, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, which is reasonably
likely to succeed, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
default with respect to any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree or award.

2.7 Title to Properties; Insurance. The Company and its
Subsidiaries have good and valid title to, or, in the case of property leased
by any of them as lessee, a valid and subsisting leasehold interest in, their
respective properties and assets, free of all Liens other than those referred
to in the financial statements of the Company (or the notes thereto) for the
year ended December 25, 1993, included in the SEC Reports, except in each case
for such defects in title and such other Liens which are disclosed in the SEC
Reports. The Company and its Subsidiaries maintain insurance in such amounts
(to the extent available in the public market), including self-insurance,
retainage and deductible arrangements, and of such a character as is reasonable
for companies engaged in the same or similar business.

2.8 Governmental Consents, etc. The Company is not required to
obtain any consent, approval or authorization of, or to make any declaration or
filing with, any governmental authority as a condition to or in connection with
the valid execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each of the
Collateral Agreements and the valid offer, issue, sale or delivery of the
Securities and Warrant Shares, or the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, except for filings under the HSR
Act, any filings required to effect any registration pursuant to the
Registration Rights Agreement, any filings required pursuant to state and
federal securities laws which will be timely made after the Closing hereunder
and the filing of a Nasdaq National Market Notification Form for Listing of
Additional Shares.

2.9 Holding Company Act and Investment Company Act. Neither the
Company nor any Subsidiary is: (i) a "public utility company" or a "holding
company," or an "affiliate" or a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company,"
or an "affiliate" of such a "subsidiary

8
<PAGE> 14
company," as such terms are defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935, as amended (the "PUHCA"), or (ii) a "public utility," as defined in
the Federal Power Act, as amended (the "FPA"), or (iii) an "investment company"
or an "affiliated person" thereof or an "affiliated person" of any such
"affiliated person," as such terms are defined in the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended (the "ICA"); provided, however, that the Company may be deemed
to be an "affiliate" of General Electric for purposes of the PUHCA and FPA and
an "affiliated person" of Northern Trust Corporation, State of Wisconsin
Investment Board and RCM Capital Management for purposes of the ICA.

2.10 Taxes. The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed or caused
to be filed all income tax returns which are required to be filed and have paid
or caused to be paid all taxes as shown on said returns and on all assessments
received by them to the extent that such taxes have become due, except taxes
the validity or amount of which are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and with respect to which adequate reserves have been
set aside. The federal income tax returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries
have been examined and reported on by the Internal Revenue Service (or closed
by applicable statutes) and all tax liabilities including additional
assessments have been satisfied for all fiscal years prior to and including the
fiscal year ended December 31, 1988. The Company and its Subsidiaries have
paid or caused to be paid, or have established reserves that the Company
reasonably believes to be adequate for all federal income tax liabilities and
state income tax liabilities applicable to the Company and its Subsidiaries for
all fiscal years which have not been examined and reported on by the taxing
authorities (or closed by applicable statutes).

2.11 Conflicting Agreements and Charter Provisions. Neither the
Company nor its Subsidiaries is a party to any contract or agreement or subject
to any Charter Document provision, or judgment or decree which does or in all
reasonable likelihood will have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.
Except as set forth on Schedule 2.11, none of (i) the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and each of the Collateral Agreements and the Right of First
Refusal Agreements and the issuance of the Securities, (ii) the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (iii) the exercise of the
Warrants for, and the issuance of, the Warrant Shares, will conflict with or
result in a breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or give rise to a
right of termination under, or constitute a default under, or result in any
violation of, the Charter Documents of the Company or any Subsidiary or any
mortgage, agreement, instrument, order, judgment, decree, statute, law, rule or
regulations to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective property is subject. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is in default under any outstanding indenture or other debt
instrument or with respect to the payment of principal of or interest on any
outstanding obligation for borrowed money, under any of their respective
contracts or agreements, or under any instrument by which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is bound.

2.12 Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of (i) 30,000,000 Common Shares of which, as of May 2, 1994,
14,764,596 shares are outstanding and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of Preferred
Stock, including the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series A
Preferred") and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Series B
Preferred"), none of which are issued and outstanding. All of the outstanding
Common Shares have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable.
No class of capital stock of the

9
<PAGE> 15
Company is entitled to preemptive rights. Except for the Rights, the options
and warrants listed on Schedule 2.12 hereto, the 6.25% Subordinated Convertible
Notes due June 30, 2001 (the "Convertible Notes"), the Series A Preferred and
the Series B Preferred, there are no outstanding options, warrants, scrip,
rights to subscribe to, calls or commitments of any character whatsoever
relating to, or securities or rights convertible into, shares of any class of
capital stock of the Company, or contracts, commitments, understandings, or
arrangements by which the Company is or may become bound to issue additional
shares of its capital stock or options, warrants or rights to purchase or
acquire any shares of its capital stock. Since December 25, 1993, the Company
has not changed the amount of its authorized capital stock or subdivided or
otherwise changed any shares of any class of its capital stock, whether by way
of reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or otherwise, or issued or
reissued, or agreed to issue or reissue, any of its capital stock. Between May
2, 1994 and the Effective Date, the Company has not issued any additional
shares of capital stock, or any other securities, or any securities convertible
into or exchangeable for shares of its capital stock or any other securities,
other than pursuant to the exercise of outstanding stock options and other
employee benefit plans in effect on the Effective Date.

2.13 Status of Securities. The Securities have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company (no
consent or approval of stockholders being required by law, the Charter
Documents of the Company, the qualification criteria of the Nasdaq National
Market System or otherwise), and upon issuance and sale hereunder will be
validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable, and the issuance
thereof is not subject to preemptive rights of any other stockholder of the
Company.

2.14 Status of Warrant Shares. The Warrant Shares will be duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company (no
consent or approval of stockholders being required by law, the Charter
Documents of the Company, the qualification criteria of the Nasdaq National
Market System or otherwise), and upon issuance in accordance with the terms of
the Warrant Agreement, will be validly issued and outstanding, fully paid and
nonassessable, and the issuance thereof is not subject to preemptive rights of
any other stockholder of the Company. The Warrant Shares have been validly
reserved for issuance upon the exercise of the Warrants.

2.15 ERISA. No accumulated funding deficiency (as defined in
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, exists
with respect to any Pension Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan (as defined
below)). No liability to the PBGC has been, or is reasonably likely to be,
incurred with respect to any Pension Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan) by
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate (as defined below).
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate has
incurred, or is reasonably likely to incur, any withdrawal liability under
Title IV of ERISA with respect to any Multiemployer Plan, and if the Company,
its Subsidiaries and ERISA Affiliates, were to completely withdraw as of the
Effective Date from each Multiemployer Plan to which they have or have ever had
an obligation to contribute, the Company, its Subsidiaries and its ERISA
Affiliates would not incur any withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA.
The Company is not a "party in interest" (as defined in Section 3(14) of ERISA)
or a "disqualified person" (as defined in Section 4975(e)(2) of the Code) with
respect to the Purchaser. To the best knowledge

10
<PAGE> 16
of the Company, no fiduciary of or "party in interest" or "disqualified person"
with respect to any employee benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA)
maintained or contributed to by the Company or any of its subsidiaries, for the
benefit of their respective employees (each an "Employee Plan") has engaged in
or caused any Employee Plan to engage in any "prohibited transaction" (within
the meaning of Section 4975 of the Code and Sections 406 or 407 of ERISA) that
has resulted in the imposition of any tax or penalty imposed under Section 4975
of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA that has not been satisfied. Except as set
forth on Schedule 2.15(a), each Employee Plan has been maintained and
administered in compliance with all applicable law including ERISA and the
Code. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.15(a), each Employee Plan which is
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has been so qualified
during the period from its adoption to date. There are no pending IRS audits
or controversies with respect to any Pension Plan other than a Multiemployer
Plan. An "ERISA Affiliate" for purposes of this Section 2.15 is any trade or
business, whether or not incorporated, which, together with the Company, is
under common control, as described in Section 414(b) or (c) of the Code, and
the term "Multiemployer Plan" shall mean any Pension Plan which is a
"multiemployer plan" (as such term is defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA).
Schedule 2.15(b) hereto contains a complete list of each Pension Plan,
Multiemployer Plan, Employee Plan, employment, consulting, severance or other
similar contract, arrangement and policy and each plan, arrangement, program,
agreement or commitment providing for welfare benefits or for deferred
compensation, profit-sharing bonuses, stock options, stock appreciation rights,
stock purchases or other forms of incentive compensation or post-retirement
insurance, compensation or benefits which are maintained or contributed to by
the Company and which cover or have covered employees of the Company or any of
its subsidiaries (with respect to their relationship with such entities).

2.16 Possession of Franchises, Licenses, Etc. The Company and its
Subsidiaries possess all franchises, certificates, licenses, permits and other
authorizations from governmental or political subdivisions or regulatory
authorities and all patents, trademarks, service marks, trade names,
copyrights, licenses and other rights, free from burdensome restrictions, that
are necessary to the Company and its Subsidiaries for the ownership,
maintenance and operation of their respective businesses, properties and
assets, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of
any thereof.

2.17 Compliance With Legislation Regulating Environmental Quality.
Except where non-compliance is not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company, the Facilities which currently are owned, operated or
leased by the Company are and at all times have been maintained and operated in
compliance with all applicable federal, state and local environmental
protection, occupational, health and safety or similar laws, ordinances,
restrictions, orders, regulations and licenses (collectively "Environmental
Laws") including but not limited to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33
U.S.C Section 1251 et seq. ), Resource Conservation & Recovery Act (42 U.S.C.
Section 6901 et seq.), Safe Drinking Water Act (21 U.S.C. Section 349, 42 
U.S.C. Section Section 201, 300f), Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 
Section 2601 et seq.), Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. Section 7401 et seq.), 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (42 U.S.C. 
Section 9601 et seq.), California Health & Safety Code (Section 25100 
et seq., Section 39000 et seq.), and California Water Code (Section 13000 
et seq.). No materials, substances, or products have been at any time placed, 
held, located, disposed of or released on,

11
<PAGE> 17
under, at, within, or about the Facilities which may reasonably be expected to
result in a regulatory agency or other governmental entity requiring clean up,
removal or other remedial action by the Company under Environmental Laws with
such exceptions as would not in the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Company. No hazardous or toxic substance, waste or material (collectively
"Hazardous Materials") has at any time been used, stored, treated, transported
or handled by the Company or any of its consultants, contractors or agents on,
under, at, within, or about the Facilities except Hazardous Materials that are
used, stored, treated, transported or handled on, under, at, within or about
the Facilities in material compliance with Environmental Laws. Except in cases
or circumstances not reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company, no litigation, administrative enforcement actions, proceedings or
notices of potential liability have been (x) received, served or, to the best
knowledge of the Company, filed or threatened against the Company or (y) to the
actual knowledge of the Company, received, served, filed or threatened against
any predecessor business or landowner or with respect to any Facility, in each
case, relating to damage, contribution, cost recovery, compensation, loss or
injury resulting from any Hazardous Materials or arising out of the use,
generation, storage, treatment, release, discharge, transportation, handling or
disposal of Hazardous Materials or resulting from a violation or alleged
violation of Environmental Laws.

2.18 Certain Agreements. The Purchaser has been provided access to
all material contracts and agreements to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.18, the Company is
not a party to (i) any written arrangement (or group of related written
arrangements) concerning a partnership or joint venture with any other Person
involving commitments or assets of the Company in excess of $100,000, (ii) any
written arrangement (or group of related written arrangements) concerning
non-competition arrangements, (iii) any written arrangement with any of its
directors, officers, shareholders or employees or any member of any such
Person's immediate family (1) providing for the furnishing of material services
by or (2) otherwise requiring material payments to any such Person or any
Person in which any such Person has a substantial interest as a shareholder,
officer, director, trustee or partner or (iv) any oral contract or agreement
with respect to any of the matters referred to in the foregoing clauses (i)

other than the Purchaser and other "Accredited Investors" (as defined in Rule

any offering of any securities of the Company under circumstances which would
require the integration of such offering with the offering of the Securities or
Warrant Shares under the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the
Commission thereunder) which could reasonably be expected to subject the
offering, issuance or sale of the Securities or Warrant Shares to the
registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act.

represents and warrants as of the Effective Date and as of the Closing Date as
follows:

3.1 Organization and Qualification. The Purchaser is a
corporation duly organized and existing in good standing under the laws of the
state of Delaware and has the power to own its properties and to carry on its
businesses as now being conducted. The Purchaser is duly qualified to do
business and in good standing in every jurisdiction in which the nature of the
respective business conducted or property owned by it makes such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to so qualify would not prevent
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or materially and
adversely effect the Purchaser's ability to perform its obligations hereunder.

authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and each of

Purchaser. This Agreement and each of the Collateral Agreements to which it is
a party have been (or, when executed and delivered, will have been) duly
executed and delivered by the Purchaser and constitute (or, when executed and
delivered, will constitute) valid and binding agreements of the Purchaser
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, except that (i) such
enforcement may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws now or hereafter in effect relating to
creditors' rights, and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive
and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and to
the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be

3.3 Conflicting Agreements and Other Matters. Neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and each of the Collateral Agreements
to which it is a party nor the performance by the Purchaser of its obligations
hereunder or thereunder will conflict with, result in a breach of the terms,
conditions or provisions of, constitute a default under, or require any
consent, approval or other action by or any notice to or filing with any court
or administrative or governmental body pursuant to, the organizational
documents or agreements of the Purchaser or any material mortgage, agreement,
instrument, order, judgment, decree, statute, law, rule or regulation to which
the Purchaser or any of its respective properties are subject, except for
filings under the HSR Act.

3.4 Acquisition Representations. The Purchaser is acquiring the
Securities being purchased by it for its own account and not with a view to or
for sale in connection with any distribution thereof in any transaction that
would violate the securities laws of the United States or any state thereof and
the Purchaser has no present plan or intention to effect any distribution
thereof. The Purchaser acknowledges that the Securities and the Warrant Shares
issuable upon exercise of the Warrants have not been registered under the
Securities Act and may be sold or disposed of in the absence of such
registration only pursuant to an exemption from such registration and in
accordance with this Agreement. At the Effective Date, the Purchaser does not
Beneficially Own, directly or, to the knowledge of the Purchaser, indirectly
(or have any option or right to acquire), any securities of the Company other
than as contemplated under this Agreement, the Collateral Agreements and the
Right of First Refusal Agreements. The Purchaser has provided the Company with
the form of Item 4 of the statement on Schedule 13D it intends to file with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 promulgated under the Securities Act.

properties, books and records of the Company, and to conduct such examination
of the condition of the Company, as the Purchaser deems necessary or advisable
to familiarize itself with such business, properties, books, records, condition
and other matters, and to verify the representations and warranties of the
Company hereunder.

15
<PAGE> 21
4.2 Consents and Best Efforts. As soon as practicable, but in any
event within five Business Days after the Effective Date, the Company and the
Purchaser shall make all filings required under the HSR Act. In addition, the
Company shall as soon as practicable after the Effective Date, commence to take
all action required to obtain all consents, approvals and agreements of, and to
give all notices and make all other filings with, any Persons necessary to
authorize, approve or permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and each of the Collateral Agreements and the Right of First
Refusal Agreements, including the full and complete sale, conveyance,
assignment or transfer of all of the Securities (and the Warrant Shares when
issued upon exercise of the Warrants), and the Purchaser shall cooperate with
the Company with respect thereto. In addition, subject to the terms and
conditions provided herein, each of the parties hereto covenants and agrees to
use its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action or do, or cause
to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
hereby and to cause the fulfillment of the parties' obligations hereunder.

4.3 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give
prompt notice to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall give prompt notice to
the Company, of (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event which
occurrence or failure would be likely to cause any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect
as of the Closing Date and (ii) any material failure of the Company or the
Purchaser, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, and
each party shall use all reasonable efforts to remedy same.

5. Covenants of the Company after Closing

The Company covenants that so long as the Purchaser (and/or its
Affiliates) Beneficially Own any Common Shares:

5.1 Financial Statements and Other Reports.

(a) The Company will, as soon as practicable and in any
event within 60 days after the end of each quarterly period (other than the
last quarterly period) in each fiscal year, furnish to the Purchaser statements
of consolidated net income and cash flows and a statement of changes in
consolidated stockholders' equity of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the
period from the beginning of the then current fiscal year to the end of such
quarterly period, and a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the end of such quarterly period, setting forth in each case
in comparative form figures for the corresponding period or date in the
preceding fiscal year, all in reasonable detail and certified by an authorized
financial officer of the Company, subject to changes resulting from year-end
adjustments; provided, however, that delivery pursuant to clause (c) below of a
copy of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of the Company for such quarterly
period filed with the Commission shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of
this Section 5.1(a);

16
<PAGE> 22
(b) The Company will, as soon as practicable and in any
event within 100 days after the end of each fiscal year, furnish to the
Purchaser statements of consolidated net income and cash flows and a statement
of changes in consolidated stockholders' equity of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for such year, and a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the end of such year, setting forth in each case in
comparative form the corresponding figures from the preceding fiscal year, all
in reasonable detail and examined and reported on by independent public
accountants of recognized national standing selected by the Company; provided,
however, that delivery pursuant to clause (c) below of a copy of the Annual
Report on Form 10-K of the Company for such fiscal year filed with the
Commission shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this Section 5.1(b);

(c) The Company will, promptly upon transmission thereof,
furnish to the Purchaser copies of all such financial statements, proxy
statements, notices and reports as it shall send to its stockholders and copies
of all such registration statements (without exhibits), other than registration
statements relating to employee benefit or dividend reinvestment plans, and all
such regular and periodic reports as it shall file with the Commission;

(d) The Company will, promptly after such package becomes
available, furnish to the Purchaser a copy of the Company's monthly management
executive summary or any substantially similar replacement therefor for the
third month of each fiscal quarter; and

(e) The Company will promptly furnish to the Purchaser
copies of any compliance certificates furnished to lenders in respect of
Indebtedness (as defined in the GECC Agreement) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and, with reasonable promptness, furnish to the Purchaser such
other financial and other data of the Company and its Subsidiaries as the
Purchaser may reasonably request, including, but not limited to, operating
financial information for each facility owned or operated by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be
required to furnish to the Purchaser the reports described in Sections 5.1(d)
and (e) when the Purchaser Beneficially Owns less than 1% of the outstanding
Common Shares, on a Fully Diluted basis.

5.2 Inspection of Property. The Company shall permit
representatives of the Purchaser to visit and inspect, at the Purchaser's
expense, any of the properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries, to examine
the corporate books and make copies or extracts therefrom and to discuss the
affairs, finances and accounts of the Company and its Subsidiaries with the
principal officers of the Company, all at such reasonable times, upon
reasonable notice and as often as the Purchaser may reasonably request;
provided, however, that the foregoing shall be subject to compliance with
reasonable safety, operating and production requirements and shall not require
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to permit any inspection which in the
reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the violation of any statute
or regulation with respect to confidentiality or security. The Purchaser
agrees that the information received pursuant to Sections 5.1 and 5.2 shall be
subject to the confidentiality provisions of Section 6.4.

17
<PAGE> 23
5.3 Board Membership. The provisions of this Section 5.3 shall be
applicable so long as the Purchaser shall Beneficially Own 10% or more of the
Common Shares on a Fully Diluted Basis:

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Closing, the
Board of Directors shall take all necessary action to increase the size of the
Board of Directors by two and to elect two Persons nominated by the Purchaser
(the "Purchaser's Nominees") to the Board of Directors, with such Purchaser's
Nominees being elected to Class II and Class III, respectively;

(b) At each subsequent stockholders meeting at which
directors will be elected or solicitation of written consents for the election
of directors, the Purchaser will be entitled to propose as members of the Board
of Directors (and the Company will nominate to separate classes, recommend and
use the same efforts it uses with respect to all other of the Board of
Director's nominees to cause the election of) that number of Persons which when
added to Persons who are Purchaser's Nominees and who are continuing to serve
on the Board of Directors is equal to the number of Purchaser's Nominees to
which the Purchaser is then entitled pursuant to this Section 5.3. In the
event of any vacancy arising by reason of the resignation, death, removal or
inability to serve of one of the Purchaser's Nominees, the Purchaser shall be
entitled to designate a successor to fill such vacancy and such successor shall
serve as a board member until the next regularly scheduled election for such
board seat. One of the Purchaser's Nominees shall be entitled to membership on
all committees of the Board of Directors, including, without limitation, the
executive committee, if any, or any committee performing substantially similar
functions;

(c) The Company agrees that if any of the Purchaser's
Nominees are not reelected to the Board of Directors by the stockholders of the
Company, the Purchaser shall be entitled to have that number of observers equal
to the number of the Purchaser's Nominees that were not so elected present at
all meetings of the Board of Directors and committees of the Board of Directors
and such observer(s) shall have the same access to information concerning the
business and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and at the same
time as directors of the Company, subject to the provisions of Section 6.4, and
shall be entitled to participate in discussions and consult with the Board of
Directors, without voting;

(d) The Company further agrees that at all times the
Purchaser shall be entitled to nominate to the Board of Directors a number of
Purchaser's Nominees which bears the same proportion to the total number of
members of the Board of Directors as the number of Common Shares actually owned
by the Purchaser (excluding Warrant Shares relating to Warrants which have not
been exercised) bears to the total number of Common Shares then actually
outstanding; provided, however, that if such proportion is not a whole number,
the number of Purchaser's Nominees will be rounded down if the fraction is .49
or less and will be rounded up if the fraction is .50 or greater; provided,
further, however that at all times the Purchaser shall be entitled to nominate
to the Board of Directors a minimum of two Purchaser's Nominees. The
provisions of Sections 5.3(b) and (c) shall be applicable with respect to all
of the Purchaser's Nominees, including the Purchaser's Nominees elected to the
Board of Directors pursuant to the provisions of this Section 5.3(d); and

18
<PAGE> 24
(e) All Purchaser's Nominees shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Board of Directors.

5.4 Preemptive Rights. In the event of the sale by the Company of
Common Shares, or any other voting or other security of the Company or security
convertible into or exercisable for such Common Shares or other voting
security, for cash effected subsequent to the Effective Date, the Purchaser
shall be entitled to purchase shares in such sale on a pro rata basis in
respect of the Common Shares then Beneficially Owned by it, on a Fully Diluted
basis, so that following such sale, the Purchaser will, if it has elected to
purchase the securities to be sold, Beneficially Own the same percentage of the
equity ownership of the Company on a Fully Diluted basis as it had by reason of
its Beneficial Ownership of Common Shares prior to such sale. The Company
shall provide the Purchaser with a minimum of two Business Days notice of the
anticipated pricing of such offering, which notice shall indicate the
anticipated size and range of pricing of the offering, and based on such
notice, the Purchaser shall advise the Company within one Business Day as to
whether it elects to exercise its rights under this Section 5.4, and if it so
elects, the Purchaser shall tender payment for the same securities, at the same
time, and in the same manner as the other purchasers in such offering.

5.5 Special Notices. If (a) the Company determines to initiate,
solicit or pursue (i) a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the
Company's assets or Common Shares representing 20% or more of the then
outstanding Common Shares or (ii) a merger, reorganization, consolidation or
similar transaction between the Company and any other Person (individually, any
of the events described in clauses (i) and (ii) are referred to herein as a
"Transaction") or (b) any officer, director, agent or representative of the
Company begins pursuing with any Person substantive discussions concerning, or
substantive negotiations with respect to, any Transaction (any such initiation,
solicitation, pursuit, discussions or negotiations referred to in clauses (a)
and (b) is referred to herein as an "Initiating Event"), then the Company
shall:

(1) notify the Purchaser of the occurrence of any
Initiating Event, as promptly as possible, but in no
event later than one Business Day after the
occurrence of such event; and

(2) notify the Purchaser that the Company may enter into
an agreement, contract, letter of intent or similar
instrument for a Transaction not less than 45 days
prior to the execution of any such agreement,
contract, letter of intent or similar instrument
which has any binding effect (a "Transaction
Notification").

5.6 Nondisclosure of the Purchaser's Confidential Information.

(a) Without the prior written consent of the Purchaser,
any information relating to the Purchaser provided to the Company in connection
with this Agreement and each of the Collateral Agreements and the Right of
First Refusal Agreements, which is either confidential, proprietary, or
otherwise not generally available to the public (but excluding information (i)
which was or becomes generally available to the Company or its Affiliates on

19
<PAGE> 25
a non-confidential basis, other than through a direct or indirect breach of
this Agreement by the Company, its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives, (ii) that was, prior to December 16, 1993, in the Company's,
its Affiliates' or any of their respective Representatives' possession, (iii)
that becomes available to the Company, its Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other
than the Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives
without the Company's or its Affiliates' knowledge that the source has violated
any fiduciary or other duty not to disclose such information or (iv) was
independently developed by the Company or its Affiliates without reference to
the Purchaser's Confidential Information) (the "Purchaser's Confidential
Information") will be used solely for the purpose of evaluating the Purchaser's
investment in the Company and will be kept confidential by the Company, its
Affiliates and their respective Representatives, using the same standard of
care in safeguarding the Purchaser's Confidential Information as the Company
employs in protecting its own proprietary information which the Company desires
not to disseminate or publish, and will not be disclosed to any Person, except
for Representatives of the Company who need to know such Purchaser's
Confidential Information for purposes of evaluating the Purchaser's investment
in the Company. It is understood (i) that such Representatives shall be
informed by the Company of the confidential nature of the Purchaser's
Confidential Information, (ii) that such Representatives shall be bound by the
provisions of this Section 5.6 as a condition of receiving the Purchaser's
Confidential Information and (iii) that, in any event, the Company shall be
responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Representatives;

(b) Without the prior consent of the Purchaser, other
than as required by applicable law, the Company will not, and will direct its
Affiliates and Representatives not to, disclose to any Person either the fact
that the Purchaser's Confidential Information has been made available to the
Company or that the Company has inspected any portion of the Purchaser's
Confidential Information; and

(c) If the Company, its Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives are requested or required (by oral question,
interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Purchaser's
Confidential Information, the Company will, as soon as practicable, notify the
Purchaser of such request or requirement so that the Purchaser may seek an
appropriate protective order. If, in the absence of a protective order, the
Company, its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives are, in the
opinion of the Company's counsel, compelled to disclose the Purchaser's
Confidential Information or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other
censure or significant penalty, the Company or its Affiliates may disclose only
such of the Purchaser's Confidential Information to the party compelling
disclosure as is required by law. The Company and its Affiliates shall not be
liable for the disclosure of Purchaser's Confidential Information pursuant to
the preceding sentence. The Company and its Affiliates will, at the
Purchaser's expense, cooperate with the Purchaser's reasonable efforts to
obtain a protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded the Purchaser's Confidential Information.

20
<PAGE> 26
5.7 Repurchase Programs.

The Company shall notify the Purchaser of the initiation,
suspensions (of any duration) and completion or termination by the Company of
any program pursuant to which the Company is effecting repurchases of its
Common Shares, as promptly as possible, but in no event later than five
Business Days after the occurrence of such event.

5.8 Distribution of Certain Products.

Unless Ben & Jerry's shall have agreed in writing to
unconditionally waive the payment of the termination payment specified in the
Previously Added Change of Control Provisions (as defined in the Ben & Jerry's
Distribution Agreement, as amended by the Ben & Jerry's Amendments) (the
"Termination Payment"), the Company shall not, directly or indirectly, take any
action which would permit Ben & Jerry's to be entitled to receive such
Termination Payment pursuant to clauses (a) or (b) of Section 1(ii) of the Ben
& Jerry's Amendments.

6. Covenants of the Purchaser after Closing

6.1 Standstill Provisions. Unless otherwise consented to by a
majority of the Board of Directors, until the earlier of (i) one year after the
date on which the Purchaser no longer Beneficially Owns 1% or more of the
outstanding Common Shares, on a Fully Diluted basis, (ii) the 10th anniversary
of the Closing Date or (iii) the occurrence of a Triggering Event, the
Purchaser covenants and agrees that:

(a) The Purchaser (and any of its Affiliates who hold
Common Shares) shall (i) cooperate with the Company in keeping the Rights
Agreement in full force and effect and (ii) notify the Company two Business
Days prior to making open market purchases of Common Shares that are not
otherwise precluded by the terms of this Section 6.1 ("Permitted Purchases");
provided, however, that the Purchaser acknowledges that the Company will begin
a Common Share repurchase program on or immediately after the Effective Date
pursuant to which the Company will seek to acquire up to 5 million Common
Shares (the "Repurchase Program"), and the Purchaser hereby agrees to refrain
from making any Permitted Purchases during the period commencing with the
Effective Date and ending on the earlier of the Company's termination of the
Repurchase Program or the last day of the six-month period following the
Effective Date. If the Repurchase Program has not been terminated upon the
expiration of such six-month period, the Purchaser may notify the Company of
its desire to make Permitted Purchases, and if the Company has not made open
market purchases of Common Shares in excess of 1% of the outstanding Common
Shares during the 30 days prior to such notice ("Significant Repurchases"),
then the Purchaser shall be entitled to make Permitted Purchases for a 90-day
period commencing with such notification and the Company hereby agrees not to
make any open market purchases during such 90-day period, unless earlier
notified by the Purchaser that the Purchaser has terminated its Permitted
Purchases. Thereafter, the Company may notify the Purchaser of its intention
to resume the Repurchase Program and, upon receipt of such notice, the
Purchaser shall refrain from making Permitted Purchases during the following
90-day period, unless earlier notified by the Company that the Company has
terminated its Repurchase Program. If, at the

21
<PAGE> 27
expiration or earlier termination of such 90-day period, the Company has not
made Significant Repurchases and the Purchaser desires to make Permitted
Purchases, the Purchaser may make Permitted Purchases upon notice to the
Company and the Company shall refrain from making open market repurchases
during the following 90-day period, unless earlier notified by the Purchaser
that the Purchaser has terminated its Permitted Purchases. If at any time
thereafter and prior to the termination of the Repurchase Program either the
Company or the Purchaser desire to make open market purchases, then the Company
shall make open market purchases of its Common Shares pursuant to the second
preceding sentence and the Purchaser shall make Permitted Purchases pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence;

(b) Neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall
solicit proxies or initiate, propose or become a "participant" in a
"solicitation" (as such terms are defined in Regulation 14A under the Exchange
Act) in opposition to any matter which has been recommended by a majority of
the directors of the Company or in favor of any matter which has not been
approved by a majority of the directors of the Company or seek to advise,
encourage or influence any Person with respect to the voting of Common Shares
in such manner, or induce or attempt to induce any Person to initiate any
stockholder proposal;

(c) Neither the Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall
form, join or participate in, or encourage the formation of, a partnership,
limited partnership, syndicate or other group, or otherwise act in concert with
any other Person (except as specifically contemplated by this Agreement, any of
the Collateral Agreements or the Right of First Refusal Agreements), for the
purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of Common Shares, or
otherwise become a "person" or a member of a "group" within the meaning of
Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or any Common
Shares (a "13D Group");

(d) The Purchaser and its Affiliates will not directly or
indirectly acquire, propose to acquire or agree to acquire any Common Shares
(except (i) the Securities and Warrant Shares, (ii) the Common Shares which are
or may become the subject of the Right of First Refusal Agreements (the "First
Refusal Shares") and are acquired pursuant to such Right of First Refusal
Agreements and (iii) as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, stock
reclassification or recapitalization of the Company) if the effect of such
acquisition would be to increase the Purchaser's Beneficial Ownership of Common
Shares to more than 25% of the outstanding Common Shares, after giving effect
to such acquisition, on a Fully Diluted basis; provided, however, that if an
acquisition by the Purchaser of any of the First Refusal Shares would cause the
Purchaser to Beneficially Own 35% or more of the outstanding Common Shares,
after giving effect to such acquisition, on a Fully Diluted basis (the shares
in excess of such limitation being referred to as the "Excess Shares"), then
the Purchaser shall Transfer (as defined in Section 6.3) the Excess Shares
prior to or simultaneous with its actual acquisition of the First Refusal
Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (a) due to actions of the Company
(including, without limitation, stock repurchases and recapitalizations) the
Purchaser is required to Transfer Excess Shares to enable the Purchaser to
acquire any of the First Refusal Shares and (b) the Purchaser's percentage

or proviso (B) to Section 6.1 below if it exceeds either of the foregoing

Board of Directors pursuant to their responsibilities in such capacity, the
exercise by the Purchaser of its voting rights with respect to any Common
Shares it Beneficially Owns and arrangements among and involving only the
Purchasers and its Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby shall not be deemed a violation of the provisions of this Section 6.1;

(B) Following the expiration of the standstill provisions
set forth in this Section 6.1, the Purchaser shall not attempt to purchase or
otherwise acquire (1) any Common Shares if after giving effect to such

equitable adjustment to reflect stock splits, stock dividends, stock
reclassifications or recapitalizations of the Company), then the Purchaser
shall be required to pay to the Company as soon as practicable following the

the subject shares, an additional $2.00 per share in cash for each Share and
Warrant Share acquired by the Purchaser pursuant to Sections 1.1 and 1.2 during
the Contingent Payment Period.

6.3 Restrictions on Transfer.

(a) Until the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the

<PAGE> 30
unreasonably withheld, it being understood that in determining whether or not
to grant such consent, the Board of Directors may take into account such
factors as it deems relevant to the interests of the Company as a whole, or (B)

or in the aggregate with such purchaser's Affiliates, more than 5% of the
outstanding Common Shares, on a Fully Diluted basis;

(c) The Transfer restrictions in Sections 6.3(a) and (b)

(a) Without the prior written consent of the Company, any
information relating to the Company provided to the Purchaser in connection
with this Agreement, or to the persons nominated by the Purchaser to be elected
to the Board of Directors, which is either confidential, proprietary, or
otherwise not generally available to the public (but excluding information (i)
which was or becomes generally available on a non-confidential basis to the
Purchaser or its Affiliates, other than through a direct or indirect breach of
this Agreement by the Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives, (ii) that was, prior to December 16, 1993, in the Purchaser's,
its Affiliates' or any of their respective Representatives' possession, (iii)
that becomes available to the Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than
the Company, its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives without
the Purchaser's or its Affiliates' knowledge that the source has violated any
fiduciary or other duty not to disclose such information or (iv) was
independently developed by the Purchaser or its Affiliates without reference to
the Confidential Information) (the "Company's Confidential Information") will
be used solely for the purpose of evaluating its investment in the Company and
will be kept confidential by the Purchaser, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives, using the same standard of care in safeguarding the Company's
Confidential Information as the Purchaser employs in protecting its own
proprietary information which the Purchaser desires not to disseminate or
publish, and will not be disclosed to any Person, except for Affiliates and
Representatives of the Purchaser who need to know such Company's Confidential
Information for purposes of evaluating the Purchaser's investment. It is
understood (i) that such Affiliates and Representatives shall be informed by
the Purchaser of the confidential nature of the Company's Confidential
Information, (ii) that such Affiliates and Representatives shall be bound by
the provisions of this Section 6.4 as a condition of receiving the Company's
Confidential Information and (iii) that, in any event, the Purchaser shall be
responsible for any breach of this Agreement by any of its Affiliates or
Representatives;

(b) Without the prior consent of the Company, other than
as required by applicable law, the Purchaser will not, and will direct its
Affiliates and Representatives not to,

25
<PAGE> 31
disclose to any Person either the fact that the Company's Confidential
Information has been made available to the Purchaser or that the Purchaser has
inspected any portion of the Company's Confidential Information; and

(c) If the Purchaser, its Affiliates or any of their
respective Representatives are requested or required (by oral question,
interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Company's Confidential
Information, the Purchaser will, as soon as practicable, notify the Company of
such request or requirement so that the Company may seek an appropriate
protective order. If, in the absence of a protective order, the Purchaser, its
Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives are, in the opinion of
the Purchaser's counsel, compelled to disclose the Company's Confidential
Information or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or
significant penalty, the Purchaser or its Affiliates may disclose only such of
the Company's Confidential Information to the party compelling disclosure as is
required by law. The Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not be liable for the
disclosure of Company's Confidential Information pursuant to the preceding
sentence. The Purchaser and its Affiliates will, at the Company's expense,
cooperate with the Company's reasonable efforts to obtain a protective order or
other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the
Company's Confidential Information.

and the Company; or

(ii) By the Purchaser or the Company if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before 120 days following the Effective
Date.

(b) In the Event of Termination. In the event of
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms:

(i) Each party will redeliver all documents, work
papers and other material of any other party relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before or after the Effective Date, to
the party furnishing the same;

(ii) The provisions of Section 8.4 shall continue
in full force and effect; and

(iii) No party hereto shall have any liability or
further obligation to any other party to this Agreement, except as stated in
Sections 8.1(b)(i) - (iii), except for any willful breach of this Agreement
occurring prior to the proper termination of this Agreement. The foregoing
provisions shall not limit or restrict the availability of specific performance
or other injunctive relief to the extent that specific performance or such
other relief would otherwise be available to a party hereunder.

8.2 Noncompetition Agreement. In connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Purchaser agrees, for itself and its
Affiliates, that during the one-year period following termination by NICC of
the Distributor Agreement without cause, none of them will engage, in the
United States, directly or indirectly, in any business which competes with the
Company in the packaged ice cream segment (as commonly understood in the frozen

provisions of this Section 8.2 shall not restrict, prevent or prohibit the
Purchaser and its Affiliates in any manner whatsoever from engaging in any
business (including, without limitation, the packaged ice cream business and
the novelty ice cream business) that any of them were engaged in prior to the
termination of the Distributor Agreement without cause. The Company
acknowledges that as of the Effective Date, Affiliates of the Purchaser are
engaged in the packaged ice cream business and such Affiliates intend to remain
in such business. For purposes of this Section 8.2, a business will be deemed
competitive if it is a business engaged in the manufacture, delivery,
marketing, brokerage, sale or distribution of packaged ice cream. A person
will be deemed to engage in a business if that person participates in such
business as a stockholder, director, officer, employee, manufacturer's
representative, agent, independent contractor, consultant, partner or
individual proprietor, or as an investor (whether directly or beneficially);
provided, however, that nothing herein shall prohibit investment in up to five
percent of the publicly-traded securities of any corporation so long as such
investment is the sole relationship to such corporation. In the event of the
violation of any of the provisions of this Section 8.2, the Company shall be
entitled to injunctive relief prohibiting the Purchaser or any Affiliate from
commencing or continuing such actions, in addition to any other rights or
remedies Company may have.

for each county and city included. Except for geographic coverage, each such
separate agreement shall be deemed identical in terms to the agreement
contained in the preceding paragraph. If, in any judicial proceeding, a court
shall refuse to enforce any of the separate agreements deemed included in this
paragraph, then the unenforceable agreement shall be deemed eliminated to the
extent necessary to permit the remaining separate agreements to be enforced.

8.3 Further Assurances. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions contained herein, each of the parties hereto agrees, both before and
after the Closing, (i) to use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by

Refusal Agreements, (ii) to execute any documents, instruments or conveyances
of any kind which may be reasonably necessary or advisable to carry out any of

Nestle USA, Inc. and the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement") shall
survive and remain in full force and effect until the Closing, if any, at which
time it shall terminate.

8.5 Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement or any exhibit hereto is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, void or unenforceable (an "Invalidating Event"),
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement and such exhibits shall remain in full force and effect and shall in
no way be affected, impaired or invalidated; provided, however, that upon the
occurrence of an Invalidating Event, the parties shall use their best efforts
acting in good faith to amend (or cause to be amended) this Agreement, the
Collateral Agreements and the Right of First Refusal Agreements to provide to
the party who is adversely effected by the Invalidating Event the same benefits
expected to be obtained by such party prior to the occurrence of such
Invalidating Event.

8.6 Specific Enforcement. The Purchaser, on the one hand, and the
Company, on the other, acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction to

contained herein shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns, it being understood however that the
covenants set forth in (i) Sections 5.1(d), (e) and 5.2 shall not inure to the

Shares, on a Fully Diluted basis and (ii) Sections 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6 and 5.7
shall not inure to the benefit of any assignee of the Purchaser (other than
Affiliates of the Purchaser); and, except as otherwise expressly provided in
Section 6, the restrictions contained in Section 6 shall not be applicable to
any subsequent holder of the Securities or Warrant Shares (other than
Affiliates of the Purchaser) unless such transferee has agreed to be bound by

8.12 Remedies

(a) Subject to Section 8.12(c), each party agrees to
indemnify and save harmless the other party hereto and such other party's
officers, directors, employees and agents, and each Person who controls such
other party within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, from
and against any and all costs, expenses, damages, claims, actions, diminution
in value or other liabilities, including costs of investigation and defense
(collectively, "Damages") suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a
result of any breach by the indemnifying party of any of its agreements,
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement or in any
of the Collateral Agreements (except for the Distributor Agreement), other than
Damages resulting, directly or indirectly from the breach by the indemnified
party of any of its agreements, representations, warranties or covenants
contained herein or therein; and the Company agrees to indemnify and save
harmless the Purchaser and the Purchaser's officers, directors, employees and
agents, and each Person who controls the Purchaser within the meaning of the
Securities Act or Exchange Act, from and against any and all Damages suffered
or incurred by the Purchaser as a result of any legal, administrative or other
proceedings arising out of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Collateral Agreements (except for the Distributor Agreement) or the Right of
First Refusal Agreements; provided, however, that, if and to the extent that
such indemnification is unenforceable for any reason, the indemnifying party
shall make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such
indemnified liability which shall be permissible under applicable laws. For
purposes of this Agreement, "diminution in value" shall refer to the
Purchaser's and its Affiliates' proportionate share in a reduction in the net
book value of the Company, as reflected in a balance sheet prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

(b) The indemnified party under this Section 8.12 will,
promptly after the receipt of notice of the commencement of any action against
such indemnified party in respect of which indemnity may be sought from the
indemnifying party on account of an indemnity agreement contained in this
Section 8.12, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement
thereof. The omission of any indemnified party so to notify the indemnifying
party of any such action shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any
liability which it may have to such indemnified party except to the extent the
indemnifying party shall have been materially prejudiced by the omission of
such indemnified party to so notify the indemnifying party, pursuant to this
Section 8.12. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified
party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof,
the

36
<PAGE> 42
indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent
that it may wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the indemnifying
party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense
thereof, the indemnifying party will not be liable to such indemnified party
under this Section 8.12 for any legal or other expense subsequently incurred by
such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof nor for any
settlement thereof entered into without the consent of the indemnifying party;
provided, however, that (i) if the indemnifying party shall elect not to assume
the defense of such claim or action or (ii) if the indemnified party reasonably
determines (x) that there may be a conflict between the positions of the
indemnifying party and of the indemnified party in defending such claim or
action or (y) that there may be legal defenses available to such indemnified
party different from or in addition to those available to the indemnifying
party, then separate counsel for the indemnified party shall be entitled to
participate in and conduct the defense, in the case of (i) and (ii)(x), or such
different defenses, in the case of (ii)(y), and the indemnifying party shall be
liable for any reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by the indemnified
party in connection with such defense(s);

(c) The Company shall not be liable to the Purchaser for
any Damages relating to diminution in value until the aggregate amount
otherwise due the Purchaser pursuant to this Section 8.12 exceeds an
accumulated total of $5,000,000, at which time the Company shall be liable for
all Damages relating to diminution in value, from the first dollar of such
Damages; and

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement or the Exhibits or Schedules hereto, the Company hereby agrees to
indemnify the Purchaser for any Damages suffered or incurred by the Purchaser
as a result of (i) any breach of the terms, conditions or provisions of the
agreements set forth on Schedule 2.11, (ii) any failure of the Employee Plans
set forth on Schedule 2.15(a) to be maintained and administered in compliance
with all applicable law, including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code and
(iii) any failure of the Employee Plans set forth on Schedule 2.15(a) to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code; provided, however, that any Damages
attributable to "diminution in value" resulting from any of the events
described in clauses (i) - (iii) above shall be subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 8.12(c).

8.13 Special Payment and Indemnity. If the Company becomes
obligated to pay to Ben & Jerry's the Termination Payment by reason of any of
the provisions of the Ben & Jerry's Amendments, and the Purchaser is in
compliance with the provisions of Section 6.1(d) and proviso (B) to Section
6.1, to the extent then applicable, then:

(a) Simultaneous with the making of the Termination
Payment, the Company shall pay to the Purchaser an amount equal to the product
of (I) the Termination Payment and (II) the quotient of (1) the number of the
Common Shares Beneficially Owned by the Purchaser at the time the Termination
Payment is made and (2) all of the then outstanding Common Shares;

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, including, without limitation, Section 8.12(c), the Company shall
indemnify the Purchaser against, and hold

37
<PAGE> 43
it harmless from, any and all Damages which may be asserted against the
Purchaser, or by which the Purchaser may suffer or incur, by reason of the
Company's payment of the Termination Payment, and/or the fact that Purchaser's
full exercise of all of its rights under this Agreement, the Collateral
Agreements and the Right of First Refusal Agreements may have contributed to
the Company's obligation to make the Termination Payment, and/or the
Purchaser's knowledge of the effects of such exercise of rights by reason of
the provisions of the Ben & Jerry's Amendments; and

(c) The provisions of Section 8.13(a) shall not be
applicable if the Company becomes obligated to make the Termination Payment by
reason of (i) an acquisition by any Person (including the Purchaser) of all or
substantially all of the Company's assets or all Common Shares or (ii) the
occurrence of any of the events described in clauses (b) and (c) of Section
1(ii) of the Ben & Jerry's Amendments, but only if the "Significant Competitor"
(as defined in the Ben & Jerry's Amendments) referred to in such clauses is a
Person other than the Purchaser and/or its Affiliates.

8.14 Survival of Representations and Warranties. All
representations and warranties contained herein or made in writing by any party
in connection herewith shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the issuance and delivery of the Securities and Warrant Shares
until the third anniversary of the Closing Date (or until final resolution of
any claim or action arising from the breach of any such representation and
warranty, if notice of such breach was given prior to the third anniversary of
the Closing Date), regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any
party.

8.15 Transfer of Securities and Warrant Shares. The Purchaser
understands and agrees that the Securities and Warrant Shares have not been
registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws of any state and
that they may be sold or otherwise disposed of only in one or more transactions
registered under the Securities Act and, where applicable, such laws or
transactions as to which an exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act and, where applicable, such laws are available. The Purchaser
acknowledges that, except as provided in the Registration Rights Agreement, the
Purchaser has no right to require the Company to register the Securities and
Warrant Shares. The Purchaser understands and agrees that each certificate
representing the Securities and Warrant Shares shall bear the following
legends:

"THE TRANSFER OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS
CERTIFICATE IS RESTRICTED BY AN AGREEMENT ON FILE AT THE
OFFICES OF THE CORPORATION."

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR THE SECURITIES
LAWS OF ANY STATE AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF
EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER
SUCH ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR AN APPLICABLE
EXEMPTION TO

38
<PAGE> 44
THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH ACT OR SUCH LAWS."

8.16 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.

8.17 Publicity. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will
make no statement regarding the transactions contemplated hereby which is
inconsistent with the press releases agreed to by the parties hereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto may, in documents
required to be filed by it with the Commission or other regulatory bodies, make
such statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as each

THIS WARRANT AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is dated as of May
___, 1994 and entered into by and between DREYER'S GRAND ICE CREAM, INC., a
Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and NESTLE HOLDINGS, INC., a Delaware
corporation ("Nestle"). Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise
defined shall have the meaning assigned such terms in the Purchase Agreement
(as defined below).

WHEREAS, the Company proposes to issue to Nestle, or its
designee, Common Stock Purchase Warrants, in Series A and Series B, as
hereinafter described (the "Warrants"), to purchase up to an aggregate of
2,000,000 shares (1,000,000 shares for each of Series A and Series B) of Common
Stock, $1.00 par value (the "Common Stock"), of the Company (the Common Stock
issuable on exercise of the Warrants being referred to herein as the "Warrant
Shares"), pursuant to a Stock and Warrant Purchase Agreement of even date
herewith (the "Purchase Agreement").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

SECTION 1. Warrant Certificates. The certificates evidencing
the Warrants (the "Warrant Certificates") to be delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall be in registered form only and shall be substantially in the
form set forth in Exhibits A and B attached hereto.

SECTION 2. Execution of Warrant Certificates. Warrant
Certificates shall be signed on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the
Board or its President or a Vice President and by its Secretary or an Assistant
Secretary under its corporate seal. Each such signature upon the Warrant
Certificates may be in the form of a facsimile signature of the present or any
future Chairman of the Board, President, Vice President, Secretary or Assistant
Secretary and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the Warrant
Certificates and for that purpose the Company may adopt and use the facsimile
signature of any person who shall have been Chairman of the Board, President,
Vice President, Secretary or Assistant Secretary, notwithstanding the fact that
at the time the Warrant Certificates shall be delivered or disposed of he shall
have ceased to hold such office. The seal of the Company may be in the form of
a facsimile thereof and may be impressed, affixed, imprinted or otherwise
reproduced on the Warrant Certificates.

In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any
of the Warrant Certificates shall cease to be such officer before the Warrant
Certificates so signed shall have been disposed of by the Company, such Warrant
Certificates nevertheless may be delivered or disposed of as though such person
had not ceased to be such officer of the Company; and any Warrant Certificate
may be signed on behalf of the Company by any person who, at the actual date of
the execution of such Warrant Certificate, shall be a proper officer of the
Company to sign such Warrant Certificate, although at the date of the execution
of this Warrant Agreement any such person was not such officer.

SECTION 3. Registration. The Company shall number and
register the Warrant Certificates in a register as they are issued.

1
<PAGE> 50
SECTION 4. Registration of Transfers and Exchanges. The
Company shall from time to time register the transfer of any outstanding
Warrant Certificates in a Warrant register to be maintained by the Company upon
surrender of such Warrant Certificates accompanied by a written instrument or
instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by
the registered holder or holders thereof or by the duly appointed legal
representative thereof or by a duly authorized attorney. Upon any such
registration of transfer, a new Warrant Certificate shall be issued to the
transferee(s) and the surrendered Warrant Certificate shall be cancelled and
disposed of by the Company.

The Warrant holders agree that each certificate representing
Warrant Shares will bear the following legend:

"THE TRANSFER OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS
CERTIFICATE IS RESTRICTED BY AN AGREEMENT ON FILE AT THE
OFFICES OF THE CORPORATION."

"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 OR THE SECURITIES
LAWS OF ANY STATE AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF
EXCEPT PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER
SUCH ACT AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS OR AN APPLICABLE
EXEMPTION TO THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF SUCH ACT OR SUCH
LAWS."

Warrant Certificates may be exchanged at the option of the
holder(s) thereof, when surrendered to the Company at its office for another
Warrant Certificate or other Warrant Certificates of like tenor and
representing in the aggregate a like number of Warrants. Warrant Certificates
surrendered for exchange shall be cancelled and disposed of by the Company.

SECTION 5. Warrants; Exercise of Warrants. Subject to the
terms of this Agreement, each holder of Series A Warrants shall have the right,
which may be exercised commencing at the opening of business on ___________,
1994 [Closing Date under Purchase Agreement] and until 5:00 p.m., Los Angeles
time on ___________, 1997 [third anniversary of Closing Date], to receive from
the Company the number of fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Shares which the
holder may at the time be entitled to receive on exercise of such Warrants and
payment to the Company of the Exercise Price (as defined below) then in effect
for such Warrant Shares. Each Series A Warrant not exercised prior to 5:00
p.m., Los Angeles time, on ___________, 1997 [third anniversary of Closing
Date] shall become void and all rights thereunder and all rights in respect
thereof under this Agreement shall cease as of such time.

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each holder of Series
B Warrants shall have the right, which may be exercised commencing at the
opening of business on __________, 1994 [Closing Date under Purchase Agreement]
and until 5:00 p.m., Los Angeles time on ___________, 1999 [fifth anniversary
of Closing Date], to receive from the Company the number of fully paid and
nonassessable Warrant Shares which the holder may at the time be

2
<PAGE> 51
entitled to receive on exercise of such Warrants and payment of the Exercise
Price then in effect for such Warrant Shares. Each Series B Warrant not
exercised prior to 5:00 p.m., Los Angeles time, on ___________, 1999 [fifth
anniversary of Closing Date] shall become void and all rights thereunder and
all rights in respect thereof under this Agreement shall cease as of such time.

In addition, the Company shall have the right, upon 10
business days' prior written notice, to cause the holder of any Warrants to
exercise such Warrants: (i) at any time prior to ___________, 1997 [third
anniversary of Closing Date], at an Exercise Price that is equal to $24.00 per
share (subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 10), or (ii) with respect to
the Series A Warrants, at any time during the three-year term of such Warrants,
and with respect to the Series B Warrants, at any time during the five-year
term of such Warrants, at the Exercise Price then in effect for such Warrant
Shares, if the average of the Quoted Prices (as defined in Section 10(f)) of
the Common Stock for the 130 trading days preceding the date of such
requirement shall equal or exceed $60.00 per share (provided that such $60.00
per share figure shall be subject to equitable adjustment to reflect stock
splits, stock dividends, or reclassifications or other similar
recapitalizations).

If the requirements of the HSR Act must be complied with in
order for Nestle to consummate the purchase of the Warrant Shares contemplated
by this Section 5, then (A) as soon as practicable, the Company and Nestle
shall make all filings required under the HSR Act and (B) consummation of the
exercise of the subject Warrants shall occur only after the applicable waiting
period, including any extension thereof, under the HSR Act shall have expired
or been terminated and neither the Department of Justice nor the Federal Trade
Commission shall have instituted any litigation to enjoin or delay the
consummation of such exercise.

Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, the Company shall
have no right to cause any exercise of the Warrants:

(a) pursuant to clause (i) of the second preceding
paragraph during such time as any GECC Event of Default is outstanding (without
regard to whether notice or passage of time has occurred and whether or not
such GECC Event of Default has been waived), unless Nestle waives in writing
the provisions of this clause (a), or

(b) pursuant to either clause (i) or clause (ii) of the
second preceding paragraph, after the delivery by Nestle Ice Cream Company
("NICC") to the Company of an irrevocable notice of termination under the
Distributor Agreement, whether or not cause exists for such notice and whether
or not the Company has breached any of its obligations under such Distributor
Agreement.

In the event that the Company elects to cause any exercise of the Warrants
pursuant to either clause (i) or clause (ii) of the foregoing paragraph during
such period as NICC is making a claim in good faith that the Company is in
breach of one or more of its commitments under the Distributor Agreement, then
Nestle shall be entitled to offset the aggregate Exercise Price due the Company
with respect to such exercise against the amounts owed by the Company to NICC
for (1) products purchased or (2) pursuant to the indemnification provisions of
Section 5(e) under the Distributor Agreement as of the date of such exercise,
if any.

3
<PAGE> 52
A Warrant may be exercised upon surrender to the Company at
its office designated for such purpose (the address of which is set forth in
Section 13 hereof) of the certificate or certificates evidencing the Warrants
to be exercised with the form of election to purchase on the reverse thereof
duly filled in and signed, which signature shall be guaranteed by a bank or
trust company having an office or correspondent in the United States or a
broker or dealer which is a member of a registered securities exchange or the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and upon payment to the
Company of the exercise price per share of Common Stock (the "Exercise Price")
which is set forth in the form of Warrant Certificate attached hereto as
Exhibit A or B, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 10, for the number of
Warrant Shares in respect of which such Warrants are then exercised. Payment
of the aggregate Exercise Price shall be made in cash or by certified or
official bank check payable to the order of the Company.

Subject to the provisions of Section 6 hereof, upon such
surrender of Warrants and payment of the Exercise Price the Company shall issue
and cause to be delivered with all reasonable dispatch to or upon the written
order of the holder and in such name or names as the Warrant holder may
designate, a certificate or certificates for the number of full Warrant Shares
issuable upon the exercise of such Warrants together with cash as provided in
Section 11; provided, however, that if an agreement for a consolidation, merger
or lease or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company shall
have been entered into or approved of by the Company's Board of Directors, or a
tender offer or an exchange offer for shares of Common Stock of the Company
shall have been made, upon such surrender of Warrants and payment of the
Exercise Price as aforesaid, the Company shall, as soon as possible, but in any
event not later than two business days thereafter, issue and cause to be
delivered the full number of Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of such
Warrants in the manner described in this sentence together with cash as
provided in Section 11. Such certificate or certificates shall be deemed to
have been issued and any person so designated to be named therein shall be
deemed to have become a holder of record of such Warrant Shares as of the date
of the surrender of such Warrants and payment of the Exercise Price.

The Warrants shall be exercisable, at the election of the
holders thereof, either in full or from time to time in part, in minimum
increments of 100,000 shares, and, in the event that a certificate evidencing
Warrants is exercised in respect of fewer than all of the Warrant Shares
issuable on such exercise at any time prior to the date of expiration of the
Warrants, a new certificate evidencing the remaining Warrant or Warrants will
be issued and delivered pursuant to the provisions of this Section and of
Section 2 hereof.

All Warrant Certificates surrendered upon exercise of Warrants
shall be cancelled and disposed of by the Company. The Company shall keep
copies of this Agreement and any notices given or received hereunder available
for inspection by the holders during normal business hours at its office.

SECTION 6. Payment of Taxes. The Company will pay all
documentary stamp taxes attributable to the initial issuance of Warrant Shares
upon the exercise of Warrants; provided, however, that the Company shall not be
required to pay any tax or taxes which may be payable in respect of any
transfer involved in the issue of any Warrant Certificates or any

4
<PAGE> 53
certificates for Warrant Shares in a name other than that of the registered
holder of a Warrant Certificate surrendered upon the exercise of a Warrant, and
the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such Warrant Certificates
unless or until the person or persons requesting the issuance thereof shall
have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to
the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid.

SECTION 7. Mutilated or Missing Warrant Certificates. In
case any of the Warrant Certificates shall be mutilated, lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Company may in its discretion issue, in exchange and
substitution for and upon cancellation of the mutilated Warrant Certificate, or
in lieu of and substitution for the Warrant Certificate lost, stolen or
destroyed, a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor and representing an
equivalent number of Warrants, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Company of such loss, theft or destruction of such Warrant
Certificate and indemnity, if requested, also reasonably satisfactory to it.
Applicants for such substitute Warrant Certificates shall also comply with such
other reasonable regulations and pay such other reasonable charges as the
Company may prescribe.

SECTION 8. Reservation of Warrant Shares; Rights. The
Company will at all times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive
rights, out of the aggregate of its authorized but unissued Common Stock or its
authorized and issued Common Stock held in its treasury, for the purpose of
enabling it to satisfy any obligation to issue Warrant Shares upon exercise of
Warrants, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock which may then be
deliverable upon the exercise of all outstanding Warrants.

The Company shall issue, together with each Warrant Share
issued upon exercise of a Warrant, one Right (or other securities in lieu
thereof), and any rights issued to holders of Common Stock in addition thereto
or in replacement therefor, whether or not such rights shall be exercisable at
such time, but only if such rights are issued and outstanding and held by other
holders of Common Stock at such time and have not expired.

The Company or, if appointed, the transfer agent for the
Common Stock (the "Transfer Agent") and every subsequent transfer agent for any
shares of the Company's capital stock issuable upon the exercise of any of the
rights of purchase aforesaid will be irrevocably authorized and directed at all
times to reserve such number of authorized shares as shall be required for such
purpose. The Company will keep a copy of this Agreement on file with the
Transfer Agent and with every subsequent transfer agent for any shares of the
Company's capital stock issuable upon the exercise of the rights of purchase
represented by the Warrants. The Company will furnish such Transfer Agent a
copy of all notices of adjustments and certificates related thereto,
transmitted to each holder pursuant to Section 12 hereof.

Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment
pursuant to Section 10 hereof to reduce the Exercise Price below the then par
value (if any) of the Warrant Shares, the Company will take any corporate
action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the
Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Warrant
Shares at the Exercise Price as so adjusted.

5
<PAGE> 54
The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares which may be
issued upon exercise of Warrants will, upon issue, be fully paid,
nonassessable, free of preemptive rights and free from all taxes, liens,
charges and security interests with respect to the issue thereof.

SECTION 9. Obtaining Stock Exchange Listings. The Company
will from time to time take all action which may be necessary so that the
Warrant Shares, immediately upon their issuance upon the exercise of Warrants,
will be listed on the principal securities exchanges and markets within the
United States of America, if any, on which other shares of Common Stock are
then listed.

SECTION 10. Adjustment of Exercise Price and Number of
Warrant Shares Issuable. The Exercise Price and the number of Warrant Shares
issuable upon the exercise of each Warrant are subject to adjustment from time
to time upon the occurrence of the events enumerated in this Section 10. For
purposes of this Section 10, "Common Stock" means shares now or hereafter
authorized of any class of common stock of the Company and any other stock of
the Company, however designated, that has the right (subject to any prior
rights of any class or series of preferred stock) to participate in any
distribution of the assets or earnings of the Company without limit as to per
share amount.

(a) Adjustment for Change in Capital Stock.

If the Company:

(1) pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its Common
Stock in shares of its Common Stock;

(2) subdivides its outstanding shares of Common Stock
into a greater number of shares;

(3) combines its outstanding shares of Common Stock into
a smaller number of shares;

(4) makes a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of
its capital stock other than Common Stock or
preferred stock; or

(5) issues by reclassification of its Common Stock any
shares of its capital stock;

then the Exercise Price shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:

O
E' = E x ---
A

6
<PAGE> 55
Where:

E' = the adjusted Exercise Price

E = the current Exercise Price

O = the number of shares outstanding prior to such action

A = the number of shares outstanding immediately after such action

In the case of a dividend or distribution the adjustment shall
become effective immediately after the record date for determination of holders
of shares of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividend or distribution,
and in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification, the
adjustment shall become effective immediately after the effective date of such
corporate action.

If after an adjustment a holder of a Warrant upon exercise of
it may receive shares of two or more classes of capital stock of the Company,
the Company shall determine the allocation of the adjusted Exercise Price
between the classes of capital stock. After such allocation, the exercise
privilege and the Exercise Price of each class of capital stock shall
thereafter be subject to adjustment on terms comparable to those applicable to
Common Stock in this Section.

Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event
listed above shall occur.

(b) Adjustment for Rights Issue.

If the Company distributes any rights, options or warrants to
all holders of its Common Stock entitling them at any time after the record
date mentioned below to purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share
less than the current market price per share on that record date, the Exercise
Price shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:

N x P
O + -----
M
E'=E x -------
O + N

7
<PAGE> 56
where:

E' = the adjusted Exercise Price.

E = the current Exercise Price.

O = the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record
date.

N = the number of additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the rights, options or warrants offered.

P = the exercise price per share of the additional shares issuable
upon exercise of the rights, options or warrants.

M = the current market price per share of Common Stock on the
record date.

The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such
rights, options or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately
after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive
the rights, options or warrants. If at the end of the period during which such
rights, options or warrants are exercisable, not all rights, options or
warrants shall have been exercised, the Exercise Price shall be immediately
readjusted to what it would have been if "N" in the above formula had been the
number of shares actually issued.

(c) Adjustment for Other Distributions.

If the Company distributes to all holders of its Common Stock
any of its assets (including, but not limited to, cash), debt securities,
preferred stock, or any rights or warrants to purchase debt securities,
preferred stock, assets or other securities of the Company, the Exercise Price
shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:

M - F
E' = E x -------
M

where:

E' = the adjusted Exercise Price.

E = the current Exercise Price.

M = the current market price per share of Common Stock on the
record date mentioned below.

8
<PAGE> 57
F = the fair market value on the record date of the assets,
securities, rights or warrants applicable to one share of
Common Stock. The Board of Directors shall determine the fair
market value.

The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such
distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record
date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the
distribution.

This subsection does not apply to rights, options or warrants
referred to in subsection (b) of this Section 10, nor does it apply to
distributions by the Company of regular quarterly cash dividends to all holders
of its Common Stock to the extent such dividends do not exceed an aggregate
amount (when added to prior regular quarterly cash dividends distributed on or
since December 27, 1992) equal to 40% of the Company's cumulative net income
(or net loss), determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles (but excluding after- tax gains from sales of material assets),
during the period (treated as one accounting period) commencing on December 27,
1992 and ending on the date any such dividend is paid.

(d) Adjustment for Common Stock Issue.

If the Company issues shares of Common Stock for a
consideration per share less than the current market price per share on the
date the Company fixes the offering price of such additional shares, the
Exercise Price shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:

P
O + ---
M
E' = E x --------
A
where:

E' = the adjusted Exercise Price.

E = the then current Exercise Price.

O = the number of shares outstanding immediately prior to the
issuance of such additional shares.

P = the aggregate consideration received for the issuance of such
additional shares.

M = the current market price per share on the date of issuance of
such additional shares.

9
<PAGE> 58
A = the number of shares outstanding immediately after the
issuance of such additional shares.

The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such
issuance is made, and shall become effective immediately after such issuance.

This subsection (d) does not apply to:

(1) any of the transactions described in subsections (b)
and (c) of this Section 10,

(2) the exercise of Warrants, or the conversion or
exchange of other securities convertible or exchangeable for Common
Stock,

(3) Common Stock issued to the Company's employees under
bona fide employee benefit plans adopted by the Board of Directors and
approved by the holders of Common Stock when required by law, if such
Common Stock would otherwise be covered by this subsection (d) (but
only to the extent that the aggregate number of shares excluded hereby
and issued after the date of this Warrant Agreement shall not exceed
__% of the Common Stock outstanding at the time of the adoption of
each such plan, exclusive of antidilution adjustments thereunder),

(4) Common Stock issued upon the exercise of rights or
warrants issued to the holders of Common Stock for which rights or
warrants an adjustment has been made pursuant to Section 10(b),

(5) Common Stock issued to shareholders of any person
which merges with the Company or an affiliate thereof in proportion to
their stock holdings of such person immediately prior to such merger,
upon such merger, or

(6) Common Stock issued in a bona fide public offering
pursuant to a firm commitment underwriting.

(e) Adjustment for Convertible Securities Issue.

If the Company issues any securities convertible into or
exchangeable for Common Stock (other than securities issued in transactions
described in subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 10) for a consideration
per share of Common Stock initially deliverable upon conversion or exchange of
such securities less than the current market price per share on the date of
issuance of such securities, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted in accordance
with this formula:

10
<PAGE> 59

O + P
---
M
E' = E x ------
O + D

where:

E' = the adjusted Exercise Price.

E = the then current Exercise Price.

O = the number of shares outstanding immediately prior to the
issuance of such securities.

P = the aggregate consideration received for the issuance of such
securities.

M = the current market price per share on the date of issuance of
such securities.

D = the maximum number of shares deliverable upon conversion or in
exchange for such securities at the initial conversion or
exchange rate.

The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such
issuance is made, and shall become effective immediately after such issuance.

If all of the Common Stock deliverable upon conversion or
exchange of such securities have not been issued when such securities are no
longer outstanding, then the Exercise Price shall promptly be readjusted to the
Exercise Price which would then be in effect had the adjustment upon the
issuance of such securities been made on the basis of the actual number of
shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion or exchange of such securities.

This subsection (e) does not apply to:

(1) convertible securities issued to shareholders of any
person which merges into the Company, or with a subsidiary of the
Company, in proportion to their stock holdings of such person
immediately prior to such merger, upon such merger, or

(2) convertible securities issued in a bona fide public
offering pursuant to a firm commitment underwriting.

(f) Current Market Price.

In subsections (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this Section 10, the
current market price per share of Common Stock on any date is the average of
the Quoted Prices of the Common Stock for 30 consecutive trading days
commencing 45 trading days before the date in question. The

11
<PAGE> 60
"Quoted Price" of the Common Stock is the last reported sales price of the
Common Stock as reported by Nasdaq National Market System, or if the Common
Stock is listed on a national securities exchange, the last reported sales
price of the Common Stock on such exchange (which shall be for consolidated
trading if applicable to such exchange), or if neither so reported or listed,
the last reported bid price of the Common Stock. In the absence of one or more
such quotations, the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine the
current market price on the basis of such quotations as it in good faith
considers appropriate.

(g) Consideration Received.

For purposes of any computation respecting consideration
received pursuant to subsections (d) and (e) of this Section 10, the following
shall apply:

(1) in the case of the issuance of shares of Common Stock
for cash, the consideration shall be the amount of such cash, provided
that in no case shall any deduction be made for any commissions,
discounts or other expenses incurred by the Company for any
underwriting of the issue or otherwise in connection therewith;

(2) in the case of the issuance of shares of Common Stock
for a consideration in whole or in part other than cash, the
consideration other than cash shall be deemed to be the fair market
value thereof as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors
(irrespective of the accounting treatment thereof), whose
determination shall be conclusive, and described in a Board
resolution;

(3) in the case of the issuance of securities convertible
into or exchangeable for shares, the aggregate consideration received
therefor shall be deemed to be the consideration received by the
Company for the issuance of such securities plus the additional
minimum consideration, if any, to be received by the Company upon the
conversion or exchange thereof (the consideration in each case to be
determined in the same manner as provided in clauses (1) and (2) of
this subsection).

(h) When De Minimis Adjustment May Be Deferred.

No adjustment in the Exercise Price need be made unless the
adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in the Exercise
Price. Any adjustments that are not made shall be carried forward and taken
into account in any subsequent adjustment.

All calculations under this Section shall be made to the
nearest cent or to the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be.

(i) When No Adjustment Required.

No adjustment need be made for a transaction referred to in
subsections (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) of this Section 10 if Warrant holders are
to participate in the transaction on a basis and with notice that the Board of
Directors determines to be fair and appropriate in light of the basis and
notice on which holders of Common Stock participate in the transaction.

12
<PAGE> 61
No adjustment need be made for rights to purchase Common Stock
pursuant to a Company plan for reinvestment of dividends or interest.

No adjustment need be made for a change in the par value or no
par value of the Common Stock.

To the extent the Warrants become convertible into cash, no
adjustment need be made thereafter as to the cash. Interest will not accrue on
the cash.

(j) Notice of Adjustment.

Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted, the Company shall
provide the notices required by Section 12 hereof.

(k) Voluntary Reduction.

The Company from time to time may reduce the Exercise Price by
any amount for any period of time if the period is at least 20 days and if the
reduction is irrevocable during the period; provided, however, that in no event
may the Exercise Price be less than the par value of a share of Common Stock.

Whenever the Exercise Price is reduced, the Company shall mail
to Warrant holders a notice of the reduction. The Company shall mail the
notice at least 15 days before the date the reduced Exercise Price takes
effect. The notice shall state the reduced Exercise Price and the period it
will be in effect.

A reduction of the Exercise Price does not change or adjust
the Exercise Price otherwise in effect for purposes of subsections (a), (b),
(c), (d) and (e) of this Section 10.

(l) Notice of Certain Transactions.

If:

(1) the Company takes any action that would require an
adjustment in the Exercise Price pursuant to subsections (a), (b),
(c), (d) or (e) of this Section 10 and if the Company does not arrange
for Warrant holders to participate pursuant to subsection (i) of this
Section 10;

(2) the Company takes any action that would require a
supplemental Warrant Agreement pursuant to subsection (m) of this
Section 10; or

(3) there is a liquidation or dissolution of the Company,

the Company shall mail to Warrant holders a notice stating the proposed record
date for a dividend or distribution or the proposed effective date of a
subdivision, combination, reclassification, consolidation, merger, transfer,
lease, liquidation or dissolution. The Company

13
<PAGE> 62
shall mail the notice at least 15 days before such date. Failure to mail the
notice or any defect in it shall not affect the validity of the transaction.

(m) Reorganization of Company.

If the Company consolidates or merges with or into, or
transfers or leases all or substantially all its assets to, any person, upon
consummation of such transaction the Warrants shall automatically become
exercisable for the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets which
the holder of a Warrant would have owned immediately after the consolidation,
merger, transfer or lease if the holder had exercised the Warrant immediately
before the effective date of the transaction. Concurrently with the
consummation of such transaction, the corporation formed by or surviving any
such consolidation or merger if other than the Company, or the person to which
such sale or conveyance shall have been made, shall enter into a supplemental
Warrant Agreement so providing and further providing for adjustments which
shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practical to the adjustments provided
for in this Section. The successor Company shall mail to Warrant holders a
notice describing the supplemental Warrant Agreement.

If the issuer of securities deliverable upon exercise of
Warrants under the supplemental Warrant Agreement is an affiliate of the
formed, surviving, transferee or lessee corporation, that issuer shall join in
the supplemental Warrant Agreement.

If this subsection (m) applies, subsections (a), (b), (c), (d)
and (e) of this Section 10 do not apply.

(n) Company Determination Final.

Any determination that the Company or the Board of Directors
must make pursuant to subsection (a), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) or (i) of this
Section 10 is conclusive.

(o) When Issuance or Payment May Be Deferred.

In any case in which this Section 10 shall require that an
adjustment in the Exercise Price be made effective as of a record date for a
specified event, the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such
event (i) issuing to the holder of any Warrant exercised after such record date
the Warrant Shares and other capital stock of the Company, if any, issuable
upon such exercise over and above the Warrant Shares and other capital stock of
the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the Exercise
Price and (ii) paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of a fractional
share pursuant to Section 11; provided, however, that the Company shall deliver
to such holder a due bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such
holder's right to receive such additional Warrant Shares, other capital stock
and cash upon the occurrence of the event requiring such adjustment.

14
<PAGE> 63
(p) Adjustment in Number of Shares.

Upon each adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to this
Section 10, each Warrant outstanding prior to the making of the adjustment in
the Exercise Price shall thereafter evidence the right to receive upon payment
of the adjusted Exercise Price that number of shares of Common Stock
(calculated to the nearest hundredth) obtained from the following formula:

E
N' = N x ---
E'

where:

N' = the adjusted number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise
of a Warrant by payment of the adjusted Exercise Price.

N = the number of Warrant Shares previously issuable upon exercise
of a Warrant by payment of the Exercise Price prior to
adjustment.

E' = the adjusted Exercise Price.

E = the Exercise Price prior to adjustment.

(q) Form of Warrants.

Irrespective of any adjustments in the Exercise Price or the
number or kind of shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants,
Warrants theretofore or thereafter issued may continue to express the same
price and number and kind of shares as are stated in the Warrants initially
issuable pursuant to this Agreement.

SECTION 11. Fractional Interests. The Company shall not be
required to issue fractional Warrant Shares on the exercise of Warrants. If
more than one Warrant shall be presented for exercise in full at the same time
by the same holder, the number of full Warrant Shares which shall be issuable
upon the exercise thereof shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate
number of Warrant Shares purchasable on exercise of the Warrants so presented.
If any fraction of a Warrant Share would, except for the provisions of this
Section 11, be issuable on the exercise of any Warrants (or specified portion
thereof), the Company shall pay an amount in cash equal to the current market
price (as defined in Section 10(f)) on the day immediately preceding the date
the Warrant is presented for exercise, multiplied by such fraction.

SECTION 12. Notices to Warrant holders. Upon any adjustment
of the Exercise Price pursuant to Section 10, the Company shall promptly
thereafter (i) cause to be filed with the Company a certificate of a firm of
independent public accountants of recognized standing selected by the Board of
Directors of the Company (who may be the regular auditors of the

15
<PAGE> 64
Company) setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and setting
forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts upon which
such calculations are based and setting forth the number of Warrant Shares (or
portion thereof) issuable after such adjustment in the Exercise Price, upon
exercise of a Warrant and payment of the adjusted Exercise Price, which
certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the correctness of the matters set
forth therein, and (ii) cause to be given to each of the registered holders of
the Warrant Certificates at his address appearing on the Warrant register
written notice of such adjustments by first-class mail, postage prepaid. Where
appropriate, such notice may be given in advance and included as a part of the
notice required to be mailed under the other provisions of this Section 12.

In case:

(a) the Company shall authorize the issuance to all
holders of shares of Common Stock of rights, options or warrants to
subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock or of any other
subscription rights or warrants; or

(b) the Company shall authorize the distribution to all
holders of shares of Common Stock of evidences of its indebtedness or
assets (other than cash dividends or cash distributions payable out of
consolidated earnings or earned surplus or dividends payable in shares
of Common Stock or distributions referred to in subsection (a) of
Section 10 hereof); or

(c) of any consolidation or merger to which the Company
is a party and for which approval of any shareholders of the Company
is required, or of the conveyance or transfer of the properties and
assets of the Company substantially as an entirety, or of any
reclassification or change of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
the Warrants (other than a change in par value, or from par value to
no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a result of a
subdivision or combination), or a tender offer or exchange offer made
by the Company for shares of Common Stock; or

(d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the Company; or

(e) the Company proposes to take any action (other than
actions of the character described in Section 10(a)) which would
require an adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to Section 10;

then the Company shall cause to be given to each of the registered holders of
the Warrant Certificates at his address appearing on the Warrant register, at
least 20 days (or 10 days in any case specified in clauses (a) or (b) above)
prior to the applicable record date hereinafter specified, or promptly in the
case of events for which there is no record date, by first-class mail, postage
prepaid, a written notice stating (i) the date as of which the holders of
record of shares of Common Stock to be entitled to receive any such rights,
options, warrants or distribution are to be determined, or (ii) the initial
expiration date set forth in any tender offer or exchange offer made by the
Company for shares of Common Stock, or (iii) the date on which any such
consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or
winding up is expected

16
<PAGE> 65
to become effective or consummated, and the date as of which it is expected
that holders of record of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to exchange
such shares for securities or other property, if any, deliverable upon such
reclassification, consolidation, merger, conveyance, transfer, dissolution,
liquidation or winding up. The failure to give the notice required by this
Section 12 or any defect therein shall not affect the legality or validity of
any distribution, right, option, warrant, consolidation, merger, conveyance,
transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, or the vote upon any action.

Nothing contained in this Agreement or in any of the Warrant
Certificates shall be construed as conferring upon the holders thereof the
right to vote or to consent or to receive notice as shareholders in respect of
the meetings of shareholders or the election of Directors of the Company or any
other matter, or any rights whatsoever as shareholders of the Company.

SECTION 13. Notices to Company and Warrant Holder. Any
notice or demand authorized by this Agreement to be given or made by the
registered holder of any Warrant Certificate to or on the Company shall be
sufficiently given or made when and if delivered by a recognized overnight

Section by such holder) to such holder at the address appearing on the warrant
register of the Company.

SECTION 14. Supplements and Amendments. The Company may from
time to time supplement or amend this Agreement without the approval of any
holders of Warrant Certificates in order to cure any ambiguity or to correct or
supplement any provision contained herein which may be defective or
inconsistent with any other provision herein, or to make any other provisions
in regard to matters or questions arising hereunder which the Company may deem
necessary or desirable and which shall not in any way adversely affect the
interests of the holders of Warrant Certificates.

SECTION 15. Successors. All the covenants and provisions of
this Agreement by or for the benefit of the Company shall bind and inure to the

accordance with the internal laws of said State.

SECTION 18. Benefits of This Agreement. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed to give to any person or corporation other than
the Company and the registered holders of the Warrant Certificates any legal or
equitable right, remedy or claim under this Agreement; but this Agreement shall
be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Company and the registered holders

THIS RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is
dated as of May ____, 1994 (the "Effective Date") and entered into by and
between T. GARY ROGERS ("G.Rogers"), T. GARY ROGERS as co-trustee of the Rogers

Revocable Trust dated as of December 31, 1981, as amended and restated by that
certain First Amendment by Restatement of the Trust Agreement Establishing
Rogers Revocable Trust dated as of March 19, 1991 (the "Rogers Revocable
Trust") ("G.Trustee"), KATHLEEN T. ROGERS ("K.Rogers"), and KATHLEEN T. ROGERS
as co-trustee of the Rogers Revocable Trust ("K.Trustee," and together with
G.Rogers, G.Trustee and K.Rogers, the "Seller") and NESTLE HOLDINGS, INC., a
Delaware corporation (the "Purchaser"). Capitalized terms used herein but not
otherwise defined shall have the meaning assigned such terms in the Purchase
Agreement (as defined below).

WHEREAS, the Purchaser and Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Dreyer's") have entered into a Stock and Warrant
Purchase Agreement dated as of May ____, 1994 (the "Purchase Agreement")
providing, among other things, for the purchase by the Purchaser of three
million shares of the Common Stock of Dreyer's, par value $1.00 per share (the
"Common Stock"), and warrants exercisable for two million shares of Common
Stock;

WHEREAS, the Seller currently Beneficially Owns 1,863,730
shares of Common Stock (of which 1,585,350 shares are owned of record by
G.Trustee and K.Trustee, 178,380 shares are issuable upon exercise of stock
options owned of record by G.Rogers (the "Stock Options") and 100,000 shares
are owned of record by G.Rogers and K.Rogers as co-trustees of the Four Rogers
Trust created under that certain Trust Agreement Establishing Four Rogers Trust
dated as of December 23, 1986 (the "Four Rogers Trust")) and may acquire
additional shares of Common Stock or other voting securities of Dreyer's in the
future (the shares of Common Stock and other voting securities of Dreyer's (i)
now owned by the Seller, (ii) issuable upon exercise of the Stock Options or
any other options or warrants of Dreyer's now owned by the Seller, (iii)
issuable upon conversion or exchange of any other securities of Dreyer's now
owned by the Seller or (iv) hereafter acquired by, or which become Beneficially
Owned by, the Seller or any of its Affiliates, are referred to herein as the
"Shares");

WHEREAS, a condition to the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement is that the Seller shall have granted
the Purchaser a right of first refusal with respect to the Shares; and

WHEREAS, the Purchaser and the Seller desire to provide for
such grants and to establish various rights and obligations in connection
therewith.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
mutual covenants and agreements herein set forth, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

1
<PAGE> 82
SECTION 1. Right of First Refusal.

(a) Grant of Right. In consideration of the payment of
$1,000 by the Purchaser to the Seller, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the Seller hereby grants to the Purchaser a right of first
refusal with respect to all of the Shares (the "Right of First Refusal").

(b) Exercise of Right. Subject to Sections 1(c) and (d),
if at any time the Seller receives a bona fide offer (an "Offer") from any
person or entity to purchase any or all of the Shares which the Seller wishes
to accept, the Seller shall cause the Offer to be reduced to writing and shall
notify the Purchaser in writing of its wish to accept the Offer (the "Offer
Notice"). The Offer Notice shall contain an irrevocable offer to sell such
Shares to the Purchaser at a purchase price equal to the price contained in,
and on the same terms and conditions of, the Offer and shall be accompanied by
a true copy of the Offer (which shall identify the offeror). At any time
within five business days after the date of receipt by the Purchaser of the
Offer Notice (the "Right of First Refusal Exercise Period"), the Purchaser
shall have the right to purchase all, but not less than all, the Shares covered
by the Offer at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as the
Offer by notifying the Seller in writing of its election to purchase the Shares
(the "Right of First Refusal Exercise Notice"). Upon the Seller's receipt of
the Right of First Refusal Exercise Notice, the Seller shall sell the Shares to
the Purchaser pursuant to the provisions of Section 1(e). If at the end of the
Right of First Refusal Exercise Period the Purchaser has not delivered a Right
of First Refusal Exercise Notice to the Seller, the Seller may, during the
succeeding 90-day period, sell not less than all of the Shares covered by the
Offer to the offeror at a price not less than that contained in the Offer and
on terms and conditions not less favorable in the aggregate to the Seller than
those contained in the Offer. Upon such sale, the Right of First Refusal shall
terminate with respect to the Shares so sold. If at the end of 90 days
following the expiration of the Right of First Refusal Exercise Period the
Seller has not completed the sale of the Shares covered by the Offer (or
tendered or exchanged such Shares pursuant to a tender or exchange offer) as
aforesaid, then the Seller shall not thereafter sell such Shares without again
complying with the provisions of this Section 1.

(c) Elective Sales. If at any time the Seller has a bona
fide intention to sell any of the Shares, but at such time has not received an
Offer from any person or entity to purchase such Shares, the Seller shall
provide the Purchaser with a notice (the "Elective Sale Notice") which (i)
notifies the Purchaser of such intention, (ii) sets forth the number of Shares
desired to be sold (the "Elective Shares") and (iii) irrevocably offers to sell
the Elective Shares to the Purchaser at a purchase price and on terms and
conditions set forth in such notice. At any time within five business days
after the date of receipt by the Purchaser of the Elective Sale Notice (the
"Elective Sale Exercise Period"), the Purchaser shall have the right to
purchase all, but not less than all, of the Elective Shares at the price and on
the terms and conditions set forth in the Elective Sale Notice by notifying the
Seller in writing of its election to purchase such Shares (the "Elective Sale
Exercise Notice"). Upon the Seller's receipt of the Elective Sale Exercise
Notice, the Seller shall sell the Elective Shares to the Purchaser pursuant to
the provisions of Section 1(e). If at the end of the Elective Sale Exercise
Period the Purchaser has not delivered an Elective Sale Exercise Notice to the
Seller, the Seller may, during the succeeding 90-day period, sell not less than
all of the Elective Shares at a price not less than that

2
<PAGE> 83
contained in the Elective Sale Notice and on terms and conditions not less
favorable in the aggregate to the Seller than those contained in the Elective
Sale Notice. Upon such sale, the Right of First Refusal shall terminate with
respect to the Elective Shares so sold. If at the end of 90 days following the
expiration of the Elective Sale Exercise Period the Seller has not completed
the sale of the Elective Shares as aforesaid, then the Seller shall not
thereafter sell the Elective Shares without again complying with the provisions
of this Section 1.

(d) Rule 144 Sales. If at any time the Seller has a bona
fide intention to sell any of the Shares pursuant to Rule 144 ("Rule 144") of
the Rules and Regulations issued under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Act") during the immediately succeeding 90 calendar day period (such
period being referred to as the "Qualified Period"), the Seller shall provide
the Purchaser with a notice (the "Rule 144 Notice") which (i) notifies the
Purchaser of such intention, (ii) sets forth the number of Shares desired to be
sold (the "Rule 144 Shares") and (iii) irrevocably offers to sell the Rule 144
Shares to the Purchaser at a per-share price equal to (1) the reported closing
price of the outstanding shares of Common Stock on the day preceding the date of
the Rule 144 Notice as reported by the Nasdaq National Market System, (2) if
such shares are listed on a national securities exchange, the last reported
sales price of the outstanding shares of Common Stock on such exchange (which
shall be for consolidated trading if applicable to such exchange) on the day
preceding the date of the Rule 144 Notice, or (3) if neither so reported or
listed, the last reported bid price of such shares (the "Rule 144 Purchase
Price"). At any time within five business days after the date of receipt by the
Purchaser of the Rule 144 Notice (the "Rule 144 Exercise Period"), the Purchaser
shall have the right to purchase all, but not less than all, of the Rule 144
Shares by notifying the Seller in writing of its election to purchase such
Shares (the "Rule 144 Exercise Notice"), whereupon the Purchaser shall be
unconditionally obligated (unless prohibited by applicable law) to purchase the
Rule 144 Shares. Upon the Seller's receipt of the Rule 144 Exercise Notice, the
Seller shall sell the Rule 144 Shares to the Purchaser pursuant to the
provisions of Section 1(e). If at the end of the Rule 144 Exercise Period the
Purchaser has not delivered a Rule 144 Exercise Notice to the Seller, then the
Seller may, during the Qualified Period, sell any or all of the Rule 144 Shares
pursuant to Rule 144 at a per-share price not less than 97.5% of the Rule 144
Purchase Price. Such sale shall be otherwise without restriction and shall not
require further notice to the Purchaser. Upon such sale, the Right of First
Refusal shall terminate with respect to the Rule 144 Shares so sold. If at the
end of the Qualified Period the Seller has not sold all of the Rule 144 Shares
as aforesaid, then the Seller shall not thereafter sell such unsold Shares
without again complying with the provisions of this Section 1.

(e) Closing. If the Purchaser exercises its Right of
First Refusal with respect to any Shares, then the closing of the purchase of
the subject Shares shall take place at the principal office of ______________
on the later of (i) the 10th business day following the receipt by the Seller
of the Right of First Refusal Exercise Notice or Elective Sale Exercise Notice
or Rule 144 Exercise Notice, as the case may be, or (ii) if applicable, the
closing date provided for in the Offer Notice or Elective Sale Notice, as the
case may be; provided, however, that if any of the Shares to be acquired by the
Purchaser would result in the Purchaser holding "Excess Shares" under Section
6.1(d) of the Purchase Agreement, then the closing of the purchase of those
Shares shall occur, at the Purchaser's sole and absolute discretion, no later
than 90 calendar days following the receipt by the Seller of the Right of First
Refusal Exercise Notice or Elective Sale Exercise Notice or Rule 144 Exercise

Refusal Exercise Notice or Elective Sale Exercise Notice or Rule 144 Exercise
Notice, as the case may be, the requirements of the HSR Act must be complied

Seller) against delivery of certificates or other instruments representing the

whatsoever (collectively, the "Encumbrances").

bank or other financial institution to which such pledge is made agrees in

the Purchaser's Right of First Refusal and shall be conducted in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and (iii) any Pledged Shares may be sold to
the Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Agreement without the bank's or
other financial institution's prior consent, and once so sold, such Shares
shall be free and clear of any and all claims or liens of such bank or other
financial institution.

owned by the Seller, (ii) issuable upon exercise of the Stock Options or any
other options or warrants of Dreyer's now owned by the Seller, (iii) issuable
upon conversion or exchange of any other securities of Dreyer's now owned by

WHEREAS, a condition to the closing of the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement is that the Seller shall have granted
the Purchaser a right of first refusal with respect to the Shares; and

1
<PAGE> 98
WHEREAS, the Purchaser and the Seller desire to provide for
such grants and to establish various rights and obligations in connection
therewith.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the
mutual covenants and agreements herein set forth, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

SECTION 1. Right of First Refusal.

(a) Grant of Right. In consideration of the payment of
$1,000 by the Purchaser to the Seller, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the Seller hereby grants to the Purchaser a right of first
refusal with respect to all of the Shares (the "Right of First Refusal").

(b) Exercise of Right. Subject to Sections 1(c) and (d),
if at any time the Seller receives a bona fide offer (an "Offer") from any
person or entity to purchase any or all of the Shares which the Seller wishes
to accept, the Seller shall cause the Offer to be reduced to writing and shall
notify the Purchaser in writing of its wish to accept the Offer (the "Offer
Notice"). The Offer Notice shall contain an irrevocable offer to sell such
Shares to the Purchaser at a purchase price equal to the price contained in,
and on the same terms and conditions of, the Offer and shall be accompanied by
a true copy of the Offer (which shall identify the offeror). At any time
within five business days after the date of receipt by the Purchaser of the
Offer Notice (the "Right of First Refusal Exercise Period"), the Purchaser
shall have the right to purchase all, but not less than all, the Shares covered
by the Offer at the same price and on the same terms and conditions as the
Offer by notifying the Seller in writing of its election to purchase the Shares
(the "Right of First Refusal Exercise Notice"). Upon the Seller's receipt of
the Right of First Refusal Exercise Notice, the Seller shall sell the Shares to
the Purchaser pursuant to the provisions of Section 1(e). If at the end of the
Right of First Refusal Exercise Period the Purchaser has not delivered a Right
of First Refusal Exercise Notice to the Seller, the Seller may, during the
succeeding 90-day period, sell not less than all of the Shares covered by the
Offer to the offeror at a price not less than that contained in the Offer and
on terms and conditions not less favorable in the aggregate to the Seller than
those contained in the Offer. Upon such sale, the Right of First Refusal shall
terminate with respect to the Shares so sold. If at the end of 90 days
following the expiration of the Right of First Refusal Exercise Period the
Seller has not completed the sale of the Shares covered by the Offer (or
tendered or exchanged such Shares pursuant to a tender or exchange offer) as
aforesaid, then the Seller shall not thereafter sell such Shares without again
complying with the provisions of this Section 1.

(c) Elective Sales. If at any time the Seller has a bona
fide intention to sell any of the Shares, but at such time has not received an
Offer from any person or entity to purchase such Shares, the Seller shall
provide the Purchaser with a notice (the "Elective Sale Notice") which (i)
notifies the Purchaser of such intention, (ii) sets forth the number of Shares
desired to be sold (the "Elective Shares") and (iii) irrevocably offers to sell
the Elective Shares to the Purchaser at a purchase price and on terms and
conditions set forth in such notice. At any time within five business days
after the date of receipt by the Purchaser of the Elective Sale Notice (the
"Elective Sale Exercise Period"), the Purchaser shall have the right to
purchase all, but not less than all, of the Elective Shares at the price and on
the terms and conditions set forth

2
<PAGE> 99
in the Elective Sale Notice by notifying the Seller in writing of its election
to purchase such Shares (the "Elective Sale Exercise Notice"). Upon the
Seller's receipt of the Elective Sale Exercise Notice, the Seller shall sell
the Elective Shares to the Purchaser pursuant to the provisions of Section
1(e). If at the end of the Elective Sale Exercise Period the Purchaser has not
delivered an Elective Sale Exercise Notice to the Seller, the Seller may,
during the succeeding 90-day period, sell not less than all of the Elective
Shares at a price not less than that contained in the Elective Sale Notice and
on terms and conditions not less favorable in the aggregate to the Seller than
those contained in the Elective Sale Notice. Upon such sale, the Right of
First Refusal shall terminate with respect to the Elective Shares so sold. If
at the end of 90 days following the expiration of the Elective Sale Exercise
Period the Seller has not completed the sale of the Elective Shares as
aforesaid, then the Seller shall not thereafter sell the Elective Shares
without again complying with the provisions of this Section 1.

(d) Rule 144 Sales. If at any time the Seller has a bona
fide intention to sell any of the Shares pursuant to Rule 144 ("Rule 144") of
the Rules and Regulations issued under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Act") during the immediately succeeding 90 calendar day period (such
period being referred to as the "Qualified Period"), the Seller shall provide
the Purchaser with a notice (the "Rule 144 Notice") which (i) notifies the
Purchaser of such intention, (ii) sets forth the number of Shares desired to be
sold (the "Rule 144 Shares") and (iii) irrevocably offers to sell the Rule 144
Shares to the Purchaser at a per-share price equal to (1) the reported closing
price of the outstanding shares of Common Stock on the day preceding the date
of the Rule 144 Notice as reported by the Nasdaq National Market System, (2) if
such shares are listed on a national securities exchange, the last reported
sales price of the outstanding shares of Common Stock on such exchange (which
shall be for consolidated trading if applicable to such exchange) on the day
preceding the date of the Rule 144 Notice, or (3) if neither so reported or
listed, the last reported bid price of such shares (the "Rule 144 Purchase
Price"). At any time within five business days after the date of receipt by
the Purchaser of the Rule 144 Notice (the "Rule 144 Exercise Period"), the
Purchaser shall have the right to purchase all, but not less than all, of the
Rule 144 Shares by notifying the Seller in writing of its election to purchase
such Shares (the "Rule 144 Exercise Notice"), whereupon the Purchaser shall be
unconditionally obligated (unless prohibited by applicable law) to purchase the
Rule 144 Shares. Upon the Seller's receipt of the Rule 144 Exercise Notice,
the Seller shall sell the Rule 144 Shares to the Purchaser pursuant to the
provisions of Section 1(e). If at the end of the Rule 144 Exercise Period the
Purchaser has not delivered a Rule 144 Exercise Notice to the Seller, then the
Seller may, during the Qualified Period, sell any or all of the Rule 144 Shares
pursuant to Rule 144 at a per-share price not less than 97.5% of the Rule 144
Purchase Price. Such sale shall be otherwise without restriction and shall not
require further notice to the Purchaser. Upon such sale, the Right of First
Refusal shall terminate with respect to the Rule 144 Shares so sold. If at the
end of the Qualified Period the Seller has not sold all of the Rule 144 Shares
as aforesaid, then the Seller shall not thereafter sell such unsold Shares
without again complying with the provisions of this Section 1.

(e) Closing. If the Purchaser exercises its Right of
First Refusal with respect to any Shares, then the closing of the purchase of
the subject Shares shall take place at the principal office of ______________
on the later of (i) the 10th business day following the receipt by the Seller
of the Right of First Refusal Exercise Notice or Elective Sale Exercise Notice
or Rule 144 Exercise Notice, as the case may be, or (ii) if applicable, the
closing date provided for

3
<PAGE> 100
in the Offer Notice or Elective Sale Notice, as the case may be; provided,
however, that if any of the Shares to be acquired by the Purchaser would result
in the Purchaser holding "Excess Shares" under Section 6.1(d) of the Purchase
Agreement, then the closing of the purchase of those Shares shall occur, at the
Purchaser's sole and absolute discretion, no later than 90 calendar days
following the receipt by the Seller of the Right of First Refusal Exercise
Notice or Elective Sale Exercise Notice or Rule 144 Exercise Notice, as the
case may be; provided, further, however, that if at the time the Seller
receives the Right of First Refusal Exercise Notice or Elective Sale Exercise
Notice or Rule 144 Exercise Notice, as the case may be, the requirements of the
HSR Act must be complied with in order for the Purchaser to consummate the
purchase of the Shares contemplated by such notice, then (A) as soon as
practicable, the Seller shall cause Dreyer's to make all filings required under
the HSR Act and the Purchaser shall make all filings required under the HSR Act
and (B) the closing of the purchase of the subject Shares shall occur only
after the applicable waiting period, including any extension thereof, under the
HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated and neither the Department of
Justice nor the Federal Trade Commission shall have instituted any litigation
to enjoin or delay the consummation of such purchase. The payment of the
appropriate purchase price shall be paid by delivery to the Seller (or Seller's
bank or other financial institution if so directed by the Seller) of a
certified check payable to the Seller (or Seller's bank or other financial
institution if so directed by the Seller) against delivery of certificates or
other instruments representing the Shares, appropriately endorsed or executed
by the Seller, together with such instruments of transfer and conveyance,
satisfactory in form and substance to the Purchaser, sufficient to vest the
Purchaser with good and marketable title, free and clear of any and all liens,
charges, encumbrances, covenants, conditions, restrictions, voting trust
arrangements, adverse claims or rights whatsoever (collectively, the
"Encumbrances").

SECTION 2. Transfers of Shares.

(a) Restrictions. The Seller agrees that it shall not,
directly or indirectly, offer, sell, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of
(or make any exchange, gift, assignment or pledge of) (collectively,
"Transfer") any of the Shares except as provided in Section 1 and this Section
2.

(b) Exceptions to Restrictions.

The provisions of Section 2(a) shall not apply to a Transfer,
if such Transfer is made without consideration (except for Section 2(b)(vi)),
by the Seller to:

(i) any lineal descendant of W.Cronk and J.Cronk
or any spouse of such lineal descendant;

(ii) a trust for the sole benefit of W.Cronk and
J.Cronk and/or one or more of W.Cronk's and J.Cronk's family members;

or J.Cronk if W.Cronk or J.Cronk is adjudged disabled or incompetent by a court
of competent jurisdiction, acting in his or her capacity as such; or

(vi) a bank or other financial institution, if
such Transfer is solely in the form of a pledge to secure bona fide
indebtedness of the Seller to such bank or other financial institution.

Provided, however, that none of the foregoing Transfers shall
be permitted unless:

(1) Such Transfer complies with all applicable
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended;

(2) Prior to such Transfer, the Seller shall have
caused the transferee to execute an agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Purchaser, providing that such transferee shall fully
comply with the terms of this Agreement;

(3) The Transferred Shares shall remain subject
to the Purchaser's Right of First Refusal and to this Section 2; and

(4) With respect to a Transfer to a bank or other
financial institution in the form of a pledge pursuant to Section 2(b)(vi), the
bank or other financial institution to which such pledge is made agrees in
writing that (i) the Purchaser's Right of First Refusal with respect to the
Shares so pledged (the "Pledged Shares") is senior to any security interest or
lien of such bank or financial institution created by such pledge, (ii) any
sale of the Pledged Shares by such bank or financial institution is subject to
the Purchaser's Right of First Refusal and shall be conducted in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and (iii) any Pledged Shares may be sold to
the Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Agreement without the bank's or
other financial institution's prior consent, and once so sold, such Shares
shall be free and clear of any and all claims or liens of such bank or other
financial institution.

RECITALS

WHEREAS, Company manufactures, sells and distributes certain ice cream
and frozen novelty products and is desirous of having Distributor develop a
demand for and sell certain of Company's products by purchasing such products
from Company at wholesale and selling such products to retailers within certain
prescribed territories and markets; and

WHEREAS, Distributor is a manufacturer and distributor of ice cream and
other food products and possesses the ability to act as a wholesale distributor
of Company's products, and desires in such capacity to promote the sale and
distribution of certain products manufactured by Company in the prescribed
territories and markets; and

WHEREAS, an affiliate of Company and Distributor have entered into the
following agreements, all of even date herewith: (i) Stock and Warrant Purchase
Agreement; (ii) Warrant Agreement, and (iii) Registration Rights Agreement
(collectively, the "Stock Agreements");

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and conditions
contained herein and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto mutually agree 
as follows:

1. APPOINTMENT

a. Company hereby appoints Distributor as (i) an exclusive wholesale
distributor of those branded products of Company set forth in Exhibit A hereto
(the "Nestle Products") in and for the market areas and geographical areas
listed in Exhibit B-1 and B-2 hereto which are denoted as exclusive (the
"Exclusive Territories"), and (ii) a 

1
<PAGE> 112
non-exclusive wholesale distributor of the Nestle Products in and for
the market areas and geographical areas which are listed in Exhibit B-1 and B-3
hereto which are denoted as non-exclusive (the "Non-Exclusive Territories"),
and Distributor hereby accepts such appointments. The Exclusive Territories and
Non-Exclusive Territories are hereinafter sometimes referred to as the
"Territories". Distributor shall sell Nestle Products only to retailers
located within each market area or geographical area in the Territories which
are part of the approved channels of distribution identified in Exhibit B
hereto for each such market area or geographical area, and shall distribute
such Nestle Products only to such customers' facilities located within the
Territories. Distributor's rights as a distributor of Nestle Products shall be
subject to all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement including, without
limitation Section 5 of this Agreement.

b. Upon written notice by Company to Distributor that Company desires
to add market areas or geographic areas located within Distributor's Existing
Markets (as defined in paragraph 5.a of this Agreement) to the Territories
listed in Exhibit B-1 to this Agreement, in accordance with a timetable for
transition identified in such notice (which in all events shall allow for at
least a ninety (90) day transition period), Distributor shall become the
distributor for such market areas or geographic areas. Notwithstanding the
prior sentence, under all circumstances Distributor will have no obligation to
accept the appointment as exclusive distributor for any market area or
geographic area until and unless the Company is able to deliver at lest
eighty-seven and five-tenths percent (87.5%) of the total sales of Nestle
Products in each of the channels of distribution to be assigned to Distributor
on an exclusive basis in such area; but once appointment as exclusive
distributor is accepted by Distributor, any such area shall be deemed an
Exclusive Territory for all purposes hereunder. Upon Distributor's receipt of
any such notice of Company's desire to appoint Distributor as the exclusive
distributor of any channel of distribution or area (provided the appointment
complies with the requirements of this Agreement, including without limitation
this paragraph 1.b), then Distributor and Company shall negotiate in good 
faith to establish performance objectives in accordance with paragraph 5.a of 
this Agreement, to allow for the transition of responsibility from Nestle to 
Distributor for distribution of Nestle Products in such Exclusive Territory 
pursuant to the timetable for transition identified in such notice.

c. At such time as Distributor becomes the exclusive distributor of the
Nestle Products for any channel of distribution or area, Distributor agrees not
to distribute or enter into any agreement to distribute products competitive
with the Nestle Products (based upon the formulation and price of such
products) including, but not limited to, frozen novelty products produced by
Chipwich, Eskimo Pie, Frozfruit, Mars (excluding the "Mars territory" as
hereinafter defined), Unilever and Wells, in such channel or such area. Except
as specifically agreed between the parties, Distributor shall not enter into
any new contractual relationship concerning the distribution of any products
competitive 

2
<PAGE> 113
with the Nestle Products for any channel of distribution or area that
would not be terminable by Distributor upon the effective date that Distributor
becomes the exclusive distributor of Nestle Products for such channel or area. 
Distributor agrees that it will terminate all such contracts for a given
channel or area effective upon the effective date of such appointment of
Distributor as exclusive distributor. This paragraph 1.c shall not apply to
any of Distributor's (or its subsidiary's) manufactured products
("Distributor's Products") or to any products sold or distributed by
Distributor (or its subsidiary) pursuant to a contractual obligation with any
of the following companies: Ben & Jerry's Homemade, Inc.; ConAgra, Inc.; Mars,
Inc. (exclusion limited to the "Mars territory"); Presto Food Products, Inc.;
Steve's Homemade Ice Cream, Inc.; and Calip Dairies, Inc. "Mars territory"
means the State of Wisconsin; the State of Illinois (excluding Greene, Madison,
Jersey and Monroe counties); Clinton and Scott counties in Iowa; and the State
of Indiana.

d. Notwithstanding the exclusive distributor rights granted to
Distributor with respect to the Exclusive Territories, it is mutually
understood and agreed that the existing Nestle licensees/distributors
previously disclosed by Company to Distributor shall have the right to continue
selling any Nestle Products for which they are currently authorized.

2. REPRESENTATIONS OF DISTRIBUTOR

Distributor represents and warrants to Company that:

a. Distributor has all permits and licenses necessary for Distributor
to lawfully distribute Nestle Products in the Territories.

b. The relationship of Distributor and Company is that of buyer and
seller and nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create any other
relationship.

c. Distributor has not paid or agreed to pay any consideration to
Company or any Company officer, director, employee or representative with
respect to entering into this Agreement, nor has it paid or agreed to pay any
franchise fee. Except as provided elsewhere in this Agreement, Company and its
affiliates have neither, directly nor indirectly, orally or in writing
(including, without limitation, the Stock Agreements), represented that Company
will (i) provide outlets or accounts for Nestle Products, (ii) cause the
purchase of Nestle Products from Distributor, (iii) guarantee profits from the
distribution of Nestle Products or (iv) refund the price paid or repurchase
Nestle Products if Distributor is dissatisfied with such Products.

3
<PAGE> 114

In reliance on the above representations and warranties, Company has
entered into this Agreement with Distributor.

3. OPERATION

a. All orders which Company receives from Distributor for Nestle
Products shall be subject to acceptance by Company. Company will use all
reasonable efforts to accept and fill orders as promptly as practicable,
subject, however, to delays beyond Company's reasonable control. Distributor
agrees to use its best efforts to place orders for Nestle Products with Company
at least five (5) business days in advance of the requested delivery date.

b. Company reserves to itself the unqualified right to manage its
business in all respects, including, but not limited to, the right to maintain
or alter the flavors, formula, ingredients, labeling, or packaging of any
Company products. Orders may be filled by Company from such Company production
facilities as Company shall determine.

c. This Agreement shall extend only to those Nestle Products and
package sizes listed on Exhibit A. Provided, however, that it is expressly
agreed that this Agreement may be extended by Company to include Dole(R) sorbet
and other Company frozen novelty and frozen dessert products from time to time
by ninety (90) days prior written notice to Distributor, in which case the
names of such other products and package sizes shall be entered on an amended
Exhibit A and such other products shall be deemed to be Nestle Products
hereunder. It is acknowledged and agreed that for the purposes of this
Agreement, the term "frozen dessert" shall mean and refer to ice cream,
sherbet, ice milk and frozen yogurt products designed for take home
consumption, including, but not limited to ice cream cakes, ice cream pies, ice
cream nutrolls, ice cream parfaits and ice cream tortes; excluding, however any
dairy-based or other frozen dessert products sold in half-gallon, quart or
pint-sized containers for a suggested retail price on a non-promoted basis
equal to or greater than an average of one dollar twenty-five cents ($1.25) per
pint, one dollar seventy cents ($1.70) per quart, and three dollars ($3.00) per
one-half gallon over a fifty-two (52) week period adjusted by the CPI Index
(December 1993 to equal 100 for this purpose) but, notwithstanding the
foregoing, not to include any Dole(R) sorbet products referenced above.
Company shall have the right, at any time and in its sole discretion, to
discontinue the sale of any Nestle Products, packages or containers on a
national, regional, state-wide or media-coverage area basis or to a particular
class of trade. Company shall have the right, at any time, upon ninety (90)
days prior written notice to Distributor, to delete one or more Territories
from this Agreement. Company and Distributor also may from time to time, by
mutual agreement, extend this Agreement to include other market or geographical
areas, either on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis, in which case the
description(s) of such other market or geographical areas shall be 

4
<PAGE> 115
entered on an amended Exhibit B, and such other market or geographical
areas shall be deemed to be part of the Exclusive Territories or Non-Exclusive
Territories hereunder, as the case may be. In addition, Company may at any
time, upon ninety (90) days prior written notice to Distributor, extend this
Agreement to other channels of distribution, or delete any or all of the
channels of distribution in any of the Territories, provided that Company shall
not have the right to delete the grocery channel in a Territory unless it also
deletes all other channels in such Territory, in which case the description(s)
of such other channels of distribution shall be entered on or deleted from an
amended Exhibit B, and thereafter only the channels of distribution listed on
such revised Exhibit B, shall be deemed to be authorized channels of
distribution hereunder for the Territories listed. In the event of any changes
in (i) the products comprising the Nestle Products, (ii) the market or
geographical areas comprising the Territories, (iii) the channels of
distribution assigned to Distributor, or (iv) the exclusive or non-exclusive
status of any of the Territories or channels of distribution subject to this
Agreement, the parties shall negotiate in good faith mutually acceptable
changes to any performance standards or objectives which may be applicable to
the Territories or channels of distribution affected by such changes.

d. Distributor shall pay Company for Nestle Products purchased by
Distributor from Company according to Company's then prevailing distributor
price list in effect at the time of shipment of Distributor's order. Terms of
payment are 28 days net from date of invoice. Interest charges will be
assessed on all past due balances at an annual percentage rate equal to (i) the
prime interest rate in effect at Citibank N.A. for its preferred commercial
borrowers, plus one percent (1%), or (ii) the highest rate permitted by law,
whichever is less. Credit terms are subject to change if any outstanding
balance remains unpaid after 28 days. All Nestle Products shall be sold to
Distributor f.o.b. Distributor's warehouses from such Company location(s) as
may be designated by Company from time to time, unless Distributor elects to
arrange for pickup at Company's facilities or warehouses. Company reserves the
right to change the Company shipping location(s) upon reasonable notice to
Distributor. Title and risk of loss shall pass to Distributor either (i) upon
delivery of the Nestle Products to Distributor's warehouses, or (ii) upon
delivery to Distributor or a carrier selected by Distributor if Distributor
elects to pick up Nestle Products at Company's facilities or warehouses. 
Company shall use its best efforts to give Distributor at least thirty (30)
days prior notice of any changes in price, or other terms and conditions of
sale; however, Company reserves the right to implement changes in credit terms
effective upon notice. Once Nestle Products are received by Distributor or its
customer, the same may not be returned to Company without prior approval of the
Company.

Company shall inform Distributor of its prices in writing from time to
time, but Company shall have the unlimited right to change prices and establish
other terms and 

5
<PAGE> 116
conditions of sale at any time, subject to its notice obligation set
forth in the preceding paragraph; however, Company shall not have the right to
change terms relating to delivery, title or risk of loss, except with
Distributor's prior written approval. Distributor shall be free to establish
its resale prices and terms of sale for Nestle Products, and the parties
represent and acknowledge that they have no understanding that controls or
restricts any such resale prices or terms of sale.

e. Company may extend credit terms to Distributor, subject to prior
approval in writing by an authorized representative of Company. Distributor
shall promptly pay all invoices rendered by Company and shall furnish such
credit information (including, but not exclusively limited to, full and
adequate financial statements) as may be requested from time to time by Company
to evaluate credit terms, if any, requested by Distributor.

f. Company shall not deliver to Distributor any Nestle Products which,
at the time of delivery, have less than sixty (60) days remaining of shelf
life.

g. Company may make available to Distributor from time to time display
freezers for delivery to retail accounts. Such units would be provided on a
lease basis, on such terms as the parties may mutually agree.

h. Without limitation of paragraph 4.f, Company shall notify
Distributor, as promptly as practicable, of any material claim related to any
Nestle Product. For purposes of this paragraph 3(h), "material claim" shall
mean a claim which is reasonably likely to require action by Distributor to
maintain its customer relationships or protect the health of consumers.

4. GENERAL OBLIGATIONS OF COMPANY

a. Company, at Company's sole discretion, will make available for use
by Distributor point-of-sale advertising and promotional materials relating to
Nestle Products.

b. Company shall use its best efforts to (i) manufacture and provide to
Distributor an adequate and timely supply of high quality Nestle Products to
meet Distributor's requirements hereunder, (ii) maintain, at Company's expense,
marketing programs (including, but not limited to, media, consumer and trade
promotions) as it reasonably deems appropriate, in support of the Nestle
Products on an on-going basis, and (iii) provide such reasonable co-operation,
advice and assistance to Distributor as Distributor may request from time to
time in support of Distributor's sales efforts under this Agreement; provided,
however, that Company shall have no obligation to become actively involved in
Distributor's distribution and sales activities. In the event Distributor 

6
<PAGE> 117
is unable to satisfy any requirement set forth in this Agreement or otherwise
mutually agreed upon in writing by Company and Distributor for any of the
Territories due to Company's failure to perform its best efforts obligations as
hereinabove provided, then such requirement shall be reduced retrospectively as
appropriate to reflect the effect of such failure by Company.

c. Company agrees to use its best efforts to cause other distributors,
subdistributors and customers in channels of distribution or market areas other
than those listed in Exhibit B hereto, not to sell or resell to accounts in the
Exclusive Territories for sale in the channels of distribution listed in
Exhibit B with respect to said Exclusive Territories. Upon notification from
Distributor, Company shall promptly look into and use its best efforts to take
appropriate action to cause any unauthorized sales or resales in the Exclusive
Territories to terminate. As used in this Agreement, "best efforts" means
reasonable use of available resources to accomplish the objectives of this
Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall (i) obligate Company to take any
action or institute any proceeding in the event that any other individual or
business entity sells or distributes Nestle Products in the Exclusive
Territories (unless such individual or business entity is under a contractual
obligation to Company not to sell Nestle Products in the Exclusive Territories)
or (ii) limit or affect the right of Company to sell Nestle Products to other
customers or distributors who are located outside the Exclusive Territories or
who are located inside the Territories but would resell Nestle Products only
outside the Exclusive Territories. In the event Distributor is unable to
satisfy any requirement set forth in this Agreement or otherwise mutually
agreed upon in writing by Company and Distributor for any of the Territories
due to Company's failure to prevent unauthorized and unanticipated (at the time
such requirement was established) shipments of Nestle Products into such
Territories by third parties, then such requirement shall be reduced
retrospectively as appropriate to reflect the effect of such unauthorized
shipments.

d. Any use by Distributor of any trademarks, trade names or logos
owned by or licensed to Company (collectively the "Trademarks"), in both form
and manner, shall be at the sole discretion of Company. Except as otherwise
provided in paragraph 5.f., all permitted use of the Trademarks by Distributor
shall cease immediately upon written notification by Company to Distributor to
stop such use or upon termination of this Agreement for any reason. 
Distributor shall not (i) adopt any trademark, logo or trade name which, in the
judgment of Company, is confusingly similar to any of the Trademarks or (ii)
contest or assist others in contesting the validity or ownership of (or
Company's license to use) any of the Trademarks. Distributor agrees that, as
between Company and Distributor, the Trademarks are valid and existing
trademarks, trade names and logos of Company and are the sole and exclusive
property of Company. Nothing in this Agreement shall give Distributor any
right, title, or interest in any of the Trademarks or in the goodwill
associated with any of the Trademarks, except the right to use the 

7
<PAGE> 118
Trademarks in strict compliance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement or as may be otherwise specified in writing by Company. All goodwill
associated with the use of any of the Trademarks by Distributor shall inure to
the benefit of Company or the licensors of such Trademarks. Distributor shall
change or discontinue the way in which Distributor uses any Trademarks upon
written notice from Company to do so. This Agreement is not intended to be and
shall not be construed as a license of the Trademarks.

e. Company warrants that, as of the date of delivery to Distributor,
the Nestle Products sold to Distributor shall comply with all applicable local,
state and federal laws and regulations and shall be wholesome, merchantable and
fit for human consumption. Company shall indemnify and hold Distributor
harmless from and against any and all liability, loss or damage, cost or
expense (including court costs and reasonable attorney fees), arising out of a
breach of the warranty of Company contained in this paragraph.

f. Company shall immediately inform Distributor of any claim, suit,
proceeding or action connected with or relating to any Nestle Product sold to
Distributor of which Company becomes aware if an allegation of liability on the
part of Distributor is involved, and Distributor shall have the right to assume
control of any such suit, proceeding or action, unless Company is named as a
defendant. Company agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Distributor and its
affiliates harmless from and against any and all liability, loss or damage,
cost or expense (including, with respect to the defense of third-party claims,
court costs, litigation expenses, out-of-pocket costs and reasonable attorneys'
fees) connected with or relating to (i) Company's acts or omissions in
connection with its performance of, or its failure to perform, any of its
obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent in either case such
liability, loss or damage, cost or expense is due to the negligence of
Distributor or to the acts of unrelated third parties, (ii) any breach by
Company of any representation, warranty or covenant made by Company hereunder,
(iii) any defects in Company's manufacturing, packaging, storage and delivery
to the Distributor of the Nestle Products, or (iv) Nestle Products which are
misbranded or adulterated at the time of delivery to Distributor.

5. GENERAL OBLIGATIONS OF DISTRIBUTOR

Distributor shall have the following general obligations:

a. Distributor shall convert Company's present method of distribution
of Nestle Products in the Exclusive Territories from sales via centralized
grocery store/chain warehousing and broker representation to a system of direct
store delivery ("DSD") and Distributor sales representation for grocery stores.
Following execution of this Agreement, or following Distributor's appointment
as exclusive

8
<PAGE> 119
distributor pursuant to a notice to Distributor under paragraph 1.b of
this Agreement, Distributor and Company shall negotiate in good faith to
establish performance objectives for distribution of Nestle Products in grocery
stores for Distributor's Existing Markets in the Exclusive Territories, to be
completed prior to such transition dates as may be mutually agreed upon in
writing by Company and Distributor for such markets, and upon completion of
said mutually-agreed performance objectives for such markets, Distributor and
Company shall cooperate in arranging for an orderly transition to Distributor
of the responsibility for the distribution of the Nestle Products in such
markets, but in all events prior to any applicable transition dates which have
been mutually agreed upon by the parties or which have been set forth in a
notice to Distributor from the Company pursuant to paragraph 1.b of this
Agreement. The factors to be considered in negotiation of performance
objectives for Nestle Products for each channel of distribution in the
Exclusive Territories shall include, without limitation, (1) volume, (2) market
share, (3) ACV distribution, (4) merchandising, (5) promotions, (6) displays,
(7) financial budget and (8) reporting. "Distributor's Existing Markets" shall
mean all markets in which Distributor and/or its subsidiary Edy's Grand Ice
Cream currently has achieved distribution of Distributor's products in grocery
stores representing at least fifty percent (50%) All Commodity Volume in the
market, and where Distributor or Edy's has operated for at least two years.
During the transition to DSD distribution and thereafter during the term of
this Agreement, Distributor shall utilize its best efforts to maintain
competitive retail price levels and maintain or improve distribution levels of
Nestle Products in the various market areas and geographical areas comprising
the Exclusive Territories. For the purposes of this paragraph 5.a the term
"best efforts" shall mean and refer to (i) Distributor's reasonable use of
available resources to accomplish an orderly transition to DSD distribution in
accordance with any applicable transition dates which have been mutually agreed
upon by the parties; and (ii) appropriate reduction by Distributor of its
distribution margins to permit the maintenance of competitive retail price
levels in the Exclusive Territories (excluding Florida and Atlanta) relative to
the accounts served by Distributor with Nestle Products, so as to maintain the
average profit levels existing for such Exclusive Territories and accounts
(after adjusting for the effect of Company's changeover from licensing to
copacking and self-manufacturing the Nestle Products) for the six-month periods
prior to the respective dates of transition to DSD distribution of such
Exclusive Territories and accounts. Company acknowledges and agrees that
Distributor's obligation to reduce distribution margins as set forth above in
this paragraph shall be contingent upon (i) Company, in its reasonable
determination, reducing its prices of the Nestle Products to Distributor to
reflect the value of Distributor's DSD distribution system and sales
representation, such reduced distributor prices to be effective as of and from
the date of each such transition, or (ii) Distributor's receipt of equivalent
value as if such reduction in wholesale prices of the Nestle Products had been
provided by Company to Distributor, as mutually agreed by the parties.
Distributor shall purchase Nestle Products from Company only, shall maintain at
all times

9
<PAGE> 120
a sufficient inventory of Nestle Products for Distributor's customers
and shall provide qualified personnel to furnish "Full Service" Direct Store
Delivery ("F/S-DSD") of Nestle Products for all customer accounts served by
Distributor in the Territories. The term "F/S-DSD" means that employees of the
Distributor will use their best efforts to provide full retail case services
for its customers and, if permitted, physically stock Nestle Products in the
stores of the customer with the intention of maintaining a constant "in stock"
condition, constructing displays of Nestle Products in the store and handling
or coordinating the handling of the Nestle Products throughout the entire
distribution process in order to meet the distribution and product quality
standards set forth in Exhibit C hereto.

b. Distributor shall use its best efforts to promote the sale,
distribution (on a DSD basis) and use of Nestle Products in the Territories and
use its best efforts to build, maintain and expand maximum and competitive
distribution of Nestle Products in all sections of the Territories in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to Company; however, in the event Distributor is unable
to achieve DSD distribution for any particular account within a reasonable
period of time, then Company shall have the right to establish whatever method
of distribution for such account it may deem appropriate, as determined by its
Vice President-Sales. Distributor acknowledges that Company's distributor
pricing structure for Nestle Products will vary among different markets and
geographic areas due to local competitive conditions. Distributor agrees that
it will not ship or sell Nestle Products intended for one market or area into
another market or area without Company's prior approval, if Company's
distributor prices for the Nestle Products are different for such markets or
areas. A material breach by Distributor of its obligations to use its best
efforts under this Section 5, which continues after notice and opportunity to
cure as provided in Section 6 hereof, shall constitute grounds for termination
of this Agreement. Distributor will use its best efforts to achieve such
performance objectives in each of the Exclusive Territories as may be mutually
agreed upon in writing by Company and Distributor from time to time.

c. Distributor shall procure and maintain during the term of this
Agreement workmen's compensation insurance as required by applicable law, as
well as occurrence basis automobile liability insurance on all motor vehicles
used by Distributor to distribute Nestle Products, with insurers reasonably
acceptable to Company and naming Company and the owner of any of the Trademarks
appearing on Nestle Products as additional insureds and with limits of not less
than $2,000,000 combined single limit per occurrence for bodily injury and
property damage. Distributor shall provide Company with a certificate of
insurance evidencing such coverages, which certificate must provide that the
insurer shall give Company at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of
any cancellation or material change in any such coverage.

10
<PAGE> 121

d. Distributor shall procure and maintain during the term of this
Agreement occurrence basis comprehensive general liability insurance (including
products liability and contractual liability coverage) with insurers reasonably
acceptable to Company and naming Company and the owner of any of the Trademarks
appearing on Nestle Products as additional insureds and with limits of not less
than $20,000,000 combined single limit per occurrence for bodily injury and
property damage. Such insurance minimum shall be reviewed by the parties at
five-year intervals and shall be adjusted as appropriate by mutual agreement of
Distributor and Company. Distributor shall provide Company with a certificate
of insurance evidencing such coverages, which certificate must provide that the
insurer shall give Company at least thirty (30) days prior written notice of
any cancellation or material change in any of such coverages. Distributor
shall use its best efforts to ensure that Nestle Products in its possession or
under its control which are involved in an insurance claim shall not be
transferred to a third party, except with Company's prior written approval.

e. Distributor shall immediately inform Company of any claim, suit,
proceeding or action connected with or relating to any Nestle Product sold to
Distributor of which Distributor becomes aware and, if an allegation of
liability on the part of Company is involved, Company shall have the right to
assume control of any such suit, proceeding or action. Distributor agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold Company and its affiliates, including the owners of
the Trademarks, harmless from and against any and all liability, loss or
damage, cost or expense (including, with respect to the defense of third-party
claims, court costs, litigation expenses, out of pocket costs and reasonable
attorneys' fees) connected with or relating to (i) the distribution, sale,
advertisement, storage or transportation by Distributor of Nestle Products
purchased from Company pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) Distributor's acts or
omissions in connection with its performance of, or its failure to perform, any
of its obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent in either case
such liability, loss or damage, cost or expense is due to the negligence of
Company or to the acts of unrelated third parties, (iii) any breach by
Distributor of any representation, warranty or covenant made by Distributor
hereunder, (iv) any acts or omissions of Distributor's subdistributors
authorized under paragraph 5.l of this Agreement (but excluding (x) any act or
omission of an authorized subdistributor which relates to the distribution of
Nestle Products purchased directly from Company, and not from Distributor, or
(y) any failure or refusal by any authorized subdistributor, other than Edy's
Grand Ice Cream, to adjust distribution margins as contemplated by paragraph
5.a hereof), or (v) any defects in Nestle Products arising after the delivery
of such Products to Distributor unless such defects are due to the negligence
of Company.

f. In the event Company permits Distributor to place any Company trade
name, logo, trademark, device or advertising matter on any of Distributor's
distribution vehicles, Distributor agrees that it will cease using (and will
remove) any such Company 

11
<PAGE> 122
trade name, logo, trademark, device or advertising matter from Distributor's 
distribution vehicles within thirty (30) days after the termination of this
Agreement, unless Company otherwise authorizes in writing the continuance of
Distributor's use of any such trade name, logo, trademark, device or
advertising matter.

g. Distributor shall maintain complete and accurate records of orders
to and deliveries from Company, as well as sales and inventory records, on such
forms as may be mutually agreed upon by the parties, shall submit to Company
reports based on such records, and shall provide Company access to such records
upon reasonable notice during Distributor's regular business hours. Such
records shall be structured so as to enable Distributor to conduct or
participate in product withdrawals and recalls by tracing or locating to the
extent possible under Distributor's record-keeping system all other units of
the same lot in the distribution chain, provided all such units have been
marked by Company with a clearly visible lot code. Distributor agrees to
maintain true and accurate records with respect to all sales of Nestle Products
sold during each calendar year during the term hereof and shall deliver to
Company, within 45 days after the close of each calendar year, a statement
signed and certified by a duly authorized financial officer of Distributor
certifying as to the amount of sales of Nestle Products sold in the Territories
during the preceding calendar year. Upon request from Company, Distributor
shall furnish to Company, on a monthly basis, a record of sales (by product and
by outlet) of all Nestle Products sold to each customer in each of the market
areas and geographical areas comprising the Territories during the previous
calendar month, in a machine readable format reasonably acceptable to Company.
Upon reasonable request, Distributor shall also furnish to Company in such
format and at such frequency as Company may reasonably require (within the
capabilities of Distributor) a record of sales (by product and by outlet) of
Nestle Products sold to a particular key customer or customers in any area of
the Territories. Company, through its duly authorized representatives, shall
upon reasonable notice and during Distributor's regular business hours have the
right to examine Distributor's books and records relating to sales of Nestle
Products in the Territories and to make copies or extracts thereof. Distributor
shall render all assistance reasonably requested by Company in connection
therewith. Distributor shall also permit Company's personnel on reasonable
notice to make periodic audits and inspections of its facilities and vehicles
used for storage and distribution of Nestle Products to determine compliance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Distributor agrees to permit
Company, upon reasonable notice to Distributor, to conduct semi-annual tests at
Company's expense to evaluate the effectiveness of Distributor's recall
system.

h. Distributor shall at all times conduct itself in a professional
manner and shall comply withsuch guidelines and directives regarding Nestle
Product representation

12
<PAGE> 123
as may reasonably be issued by Company from time to time. Distributor
shall provide such additional trucks and warehousing capability as may be
reasonably necessary to provide a level of F/S-DSD service for Nestle Products
that is satisfactory to Distributor's customers. Distributor shall (i)
maintain adequate facilities for the storage, warehousing and prompt delivery
of Nestle Products; (ii) permit joint sales efforts by its salespeople with
Company sales personnel; (ii) hold sales meetings and business reviews with
Company sales personnel as needed; (iv) provide such reports and forecasts
relating to sales of Nestle Products as may be reasonably required by Company;
(v) handle special orders or give special service when reasonably necessary;
and (vi) reasonably cooperate at all times with Company personnel.

i. Distributor shall assert any complaints or claims arising out of or
relating to a shipment of Nestle Products to Distributor within thirty (30)
days of Distributor's receipt of such shipment; otherwise the same shall be
deemed to have been waived, unless such complaints or claims involve damage to
or defects in Nestle Products which are proven to be attributable to
manufacture.

j. Distributor shall comply with all applicable federal, state and
local laws, rules and regulations pertaining to the performance of its
obligations under this Agreement and with all reasonable policies established
by Company and communicated to Distributor which relate in general to
distributors of Nestle Products. Distributor shall administer and communicate
all trade promotions so as to ensure that all customers in the geographical
area covered by the promotion are aware of the trade promotion and that such
promotions are offered to each such customer on a fair and proportionately
equal basis. Distributor shall maintain in full force and effect all permits
and licenses necessary to distribute Nestle Products in the Territories.

k. Distributor shall use its best efforts to keep Company informed of
all market and economic conditions in the Territories of which Distributor
becomes aware and which may materially affect the sale of Nestle Products.

l. Distributor will not establish any subdistributorships or
subdistribute Nestle Products to or through any other distributor without the
prior written consent of Company, which shall not be unreasonably withheld
except that Distributor shall have the right to continue selling through its
current first-tier subdistributors which are listed on Exhibit D hereto, in the
channels of distribution indicated in said Exhibit D. Company acknowledges
that Distributor has distributed products to various independent distributors
from time to time in various markets or geographical areas which are not served
directly by Distributor. Distributor agrees to use its best efforts to work
with Company to either (i) establish distribution arrangements with such
independent distributors whereby said distributors would provide distribution
services on terms consistent with the terms of this

13
<PAGE> 124
Agreement and otherwise satisfactory to Company (in which event and
with Company's approval such distributors may be added to Exhibit D hereto as
authorized subdistributors), or (ii) establish distribution agreements on a
direct basis between Company and said independent distributors on terms
consistent with this Agreement and otherwise satisfactory to Company. Except
as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Distributor agrees not to sell to any
person Distributor has reason to believe will redistribute or subdistribute
Nestle Products. Distributor shall not convert Nestle Products to any other
package, container or use. Distributor agrees that it will require its
authorized subdistributors to restrict their sales of Nestle Products to only
those channels of distribution and market areas where Distributor is authorized
to sell Nestle Products hereunder. Distributor agrees that it will not sell
Nestle Products to a subdistributor if Distributor knows or has convincing
reason to believe that such subdistributor is selling or intends to sell Nestle
Products outside of the Territories or to a customer or customers in any
channel of distribution to which Distributor is not authorized to sell Nestle
Products pursuant to this Agreement. No arrangements or dealings between
Distributor and its subdistributors shall modify or limit Distributor's
obligations to Company under this Agreement.

m. Distributor shall use its best efforts to cause its personnel and
its authorized subdistributors' personnel to attend Company sales, marketing,
and related meetings and training sessions as may be reasonably scheduled by
Company and shall consistently and effectively use such Company training
programs and materials, as provided, in Distributor's operation.

n. Distributor shall at all times use its best efforts to preserve and
enhance the high quality image, reputation, and goodwill of Company and the
Nestle Products.

o. Distributor shall be open for business during customary business
hours and days to be competitive with major competition. Distributor shall
provide regular deliveries of Nestle Products with sufficient frequency to be
competitive with major competition. Distributor shall maintain a sufficient
inventory of Nestle Products in order to fill, deliver and handle all orders
placed by customers in the Territories, including orders for new items and
introductory offers.

p. Distributor shall provide for the safe and proper handling,
storage, placement, and installation of Company point of sale materials and
shall display such materials in a conspicuous place wherever possible at each
retail location.

q. Distributor shall submit for Company's prior written approval all
advertising, promotional materials, copy, literature or artwork referring or
relating to Nestle Products and/or the Trademarks prior to any use or
distribution thereof. Upon 

14
<PAGE> 125
receipt of written notice from Company, Distributor shall discontinue
any advertising or promotional practices that Company finds injurious to
Company's image or business or to the Trademarks.

r. All pallets furnished by Company shall remain the property of
Company and such pallets, or pallets of equal quality received in exchange
therefor, shall be returned to Company or so exchanged at Distributor's
warehouses.

s. Distributor shall be responsible for all federal, state and local
sales taxes and other taxes of a similar nature that may be assessed against
Distributor in connection with the sale of any Nestle Products.

6. TERM AND TERMINATION

This Agreement has no stated term. Although the parties desire this
Agreement to be mutually profitable, Distributor acknowledges and agrees that
Company has made no representation or warranty that this Agreement will be
extended or continue for any period of time. Accordingly, all investments made
by Distributor are at its own risk and not in reliance on the expectation of
the continuation of this relationship. Under no circumstances shall this
relationship be deemed to constitute that of franchisor and franchisee, and the
parties expressly disclaim any intention to create a franchise arrangement.

This Agreement may be terminated by the Company at any time for any
reason, with or without cause, upon ninety (90) days prior written notice
thereof to Distributor.

This Agreement may be terminated by Distributor upon ninety (90) days
prior written notice in the event that those certain two Right of First Refusal
Agreements of even date herewith between an affiliate of Company and Messrs.
William F. Cronk, III and T. Gary Rogers, respectively, (and their respective
spouses, together with certain testamentary trusts) have been terminated
pursuant to Section 6(l) of each said Agreement.

In addition, in the event of a material breach by one party of any of
the terms of this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall have the right, at
its option, to terminate this Agreement. In such event, the non-breaching
party shall give written notice to the breaching party of such breach and the
latter party shall then have thirty (30) days (or ten (10) days in the case of
a monetary breach) within which to cure such breach; provided, however, that no
such notice with respect to a sales or distribution-related breach may be given
unless, within thirty (30) days prior to giving such notice, a responsible
representative of the non-breaching party shall have met with responsible
personnel of the 

15
<PAGE> 126
breaching party in the relevant market and discussed the breach. If the 
breach is not cured within the applicable time period, then the breaching party
shall be in default and, in addition to any other rights or remedies it may
have under this Agreement or under applicable law, the non-breaching party
shall also have the right to immediately terminate this Agreement on written
notice to the party in default.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Company may, if Distributor is in breach of any material obligation of
Distributor under paragraph 5 of this Agreement after notice and opportunity to
cure, take such action as may reasonably be necessary to maintain the
uninterrupted distribution of Nestle Products in the Territories, including
(but not limited to) the servicing of customers either directly or through
other distributors, and upon demand Distributor shall reimburse Company for
costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of Company in taking such action to
the extent that such costs and expenses exceed those which Company would have
incurred if such breach had not occurred. In exercising the rights set forth
in the preceding sentence, Company shall use its best efforts to avoid taking
actions which would prevent Distributor from remedying such breach, as long as
Distributor has commenced in good faith to do so and is diligently continuing
such efforts to remedy.

This Agreement may be terminated immediately by either party upon

(i) the filing of a petition proposing the adjudication of the
other party as a bankrupt or insolvent or the financial reorganization 
of such other party or any arrangement by such other party with its 
creditors, whether pursuant to the Federal Bankruptcy Act or any 
similar federal or state proceeding, unless such petition is withdrawn 
or dismissed within sixty (60) days after the date of its filing, or

(ii) the admission in writing by the other party of its 
inability to pay its debts when due, or

(iii) the appointment of a receiver or trustee for the 
business or property of the other party, unless such appointment shall 
be vacated within thirty (30) days of its entry, or

(iv) the making by the other party of an assignment for the 
benefit of its creditors or the dissolution or liquidation of the 
other party.

In the event of the termination of this Agreement, Company shall have
the right to cancel unfilled orders and to stop or re-route any shipment of
Nestle Products inroute to Distributor. Within ten (10) days after the
termination of this Agreement, Distributor 

16
<PAGE> 127
shall return to Company all property belonging to Company in Distributor's 
possession or control.

Distributor shall not be entitled to any compensation or damages under
any state franchise statute with respect to this Agreement, including the
termination thereof, or the distribution of Nestle Products pursuant hereto.

7. COMPANY'S PURCHASE OPTION UPON TERMINATION

Upon termination pursuant to paragraph 6 above, Company shall have the
option, exercisable upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to Distributor,
to purchase Nestle Products in Distributor's inventory by paying the net
purchase price paid by Distributor to Company for such Nestle Products. Company
reserves the right to reject any Nestle Products not in good and marketable
condition.

Any credits on account provided by the Company to Distributor or any
outstanding indebtedness due to Company from Distributor may be offset as a
credit against any sums payable by Company to Distributor under the preceding
subparagraph.

8. PROHIBITION AGAINST ASSIGNMENT

Distributor shall not assign this Agreement or any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Company.
Any dissolution, merger, consolidation, or other reorganization of Distributor,
or the sale of all or substantially all of Distributor's assets, shall be
deemed an assignment.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement the sole remedy
for breach of the foregoing provision shall be the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 6 hereof immediately upon notice to Distributor.

9. NO INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, ETC.

a. In no event (including, without limitation, any termination of this
Agreement) shall either party hereto be liable to the other party or any other
person for any incidental, indirect, special or consequential damages of any
nature whatsoever arising out of or relating to this Agreement, such party's
performance under this Agreement, or the sale of Nestle Products by Company to
Distributor.

b. In no event (including, without limitation, any termination of this
Agreement) shall Company be liable to Distributor or any other person for any
monies or 

17
<PAGE> 128
other consideration invested in Distributor's business or otherwise expended 
by Distributor in the course of performing its obligations hereunder.

10. MISCELLANEOUS

a. The failure of either Company or Distributor at any time or times
to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall in no way be construed as a
waiver of such provision and shall not affect the right of that party at a
later time to enforce each and every such provision. Waiver of any breach of
this Agreement by either party shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any
subsequent or continuing breach of this Agreement.

b. Any notices required or permitted to be given hereunder shall be in
writing, delivered personally or by certified United States mail or by
overnight air courier service to:

AMENDMENT TO REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

This Amendment to Registration Rights Agreement (the "Amendment") is
entered into this ___ day of May, 1994 by and among Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Trustees of General Electric
Pension Trust, a New York common law trust ("GE Pension"), GE Investment
Private Placement Partners, I, a Delaware limited partnership ("GEIPPP") and
General Electric Capital Corporation, a New York corporation (collectively the
"Investors").

Recitals

A. The Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement dated June
30, 1993 with the Investors (the "Agreement"), pursuant to which the Investors
acquired the right under certain circumstances to cause securities of the
Company held by them to be registered by the Company under the Securities Act
of 1933.

B. The Company and Investors now desire to amend the Agreement as set
forth herein.

1. Amendments.

1.1. Section 2.2(a) is hereby amended by adding the following 
at the end of such section:

"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this 
Section 2.2(a), if any such proposal by the Company to 
register any of its securities was as a result of the 
exercise of a demand registration right under 
Section 3 of the Nestle Registration Rights Agreement, 
then the Company shall not be obligated to include 
any Registrable Securities in any such registration 
without the consent of the Nestle Holders; provided, 
however, that such consent shall be deemed to have 
been given if the Nestle Holders allow any securities 
of the Company other than 'Registrable Securities' 
(as defined in the Nestle Registration Rights 
Agreement) to be included in such registration." 

1.2. Subsection 2.2(b) is hereby amended to read in its
entirety as follows: 

"(b) Priority in Incidental Registrations. If the 
managing underwriter of any underwritten offering 
shall inform the Company by letter of its belief that 
the number or type of Registrable Securities 

1
<PAGE> 141
requested to be included in such registration would 
materially adversely affect such offering, then the 
Company will include in such registration, to the extent 
of the number and type which the Company is so advised can
be sold in (or during the time of) such offering 
(i) first, all securities proposed by the Company to be 
sold for its own account, if any; (ii) second, and only if
all the securities proposed by the Company to be sold for 
its own account have been so included, such Registrable 
Securities and securities of the Company requested
for inclusion in such registration pursuant to the 
exercise of piggyback registration rights under 
Section 4(a) of the Nestle Registration Rights Agreement
(the 'Nestle Securities'), pro rata among the holders of 
the Registrable Securities and Nestle Securities on
the basis of the respective percentages of the total 
amount of securities requested to be so included by such 
holders which are represented by Registrable Securities, 
on the one hand, and Nestle Securities, on the other
hand; and (iii) third, and only if all of the Registrable 
Securities and Nestle Securities have been included in such
registration, any other securities of the Company
requested to be included in such registration; provided, 
however, that if such registration was as a result of the 
exercise of a demand registration right pursuant to
Section 3 of the Nestle Registration Rights Agreement, and
the Nestle Holders have consented to the inclusion of 
Registrable Securities in such offering, then the 
securities to be included in such registration shall be 
selected, after all 'Registrable Securities' (as defined 
in the Nestle Registration Rights Agreement) originally 
proposed to be included in such registration have been so
included, (y) first, from the Registrable Securities and 
(z) second, and only if all the Registrable Securities 
have been included in such registration, from any other 
securities eligible for inclusion in such registration."

1.3. Subsection 2.4(c) is hereby amended to read in its
entirety as follows:

"(c) Holdback Agreements. (i) Each holder of Registrable 
Securities agrees, in each of the instances set out below,
not to effect any public sale or distribution, including any
sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, of any
Registrable Securities, and not to effect any such public 
sale or distribution of any other equity

2
<PAGE> 142
security of the Company or of any security convertible 
into or exchangeable or exercisable for any equity 
security of the Company during the 15 days prior to, and
during the 90-day period (or such longer period as may be 
reasonably requested by the underwriter, if any, of an 
offering) beginning on, the effective date of a registration
statement (except as part of such registration) provided 
that each holder of Registrable Securities has received 
written notice of such registration at least 15 days prior
to such effective date:

(1) in the case of an underwritten public 
offering in which any such holder is participating, if
requested by the managing underwriters of such
underwritten public offering,

(2) in the case of an underwritten public 
offering in which any such holder is not participating 
and which is initiated pursuant to the exercise 
of demand registration rights under Section 3 
of the Nestle Registration Rights Agreement, if 
requested by the managing underwriters of such
underwritten public offering,

(3) in the case of a registration pursuant to 
Section 2.1 hereof in which any such holder is 
participating and which is not an underwritten
public offering, if requested by the holders of 
a majority of the Registrable Securities
requesting such registration,

(4) in the case of an incidental registration 
pursuant to Section 2.2 hereof in which any such
holder is participating and which is not an 
underwritten public offering, if requested by the
holders of a majority of the securities 
requesting such registration, or

(5) in the case of a registration in which any
such holder is not participating and which is 
initiated pursuant to the exercise of demand
registration rights under Section 3 of the
Nestle Registration Rights Agreement and which 
is not an underwritten public offering, if 
requested by the Nestle Holders.

3
<PAGE> 143

(ii) In the event of any registration of Registrable 
Securities pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2 hereof, the
Company agrees (i) not to effect any public or private
sale or distribution of any of its equity securities or
of any equity security convertible into or exchangeable
or exercisable for any equity security of the Company
(other than any such sale or distribution of such
securities in connection with any merger or
consolidation by the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company of the capital stock or substantially all the
assets of any other person or in connection with an
employee stock option or other benefit plan) during the
15 days prior to, and during the 90-day period beginning
on, the effective date of such registration statement
(except as part of such registration) to the extent the
Company is timely notified in writing by a holder of the
Registrable Securities or the managing underwriters of
any such registration, and (ii) that any agreement
entered into after the date of this Agreement pursuant
to which the Company issues or agrees to issue any
privately placed equity securities shall contain a
provision under which holders of such securities agree
not to effect any public sale or distribution of any
such securities during the period referred to in the
foregoing clause (i), including any sale pursuant to
Rule 144 under the Securities Act (except as part of
such registration, if permitted)."

1.4. Section 3 of the Agreement is hereby amended by adding
the following definitions in their correct alphabetical position:

"'Nestle' means Nestle Holdings, Inc., a Delaware
corporation."

"'Nestle Holders' means the selling holders of a
majority of all 'Registrable Securities' (as defined
in the Nestle Registration Rights Agreement) included
in a demand registration under Section 3 of the
Nestle Registration Rights Agreement."

"'Nestle Registration Rights Agreement' means the
Registration Rights Agreement dated May ___, 1994
between the Company and Nestle as in effect on such
date."

<PAGE> 144
2. Miscellaneous.

2.1. Except as expressly amended herein, all terms, 
covenants and provisions of the Agreement are and shall remain in full
force and effect and all references therein to such Agreement shall
henceforth refer to the Agreement as amended by this Amendment. This
Amendment shall be deemed incorporated into, and a part of, the
Agreement.

2.2. This Amendment shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. No third party beneficiaries are intended in connection with
this Amendment.

2.3. This Amendment shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the law of the State of Delaware.

2.4. This Amendment may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all such
counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same
instrument.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company and the Purchasers have caused this
Amendment to be executed and delivered as of the date first above written.

SECTION 2. Securities Subject to this Agreement.

(a) Registrable Securities. The securities entitled to
the benefits of this Agreement are the Registrable Securities.

deemed to be a holder of Registrable Securities whenever such Person owns
Registrable Securities or has the right to acquire such Registrable Securities,
whether or not such ownership or right was acquired pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement, the Warrant Agreement, the Right of First Refusal Agreements, or the
Preemptive Rights, and whether or not such acquisition has actually been
effected and disregarding any legal restrictions upon the exercise of such
right.

SECTION 3. Demand Registrations.

(a) Demand by Holders. Subject to the transfer
restrictions of Section 6.3 of the Purchase Agreement, the holders of
Registrable Securities, at any time from and after the Closing, may make three
written requests, in the aggregate with respect to all such holders, to the
Company for Registration of Registrable Securities representing, in each
instance, not less than 600,000 Common Shares under and in accordance with the
provisions of the Securities Act; provided, however, that the holders of Excess
Shares shall be entitled to make a written request to the Company for one
Registration of Excess Shares under and in accordance with the provisions of
the Securities Act without regard to the foregoing limitations as to number of
requests and minimum number of shares. Any such Registration requested shall
hereinafter be referred to as a "Demand Registration." Each request for a
Demand Registration shall specify the kind and aggregate amount of Registrable
Securities to be registered and the intended methods of disposition thereof.
Upon such request for a Demand Registration, the Company shall use its best
efforts to effect the Registration of such Registrable Securities under (i) the

3
<PAGE> 154
Securities Act, and (ii) the blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as any holder
of such Registrable Securities requesting such Registration or any underwriter,
if any, may reasonably request, provided that the Company shall not be required
to qualify generally to do business as a foreign corporation in any
jurisdiction wherein it would not, but for the requirements of this paragraph,
be obligated to be so qualified or to consent to general service of process in
such jurisdiction. The Company shall also use its best efforts to have all
such Registrable Securities registered with or approved by such other federal
or state governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary in the
opinion of counsel to the Company and counsel to the holders of a majority of
such Registrable Securities to consummate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities.

(b) Effective Registration. The Company shall be deemed
to have effected a Demand Registration if the Registration Statement relating
to such Demand Registration is declared effective by the SEC and remains
effective until the earlier of such time as all the Registrable Securities
covered by such Registration Statement have been sold or withdrawn, or 90 days;
provided, however, that no Demand Registration shall be deemed to have been
effected if (i) such Registration, after it has become effective, is interfered
with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of the SEC or
other governmental agency or court for any reason not attributable to the
selling holders of Registrable Securities, or (ii) the conditions to closing
specified in the purchase agreement or underwriting agreement entered into in
connection with such Registration are not satisfied, other than by reason of a
failure on the part of the selling holders of Registrable Securities.

(c) Registration Statement Form. Registrations under
this Section 3 shall be on such appropriate registration form of the SEC as
shall be selected by the Company and as shall permit the disposition of such
Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method or methods of
disposition specified in the request for such Registration; provided, however
that the Company shall include in such registration form, if reasonably
requested by the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities for which
Registration is being requested under this Section 3, information which is
otherwise required under applicable SEC regulations to be incorporated by
reference in such registration form.

(d) Selection of Underwriters. If at any time or from
time to time any of the holders of the Registrable Securities covered by a
Registration Statement desires to sell Registrable Securities in an
Underwritten Offering, the investment banker or investment bankers and manager
or managers that will administer the offering will be selected by the holders
of a majority of the Registrable Securities included in such offering;
provided, however, that the banker(s) and manager(s) so selected must be
nationally recognized in the securities field; provided, further, however, that
the Company shall have the right to make a reasonable objection to such
selection if such objection is based upon the Company's prior experience or
relationship with such banker(s) or manager(s).

(e) Registration of Other Securities. Whenever the
Company shall effect a Registration pursuant to this Section 3, no securities
other than Registrable Securities shall be included among the securities
covered by such Registration unless the selling holders of a majority of all
Registrable Securities to be covered by such Registration shall have consented
in writing to the inclusion of such other securities.

4
<PAGE> 155
(f) Priority in Requested Registration. If the Company
shall effect a Registration pursuant to this Section 3 in connection with an
Underwritten Offering by one or more holders of Registrable Securities, and if
the managing underwriter of such offering shall advise the Company in writing
(with a copy to each selling holder of Registrable Securities requesting
Registration) that, in its opinion, the number of securities requested to be
included in such Registration exceeds the number which can be sold in such
offering within a price range acceptable to the selling holders of a majority
of the Registrable Securities requested to be included in such Registration,
the Company will include in such Registration, to the extent of the number
which the Company is so advised can be sold in such offering, Registrable
Securities requested to be included in such Registration, selected pro rata
from the Registrable Securities of the selling holders requesting such
Registration on the basis of the percentage of the total amount of the
Registrable Securities which such selling holders requested to be so
registered.

SECTION 4. Piggyback Registrations.

(a) Participation. Subject to Section 4(b) hereof, if at
any time from and after the Closing under the Purchase Agreement the Company
proposes to file a Registration Statement under the Securities Act with respect
to any offering of any of its securities, whether or not by the Company for its
own account (other than (i) a registration on Form S-4 or S-8 or any successor
form to such Forms, or (ii) any registration of securities as it relates to an
offering and sale to management of the Company pursuant to any employee stock
plan or other employee benefit plan arrangement), then, as promptly as
practicable, the Company shall give written notice of such proposed filing to
each holder of Registrable Securities and such notice shall offer the holders
of Registrable Securities the opportunity to register such number of
Registrable Securities as each such holder may request (a "Piggyback
Registration"). Subject to Section 4(b), the Company shall include in such
Registration Statement all Registrable Securities requested within 30 days
after the receipt of any such notice (which request shall specify the
Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such holder) to be
included in the Registration for such offering pursuant to a Piggyback
Registration; provided, however, that if such Registration Statement was the
subject of an exercise of a demand registration right pursuant to Section 2.1
of the GECC Registration Rights Agreement, then the Company shall not be
obligated to include any Registrable Securities in such Registration without
the consent of the selling holders of a majority of all "Registrable
Securities" (as defined in the GECC Registration Rights Agreement) included in
the Registration (the "GE Holders"); provided, further, however, that such
consent shall be deemed to have been given if the GE Holders allow any
securities other than "Registrable Securities" (as defined in the GECC
Registration Rights Agreement) to be included in such Registration. Each
holder of Registrable Securities shall be permitted to withdraw all or part of
such holder's Registrable Securities from a Piggyback Registration at any time
prior to the effective date thereof.

(b) Underwriter's Cutback. The Company shall use its
best efforts to cause the managing underwriter or underwriters of a proposed
Underwritten Offering to permit the Registrable Securities requested to be
included in the Registration for such offering under Section 4(a) or pursuant
to other piggyback registration rights granted by the Company, if any (the
"Piggyback Securities"), to be included on the same terms and conditions as any
similar securities included therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
managing underwriter or

5
<PAGE> 156
underwriters of any such proposed Underwritten Offering informs the Company and
the holders of such Piggyback Securities in writing that the total amount or
kind of securities, including Piggyback Securities, which such holders and any
other persons or entities intend to include in such offering would be
reasonably likely to adversely affect the price or distribution of the
securities offered in such offering or the timing thereof, then the securities
to be included in the Registration for such offering shall be the number of
securities that, in the opinion of such underwriter or underwriters, can be
sold without an adverse effect on the price, timing or distribution of the
securities to be included, selected (i) first, from all securities proposed by
the Company to be sold for its own account, if any, (ii) second, and only if
all securities proposed by the Company to be sold for its own account have been
so included, from (A) the Piggyback Securities and (B) the securities requested
for inclusion in such Registration pursuant to the exercise of piggyback
registration rights under Section 2.2 of the GECC Registration Rights Agreement
(the "GE Piggyback Securities"), provided that if less than 100% of the
Piggyback Securities and GE Piggyback Securities are to be included in such
Registration, the securities to be so included shall be selected pro rata from
the Piggyback Securities and the GE Piggyback Securities, based upon the
percentage of the total amount of securities which such selling holders
requested to be so registered, and (iii) third, and only if all of the
Piggyback Securities and GE Piggyback Securities have been included in such
Registration, from any other securities eligible for inclusion in such
Registration; provided, however, that if such Registration Statement was the
subject of an exercise of a demand registration right pursuant to Section 2.1
of the GECC Registration Rights Agreement and the GE Holders have consented to
the inclusion of Piggyback Securities in such offering, then the securities to
be included in such Registration shall be selected, after all Registered
Securities (as defined in the GECC Registration Rights Agreement) originally
proposed to be included in such Registration have been so included, (i) first,
from the Piggyback Securities and (ii) second, and only if all the Piggyback
Securities have been included in such Registration, from any other securities
eligible for inclusion in such Registration.

(c) No Effect on Demand Registrations. No Registration
of Registrable Securities effected pursuant to a request under this Section 4
shall be deemed to have been effected pursuant to Section 3 hereof or shall
relieve the Company of its obligation to effect any Registration upon request
under Section 3 hereof.

SECTION 5. Hold-Back Agreements.

(a) Restrictions on Public Sale by Holders of Registrable
Securities. Each holder of Registrable Securities agrees:

(1) in the case of an Underwritten Registration
in which any such holder is participating, if requested by the
managing underwriters of such Underwritten Registration,

(2) in the case of an Underwritten Registration
in which any such holder is not participating and which is initiated
pursuant to the exercise of demand rights under Section 2.1 of the GE
Registration Rights Agreement, if requested by the managing
underwriters of such Underwritten Registration,

6
<PAGE> 157
(3) in the case of a Demand Registration in which
any such holder is participating and which is not an Underwritten
Registration, if requested by the holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities requesting such Registration,

(4) in the case of a Piggyback Registration in
which any such holder is participating and which is not an
Underwritten Registration, if requested by the holders of a majority
of the securities requesting such registration, or

(5) in the case of a Registration in which any
such holder is not participating and which is initiated pursuant to
the exercise of demand rights under Section 2.1 of the GE Registration
Rights Agreement and which is not an Underwritten Registration, if
requested by the holders of a majority of the securities requesting
such registration

not to effect any public sale or distribution of securities of the Company the
same as or similar to those being registered, or any securities convertible
into or exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, in such Registration
Statement (or registration statement, as the case may be), including a sale
pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act, (except as part of an
Underwritten Registration) during the 15-day period prior to, and during the
90-day period beginning on, the effective date of any Registration Statement
(or registration statement, as the case may be) (except as part of such
Registration), to the extent timely notified in writing by the managing
underwriters or the holders, as the case may be.

The foregoing provisions shall not apply to any holder of
Registrable Securities if such holder is prevented by applicable statute or
regulation from entering any such agreement; provided that any such holder
shall undertake, in its request to participate in any such Underwritten
Offering, not to effect any public sale or distribution of the applicable class
of Registrable Securities commencing on the date of sale of such applicable
class of Registrable Securities unless it has provided 60 days' prior written
notice of such sale or distribution to the underwriter or underwriters.

(b) Restrictions on Public Sale by the Company and
Others. The Company agrees:

(1) not to effect any public or private sale or
distribution of its equity securities, including a sale pursuant to
Regulation D under the Securities Act, during the 15-day period prior
to, and during the 90-day period beginning on, the effective date of a
Registration Statement filed under Section 3 or Section 4 hereof to the
extent timely notified in writing by a holder of Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration Statement or the managing
underwriters (the "Holdback Period") (except as part of such
Underwritten Registration or pursuant to registrations on Forms S-4 or
S-8 or any successor form to such forms), and

(2) to cause each holder of its privately placed
equity securities issued by the Company at any time on or after the
date of this Agreement to agree not to effect any public sale or
distribution of any such securities during the Holdback Period,

7
<PAGE> 158
including a sale pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act (except
as part of such Underwritten Registration, if permitted).

SECTION 6. Registration Procedures.

In connection with the Company's registration obligations
pursuant to Sections 3 and 4 hereof, the Company will use its best efforts to
effect such registration to permit the sale of such Registrable Securities in
accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition thereof, and
pursuant thereto the Company will as expeditiously as possible:

(a) before filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus
or any amendments or supplements thereto (each a "Public Document"),
(i) furnish to the selling holders of the Registrable Securities
covered by each such Public Document, and the underwriters, if any,
copies of each such Public Document (including all drafts of such
Public Document which are distributed to the underwriters, and if the
subject offering is not an Underwritten Offering, all drafts of such
Public Document available to the Company during the 14 day period
prior to the initial filing of such Public Document), (ii) allow such
holders and underwriters a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon each such Public Document, (iii) make the Company's
representatives available for discussion and consultation regarding
the contents of each such Public Document and (iv) consider in good
faith all comments proposed by such holders on each such Public
Document;

(b) prepare and file with the SEC a Registration
Statement or Registration Statements relating to the applicable Demand
Registration or Piggyback Registration including all exhibits and
financial statements required by the SEC to be filed therewith, and
use its best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become
effective under the Securities Act; and prepare and file with the SEC
such amendments and post-effective amendments to such Registration
Statement, and such supplements to the Prospectus, as may be requested
by any holder of Registrable Securities or any underwriter of
Registrable Securities or as may be required by the rules, regulations
or instructions applicable to the registration form utilized by the
Company or by the Securities Act or rules and regulations otherwise
necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective until the
earlier of such time as all the Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement have been sold or withdrawn, or 90 days; and
cause the Prospectus as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule
424 under the Securities Act; and comply with the provisions of the

by the Registration Statement in which such document is incorporated
by reference, and the underwriters, if any, copies of each such
document (including all drafts of such document which are distributed
to the underwriters, and if the subject offering is not an

Company during the 14 day period prior to the initial filing of such
document), (ii) allow such holders and underwriters a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment upon each such document, (iii) make

12
<PAGE> 163
The Company may require each seller of Registrable Securities
as to which any registration is being effected to furnish to the Company such
information regarding the distribution of such securities as the Company may
from time to time reasonably request in writing.

Each holder of Registrable Securities agrees by acquisition of
such Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company
of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 6(k) hereof,
such holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities
until such holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
Prospectus contemplated by Section 6(k) hereof, or until it is advised in
writing by the Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed, and has
received copies of any additional or supplemental filings which are
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, and, if so directed by the
Company, such holder will deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all
copies, other than permanent file copies then in such holder's possession, of
the Prospectus covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of
receipt of such notice. In the event the Company shall give any such notice,
the time periods during which such Registration Statement shall be maintained
effective shall be extended by the number of days during the period from and
including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date when
each seller of Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement
either receives the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus
contemplated by Section 6(k) hereof or is advised in writing by the Company
that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed.

SECTION 7. Registration Expenses.

(a) All expenses incident to the Company's performance of
or compliance with this Agreement will be paid by the Company, regardless of
whether the Registration Statement becomes effective, including without
limitation:

(1) all registration and filing fees (including with
respect to filings required to be made with the SEC and the NASD);

(2) fees and expenses of compliance with securities or
blue sky laws (including fees and disbursements of counsel for the

their eligibility for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions
as the managing underwriters or holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities being sold may designate);

(3) printing (including expenses of printing certificates
for the Registrable Securities in a form eligible for deposit with the
Depositary Trust Company and of printing prospectuses), messenger,

(4) fees and disbursements of counsel for the (i)
Company, (ii) the underwriters and (iii) the sellers of the

13
<PAGE> 164
(5) fees and disbursements of all independent certified
public accountants of the Company (including the expenses of any
special audit and "cold comfort" letters required by or incident to

(6) fees and disbursements of underwriters (excluding
discounts, commissions or fees of underwriters, selling brokers,
dealer managers or similar securities industry professionals relating
to the distribution of the Registrable Securities or legal expenses of
any Person other than the Company, the underwriters and the selling
holders) customarily paid by issuers;

(7) fees and expenses of other Persons retained by the 
Company; and

(8) fees and expenses associated with any NASD filing
required to be made in connection with the Registration Statement,
including, if applicable, the fees and expenses of any "qualified
independent underwriter" (and its counsel) that is required to be
retained in accordance with the rules and regulations of the NASD (all
such expenses being herein called Registration Expenses").

The Company will, in any event, pay its internal expenses
(including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and
employees performing legal or accounting duties), the expense of any annual
audit and the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of the
securities to be registered on each securities exchange on which similar
securities issued by the Company are then listed.

(b) In connection with each Registration Statement
required hereunder, the Company will reimburse the holders of Registrable
Securities being registered pursuant to such Registration Statement for the
reasonable fees and disbursements of not more than one counsel chosen by the
holders of a majority of such Registrable Securities.

SECTION 8. Indemnification.

(a) Indemnification by Company. The Company agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless each holder of Registrable Securities, its
officers, directors, employees and Agents and each Person who controls such
holder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section
20 of the Exchange Act (each such person being sometimes hereinafter referred
to as an "Indemnified Holder") from and against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses (including reasonable costs of investigation and legal
expenses) arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or
Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary
prospectus, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to
state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses arise out of or are based upon any
such untrue statement or omission or allegation thereof based upon information
furnished in writing to the Company by such holder expressly for use therein;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the
extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense arises out of or
is based upon an untrue statement

14
<PAGE> 165
or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission in any Prospectus
or preliminary prospectus, if such untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement, omission or alleged omission is corrected in an amendment or
supplement to the Prospectus or preliminary prospectus and if, having
previously been furnished by or on behalf of the Company with copies of the
Prospectus or preliminary prospectus as so amended or supplemented, such holder
thereafter fails to deliver such Prospectus or preliminary prospectus as so
amended or supplemented, prior to or concurrently with the sale of a
Registrable Security to the person asserting such loss, claim, damage,
liability or expense who purchased such Registrable Security which is the
subject thereof from such holder. This indemnity will be in addition to any
liability which the Company may otherwise have. The Company will also
indemnify underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and similar securities
industry professionals participating in the distribution, their officers and
directors and each Person who controls such Persons (within the meaning of
Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) to the same
extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Indemnified
Holders of Registrable Securities.

If any action or proceeding (including any governmental
investigation or inquiry) shall be brought or asserted against an Indemnified
Holder in respect of which indemnity may be sought from the Company, such
Indemnified Holder shall promptly notify the Company in writing, and the
Company shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel
satisfactory to such Indemnified Holder and the payment of all expenses. Such
Indemnified Holder shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such
action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of
such counsel shall be at the expense of such Indemnified Holder unless (a) the
Company has agreed to pay such fees and expenses or (b) the Company shall have
failed to assume the defense of such action or proceeding and has failed to
employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Holder in any such
action or proceeding or (c) the named parties to any such action or proceeding
(including any impleaded parties) include both such Indemnified Holder and the
Company, and such Indemnified Holder shall have been advised by counsel that a
conflict of interest exists between the Indemnified Holder and the Company (in
which case, if such Indemnified Holder notifies the Company in writing that it
elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Company, the Company
shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action or proceeding on
behalf of such Indemnified Holder, it being understood, however, that the
Company shall not, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or
separate but substantially similar or related actions or proceedings in the
same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances,
be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm
of attorneys at any time for such Indemnified Holder and any other Indemnified
Holders, which firm shall be designated in writing by such Indemnified
Holders). The Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any such
action or proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with
its written consent, or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff in any
such action or proceeding, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
such Indemnified Holders from and against any loss or liability by reason of
such settlement or judgment in accordance with this Agreement.

(b) Indemnification by Holder of Registrable Securities.
Each holder of Registrable Securities agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its directors and officers and each Person, if any, who controls the
Company within the meaning of either Section

15
<PAGE> 166
15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act to the same extent
as the foregoing indemnity from the Company to such holder, but only with
respect to information relating to such holder furnished in writing by such
holder expressly for use in any Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus. In case any
action or proceeding shall be brought against the Company or its directors or
officers or any such controlling person, in respect of which indemnity may be
sought against a holder of Registrable Securities, such holder shall have the
rights and duties given the Company and the Company or its directors or
officers or such controlling person shall have the rights and duties given to
each holder by the preceding paragraph. In no event shall the liability of any
selling holder of Registrable Securities hereunder be greater in amount than
the dollar amount of the proceeds received by such holder upon the sale of the
Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation.

The Company shall be entitled to receive indemnities from
underwriters, selling brokers, dealer managers and similar securities industry
professionals participating in the distribution, to the same extent as provided
above with respect to information so furnished in writing by such Persons
specifically for inclusion in any Prospectus or Registration Statement or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or any preliminary prospectus.

(c) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in
this Section 8 is unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 8(a) or
Section 8(b) hereof (other than by reason of exceptions provided in those
Sections) in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses
referred to therein, then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or
payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the Company on the one hand and of the Indemnified Holder on
the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such
losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company on the one hand
and of the Indemnified Holder on the other shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by the Company or by the Indemnified Holder and
the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity
to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The amount paid or payable
by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set
forth in the second paragraph of Section 8(a), any legal or other fees or
expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or
defending any action or claim.

The Company and each holder of Registrable Securities agree
that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this
Section 8(c) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred
to in the immediately preceding paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of
this Section 8(c), an Indemnified Holder shall not be required to contribute
any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the
Securities sold by such Indemnified Holder or its affiliated Indemnified
Holders and distributed to the public were

16
<PAGE> 167
offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Indemnified
Holder, or its affiliated Indemnified Holder, has otherwise been required to
pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning
of Section 11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

SECTION 9. Rule 144.

The Company covenants that it will file the reports required
to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder (or, if the Company is not
required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of any holder of
Registrable Securities made after ___________, 1996 [second anniversary of
Closing Date under Purchase Agreement], make publicly available such
information as necessary to permit sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the
Securities Act), and it will take such further action as any holder of
Registrable Securities may reasonably request, all to the extent required from
time to time to enable such holder to sell Registrable Securities without
registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by (a) Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be amended
from time to time, or (b) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by
the SEC. Upon the request of any holder of Registrable Securities, the Company
will deliver to such holder a written statement as to whether it has complied
with such information and requirements.

SECTION 10. Participation in Underwritten Registrations.

No Person may participate in any Underwritten Registration
hereunder unless such Person (a) agrees to sell such Person's securities on the
basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Persons
entitled hereunder to approve such arrangements and (b) completes and executes
all questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements
and other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

SECTION 11. Miscellaneous.

(a) Remedies. Each holder of Registrable Securities, in
addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided herein, in the
Purchase Agreement and granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be
entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The
Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any
loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Agreement
and hereby agrees to waive the defense in any action for specific performance
that a remedy at law would be adequate.

(b) No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company will not on
or after the date of this Agreement enter into any agreement with respect to
its securities which is inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of
Registrable Securities in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the
provisions hereof. The Company represents and warrants that the rights granted
to the holders of Registrable Securities hereunder do not in any way conflict
with and are not inconsistent with the rights granted to the holders of the
Company's securities under any

17
<PAGE> 168
agreement in effect on the date hereof, including, without limitation, the GECC
Registration Rights Agreement.

(c) Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this
Agreement, including the provisions of this sentence, may not be amended,
modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the
provisions hereof may not be given unless the Company has obtained the written
consent of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding Registrable
Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to departure
from the provisions hereof that relates exclusively to the rights of holders of
Registrable Securities whose securities are being sold pursuant to a
Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly affect the
rights of other holders of Registrable Securities may be given by the holders
of a majority of the Registrable Securities being sold.

(d) Notices. All notices and other communications
provided for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery,

Rogers BOA Security Document

<PAGE> 183

AGREEMENT REGARDING RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL

This Agreement is entered into as of May __, 1994 among Nestle Holdings,
Inc. ("Purchaser"), Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association
("Bank") and T. Gary Rogers and Kathleen Tuck Rogers, individually and as
trustees of the Rogers Revocable Trust and as trustees of the Four Rogers Trust
("Sellers").

RECITALS

A. Sellers and Purchaser have, or are about to, enter into a Right of First
Refusal Agreement dated as of May __, 1994 (the "Right of First Refusal
Agreement").

B. Under the Right of First Refusal Agreement, Sellers have granted to
Purchaser a right of first refusal covering all voting securities of Dreyer's
Grand Ice Cream, Inc., now or hereafter beneficially owned by the Sellers (the
"Shares").

C. The Sellers have pledged certain of the Shares as collateral for the
Sellers' obligations with respect to credit extended by the Bank. All present
and future obligations of Sellers, or any of them, to the Bank, whether direct
or contingent, are referred to herein as the "Indebtedness." Any Shares now or
hereafter pledged by the Sellers to the Bank are referred to as the "Pledged
Shares."

AGREEMENT

1. Consent and Agreement of Bank. The Bank consents to the execution of
the Right of First Refusal Agreement and agrees that the rights of Purchaser
thereunder are senior to the security interest of the Bank, to the extent and
as described in this Agreement. The Bank agrees that, so long as the Right of
First Refusal Agreement remains in effect, any sale of the Pledged Shares by
the Bank shall be conducted in accordance with the Right of First Refusal
Agreement (as modified by this Agreement). The Bank agrees to give the
Purchaser notice of any material default of the Sellers under the Indebtedness,
which default is not waived by the Bank; provided, however, that a failure to
give such notice shall not diminish the Bank's rights or obligations under this
Agreement. The Bank agrees that it may not transfer all or any portion of its
rights with respect to the Indebtedness or the Pledged Shares unless the
transferee shall agree in writing to be bound by the provisions of this
Agreement.

2. Modification of Right of First Refusal Agreement. With respect to a
proposed sale by the Bank under paragraph (d) of Section 1 of the Right of
First Refusal Agreement (entitled "Rule 144 Sales") following a default by the
Sellers under their obligations to the Bank, the provisions of the paragraph
are modified as follows (capitalized terms have the meanings defined in the
Right of First Refusal Agreement):

-1-

<PAGE> 184
(a) If the Bank provides a Rule 144 Notice to the Purchaser, the Purchaser
may, within the Rule 144 Exercise Period, provide to the Bank a notice, in
writing (the "Floor Price Notice"), stating that the Purchaser does not wish
to purchase the Rule 144 Shares at the Rule 144 Purchase Price, but stating
that the Purchaser is willing to purchase the Rule 144 Shares during the
Qualified Period at a price equal to a lower price specified by the Purchaser
in the Floor Price Notice (the "Floor Price").

(b) If the Purchaser provides the Floor Price Notice to the Bank, then the
Bank may (but is not obligated to), at any time during the Qualified Period,
do either or both of the following:

(i) sell any or all of the Rule 144 Shares pursuant to Rule 144 at a
per-share price greater than the Floor Price; or

(ii) provide written notice to the Purchaser that the Bank will sell all
or a specified portion of the Rule 144 Shares to the Purchaser at the Floor
Price. Upon the providing of such notice to the Purchaser, the Purchaser
shall be unconditionally obligated (unless prohibited by law) to purchase
the Shares specified in such notice at the Floor Price. The closing of the
sale shall occur under the time limits stated in subparagraph (e) of section
1 of the Right of First Refusal Agreement.

(c) If, during the Rule 144 Exercise Period, the Purchaser does not
provide to the Bank either the Rule 144 Exercise Notice or the Floor Price
Notice, then the Bank may, during the Qualified Period, sell any or all of
the Rule 144 Shares pursuant to Rule 144 at any commercially reasonable
price.

(d) A sale under (b)(i) or (c) above shall be otherwise without
restriction and shall not require further notice to the Purchaser; and upon
any such sale, the Right of First Refusal shall terminate with respect to the
Rule 144 Shares so sold. If at the end of the Qualified Period the Bank has
not sold all of the Rule 144 Shares as aforesaid, then the Bank shall not
thereafter sell such unsold Shares without again complying with the
provisions of the Right of First Refusal Agreement.

(e) Except as modified by this paragraph 2, all other provisions of
paragraph (d), Section 1 of the Right of First Refusal Agreement shall remain
in effect, including the right of the Purchaser to purchase the Rule 144
Shares at the Rule 144 Purchase Price.

3. Agreement of Sellers. The Sellers agree that a sale by the Bank
pursuant to the Right of First Refusal Agreement (as modified by this
Agreement) will constitute a commercially reasonable disposition of the Pledged
Shares and that if the

-2-

<PAGE> 185
Purchaser acquires any of the Pledged Shares pursuant to such sale, such
purchase shall be deemed to have been in good faith, and the Pledged Shares
shall be free and clear of any claim by the Sellers. As collateral security
for the Indebtedness, the Sellers hereby assign to the Bank and grant to the
Bank a security interest in the Sellers' rights under the Right of First
Refusal Agreement with respect to the Pledged Shares, and any amendment,
substitution or replacement thereof. The Sellers hereby grant the Bank a power
of attorney to exercise any rights of the Sellers under the Right of First
Refusal Agreement, either in the Bank's own name or in the name of the Sellers.
The Sellers will execute a financing statement appropriate to perfect the
Bank's security interest.

4. Agreements of Purchaser and Sellers. The Purchaser and the Sellers
agree that, upon receipt of written notice from the Bank that the Sellers are
in default under the Indebtedness and that the Bank has elected to sell the
Pledged Shares, any notices given to the Purchaser by the Bank under the Right
of First Refusal Agreement shall be effective as if given by the Sellers, and
if the Purchaser elects to exercise its rights under the Right of First Refusal
Agreement, the Purchaser will send to the Bank any payment due to the Sellers
under the Right of First Refusal Agreement, which the Sellers acknowledge will
satisfy the Purchaser's obligations to make payment for the Pledged Shares
which it elects to purchase under the Right of First Refusal Agreement. The
Purchaser may not transfer any of its rights under the Right of First Refusal
Agreement unless the transferee shall agree in writing to be bound by the
provisions of this Agreement.

5. Sale by the Sellers. The Bank agrees that if the Bank consents to
the terms of any sale of the Pledged Shares by the Sellers, and the Purchaser
exercises its right under the Right of First Refusal Agreement to purchase the
Pledged Shares on the terms approved by the Bank and delivers the cash or other
consideration therefor to the Bank, then the Bank shall deliver to the
Purchaser all of the Pledged Shares thereby purchased by the Purchaser and the
Bank further agrees that all the Pledged Shares so delivered to the Purchaser
shall be free and clear of all claims and security interests of the Bank. The
Sellers agree that any delivery to the Bank of the cash or other consideration
pursuant to the previous sentence shall be deemed, for purposes of the Right of
First Refusal Agreement, to be a delivery to the Sellers. Notwithstanding the
provisions of the Individual Loan Agreement among the Bank and the Sellers or
any security agreement regarding the Pledged Shares, the Bank hereby consents
to the sale of any or all of the Shares for a purchase price at least equal to
the lesser of the following: (a) an amount sufficient to repay the Bank in full
all amounts secured by the Pledged Shares, or (b) the fair market value of the
Shares to be sold (determined as the average of the reported closing sales
prices on the five preceding trading days on the NASDAQ National Market
System). The foregoing sentence shall not be deemed to modify any terms of the
Right of First

-3-

<PAGE> 186
Refusal Agreement relating to the calculation of the sales price of the Shares.

6. Certain Non-Binding Provisions. The Bank shall not be obligated under
any of the terms or conditions of the Right of First Refusal Agreement,
including the covenants of the Sellers thereunder, except as provided in this
Agreement. The Bank shall not be bound by any amendment to the Right of First
Refusal Agreement, unless the Bank consents thereto in writing.

7. Further Assurances. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
contained herein, each of the parties hereto agrees (i) to use all reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) to execute any
documents, instruments or conveyances of any kind which may be reasonably
necessary or advisable to carry out any of the transactions contemplated
hereunder and (iii) to cooperate with each other in connection with the
foregoing.

8. Specific Enforcement. The Purchaser, the Sellers and the Bank
acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state thereof having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they may be
entitled at law or equity.

<PAGE> 190

AGREEMENT REGARDING RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL

This Agreement is entered into as of May __, 1994 among Nestle Holdings,
Inc. ("Purchaser"), Bank of America National Trust and Savings Association
("Bank") and William F. Cronk, III and Janet M. Cronk, individually and as
trustees of the Cronk Revocable Trust ("Sellers").

RECITALS

A. Sellers and Purchaser have, or are about to, enter into a Right of First
Refusal Agreement dated as of May __, 1994 (the "Right of First Refusal
Agreement").

B. Under the Right of First Refusal Agreement, Sellers have granted to
Purchaser a right of first refusal covering all voting securities of Dreyer's
Grand Ice Cream, Inc., now or hereafter beneficially owned by the Sellers (the
"Shares").

C. The Sellers have pledged certain of the Shares as collateral for the
Sellers' obligations with respect to credit extended by the Bank. All present
and future obligations of Sellers, or any of them, to the Bank, whether direct
or contingent, are referred to herein as the "Indebtedness." Any Shares now or
hereafter pledged by the Sellers to the Bank are referred to as the "Pledged
Shares."

AGREEMENT

1. Consent and Agreement of Bank. The Bank consents to the execution of
the Right of First Refusal Agreement and agrees that the rights of Purchaser
thereunder are senior to the security interest of the Bank, to the extent and
as described in this Agreement. The Bank agrees that, so long as the Right of
First Refusal Agreement remains in effect, any sale of the Pledged Shares by
the Bank shall be conducted in accordance with the Right of First Refusal
Agreement (as modified by this Agreement). The Bank agrees to give the
Purchaser notice of any material default of the Sellers under the Indebtedness,
which default is not waived by the Bank; provided, however, that a failure to
give such notice shall not diminish the Bank's rights or obligations under this
Agreement. The Bank agrees that it may not transfer all or any portion of its
rights with respect to the Indebtedness or the Pledged Shares unless the
transferee shall agree in writing to be bound by the provisions of this
Agreement.

2. Modification of Right of First Refusal Agreement. With respect to a
proposed sale by the Bank under paragraph (d) of Section 1 of the Right of
First Refusal Agreement (entitled "Rule 144 Sales") following a default by the
Sellers under their obligations to the Bank, the provisions of the paragraph
are modified as follows (capitalized terms have the meanings defined in the
Right of First Refusal Agreement):

(a) If the Bank provides a Rule 144 Notice to the Purchaser, the Purchaser
may, within the Rule 144 Exercise

-1-

<PAGE> 191
Period, provide to the Bank a notice, in writing (the "Floor Price Notice"),
stating that the Purchaser does not wish to purchase the Rule 144 Shares at
the Rule 144 Purchase Price, but stating that the Purchaser is willing to
purchase the Rule 144 Shares during the Qualified Period at a price equal to
a lower price specified by the Purchaser in the Floor Price Notice (the
"Floor Price").

(b) If the Purchaser provides the Floor Price Notice to the Bank, then the
Bank may (but is not obligated to), at any time during the Qualified Period,
do either or both of the following:

(i) sell any or all of the Rule 144 Shares pursuant to Rule 144 at a
per-share price greater than the Floor Price; or

(ii) provide written notice to the Purchaser that the Bank will sell all
or a specified portion of the Rule 144 Shares to the Purchaser at the Floor
Price. Upon the providing of such notice to the Purchaser, the Purchaser
shall be unconditionally obligated (unless prohibited by law) to purchase
the Shares specified in such notice at the Floor Price. The closing of the
sale shall occur under the time limits stated in subparagraph (e) of section
1 of the Right of First Refusal Agreement.

(c) If, during the Rule 144 Exercise Period, the Purchaser does not
provide to the Bank either the Rule 144 Exercise Notice or the Floor Price
Notice, then the Bank may, during the Qualified Period, sell any or all of
the Rule 144 Shares pursuant to Rule 144 at any commercially reasonable
price.

(d) A sale under (b)(i) or (c) above shall be otherwise without
restriction and shall not require further notice to the Purchaser; and upon
any such sale, the Right of First Refusal shall terminate with respect to the
Rule 144 Shares so sold. If at the end of the Qualified Period the Bank has
not sold all of the Rule 144 Shares as aforesaid, then the Bank shall not
thereafter sell such unsold Shares without again complying with the
provisions of the Right of First Refusal Agreement.

(e) Except as modified by this paragraph 2, all other provisions of
paragraph (d), Section 1 of the Right of First Refusal Agreement shall remain
in effect, including the right of the Purchaser to purchase the Rule 144
Shares at the Rule 144 Purchase Price.

3. Agreement of Sellers. The Sellers agree that a sale by the Bank
pursuant to the Right of First Refusal Agreement (as modified by this
Agreement) will constitute a commercially reasonable disposition of the Pledged
Shares and that if the Purchaser acquires any of the Pledged Shares pursuant to
such sale, such purchase shall be deemed to have been in good faith,

-2-

<PAGE> 192
and the Pledged Shares shall be free and clear of any claim by the Sellers. As
collateral security for the Indebtedness, the Sellers hereby assign to the Bank
and grant to the Bank a security interest in the Sellers' rights under the
Right of First Refusal Agreement with respect to the Pledged Shares, and any
amendment, substitution or replacement thereof. The Sellers hereby grant the
Bank a power of attorney to exercise any rights of the Sellers under the Right
of First Refusal Agreement, either in the Bank's own name or in the name of the
Sellers. The Sellers will execute a financing statement appropriate to perfect
the Bank's security interest.

4. Agreements of Purchaser and Sellers. The Purchaser and the Sellers
agree that, upon receipt of written notice from the Bank that the Sellers are
in default under the Indebtedness and that the Bank has elected to sell the
Pledged Shares, any notices given to the Purchaser by the Bank under the Right
of First Refusal Agreement shall be effective as if given by the Sellers, and
if the Purchaser elects to exercise its rights under the Right of First Refusal
Agreement, the Purchaser will send to the Bank any payment due to the Sellers
under the Right of First Refusal Agreement, which the Sellers acknowledge will
satisfy the Purchaser's obligations to make payment for the Pledged Shares
which it elects to purchase under the Right of First Refusal Agreement. The
Purchaser may not transfer any of its rights under the Right of First Refusal
Agreement unless the transferee shall agree in writing to be bound by the
provisions of this Agreement.

5. Sale by the Sellers. The Bank agrees that if the Bank consents to
the terms of any sale of the Pledged Shares by the Sellers, and the Purchaser
exercises its right under the Right of First Refusal Agreement to purchase the
Pledged Shares on the terms approved by the Bank and delivers the cash or other
consideration therefor to the Bank, then the Bank shall deliver to the
Purchaser all of the Pledged Shares thereby purchased by the Purchaser and the
Bank further agrees that all the Pledged Shares so delivered to the Purchaser
shall be free and clear of all claims and security interests of the Bank. The
Sellers agree that any delivery to the Bank of the cash or other consideration
pursuant to the previous sentence shall be deemed, for purposes of the Right of
First Refusal Agreement, to be a delivery to the Sellers. Notwithstanding the
provisions of the Individual Loan Agreement among the Bank and the Sellers or
any security agreement regarding the Pledged Shares, the Bank hereby consents
to the sale of any or all of the Shares for a purchase price at least equal to
the lesser of the following: (a) an amount sufficient to repay the Bank in full
all amounts secured by the Pledged Shares, or (b) the fair market value of the
Shares to be sold (determined as the average of the reported closing sales
prices on the five preceding trading days on the NASDAQ National Market
System). The foregoing sentence shall not be deemed to modify any terms of the
Right of First Refusal Agreement relating to the calculation of the sales price
of the Shares.

-3-

<PAGE> 193
6. Certain Non-Binding Provisions. The Bank shall not be obligated under
any of the terms or conditions of the Right of First Refusal Agreement,
including the covenants of the Sellers thereunder, except as provided in this
Agreement. The Bank shall not be bound by any amendment to the Right of First
Refusal Agreement, unless the Bank consents thereto in writing.

7. Further Assurances. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions
contained herein, each of the parties hereto agrees (i) to use all reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be

documents, instruments or conveyances of any kind which may be reasonably
necessary or advisable to carry out any of the transactions contemplated
hereunder and (iii) to cooperate with each other in connection with the
foregoing.

8. Specific Enforcement. The Purchaser, the Sellers and the Bank
acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction to prevent breaches of the
provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and

"Purchase Agreement"). For purposes of this form of legal opinion,
the term Nestle Principal Agreements means the Purchase Agreement, the
Warrant Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement.

<PAGE> 198
3. Each of the Purchaser and NICC is duly qualified to
do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which it owns or leases property or conducts business, except
where the failure to so qualify or be licensed would not have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition or business of the Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

4. The execution, delivery and performance of each of
the Nestle Principal Agreements have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action of the Purchaser, and each of the Nestle Principal Agreements
has been duly executed and delivered by the Purchaser.

5. The execution, delivery and performance of the
Distributor Agreement have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action of NICC, and the Distributor Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by NICC.

6. Each of the Nestle Principal Agreements constitutes a
valid and legally binding obligation of the Purchaser, enforceable against the
Purchaser in accordance with its terms except as such enforceability may be
limited by (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other
laws relating to or affecting the rights of creditors generally, (ii) equitable
principles (whether considered in an action at law or in equity) which provide,
among other things, that the remedies of specific performance and injunctive
and other forms of equitable relief are subject to equitable defenses and to
the discretion of the court before which any proceedings therefor may be
brought and (iii) the unenforceability under certain circumstances under law or
court decisions of provisions providing for the indemnification of or
contribution to a party with respect to a liability where such indemnification
or contribution is contrary to public policy.

7. The Distributor Agreement constitutes a valid and
legally binding obligation of NICC, enforceable against NICC in accordance with
its terms except as such enforceability may be limited by (i) bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other laws relating to or affecting
the rights of creditors generally, (ii) equitable principles (whether

respect to a liability where such indemnification or contribution is contrary

8. The execution and delivery of each of the Nestle
Principal Agreements, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
thereby, will not conflict with or constitute a breach of, or default under,
the charter or bylaws of the Purchaser or, to the best of my knowledge after
due inquiry, any material agreement, indenture or other instrument to

which the Purchaser is a party or by which it is bound, or any law,
administrative regulation or court or governmental decree applicable to the
Purchaser.
