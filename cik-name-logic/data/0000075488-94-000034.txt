Item 5. Other Events

A. Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant - Diablo Canyon Rate Case
Settlement

As previously disclosed, in August 1994 the Division of Ratepayer
Advocates (DRA) of the California Public Utilities Commission
(CPUC) filed a petition seeking to modify the CPUC's 1993 order
refusing to reconsider the Diablo Canyon Rate Case Settlement
(Diablo Settlement). The DRA requested that the CPUC modify its
earlier decision for the purpose of reopening the Diablo Settlement
to consider modification of the payment methodology included in the
Diablo Settlement. In addition, the DRA recommended that the price
paid for electricity generated by the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power
Plant (Diablo Canyon) be frozen at the 1994 price level. On
October 19, 1994, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) of the CPUC
issued a ruling on the DRA's petition, scheduling a hearing for
December 20, 1994 on the DRA's petition, and ordering the parties
to submit affidavits and exhibits in support of or opposed to DRA's
motion prior to the hearing.

On November 16, 1994, the Company filed a motion with the CPUC
requesting that the hearing be delayed pending discussions among
the parties which might resolve the issues raised by the DRA's
petition without further litigation. The Company's motion was
supported by the DRA, the California Attorney General and several
other parties and groups representing energy consumers. If the
Company's motion is granted, the hearing on the DRA's petition
would be rescheduled to January 13, 1995.

SIGNATURE

Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of
