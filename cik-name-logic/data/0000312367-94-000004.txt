FIRST SECURITY EARNS RECORD NET INCOME FOR 1993 

SALT LAKE CITY -- First Security Corporation (FSC; OTC/NASDAQ symbol: 
FSCO) today announced record net income totaling $125.18 million for 
1993, excluding one-time merger-related charges of $11.12 million after 
tax associated with the acquisition of First National Financial 
Corporation (FNFC - Albuquerque, New Mexico), up $24.83 million (24.7%) 
from $100.34 million earned in 1992. Reported net income, including the 
FNFC merger charges, was a record $114.06 million for 1993, up $13.71 
million (13.7%) from $100.34 million earned in 1992. Net income for the 
year, excluding the FNFC merger charges, generated a 1.36% return on 
average assets (ROAA) and a 15.97% return on average equity (ROAE) for 
1993, compared with a 1.18% ROAA and a 14.75% ROAE for 1992. Net income 
per share, excluding the FNFC merger charges, was $2.61 for 1993, up 
$0.45 (20.8%) from $2.16 for 1992. FSC's financial statements have been 
restated to reflect the pooling-of-interests merger with FNFC and the 
adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard 109, "Accounting 
for Income Taxes".
Reported net income, including the FNFC merger charges, was a record 
$114.06 million for 1993, up $13.71 million (13.7%) from $100.34 million 
earned in 1992. This net income generated a 1.24% ROAA and a 14.55% ROAE 
for 1993, compared with the 1.18% ROAA and a 14.75% ROAE for 1992. Net 
income per share was $2.38 for 1993, up $0.22 (10.2%) from $2.16 for 
1992.
Spencer F. Eccles, chairman and chief executive officer of the 
regional banking and financial services company, said "1993 was the most 
profitable year in First Security's 65 year history and the seventh 
straight year in which its earnings have increased." Mr. Eccles 
explained, "For 1993, growth in net income was due primarily to continued 
strong growth in interest-earning assets, plus a significant reduction in 
the provision for loan losses combined with a lower cost of funds and 
higher noninterest income." Mr. Eccles pointed out, "First Security's 
assets also reached a significant milestone in 1993 when total assets 
passed the $10 billion dollar mark for the first time to total $10.21 
billion by year end".
Net income for the fourth quarter of 1993, excluding one-time FNFC 
merger-related charges of $11.12 million after tax, was $32.19 million, 
up $5.07 million (18.7%) from the fourth quarter of 1992. Net income, 
excluding the FNFC merger charges, generated a 1.32% ROAA and a 15.37% 
ROAE, compared with a 1.25% ROAA and a 15.18% ROAE for the year-ago 
quarter. Net income per share, excluding the FNFC merger charges, was 
$0.66, up $0.08 (13.8%) from $0.58 one year ago.
Reported net income for the fourth quarter of 1993, including the FNFC 
merger charges, was $21.06 million, down $6.05 million (22.3%) from the 
fourth quarter of 1992. This generated a 0.87% ROAA and a 10.06% ROAE, 
compared with a 1.25% ROAA and a 15.18% ROAE for the year-ago quarter. 
Net income per share was $0.43, down $0.15 (25.9%) from $0.58 one year 
ago.
FSC's net interest income on a fully-taxable equivalent (FTE) basis 
totaled $411.57 million for 1993, up $27.71 million (7.2%) from 1992, and 
was $108.79 million for the fourth quarter of 1993, up $11.04 million 
(11.3%) from the fourth quarter of 1992. These improvements included the 
impact of: sustained growth in consumer and residential mortgage loans, 
reflecting FSC's position as the leading lender in both Utah and Idaho; a 
favorable shift in the funding mix towards noninterest-bearing deposits 
and equity; the positive impact of the current short-term interest rate 
environment; an increase in investment securities; and the effects of 
recent acquisitions. The FTE adjusted net interest margin was 4.95% for 
1993 and 5.01% for the fourth quarter, compared with 5.00% for 1992 and 
5.03% for the year-ago quarter.
Noninterest income totaled $167.16 million for 1993, up $23.12 million 
(16.1%) from 1992, and was $46.45 million for the fourth quarter, up 
$7.87 million (20.4%) from the year-ago quarter. These increases 
resulted largely from growth in service charges on accounts, real estate 
loan service fees, third-party computer processing fees, and insurance 
commissions.
Noninterest expenses, including the FNFC merger charges, totaled 
$386.15 million for 1993, up $46.69 million (13.8%) from 1992, and were 
$116.02 million for the fourth quarter, up $27.11 million (30.5%) from 
the year-ago quarter. The rise in noninterest expenses was due to growth 
resulting from FSC's acquisitions and ongoing operations, plus numerous 
one-time events including the cost of acquisitions and the related 
restructuring charges.
FSC's efficiency ratio (the ratio of noninterest expenses to the sum 
of FTE net interest income and noninterest income), excluding the FNFC 
merger charges, was 64.80% for 1993 and 67.57% for the fourth quarter, 
compared with 64.30% for 1992 and 65.22% for the year-ago quarter, 
respectively. The Corporation's efficiency ratio, including the FNFC 
merger charges, was 66.72% for 1993 and 74.74% for the quarter.
The provision for loan losses totaled $11.68 million for 1993, down 
$18.59 million (61.4%) from 1992, and was $4.65 million for the fourth 
quarter, down $289 thousand (5.9%) from the year-ago quarter. Net loan 
chargeoffs included in this provision amounted to $11.86 million for the 
year, down $20.97 million (63.9%) from 1992, and $4.77 million for the 
quarter, down $4.10 million (46.2%) for the year-ago quarter.
Nonperforming assets, which include nonaccruing and renegotiated loans 
plus other real estate owned (ORE), were reduced to $52.82 million at 
December 31, 1993, down $54.64 million (50.8%) from December 31, 1992. 
Nonperforming assets equaled 0.80% of total loans and ORE at year-end 
1993, decreasing from 1.90% at year-end 1992.
The reserve for loan losses was $134.85 million at December 31, 1993, 
up $7.00 million (5.5%) from December 31, 1992. Merger transactions 
added $7.18 million in reserves since the end of 1992. The reserve 
equaled 2.06% of total loans and 370.93% of nonaccruing loans at year-end 
1993, compared with corresponding ratios of 2.28% and 159.87% at year-end 
1992.
Stockholders' equity in FSC increased to $835.73 million at December 
31, 1993, up $116.12 million (16.1%) from December 31, 1992. This was 
due primarily to record earnings, combined with the effects of 
acquisitions. The Corporation's market capitalization (market price per 
share times shares outstanding) was $1.25 billion at year-end 1993, 
essentially unchanged from year-end 1992. The ratio of total 
stockholders' equity to total assets was 8.18% at December 31, 1993, up 
from 8.09% at year-end 1992. For the same periods, the ratio of tangible 
common equity to tangible total assets was 8.07% at year-end 1993, up 
from 7.93% at year-end 1992. Prior period equity ratios have been 
restated due to FSC's acquisition of FNFC plus adoption of Statement of 
Financial Accounting Standard 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes". FSC 
adopted this standard in 1993, the cumulative effect of which reduced 
equity by $7.59 million over the period of December 31, 1988 to December 
31, 1992.
Other significant financial information at December 31, 1993, compared 
with December 31, 1992, included:
* Assets totaled $10.21 billion, up $1.32 billion (14.8%).
* Loans (net of unearned income but before the reserve for loan 
losses) totaled $6.56 billion, up $944.31 million (16.8%). For 1993, the 
Corporation, excluding its New Mexico and Nevada banks, originated $2.09 
billion in real estate secured loans, passing through $927 million into 
secondary markets, while retaining most of the servicing. Consumer loans 
have also continued to show record activity, reflecting FSC's position as 
a leading consumer lender.
* Deposits totaled $7.50 billion, up $635.25 million (9.2%).
* The loan to deposit ratio was 87.44%, up from 81.78%.
* The bid price of FSC common stock was $25.75 per share at the close 
of the market on December 31, 1993, down $1.50 (5.5%) from $27.25 per 
share on December 31, 1992. The ratio of market price to book value per 
share was 149.36% on a book value per share of $17.24 at year-end 1993, 
compared with 173.02% on a book value per share of $15.75 year-end 1992.

Restatements of FSC's Financial Statements
FSC's financial statements have been restated to reflect the November 
19, 1993 pooling-of-interests merger with First National Financial 
Corporation (FNFC) and its wholly-owned subsidiary First National Bank in 
New Mexico (with $1.13 billion in deposits and 26 branches, headquartered 
in Albuquerque, New Mexico). The Corporation's financial statements have 
also been restated to reflect FSC's adoption of Statement of Financial 
Accounting Standard 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes", which requires an 
asset and liability approach to financial reporting of income taxes that 
differs from the method previously required by generally accepted 
accounting principles.

Acquisitions
During 1993, FSC completed 9 acquisitions, expanding its existing bank 
operations in Utah, Oregon, and Wyoming, and acquiring new bank 
subsidiaries in New Mexico and Nevada (see attached exhibit). These 
acquisitions added a total of 39 branches and approximately $1.5 billion 
in deposits to FSC's operations. Except for the merger with First 
National Financial Corporation in New Mexico, these acquisitions were not 
material under applicable accounting rules to FSC's consolidated 
operations, so historical amounts were not restated.
Currently, FSC has announced four pending acquisitions in 1994, 
expanding its bank operations in Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming. These 
acquisitions will add approximately 12 branches and $200 million in 
deposits to FSC's operations.

National & Regional Economy
Economic growth nationwide was strong in the fourth quarter of 1993, 
and this improved momentum is expected to carry into 1994. The 
significantly lower interest rates reduced the borrowing costs of certain 
existing credit outstanding. The drop in financing costs also helped 
invigorate new consumer loan demand for mortgage and automobile credit, 
while businesses are increasing borrowing for capital equipment and 
commercial real estate. Accordingly, new jobs are being created, 
residential construction is expanding, and consumer expenditures are 
rising rapidly. Inflation is likely to remain near the current 3 
percent, so any rise in interest rates should not have a noticeable 
impact on 1994 credit demands.
The Intermountain area's economic growth led the nation in 1993. The 
following four states were among the top five in job gains: Utah, Idaho, 
New Mexico, and Nevada. In each of these states, rapid net in-migration 
was matched with new job opportunities. Employment gains, combined with 
a favorable mortgage-financing climate, resulted in a strong housing 
market and expanded consumer spending, particularly for consumer durable 
goods. This formula for prosperity for many western states appears to be 
solidly intact for 1994.

First Security Corporation
FSC is the largest financial services organization headquartered in 
the Intermountain region. Incorporated in 1928, it is the oldest 
multistate bank holding company in the United States. FSC operates 245 
full-service bank branches in Utah, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, Wyoming 
and Nevada. Other subsidiaries include a leasing company, two insurance 
companies, an investment management company, a full-service broker/dealer 
operation, and an information technology subsidiary.
