Item 5. Other Events

As previously reported (see New England
Telephone and Telegraph Company's ("New England
Telephone") Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 1993), on November 15,
1993, NYNEX Corporation ("NYNEX") and
New England Telephone filed suit in the United
States District Court for the District of Maine
seeking an order declaring that section 533(b)
of the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984
is unconstitutional and permanently enjoining
the United States from enforcing section 533(b)
against NYNEX. Section 533(b) prohibits NYNEX
from providing video programming to subscribers
in areas where New England Telephone or New York
Telephone Company provide service. On December
8, 1994, the court issued an opinion and order
declaring that section 533(b) is
unconstitutional and stating that it will enjoin
the enforcement of section 533(b) against NYNEX
and its subsidiaries within the NYNEX service
area. The Department of Justice is expected to
appeal.
