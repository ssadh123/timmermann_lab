ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

A. On November 21, 1994, the Company consummated the previously 
announced acquisition of the MARINE 3 jack-up drilling rig. 
In lieu of utilizing its Common Stock as consideration for
the purchase, the Company elected to acquire the rig for cash 
in the amount of $5,500,000. This election was made in 
light of recent weakness in the Company's Common Stock price 
and the ongoing merger discussions with Falcon Drilling 
Company, Inc.
