warranties made by Paribas in this Agreement, Capital acknowledges that there

ARTICLE IV.
OTHER COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

4.1 CONFIDENTIALITY. (a) Paribas expressly acknowledges that it
has been informed of, obtained or been given access to certain information,
material, documents and records generally not known outside Capital, including
trade secrets, with respect to Capital and/or its business policies, forecasts,
plans, prospects, customers, competitors, suppliers, pricing strategies,
business files and records, and financial information ("Proprietary
Information"). Paribas understands and acknowledges that the unauthorized use
or disclosure of any such Proprietary Information could seriously damage and
interfere with Capital's business and business prospects. Therefore, Paribas
expressly covenants and agrees with Capital that Paribas will not directly or
indirectly use in any unauthorized manner or disclose to any third parties any
Proprietary Information at any time within two years after the date hereof.
For purposes hereof,

-5-
<PAGE> 8
Proprietary Information does not include information, materials, documents or
records that (i) are or become generally available to the general public other
than as a result of disclosure by Paribas, (ii) was available to or known by
Paribas on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure to Paribas, or
(iii) do not relate to Capital's business, financial condition, operations,
assets, plans or prospects. Capital expressly acknowledges and agrees that
Paribas and its Affiliates may make loans to or investments in, or have other
commercial relationships with, competitors of Capital or its Affiliates or
other Entities engaged in the same general business as Capital and its
Affiliates and that the making of loans to or investments in, or having other
commercial relationships with, such Entities shall not constitute a breach of
this Agreement.

(b) Paribas acknowledges that the damages that would be suffered
by Capital or its Affiliates as a result of any breach of the provisions of
this Section 4.1 may not be calculable and that an award of a monetary judgment
for such a breach would be an inadequate remedy. Consequently, Capital and its
Affiliates shall have the right, in addition to any other rights they may have,
to obtain, in any court of competent jurisdiction, injunctive relief to
restrain any breach or threatened breach of any provision of this Section 4.1
and neither Capital nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated to post a bond
or other security in seeking such relief. This remedy is in addition to
damages for any Loss directly or indirectly suffered by Capital and reasonable
attorneys' fees.

(c) The covenants of Paribas contained in this Section 4.1 are
independent of any covenants of Capital contained herein or in any other
document or instrument delivered in connection herewith or pursuant hereto, and
any breach by Capital of any such covenant shall not justify any breach by
Paribas of its covenants under this Section 4.1.

4.2 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Each party to this Agreement shall,
upon the request of the other party from time to time after the date hereof,
execute and deliver to the other party all such further documents and
instruments, and shall do, or use its reasonable efforts to cause to be done,
such other acts as the other party may reasonably request more completely to
consummate and make effective the transaction contemplated hereby.

4.3 EXPENSES. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
each party to this Agreement shall bear its respective expenses incurred in
connection with the preparation, execution and performance of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including all fees and expenses of
agents, representatives, counsel and accountants.

-6-
<PAGE> 9
4.4 TERMINATION OF OTHER AGREEMENTS. Capital, Paribas, and CRSS
each agree that the Shareholders' Agreement, the Stock Purchase Agreement and
the Tax Allocation Agreement are hereby terminated for all purposes, and shall
have no further force or effect.

4.5 ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION. If at any time or from time to
time during the period beginning on the date hereof and ending twelve months
after such date, Capital or CRSS issues or otherwise transfers an amount of
Common Equity (as defined below), or agrees to issue or otherwise transfer an
amount of Common Equity pursuant to an agreement that obligates the other party
or parties to such agreement to acquire such Common Equity and pursuant to
which the issuance or transfer of such Common Equity is ultimately consummated
(a "Third Person Transfer"), equal to at least 3% in the aggregate of the
currently issued and outstanding Common Equity of Capital, to a Person who is
not an Affiliate of Capital or CRSS, for consideration (the "Third Person
Transfer Consideration") in excess of the Redemption Price, then Capital shall
pay to Paribas additional consideration for the Stock (the "Additional
Consideration"). The determination of whether and to what extent the Third
Person Transfer Consideration exceeds the Redemption Price, and what amount, if
any, of Additional Consideration Capital must pay to Paribas as a result of
such excess, shall be made by calculating both the Third Person Transfer
Consideration and the Redemption Price on a per share basis (i.e., by dividing
the Third Person Transfer Consideration and the Redemption Price by the number
of shares of Common Equity for which the Third Person Transfer Consideration or
the Redemption Price, respectively, was paid, after adjustment for any changes
in the number of outstanding shares of Common Equity due to any stock dividend,
stock split, reverse stock split or recapitalization in which the number of
outstanding shares of Common Equity is changed without the receipt of any
consideration for such shares by Capital), and subtracting the per share
Redemption Price from the per share Third Person Transfer Consideration (the
"Per Share Difference"). If the Per Share Difference is positive, then Capital
shall be obligated to pay to Paribas an amount equal to the Per Share
Difference multiplied by the number of shares (as adjusted as described above)
of Stock being purchased pursuant to this Agreement. In the event that Capital
at any time becomes obligated to pay to Paribas any Additional Consideration,
then with respect to any subsequent Third Party Transfer occurring within the
period set forth above the Redemption Price shall thereafter be deemed to equal
the sum of the Redemption Price plus such Additional Consideration paid with
respect to the application of this Section 4.5 to any subsequent Third Party
Transfer.

<PAGE> 10
For purposes of thisSection 4.5, "Common Equity" shall mean both
Common Stock and common equity interests in Capital the value of which
fluctuate in a manner similar and directly correlative to the value of the
Common Stock. Common Equity does not include any debt or preferred equity
security of Capital the value of which depends primarily on the right to
receive payments of interest or preferred dividends or repayment of the stated
or face value of such security upon maturity or liquidation. Appropriate
adjustments will be made in calculating any Additional Consideration to reflect
any differences in value between Common Stock and the applicable class of
Common Equity.

For purposes of this Section 4.5, a merger, consolidation or share
exchange to which Capital is a party shall be treated as an issuance or other
transfer of Common Equity for the purposes of this Section 4.5. In addition,
in the event of the sale by Capital of all or substantially all of its assets,
for purposes of this Section 4.5 there shall be deemed to have been a transfer
of Common Equity in consideration of the amount that would be available for
distribution in respect of such Common Equity (after payment or satisfaction of
all liabilities of Capital and payment of all distributions in respect of any
preferred equity security of Capital) if Capital were liquidated in accordance
with applicable law as of the date of such sale of all or substantially all of
its assets.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Capital shall not be obligated to pay
to Paribas any Additional Consideration in either of the following
circumstances:

a. any merger, consolidation, share exchange, share
reclassification, liquidation, or other transaction
involving issuances, exchanges or transfers of Common Equity
to Affiliates of Capital or CRSS or to CRSS' shareholders,
including without limitation in connection with any
reorganization or restructuring of CRSS, Capital or any of
their Affiliates; or

b. any transfer or issuance of Common Equity to directors,
officers, employees, agents or independent contractors of
CRSS, Capital, or any of their Affiliates, including without
limitation for the purpose of compensating, incentivizing,
or providing retirement or other benefits to same.

If some or all of the Third Person Transfer Consideration is not cash,
then the fair market value of the non-cash portion of such consideration shall
be determined by (i) the good faith negotiation of Paribas and Capital, or if
Paribas and Capital

-8-
<PAGE> 11
fail to reach agreement on the fair market value of the non-cash portion of
such consideration within thirty (30) days after the date Capital provides to
Paribas written notice of the Third Person Transfer (the "Negotiation Period"),
then (ii) an investment banking firm that is (A) knowledgeable and experienced
concerning the type of non-cash consideration in question and (B) otherwise
reasonably satisfactory to both Paribas and Capital. If Paribas and Capital
shall not agree upon an investment banking firm within seven (7) days after the
end of the Negotiation Period, each of Paribas and Capital shall select one
investment banking firm and the two investment banking firms so selected shall
select a third investment banking firm for such purpose. The determination of
such fair market value by an investment banking firm or firms hereunder shall
be final and binding upon Paribas and Capital. The fees of such investment
banking firm or firms shall be shared equally by Paribas and Capital.

4.6 MUTUAL RELEASE. Each of Capital and CRSS, on the one hand,
and Paribas, on the other hand, hereby release, acquit, forever discharge and
covenant not to sue, and shall not permit any of their past, present and future
Affiliates (Capital, CRSS and their Affiliates being collectively referred to
herein as "Capital's Releasing Parties," and Paribas and its Affiliates being
collectively referred to herein as "Paribas' Releasing Parties") to sue,
Paribas' Releasing Parties and Capital's Releasing Parties, respectively, from
and with respect to any and all claims, demands, Losses, damages, Liabilities,
actions, and causes of action of any kind and nature whatsoever that in any way
arise from, are or will be connected with, or relate to the Stock Purchase
Agreement, the Shareholders' Agreement, the Tax Allocation Agreement, and the
transactions, relationships, rights, benefits, duties, obligations, and
liabilities contemplated thereby or arising therefrom, including, without
limitation, those for specific performance, injunctive relief, actual,
punitive, special, statutory or other damages, and those for other or further
relief connected in any manner with any of the above, including without
limitation, interest, attorneys' fees and costs of litigation (collectively,
"Claims"); provided, that neither Capital's Releasing Parties nor Paribas'
Releasing Parties are releasing any Claims arising under, or in connection with
the transaction contemplated by, this Agreement. It is understood and agreed
that the rights and obligations of Paribas and its Affiliates and Capital and
its Affiliates set forth in the Hopewell finance documents and the Westwood
finance documents are not released, acquitted or discharged and are not the
subject of the covenant not to sue. IT IS EXPRESSLY AGREED THAT THE CLAIMS
RELEASED HEREBY INCLUDE THOSE ARISING FROM OR IN ANY MANNER ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER TORTIOUS CONDUCT OF ANY OF THE PARTIES RELEASED.

harmless Capital and its successors and assigns (Capital and such successors
and assigns are collectively referred to as "Capital's Indemnified Persons")
from and against, and shall reimburse Capital's Indemnified Persons for, each
and every Loss, imposed on or incurred by Capital's Indemnified Persons,
directly or indirectly, relating to, resulting from or arising out of any
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Paribas under this Agreement,
or any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other obligation
of Paribas under this Agreement or any other agreement or document delivered by
Paribas pursuant hereto, including any expenses incurred in connection with the
enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement.

5.2 INDEMNIFICATION BY CAPITAL. Capital unconditionally,
absolutely and irrevocably agrees to and shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Paribas and its successors and assigns, (Paribas and such successors
and assigns are collectively referred to as "Paribas' Indemnified Persons")
from and against, and shall reimburse Paribas' Indemnified Persons for, each
and every Loss paid, imposed on or incurred by Paribas' Indemnified Persons,
directly or indirectly, relating to, resulting from or arising out of any
inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Capital under this Agreement,
or any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant, agreement or other obligation
of Capital under this Agreement or any other agreement or document delivered by
Capital pursuant hereto, including any expenses incurred in connection with the
enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement.

5.3 NOTICE AND DEFENSE OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS. If any Proceeding
shall be brought or asserted under this Article against an indemnified party or
any successor thereto (the "Indemnified Person") in respect of which indemnity
may be sought under this Article from an indemnifying person or any successor
thereto (the "Indemnifying Person"), the Indemnified Person shall give prompt
written notice of such Proceeding to the Indemnifying Person who shall assume
the defense thereof, including the employment of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Person and the payment of all expenses;
provided, that any delay or failure so to notify the Indemnifying Person shall
relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations hereunder only to the
extent, if at all, that it is prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure.
In no event shall any Indemnified Person be required to make any expenditure or
bring any cause of action to enforce the Indemnifying Person's obligations and
liability under and

-10-
<PAGE> 13
pursuant to the indemnifications set forth in this Article. In addition,
actual or threatened action by a Governmental Authority or other Person is not
a condition or prerequisite to the Indemnifying Person's obligations under this
Article. The Indemnified Person shall have the right to employ separate
counsel in any of the foregoing Proceedings and to participate in the defense
thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of
the Indemnified Person unless the Indemnified Person shall in good faith
determine that there exist actual or potential conflicts of interest which make
representation by the same counsel inappropriate. The Indemnified Person's
right to participate in the defense or response to any Proceeding should not be
deemed to limit or otherwise modify its obligations under this Article. In the
event that the Indemnifying Person, within twenty days after notice of any such
Proceeding, fails to assume the defense thereof, the Indemnified Person shall
have the right to undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such
Proceeding for the account of the Indemnifying Person, subject to the right of
the Indemnifying Person to assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Person at any time prior to the
settlement, compromise or final determination thereof. Anything in this
Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the Indemnifying Person shall not,
without the Indemnified Person's prior written consent, settle or compromise
any Proceeding or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any
Proceeding for anything other than money damages paid by the Indemnifying
Person. The Indemnifying Person may, without the Indemnified Person's prior
written consent, settle or compromise any such Proceeding or consent to entry
of any judgment with respect to any such Proceeding that requires solely the
payment of money damages by the Indemnifying Person and that includes as an
unconditional term thereof the release by the claimant or the plaintiff of the
Indemnified Person from all liability in respect of such Proceeding.

5.4 LIMITATIONS. An Indemnifying Person shall have no liability
under this Article unless notice of a claim for indemnity, or written notice of
facts as to which an indemnifiable Loss is expected to be incurred, shall have
been given within one (1) year after the date hereof, except that Capital may
give notice of and may make a claim based on a breach by Paribas of the
representations and warranties in Sections 2.1, 2.2 and the second sentence of
Section 2.3, and Paribas may give notice of and may make a claim based on a
breach by Capital of the representations and warranties in Section 3.1 and the

Exhibit 99.1

INDEPENDENT POWER SUBSIDIARY NOW 100% OWNED BY CRSS

HOUSTON, February 1, 1994 _ CRSS Inc. (NYSE:CRX), announced today the
repurchase of the minority owned shares of its independent power subsidiary,
CRSS Capital, Inc. The 19% minority interest was previously owned by Paribas
North America, Inc. Total consideration paid for the shares amounted to
$17,000,000. Paribas had originally acquired the minority interest on June 30,
1989.

Commenting on the purchase, Bruce W. Wilkinson, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, stated "We are very enthusiastic about the future of the independent
power industry. This purchase clearly supports our strategic goal of building
a larger independent power portfolio and enhancing shareholder value. During
the last few fiscal years, we have seen an impressive growth in earnings from
this part of our Company. We are delighted to own 100% going forward."

Paribas, for its part, stated that it is entirely satisfied with the results of
its investment. In particular, Paribas is pleased with the close relationship
that it has developed with CRSS Capital through this investment and looks
forward to working with CRSS Capital on future activities of mutual interest.

CRSS Capital contributed over $17 million to CRSS Inc.'s Fiscal 1993
consolidated operating income before interest expense. Additionally, Capital
is expected to significantly contribute to Fiscal 1994 earnings. It currently
owns 7 facilities in commercial operation producing 1,340 equivalent megawatts
in aggregate. CRSS Capital recently announced its selection by the Bonneville
Power Administration for a 460 megawatt project under its Resource Option
Program.

In addition to developing, owning and operating energy and manufacturing
facilities for utility and industrial customers, CRSS is also one of the
largest design and construction companies in the nation.
