extent that the foregoing occurs prior to the Closing; and

(d) lease obligations from and after the Closing Date
with respect to the land, building, fixtures and improvements
located at 1577 Spring Hill Road, Vienna, Virginia 22812.

2.4 Determination of Cash Settlement Adjustment: The Cash
Settlement Adjustment shall equal the amount (which may be either
a negative or positive number) of the net cash flow received by
and expended by Sellers in the course of PSG's and the Foreign
Subsidiaries' operations between September 24, 1993 and the
Closing, determined as follows:

(a) Cash Settlement Statement: Not more than thirty
(30) days after the Closing Date, Sellers will prepare and
deliver to Purchasers a proposed Cash Settlement Statement
reflecting the net change from September 24, 1993 through the
Closing Date in the accounts carried on PSG's internal
consolidating balance sheet as "Cash," "Intercompany Account -
Sequa Corporation," "Intercompany Account - ARC & Aerospace," and
"Intercompany Account - Janus". In determining the net change in
the foregoing accounts (1) non-cash transactions, such as any
allocation of Sequa general and administrative expense and costs
of funds, shall be ignored, (2) cash and cash equivalents held in
bank accounts outside of the United States of America on the
Closing Date shall be excluded from the calculation, (3) Sellers
shall be credited with the amount of petty cash held by PSG that
is retained by PSG at the Closing, (4) the funds received on
behalf of PSG as a result of the payments made under Sections
2.1(a)(1) and (a)(2) hereof shall be excluded and (5) the change
in the account balances shall be presented by major transaction
type in the format shown in Exhibit 2.4 hereto. A negative Cash
Settlement Adjustment shall result in a reduction from the
Aggregate Purchase Price by such amount. Conversely, a positive
Cash Settlement Adjustment shall result in an addition to the
Aggregate Purchase Price by such amount.

(b) Review by Enterprises: Following receipt of the
proposed Cash Settlement Statement, Enterprises shall have a
period of thirty (30) days to review the proposed Cash Settlement
Statement. During such period, Sellers shall make available
their accounting staff and their internal auditors to respond to
any questions of Enterprises relating to the proposed Cash
Settlement 6

<PAGE>
Statement and the entries thereon. At or before the end of such
thirty (30) day period, Enterprises will either: (i) accept the
proposed Cash Settlement Statement in its entirety, in which case
the final Cash Settlement Adjustment will equal the balance set
forth on the proposed Cash Settlement Statement; or (ii) deliver
to ARC notice and a detailed explanation of those items in the
proposed Cash Settlement Statement which Enterprises disputes, in
which case the aggregate amounts not affected by the disputed
items will be deemed to be as set forth on the proposed Cash
Settlement Statement. If Enterprises delivers the notice
referred to in (ii) above, then within a period of thirty (30)
days from the date of such delivery, the parties will attempt to
resolve in good faith any disputed items, and the Cash Settlement
Adjustment will equal the balance set forth on the Cash
Settlement Statement produced through such resolution. Failing
such resolution, the unresolved disputed items will be referred
to final binding resolution to a nationally recognized firm of
certified public accountants other than Deloitte & Touche and
Arthur Andersen & Co., selected by lot by Sellers and
Enterprises, and the Cash Settlement Adjustment will equal the
balance set forth on the Cash Settlement Statement produced
through such resolution.

(c) Payment of and Interest on Amount of Cash
Settlement Adjustment: If the Aggregate Purchase Price plus or
minus the Cash Settlement Adjustment, as the case may be, is
greater than the payment made at Closing (as described in Section
2.l(b) hereof), then Enterprises will pay ARC by means of wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by ARC the amount of such difference plus interest to date on the
amount of the difference within five (5) business days after
final agreement by the parties as to the Cash Settlement
Statement. If the Aggregate Purchase Price plus or minus the
Cash Settlement Adjustment, as the case may be, is less than the
payment made at Closing (as described in Section 2.1(b) hereof),
then Sellers will pay to Enterprises the amount of such
difference plus interest on the amount of the difference within
five (5) business days after final agreement by the parties as to
the Cash Settlement Statement. In either case, the rate of
interest shall be equal to the Applicable Rate. Interest shall
accrue for the period from the Closing Date to the day before the
date on which the payment provided for under this Section 2.4(c)
is paid.

2.5 Payment of Estimated Purchase Price: Not later than the
Closing Date, Purchasers and Sellers shall agree upon a
preliminary estimate of the amount of the Cash Settlement
Adjustment, based upon information supplied by Sellers as of the
most recent date practicable. If such preliminary estimate
indicates that Sellers have received more cash flow than they
have expended for PSG's and the Foreign Subsidiaries' operations
since September 24, 1993, such that the preliminary estimate
indicates that the Cash Settlement Adjustment will be a negative
7

<PAGE>
number, then the term "Preliminary Cash Settlement Adjustment"
shall equal such negative number and onthe Closing Date,
Enterprises will pay, by means of a wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by ARC, an amount equal
to the Estimated PSG Price less the amount of the Preliminary
Cash Settlement Adjustment. Otherwise, the Preliminary Cash
Settlement Adjustment shall be deemed to equal zero and on the
Closing Date, Enterprises will pay by means of a wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by ARC the
Estimated PSG Price.

Disclosure Package, there is no action, suit or claim pending
(other than routine claims for benefits) or, to Sellers'

ERISA Plan. Neither Sellers nor PSG has received any written
notice of or otherwise knows of any direct or indirect pending or

(7) All of the ERISA Plans currently comply, and
have complied during the past five years, in all material
respects, both as to form and operation, with the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable Federal laws
other than for any such failure to comply that would not result
in any material 16

<PAGE>
cost or financial liability to PSG or the ERISA Plan and that
would not adversely affect the tax qualification of the ERISA
Plan. A favorable determination as to the qualification under
Section 401(a) of the Code of each of the Pension Plans as
amended through the dates set forth on Schedule 3.2(i) of the
Disclosure Package was made by the IRS, and a recognition of
exemption from Federal Income Taxation under Section 501(a) of
the Code of each of the funded Welfare Plans, if any, has been
made by the IRS. Schedule 3.2(i) of the Disclosure Package sets
forth each application made by PSG or that PSG currently plans to
make to request a determination as to the qualification of the
Pension Plans, as amended. Schedule 3.2(i) of the Disclosure

notify their respective suppliers and customers of the change in
ownership and corporate name as soon as reasonably practicable
following the Closing hereunder.

6.5 Non-Compete:

(a) In order to assure that the Purchasers will
realize the value and goodwill inherent in the acquisition of PSG and
the Foreign Subsidiaries, Sequa, Chromalloy and ARC agree with the
Purchasers that neither Sequa, Chromalloy, ARC, nor any of their
Affiliates shall:

(1) for a period of five (5) years
following the Closing Date, engage anywhere in the United States of

42

<PAGE>
America or anywhere in other countries in which PSG conducted
business at any time during the two (2) years prior to the Closing,
in the business of providing services of the types presently or in
the past three (3) years provided by PSG or the Foreign Subsidiaries,
provided that Sequa, Chromalloy, ARC, and their Affiliates may
acquire assets or stock of companies collaterally engaged in the
business of providing such services to the extent that the assets
involved in such business or the revenues derived from such business
are not in excess of 30% of the assets or revenues of the acquired
business; and

(2) directly or indirectly for a period of
two (2) years following the Closing with respect to any Employee of
PSG or the Foreign Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, solicit or
induce such person to terminate his or her employment with PSG or the
Foreign Subsidiary or to accept employment with Sequa, Chromalloy,
ARC or any of their Affiliates unless: (i) six (6) months has elapsed
since the last date of employment of such person with PSG or the
Foreign Subsidiaries; or (ii) such person was not personally
solicited by Sequa, Chromalloy, ARC or any of their Affiliates or any
agent engaged to act for any of them and such person has sought
employment with Sequa, Chromalloy, ARC or any of their Affiliates in
response to a general solicitation which is not directed to specific
individuals or companies and which solicitation is made through
newspaper advertisements or similar general forms of solicitation.

(b) If any provision of paragraph (a) of this
Section, as applied to any party or to any circumstances, is adjudged
by a court to be invalid or unenforceable, the same will in no way
affect any other provision of the said paragraph (a) or any other
part of this Agreement, the application of such provision in any
other circumstances or the validity or enforceability of this
Agreement. If any such provision, or any part thereof, is held to
be unenforceable because of the duration of such provision or the
area covered thereby, the parties agree that the court making such
determination will have the power to reduce the duration and/or
geographic area of such provision, and/or to delete specific words
or phrases, to the extent only that in its reduced form such
provision will then be enforceable and will be enforced. Upon breach
of any provision of paragraph (a) of this Section, the Purchasers
will be entitled to injunctive relief, since the remedy at law would
be inadequate and insufficient. In addition, the Purchasers will be
entitled to such damages as they can show themselves to have
sustained by reason of such breach.

6.6 Use of Trademark and Trade Names: Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchasers, PSG and the
Foreign Subsidiaries may continue to use the name "ARC Professional
Services Group" and related trademarks, corporate names, and
tradenames incorporating "Atlantic Research", "Sequa", "ARC" and the
stylized "ARC" and "Sequa" logos: (i) in

43

<PAGE>
displays, signage and postings for two months after the Closing Date
to the extent such displays, signage or postings exist on the Closing
Date; (ii) with respect to all existing Contracts for the term of
such Contracts; (iii) for a period of two years, to state PSG's and
the Foreign Subsidiaries' former affiliation with ARC or Sequa (e.g.,
"formerly ARC Professional Services Group"); and (iv) to the extent
the trade names, trademarks, service marks or logos of any of
Sellers' Affiliates or of Sellers appear on PSG's or any Foreign
Subsidiary's stationary, packaging materials, supplies or inventory
on hand as of the Closing Date or on order at the time of the
Closing, until such is exhausted. Purchasers shall also have the
right to use the trade names and trademarks set forth in Schedule 6.6
hereto without limitation.

6.7 Taxes:

(a) Responsibility for Certain Taxes: Taxes
shall be apportioned as follows: (i) Sellers shall be responsible for
and shall pay, when due, all federal, state, foreign and local income
taxes of Sellers and PSG arising from the sale of PSG and the Foreign

for completing the tax returns for and, except as provided in Section
6.7(a)(i) hereof, for payment of all Taxes of PSG and the Foreign
Subsidiaries, other than federal and foreign income taxes, to the
extent that such Taxes are not due and payable on or before the

by Sellers under Section 6.7(a)(i) hereof shall be paid by Sellers
to PSG or the Foreign Subsidiaries immediately prior to Purchasers'
filing of any such tax returns; (iii) Sellers are responsible for
completing the tax returns for, and for payment of, all federal and
foreign income taxes for any taxable period ending on or before the

consolidated basis, the tax returns for and for payment of the state
income taxes of PSG for the States of California, Florida, Illinois

returns for all periods ending on or before or including the Closing
Date, provided, however, that the amount of such state income taxes
attributable to the operations of PSG during fiscal year 1993 on a
stand-alone basis, other than the amounts, if any, payable by Sellers
under Section 6.7(a)(i) hereof, shall be paid by PSG to Sellers

furnish to Sellers calculations as to the amounts, if any, payable
by Sellers pursuant to Section 6.7(a)(i) and Section 6.7(a)(ii)
hereof, together with copies of the returns pursuant to which such

the case of any Straddle Period, the income taxes of the Foreign
Subsidiaries for the pre-Closing period shall be computed as if such
period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date, where
applicable. Any foreign income taxes for a Straddle Period shall be
apportioned between the pre-Closing and the post-Closing period on
the basis of taxable income or taxable loss, as determined from an
interim closing (solely for tax purposes) of the permanent books and
records of the Foreign Subsidiaries, effective as of the close of
business on the Closing Date.

(c) Straddle Period: Filing of Returns: Any
income tax returns of the Foreign Subsidiaries for a Straddle Period

a Straddle Period, Purchasers shall notify Sellers of the portion of
the income taxes due with respect to the portion of that period on
or prior to the Closing Date, computed pursuant to paragraph (b) as
if that period were a separate taxable period, and shall provide
Sellers with its calculations used to arrive at that amount. Sellers
shall remit to Purchasers the amount of such income tax allocable to
Sellers pursuant to Section 6.7(b) hereof for such period for such
income tax return equal to the excess of. (i) the amount of such
income tax allocable to Sellers; over (ii) amounts previously paid
or provided for through estimated income taxes or deposits paid by
or on behalf of the Foreign Subsidiaries with respect to such income
tax for such period. Sellers shall pay such amounts no later than
fifteen (15) business days following its receipt of a notice from
Purchasers.

(d) Section 338(h)(10) Election: Sellers and
Purchasers mutually agree to make an election under Section
338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable election under state or
local law) with respect to PSG. Purchasers and Sellers agree that

Tax Returns in a manner consistent with such values.

agreement between Sellers and any of PSG and the Foreign Subsidiaries
and any similar arrangements shall be and hereby are terminated as
of the Closing Date and will have no further effect

45

months from and after the Closing Date, Sellers shall cause any

Mellon National Bank N.A. (or to any successor account) to be paid
over as promptly as possible, which generally shall be considered to
be one (1) business day following such account being credited with
such amounts, to an account designated by PSG, provided that if it
is subsequently determined that any amount so paid over was not
payable to PSG or any of the Foreign Subsidiaries, Purchasers shall
cause such amount to be repaid to Sellers as promptly as possible but
in no event longer than five (5) business days after such
determination, together with interest at the Applicable Rate from the
date such amount was credited to the account designated by PSG until
the day before such amount is repaid to Sellers. Sellers shall cause

Section 1.1502-6, or any similar provision of state, local or foreign
law; (ii) as a transferee or successor; (iii) by contract; or (iv)
otherwise.

9.3 Procedure for Claims: If any of Sequa, Chromalloy
or ARC or CSC, Enterprises or Consulting (including, in any case,
parent corporations, subsidiaries and Affiliates) (the "Claimant")
desires to make a claim against any party obligated to provide
indemnification to any of Sellers Indemnitees or Purchasers
Indemnitees under Section 9.1 or 9.2 hereof, respectively (any such
party, the "Indemnitor"), with respect to any matter covered by such
indemnification obligation, the procedures for making such claim
shall be as follows:

(a) Third Party Claims: If the claim is for
indemnification with respect to any action, suit, proceeding or
demand at any time instituted or asserted against, or made upon, the
Claimant by or on behalf of a third party (a "Third Party Claim"),
the Claimant will give prompt written notice to the Indemnitor of the
institution, assertion or making of the Third Party Claim, and the
nature thereof. Upon such notice being given the claim specified
herein shall be deemed to have been made for purposes of this
Agreement. The Indemnitor shall, within ten (10) days after receipt
of such notice, give written notice to the Claimant as to whether or
not the Indemnitor accepts the responsibility to indemnify Claimant
with respect to the Third Party Claim. If the Indemnitor accepts the
responsibility to indemnify the Claimant with respect to the Third
Party Claim, the Claimant will then grant to the Indemnitor
authority, and the Indemnitor will proceed, at its sole expense, to
cure, defend, compromise or settle the Third Party Claim, in the name
of the Claimant or otherwise; provided, however, that any such
defense of the Third Party Claim shall be conducted by counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Claimant, and that the Indemnitor
shall not enter into any final compromise or settlement of the Third
Party Claim without the prior written consent of Claimant. If the
Indemnitor denies the responsibility to indemnify the Claimant with
respect to the Third Party Claim, or if the Indemnitor fails to
respond in a timely manner to Claimant's notice of the Third Party
Claim or fails to proceed in a diligent and timely manner to cure,
defend, compromise or settle a Third Party Claim for which it has
accepted responsibility pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the
Claimant may then proceed to cure, defend, compromise or settle

55

<PAGE>
such Third Party Claim as it shall in its sole discretion deem to be
advisable, without prejudice to any right to indemnification Claimant
may have against the Indemnitor with respect thereto, whether
pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise, and in such event the
liability of the Indemnitor to the Claimant for indemnification with
respect to such Third Party Claim shall be determined by a final and
nonappealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction,
or by written consent of the Indemnitor.

(b) Non-Third Party Claims: If the claim is for
indemnification with respect to a matter other than a Third Party
Claim, the Claimant will give prompt written notice to the Indemnitor
of such claim, setting forth with reasonable particularity the basis,
nature and dollar amount thereof. Upon such notice being given the
claim specified therein shall be deemed to have been made for
purposes of this Agreement. The Indemnitor shall, within thirty (30)
days after receipt of such notice, give written notice to the
Claimant as to whether or not the Indemnitor accepts the
responsibility to indemnify Claimant with respect to such claim. If
the Indemnitor accepts the responsibility to indemnify the Claimant
with respect to such claim, the Indemnitor shall immediately pay to
the Claimant the amount set forth in the notice thereof, with such
payment to be made in immediately available funds, and upon actual
receipt of such payment by the Claimant such claim shall be deemed
to have been satisfied. If the Indemnitor denies the responsibility
to indemnify the Claimant with respect to such claim, or if the
Indemnitor fails to respond in a timely manner to notice of such
claim, the liability of the Indemnitor to the Claimant for
indemnification with respect to such claim shall be determined by
arbitration as provided under Section 10.10 hereof

9.4 Certain Indemnification Limitations:
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Purchasers Indemnitees nor
Sellers Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification from Sellers
or Purchasers, respectively, pursuant to Sections 9.1 (a) through (e)
hereof or Sections 9.2(a) through (h) hereof for any Losses covered
thereunder until such time as the aggregate of all such Losses
incurred by Purchasers Indemnitees or Sellers Indemnitees,
respectively, exceed $350,000. From and after such time, Purchasers
Indemnitees or Sellers Indemnitees, respectively, shall be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to Sections 9.1 or 9.2 hereof for all
Losses covered thereunder (other than such first $350,000 of Losses). 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchasers Indemnitees shall be
entitled to any indemnification from Sellers pursuant to Section
9.2(i) hereof to the extent of any and all Losses covered thereunder
without regard to such threshold. In no event whatsoever shall the
total indemnification obligations hereunder exceed the Aggregate
Purchase Price plus or minus the Cash Settlement Adjustment.

(a) Sequa, Chromalloy and ARC hereby agree that
they shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, protect and make

representation, or the breach of any warranty, by ARC, Chromalloy or
Sequa contained in Section 3.2(a) hereof or Schedule 3.2(a) of the
Disclosure Package or in Section 3.2(r)(3) or (4) hereof or in
Schedule 3.2(r) of the Disclosure Package that relates to the
collectibility of Receivables reflected on the Balance Sheet (any
such inaccuracy, falsehood or breach, a "Receivables Breach");

(2) the inaccuracy or falsehood of any
representation, or the breach of any warranty, by ARC, Chromalloy or
Sequa contained in Section 3.2(s) hereof or Schedule 3.2(s) of the

(the "Receivables Allowance"). If the aggregate amount of
Uncollectible Receivables exceeds the Receivables Allowance as a
result of either a Receivables Breach or Disallowance Event, then
Purchasers, PSG and the Foreign Subsidiaries shall be entitled to
indemnification and payment pursuant to Section 9.5(a) hereof for all
Uncollectible Receivables covered thereunder other than such first
$3,417,068 of Uncollectible Receivables.

thirty (30) day period, the amount of Uncollectible Receivables which
Sellers do not contest, to the extent that the amount of such
Uncollectible Receivables and all Uncollectible Receivables exceeds
or has exceeded the Receivables Allowance.

assignee against such defect or deficiency in title.

9.7 Indemnification Based Upon Net Damage: The duty
and obligation of either Sellers or Purchasers to provide
indemnification hereunder shall be limited to the net amount of any
Losses actually sustained and/or paid. In determining the net amount

indemnification is required, the amount of indemnification shall be
increased to include any federal or state or franchise tax liability
incurred or reasonably expected to be incurred by a party as a direct
result of such indemnification. If any tax benefit expected to be

is not in fact incurred, then an adjustment shall be made to
compensate the other party.

by the Purchasers and Sellers hereunder shall be effected by payment
of cash or delivery of a certified or official bank check in the

indemnification under Sections 9.1 or 9.2 hereof must be asserted in

(3) within thirty (30) days after
expiration of the applicable statute of limitation, as such has been

(i) hereof.
59

<PAGE>

arbitrated, and shall be referred by the complaining party to the

to appear or be represented at the arbitration proceedings after due
notice in accordance with the Arbitration Rules, then the arbitrator
may nevertheless render a decision in the absence of that party, such
a decision shall have the same force and effect as if the absent
party had been present.

arbitrated, nor the views or opinions of any persons concerning them,

7. Regulatory Approvals: All consents, approvals,
authorizations and other requirements prescribed by any law,
regulation or rule which must be obtained or satisfied by
Purchasers and which are necessary for the execution and delivery
by Purchasers of the Agreement and all other documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated in the Agreement
have been obtained or satisfied.

8. Litigation: To the best of my knowledge there is no
judgment, order writ, injunction or decree of any federal, state,
local or foreign court or governmental agency to which Purchasers,
their business, or assets are subject that could affect their
ability to perform their respective obligations under the
Agreement.

I am admitted to the practice of law before the United
States Supreme Court and several lower federal courts as well as
the state courts of Kansas, Pennsylvania and the District of
Columbia. My opinion with respect to foreign qualifications
contained in numbered paragraph 1 is based solely upon a review of
unofficial compilations of the provisions of the statutory laws of
the relevant jurisdictions. I expressly disclaim any obligation
or undertaking to update or modify the opinion as a consequence of
any future changes in the applicable laws or in the facts bearing
upon the opinion.

I call to your attention that I am not admitted to the
practice of law in the state of Nevada or in the United Kingdom;
however I am familiar with the General Corporation Law of the
State of Nevada and have made such inquiries as I consider
necessary to render the opinions expressed herein with respect to
the General Corporation Law of the State of Nevada and the United
Kingdom.

This opinion is limited to the effect of the present state
of the General Corporation Law of the State of Nevada and the
United Kingdom and the laws of the relevant jurisdictions, to the
extent set forth in the preceding two paragraphs. In rendering
the opinion, I assume no obligation to revise or supplement this
opinion should the present laws, or the interpretation thereof, be
changed.
