FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

NL ANNOUNCES FIRST QUARTER 1994 RESULTS

HOUSTON, TEXAS -- April 25, 1994 -- NL Industries, Inc. (NYSE:NL) announced
a net loss for the first quarter of 1994 of $6.4 million, or $.12 per share,
on sales of $202 million compared to a net loss in the first quarter of 1993
of $13.5 million, or $.27 per share, on sales of $199 million.

Operating income of Kronos' titanium dioxide pigments business in the first
quarter of 1994 declined $1.8 million compared with the same 1993 period as
the effects of lower average selling prices in the first quarter of 1994 were
only partially offset by higher sales volumes and higher production levels.
Primarily as a result of improved pricing in Europe, Kronos' first quarter
1994 average selling prices were higher than the last three quarters of 1993,
but were still approximately 3% lower than the first quarter of 1993. J.
Landis Martin, President and CEO, stated "We are optimistic that recent price
increase announcements in the United States and Europe should result in
improved margins later this year."

Rheox's operating income for the first quarter of 1994 was $1.0 million higher
than the comparable 1993 period primarily as a result of higher sales volumes
and slightly lower operating costs.

Corporate expenses, net were lower than 1993 due to a $20 million gain related
to the 1994 settlement of the Company's lawsuit against Lockheed Corporation,
partially offset by higher environmental remediation costs.

Interest expense in the first quarter of 1994 was lower than the comparable
1993 period due to lower indebtedness and lower Deutsche mark interest rates
partially offset by higher interest rates on the Company's Senior Notes.

Income tax expense differs from a normally expected rate primarily because of
losses in certain countries for which no benefit is currently available.

NL Industries, Inc. is a major international producer of titanium dioxide
pigments and specialty chemicals.
