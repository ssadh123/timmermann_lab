Item 5. Other Information

On September 8, 1994, Administrative Law Judges (the "ALJs") of
the Public Service Commission of the State of New York (the "PSC") issued a
recommended decision ("RD") to the PSC with respect to the Company's electric
rate plan for the three year period beginning December 1, 1994. The ALJs agreed
with the Company's proposed 11% return on common equity and its proposal to
freeze base electric rates for the first rate year. While no explicit
recommendation was made, the RD implies that base rates could remain frozen for
the second rate year as well. Although base electric rates would be frozen,
annual rate increases in these years of approximately 1% and 2%, respectively,
can be expected to result from the operation of the Company's fuel cost
adjustment ("FCA") mechanism. The FCA captures, among other amounts, any
increases in the cost of fuel above the level reflected in base rates, and 
amounts to be recovered or refunded to ratepayers in excess of $15 million
which may result from the reconciliation of revenue, certain expenses and earned
performance incentives.

With respect to the third rate year beginning December 1, 1996,
the ALJs determined that it was not appropriate for them to issue a
recommendation since, in their opinion, the Company's revenue requirements for
this third year cannot be precisely determined at this time. Alternatively,
the ALJs encouraged the Company and the other parties in this proceeding to
negotiate a settlement concerning any rate increase for this third rate year. 
If a settlement is not reached, the RD contemplates that the Company would file
a subsequent proposal with the PSC at the appropriate time. The Company had 
requested an overall increase of 4.3% for the third rate year.

The staff of the PSC ("Staff") and other intervening parties
had filed testimony in response to the Company's rate proposal. Staff 
concurred with the Company's proposal for an 11% return on common equity in 
each of the three years. However, Staff recommended an overall zero percent 
rate increase for the

first two years, contrasted with the Company's proposal for a zero percent base
rate increase and FCA adjustments of 1% and 2% in each of these years,
respectively, as described above. Staff did not make a firm recommendation 
for the level of rate relief in the third year. However, Staff's proposal 
incorporated the principles of the 1989 Rate Moderation Agreement, including 
the full recovery of the Rate Moderation Component.

The Consumer Protection Board and Long Island Power Authority
had also jointly filed testimony in which they proposed that current electric
rates be reduced. Other intervenors proposed various adjustments to the
Company's rate proposal.

The PSC is expected to issue a final order on the Company's
rate proposal in November 1994. The Company is unable to predict the ultimate
outcome of this rate proceeding.
