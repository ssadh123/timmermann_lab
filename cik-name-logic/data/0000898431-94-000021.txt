FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:

SOUTHBURY, CONNECTICUT, August 12, 1994 -- AMDURA Corporation
(NYSE:ADU) today announced that the United States District Court
for the District of Colorado has issued an order in an action
styled Saul Jones, et al. v. AMDURA Corporation (Case No. 91-K-
1521), which is an appeal of certain issues in a case originally
filed in January 1990. The case was filed prior to AMDURA's
filing of a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code. The District Court's order reinstates
certain class action claims which had been disallowed by the
Bankruptcy Court prior to the confirmation of AMDURA's bankruptcy
Plan of Reorganization which became effective in October 1991. 
The order also reverses the Bankruptcy Court's order confirming
the Plan. The effect of the District Court's order, if upheld,
would be to require the Bankruptcy Court to reopen hearings on
the confirmation of AMDURA's Plan of Reorganization.

The actions underlying the District Court's order purported to
have been brought on behalf of a class of persons who purchased
AMDURA's pre-bankruptcy preferred or common stock during certain
pre-petition periods, and alleged claims under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 to the effect that AMDURA's public business
and financial disclosures were materially false or misleading
during those periods.

AMDURA is considering its legal alternatives in light of the
District Court's order.

Pursuant to AMDURA's Plan of Reorganization, the Company was
reorganized around its wholly owned subsidiaries, The Crosby
Group, Inc. and The Harris Waste Management Group, Inc. Crosby
and Harris were not included in AMDURA's Chapter 11 bankruptcy
filing and were not in bankruptcy.

AMDURA Corporation, headquartered in Southbury, Connecticut,
operates primarily through Crosby and Harris. Crosby,
headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, designs and manufactures
lifting equipment, hardware and accessories for use in energy,
construction, manufacturing, marine and transportation
applications. Harris, headquartered in Peachtree City, Georgia,
is engaged in manufacturing and marketing equipment for plastic,
paper and ferrous and non-ferrous scrap metal processing, as well
as waste recycling and solid waste disposal.
