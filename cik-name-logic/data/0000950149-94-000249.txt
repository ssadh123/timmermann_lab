(a) Based on a 10% discount factor on the estimated present value of
future operating lease payments.

(b) Safeway's ratios of earning to fixed charges during 1993 were
adversely affected by a $54.9 million charge to operating and 
administrative expense for severance payments made to retail employees in
the Alberta, Canada division as part of a voluntary employee buyout. 
Excluding this charge, the ratios of earnings to fixed charges in 1993 
were 1.60 for the 36 weeks ended September 11, 1993, and 1.66 for the 52 
weeks ended January 1, 1994.

(c) Safeway's ratio of earnings to fixed charges for 1991 was adversely
affected by a $115 million charge to operating profit in connection with 
the bankruptcy of AppleTree Markets, Inc. ("AppleTree"). The $115 million
charge was an estimate of the eventual net lease and related cash
payments which Safeway expected to make over a period of up to 16 years
in connection with any liability Safeway may have on the leases assigned
to AppleTree as part of the sale of the Company' former Houston division.
Excluding this charge, the ratio of earnings to fixed charges for 1991
would have been 1.44.
