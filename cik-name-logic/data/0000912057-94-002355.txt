ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS.

Control Data Systems, Inc. (the "Registrant" or the "Company") has
announced results of its second quarter for fiscal 1994. The Company reported
1994 second quarter net earnings of $0.7 million, or $0.05 per share, on
revenues of $131.3 million. This compares to net earnings of $4.3 million, or
$.32 per share, on revenues of $114.9 million for the second quarter of 1993.
While revenues were 14 percent greater than the second quarter of 1993, the
profit levels reached in the second quarter fell below the company's internal
plan.

"We are pleased that we have been able to once again report a profitable
quarter," said Jim Ousley, president and chief executive officer of Control Data
Systems, "but we must continue to stabilize the operating profit margins
required for success in our systems integration business model."

The company's second quarter profit levels were influenced by difficulties
in certain European countries, the continuing deferral of application
development and systems integration projects in Asia, and the redirection of a
few commercial integration projects in the United States.

"In light of these second quarter factors, and the projected weakness we
customarily experience in the third quarter, our current expectations for 1994
now appear to be below our previous expectations," said Ousley. "Gross margins,
while slightly improved over the first quarter, will continue to be
significantly lower than the previous year when proprietary hardware sales were
a much more significant part of the revenue stream.

"Our experience in the second quarter also suggests that additional steps
need to be taken to sustain acceptable profitability, which is a function both
of continued revenue growth in our new business and effective controls on
expenses and resources," said Ousley.

"When we embarked on our strategy to transition the business, we knew it
would be difficult," said Ousley. "We are very encouraged, however, by the
significant orders received during the second quarter from new customers in the
Fortune 500 and major international organizations. Prospect activity remains
extremely strong and demand for large scale network and application integration,
particularly in the area of electronic commerce, appears promising. Although the
realignment of our resources to support these efforts remains a major challenge,
we are confident in the viability and size of this market opportunity as well as
our ability to address it."
