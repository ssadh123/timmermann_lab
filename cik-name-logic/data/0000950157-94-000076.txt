Item 5. Other Events.

As previously announced, the Board of Directors of
the Company authorized its management to pursue strategic
alternatives for maximizing value for its shareholders,
including the possible sale of the Company. At a special
meeting on June 8, the Board reviewed several acquisition
proposals and voted to pursue a proposal submitted by Dean
Foods Company to acquire all the outstanding shares of the
Company at a maximum cash price of $20 per share, subject to
a number of contingencies, including an agreement with Pro-
Fac Cooperative, Inc. ("Pro-Fac") covering the purchase of
various assets owned by Pro-Fac but used by the Company in
the conduct of its business asset (which is currently
subject to significant disputes between the Company and Pro-
Fac), negotiation by Dean Foods of an agreement with Hormel
Foods Corporation for the purchase of the Nalley's Fine
Foods Division of Curtice Burns, clearance of the
transaction by appropriate government agencies, negotiation
of definitive agreements and approval of any transaction by
the Company's shareholders. No assurance can be given that
the contingencies associated with the Dean Foods proposal
will be satisfied, or that any transaction for the
acquisition of Curtice Burns will be consummated. A copy of
the Company's press release dated June 10, 1994, is attached
as Exhibit 1. 

On June 9, 1994, the Company received a letter
from Pro-Fac in which Pro-Fac asserted that it was entitled
to receive half the net proceeds of any sale of the Company
to a third party. The Company believes this assertion to be
completely without merit. See Note 1 to the unaudited
financial statements included in the Company's Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 26, 1994,
for a discussion of other disagreements between the Company
and Pro-Fac. A copy of Pro-Fac's letter is attached as
Exhibit 2.

CURTICE BURNS FOODS BOARD VOTES TO PURSUE
ACQUISITION PROPOSAL FROM DEAN FOODS COMPANY

ROCHESTER, NEW YORK June 10, 1994--The Board of

Directors of Curtice Burns Foods (AMEX: CBI), as previously

announced, authorized its management to pursue strategic

alternatives for maximizing value for its shareholders,

including the possible sale of the Company. At a special

meeting on June 8, the Board reviewed several acquisition

proposals which had been received in response to active

solicitation by the Company and its investment bankers. The

Board voted to pursue a proposal submitted by Dean Foods to

acquire all the outstanding common stock of Curtice Burns at

a maximum cash price of $20.00 per share, subject to the

satisfactory resolution of specified contingencies, the more

significant of which are described as follows. Dean

requires a satisfactory resolution for termination of the

agreement between Curtice Burns and Pro-Fac Cooperative

covering the purchase of various assets owned by Pro-Fac but

used by Curtice Burns in the conduct of its business. 

Presently, there are significant disputes between Curtice

Burns and Pro-Fac as to amounts due upon termination of the

agreement. Other contingencies to closing the acquisition

include Dean's negotiation of a definitive agreement for the

<PAGE>6

sale of Nalley's Fine Foods Division to Hormel Foods

Corporation of Austin, Minnesota, clearance of the

transaction by appropriate government agencies, negotiation

of definitive agreements and approval of any transaction by

Curtice Burns shareholders.

"Curtice Burns is very pleased with the opportunities

created by this potential transaction," said J. William

Petty, President and Chief Executive Officer of Curtice

Burns. "Clearly this transaction could represent not only

significant value to our shareholders, but also sustained

markets for the crops of the Pro-Fac grower community

throughout the country and enhanced career opportunities for

our employees."

In commenting on today's announcement, Howard M. Dean,

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Dean Foods Company,

said, "Dean Foods has long felt that the Curtice Burns

product lines to be acquired in this proposed transaction

represent a strategic fit, particularly the fruit pie

filling and vegetable businesses. Curtice Burns production

capacity in the Northeast will offer important growth

opportunities for our Birds Eye frozen vegetable business

acquired earlier this year. As part of our proposal to

Curtice Burns, we have entered into a letter of intent

whereby Hormel Foods Corporation will acquire the Nalley's

Fine Foods Division of Curtice Burns."

<PAGE>7

Joel W. Johnson, President and Chief Executive Officer

of Hormel, expressed pleasure with the proposed purchase. 

"The acquisition of these high quality, well-recognized

brands in the Northwest will provide incremental volume to

our already successful and growing Grocery Products Division

and Foodservice Group," he stated. "Hormel Foods is

impressed with the consistently strong, performance of the

Nalley's organization."

Me. Petty concluded by saying, "Dean Foods and Hormel

are financially sound, growth-oriented food companies with

strategic commitments to the product lines they would

acquire from Curtice Burns. However, no assurances can be

given at this time that the contingencies associated with

the Dean Foods proposal or the Hormel transaction will be

satisfied, or that any transaction with any third party for

the acquisition of Curtice Burns will be consummated."

Curtice Burns Foods processes and markets 21 product

lines of regional branded, private label and foodservice

products through seven autonomously managed divisions

located throughout the United States and Western Canada. In

its most recent quarterly report to shareholders, Curtice

Burns reported net earnings in the nine months ending

March '94 of $9,559,000 or $1.11 per share, compared to

$4,197,000 or $.49 per share in the same period of the prior

year. Net earnings from operations in the nine months

ending March '94 excluding non-recurring gains or losses 

<PAGE>8

were $6,795,000 or the equivalent of $.79 per share,

compared to $4,826,000 or the equivalent of $.56 per share

in the same period of the prior year - an increase of 41

percent.

Board of Directors
Curtice-Burns Foods, Inc.
90 Linden Place
Rochester, New York 14603

Dear Directors:

I write on behalf of the Pro-Fac Board of Directors to
confirm that, in the event of the sale of Curtice Burns to a
third party, Pro-Fac will vigorously enforce its rights to
one half the net proceeds of such transaction. In light of
Pro-Fac's clear right to a profit split and the joint
venture relationship that has operated and grown the Curtice
Burns business for over thirty years using Pro-Fac's equity,
facilities and other resources, Curtice Burns cannot
lawfully organize a sale to claim all the profit of such
transaction for itself.

Sincerely,

Roy A. Myers
General Manager
