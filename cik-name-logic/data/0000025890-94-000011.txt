and Chemical Bank, as trustee (herein called the "Trustee," which
term includes any successor Trustee under the Indenture), to
which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference
is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights,
limitations of rights, duties, obligations and immunities
thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the
Securities, and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and
are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of
a series designated on the face hereof, limited in aggregate
principal amount to $100,000,000.

In the event of redemption of this Security in part only, a
new Security or Securities of this series for the unredeemed
portion hereof will be issued in the name of the Holder hereof
upon the cancellation hereof.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of this
series shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the
Securities of this series may be declared due and payable in the
manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.

The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein
provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the
rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the
Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the
Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with the
consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series
to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions
permitting the Holders of specified percentages in aggregate
principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time
Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the Securities, to
waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the
Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their
consequences. Any such consent or waiver by or on behalf of the
Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such
Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of any
Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in
exchange hereof or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such
consent or waiver is made upon this Security.

No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this
Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation
of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the
principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on this Security
at the times, place, and rate, and in the coin or currency,
herein prescribed.

As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is
registrable on the Security Register of the Company, upon
surrender of this Security for registration of transfer at the
office or agency of the Company maintained for such purpose in
The City of New York or at such other office or agency of the
Company as may be maintained for such purpose, duly endorsed by,
or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly
executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in
writing, and thereupon one or more new Securities, of authorized
denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will
be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.

The Securities of this series are issuable only in registered
form without coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral
multiple thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain
</PAGE>

<PAGE>7
limitations therein set forth, the Securities are exchangeable
for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities
of a different authorized denomination, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

No service charge shall be made to the Holders for any
registration of transfer or exchange or redemption of Securities,
but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection
therewith.

Prior to and at the time of due presentment of this Security
for registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any
agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose
name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all
purposes, whether or not this Security be overdue, and neither

notice to the contrary.
