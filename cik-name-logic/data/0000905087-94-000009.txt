Item 5. Other Events

On December 1, 1994, First Empire State Corporation

("First Empire") consummated its acquisition (the "Merger") of

Ithaca Bancorp, Inc. ("Ithaca Bancorp"), Ithaca, New York, and

the merger (the "Bank Merger") of Citizens Savings Bank, F.S.B.

("Citizens Savings Bank"), Ithaca Bancorp's savings bank

subsidiary, into Manufacturers and Traders Trust Company ("M&T

Bank"), First Empire's commercial bank subsidiary. The planned

Merger and Bank Merger were previously reported by First Empire

in its Current Report on Form 8-K dated April 1, 1994.

As a result of the Bank Merger, M&T Bank acquired the

Citizens Savings Bank's 12 banking offices in Tompkins, Cortland

and Broome Counties, which are centered in and around Ithaca,

Cortland and Binghamton, New York. At September 30, 1994, Ithaca

Bancorp reported approximately $458 million in assets and $336

million in deposits. Prior to the Merger, Ithaca Bancorp's

common stock had been quoted through the NASDAQ National Market

System registered pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Securities

Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (File No. 0-18705).

First Empire will pay the holders of Ithaca Bancorp's

common stock a cash consideration of $19.00 per share. Based on

the number of shares of Ithaca Bancorp common stock outstanding

as of the Merger, the aggregate Merger consideration approximates

$44.2 million.
