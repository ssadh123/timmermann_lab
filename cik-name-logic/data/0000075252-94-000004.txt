Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On May 10, 1994 Owens & Minor, Inc., formerly O&M Holding, Inc.
(the "Company") completed its business combination with Stuart
Medical, Inc. ("SMI") pursuant to the Agreement of Exchange (the
"Agreement of Exchange") dated as of December 22, 1993, as amended
and Restated on March 31, 1994, by and among the Company, Owens &
Minor Medical, Inc. (formerly, Owens & Minor, Inc.) ("O&M Medical"),
SMI and the former shareholders of SMI. Pursuant to the Agreement of
Exchange, the outstanding shares of common stock of SMI were
exchanged for an aggregate of $40.2 million in cash and $115 million
par value of convertible preferred stock of the Company. The Company
also issued one share of its common stock in exchange for each
outstanding share of common stock of O&M Medical. The Company now
owns all of the outstanding stock of O&M Medical and SMI. 

The amount of consideration paid by the Company to the former
shareholders of SMI was determined on the basis of arm's length
negotiations, which took into account the relative earning power and
financial condition of both companies, based upon both historical and
anticipated operations, financial positions and anticipated synergies
resulting from the combination of SMI's operations with existing
operations of the Company. 

The former shareholders of SMI have agreed to certain
standstill arrangements limiting their ownership of Company stock and
obligating them to vote their shares proportionately with other
holders of Company stock. The preferred stock and the underlying
common stock of the Company are subject to certain restrictions on
transfers by the former SMI shareholders and their transferees.

The Company financed the cash required for the SMI acquisition
through a credit facility provided by a syndicate of banks led by
NationsBank of North Carolina, N.A., as Agent and Administrative
Agent, and Crestar Bank and Chemical Bank, as Co-Agents. In
connection with the SMI combination, the Company also refinanced
approximately $140 million in pro forma debt of SMI.

SMI is a distributor of medical products and supplies and will
continue its operations under the Owens & Minor name as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of the Company.

The SMI acquisition is described in greater detail in the
Company's Registration Statement on Form S-4 (File No. 33-52979),
reference to which is hereby made.

The Company's press release announcing the combination with SMI
attached as Exhibit 99 hereto is incorporated by reference herein.

Item 5. Other Events. 

On May 10, 1994 G. Gilmer Minor, III was elected chairman
of the board of the Company and G. Gilmer Minor, Jr. was named
chairman emeritus.

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA
COMBINED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Introduction

The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed
financial statements have been prepared by management of
Owens & Minor, Inc. (O&M) from the historical consolidated
financial statements of O&M (contained in O&M's Form 10-Q
filed May 4, 1994) and SMI (included in this filing). 

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial
statements have been prepared on the basis of assumptions
described in the notes there to and include assumptions
relating to the allocation of the consideration paid for SMI
to the assets and liabilities of SMI based on preliminary
estimates of their respective fair values. The actual
allocation of such consideration may differ from that
reflected in the pro forma consolidated financial statements
after an appropriate review of the fair values of the
consolidated assets and liabilities of SMI has been
completed. Amounts allocated will be based upon the
estimated fair values at the time of the acquisition which
could vary significantly from the amounts reflected in the
unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements. 
The acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase
method of accounting.

The pro forma financial information presented is not
necessarily indicative of actual results that would have
been achieved had the acquisition closed on the dates
assumed in the unaudited pro forma combined condensed
financial statements that follow. Moreover, they are not
intended to be indicative of future results of operations or
financial position.

The unaudited pro forma financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the historical financial statements of
O&M (contained in O&M's Form 10-Q filed May 4, 1994) and SMI
(included in this filing).

Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Condensed Financial Statements

1. Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of
income for the three months ended March 31, 1994 has been prepared by
combining the consolidated statement of income of O&M with the statement
of income of SMI. The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements
of income reflect adjustments as if the acquisition of SMI, had occurred
on January 1, 1994. The accompanying unaudited combined condensed
balance sheet as of March 31, 1994 presents the historical balance sheets
of O&M and SMI, with pro forma adjustments as if the acquisition of SMI
had occurred on March 31, 1994, in a transaction accounted for using the
purchase method of accounting.

The unaudited pro forma financial statements may not necessarily reflect
the actual results of operations of the Company which would have resulted
had the purchase of SMI occurred as of the dates presented. The pro
forma information is not necessarily indicative of future results of
operations for the combined companies.

2. Allocation of Purchase Price

Under the purchase method of accounting, the allocation of the purchase
price to SMI's assets and liabilities is required to reflect fair values
and to eliminate the historical stockholders' equity of the company. A
final allocation of the purchase price has not yet been performed;
however, the following sets forth certain preliminary adjustments (in
thousands, except share and per share data):

Purchase price: 
Payment of cash to be financed by borrowings 
(see note 3b and 4b) $ 40,200 
Issuance of 1,150,000 shares of 4.5% cumulative, convertible
Series B Preferred Stock, with a liquidation preference of 
$100 per share 115,000 
Total 155,200

Allocation of purchase price:
Net assets acquired - SMI stockholders' equity at 
March 31, 1994, exclusive of goodwill of $33,862 12,153 
Adjustments to assets and liabilities to reflect preliminary
estimated fair values:
Inventory 1,800 
Property and equipment (1,400)
Deferred tax asset, net 6,900 
Provision for estimated costs of integrating 
operations and acquisition related expenses (8,139)

Pro forma net assets after adjustments 11,314 

Pro forma excess of purchase price over net 
assets acquired $143,886 

3. Income Statement Adjustments

(a) To amortize over forty years the cost in excess of fair value of
net assets acquired net of goodwill amortization previously recorded by
SMI, and to depreciate the fair value of acquired property and equipment
over useful lives consistent with those used by O&M.

(In thousands)
Amortization of excess of purchase price over net assets acquired $ 900 
Reversal of SMI historical goodwill amortization (594)
Depreciation adjustment to reflect consistent fixed asset lives and 
asset revaluations (528)
Net $ (222)

(b) O&M funded the $40.2 million cash portion of the purchase price
from a $350 million Senior Credit Facility with interest based on LIBOR. 
In addition, O&M funded the repayment of the long-term debt of SMI,
certain of the long-term debt of O&M, and the working capital
requirements associated with financing SMI's accounts receivables (see
note 4a) with borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility. For purposes
of the pro forma statements, an annual interest rate of 4.33% is assumed
for borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility. This adjustment records
pro forma interest expense on borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility
net of interest previously recorded. A .125% variance on the annual
interest rate would increase or decrease quarterly net income by
approximately $42,000, net of income tax.

(c) To adjust for reductions in selling, general and administrative
expenses associated with the elimination of duplicate costs. Management
expects that there will be significant cost reductions as SMI's business
directly complements O&M's and that corporate administrative functions
and certain distribution arrangements will be combined.

(d) Prior to the combination SMI qualified as an S Corporation under
the Internal Revenue Code as well as in a number of states in which they
file tax returns. The historical financial statements of SMI reflect
only income taxes for states that do not recognize S Corporation status. 
This adjustment records income tax expense using an effective rate of
53.1% for SMI, net of previously recorded state income tax expense. In
addition, the adjustment utilizes a 42.0% tax rate to record the tax
effect of the pro forma adjustments except for adjustments related to the
amortization of goodwill.

(e) To record the preferential annual dividend of $4.50 per share on
the 1,150,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock.

4. Balance Sheet Adjustments

(a) Prior to the combination SMI sold its trade accounts receivables
to Stuart Funding Corp. (SFC) at a discount and received cash for
approximately 90% of the discounted eligible accounts and an interest
bearing note for the remaining balance. Effective with the execution of
the Agreement of Exchange SMI's trade receivables are no longer sold to
SFC. This adjustment records pro forma accounts receivables for SMI of
$82 million and pro forma borrowings to finance these receivables.

(b) O&M funded the $40.2 million cash portion of the purchase price
from a $350 million Senior Credit Facility with interest based on LIBOR. 
In addition, O&M funded the repayment of the long-term debt of SMI,
certain of the long-term debt of O&M, and the working capital
requirements associated with financing SMI's accounts receivables (see
note 4a) with borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility. This
adjustment records the net borrowings under these assumptions.

5. Service Charges to Affiliates

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of income include
approximately $0.4 million of service charges to affiliates that will not
be recurring to the combined company. These service charges related to
certain warehousing, delivery and administrative services SMI provided
to an affiliate. The net effect of this non recurring item increases pro
forma net income per common share by less than $0.01.

6. Restructuring Charges

It is anticipated that certain non-recurring charges will result from the
combination of O&M and SMI which have not been reflected in the pro forma
financial statements. These charges will be incurred pursuant to a
restructuring plan currently under development and be reflected as pre-
tax restructuring charges in O&M's income statement during the year
ending December 31, 1994. 

Simultaneous with the execution of the Exchange Agreement with SMI, a
portion of the restructuring charges comprised primarily of the costs
related to the writedown of certain O&M software, costs associated with
the closure of certain O&M distribution facilities and severance costs
associated with the termination of employees will be recorded. It is
also anticipated that additional costs will be recorded as restructuring
charges over the remainder of 1994 as these costs are incurred. The
components of these costs anticipated to be incurred subsequent to the
combination are the direct incremental costs to be incurred with respect
to restructuring corporate administrative functions, and employee costs
associated with relocation and distribution rationalization. 

The total restructuring charges, whether incurred simultaneous with the
execution of the Exchange Agreement or later in 1994, are estimated to
total $18.7 million on a pre-tax basis. Of this amount, approximately
$2.5 million would represent a non-cash charge to earnings. 

7. Stock Split

All applicable share and per share information has been restated to
reflect a 3 for 2 stock split declared on May 10, 1994 for shareholders
of record as of May 24, 1994.<PAGE>

May 10, 1994

OWENS & MINOR, INC. ANNOUNCES COMPLETION
OF BUSINESS COMBINATION WITH STUART MEDICAL, INC. 

Richmond, VA . . . Owens & Minor, Inc. (NYSE-OMI) announced today that
it has completed its business combination with Stuart Medical, Inc. of
Greensburg, PA. 

The transaction with Stuart Medical, which was approved today by the
shareholders of Owens & Minor, Inc., creates a company able to provide
products and services in all 50 states. The pro forma 1993 revenues of
the combined companies was in excess of $2.3 billion. The combination
further enhances Owens & Minor's position as the low-cost distributor of
medical and surgical supplies in the country and this combination will
allow the company to strengthen its efforts to assist healthcare
providers in containing and reducing costs. 

The consideration paid to the shareholders of Stuart Medical, Inc. was
$40.2 million in cash and $115 million par value of convertible preferred
stock. The convertible preferred stock was issued by a holding company
which was formed for the purposes of the combination and which also
exchanged one share of its common stock for one share of each outstanding
