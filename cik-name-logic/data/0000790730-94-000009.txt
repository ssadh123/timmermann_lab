PASADENA, Calif. - James S. Marlen, president and chief executive
officer of Ameron, Inc. (NYSE), announced today that the senior
management of Ameron's multi-national fiberglass pipe business has
been consolidated under a single worldwide management group that
will be headquartered in Houston, Texas. Management of the
business had previously been divided among three groups operating
from Burkburnett, Texas; Geldermalsen, Netherlands; and Singapore.

Henry C. Koehler, formerly president-directeur of the operation in
the Netherlands and general manager of the operation in Singapore,
has been named president of the newly consolidated business. A
native of Whitehall, Pa., and a graduate of the University of
Virginia, Koehler has been an Ameron executive since 1978.

"This new organization will simplify management structure,
facilitate program coordination, unify decision making and provide
a sharper strategic focus for our fiberglass pipe business," Marlen
said. "Locating the headquarters in Houston will also put our
senior management in close proximity to many of our most important
customers, including global oil companies and engineering firms."

Ameron manufactures a comprehensive line of fiberglass pipe
products for general industry, service station fuel handling, the
oilfield, marine and offshore markets and military applications. 
Manufacturing plants are located in Burkburnett, Geldermalsen,
Singapore and Spartanburg, S.C. Ameron sells fiberglass pipe
products in the U.S. and more than 20 other countries.

In addition to fiberglass pipe products, Ameron manufactures and
markets high-performance coatings, concrete and steel pipe systems
and specialized construction products around the world. Sales in
1993 were $453.4 million.
