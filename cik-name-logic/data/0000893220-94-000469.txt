Item 5. Other Events

Hercules Incorporated (the "Registrant") entered into a Purchase and Sale
Agreement (the "Agreement"), dated as of October 28, 1994 with Alliant
Techsystems Inc. ("Alliant"), providing for the previously announced sale by
the Registrant of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the
Hercules Aerospace Company (the "Business"), all in accordance with the terms
and conditions set forth in the Agreement. Pursuant to the Agreement, the
Registrant has agreed to sell the Business to Alliant for $300 million in cash
(subject to certain adjustments and credits) and approximately 3.86 million
shares of Alliant's common stock.

The assets of the Business included in the sale are those of the
Registrant's Space and Strategic, Tactical Missiles, Ordnance and Powder, and
Composite Structures units. Also included are the Registrant's 100% ownership
interests in Hercules Defense Electronics Systems, Inc. and Global
Environmental Solutions, Inc. The Registrant's 25% ownership interest in
Tecnologie d'Avanguardia e Materiali Avanzati S. p. A., an Italian company may
also be included in the transaction.

After giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and
certain stock repurchases announced by Alliant, the Registrant is expected to
own approximately 31% of the then outstanding shares of Alliant common stock.
In connection therewith, the Registrant has agreed to enter into a
Stockholder's Agreement permitting the Registrant to increase its ownership
interest in Alliant to up to 40% of Alliant's outstanding common stock and
providing, among other things, for the Registrant to designate two nominees to
Alliant's Board of Directors, and for certain "standstill" provisions with
respect to the Alliant common stock owned by the Registrant.

The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement is
conditioned upon the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver of certain
conditions, including the approval of the transaction by Alliant's
stockholders, the receipt of all required corporate and governmental filings,
consents and approvals, and the Registrant's conduct of the Business without
material adverse change. Either Party may terminate the Agreement if the
closing does not occur on or before April 30, 1995.

The foregoing description is a summary only and is not intended to be
complete. The above references to the terms and conditions of the Agreement are
qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement
which is being filed herewith as an exhibit and is incorporated by reference
herein in its entirety.

assign any Purchased Asset or grant any rights therein or thereto if an
assignment or attempted assignment or grant thereof, without the consent,
approval, novation or waiver ("Consent") of a Third Person (including, without
limitation, any Authority), would constitute a breach or a default thereof,
cause or permit the acceleration or termination thereof, or in any way
materially and adversely affect the rights of Hercules in respect thereof, or
the right of Alliant to conduct all or any part of the HAC Business in the
manner and on the terms presently enjoyed by Hercules. Both prior to and after

with Hercules, to obtain Consents to all such assignments of Purchased Assets
including, but not limited to, obtaining novations to Contracts with the U.S.
government; provided, however, that in obtaining such Consents, Hercules shall
not be required to make any material additional payment or take any additional
action not otherwise required under the terms of any Contract relating to the
Purchased Assets. Alliant shall bear, pay, discharge and satisfy all costs,
expenses and considerations required to obtain each novation or required by the
Third Person who is party to the novated item. If Consent is not obtained to
the assignment of any Purchased Asset, the Parties shall reasonably cooperate
with each other in any reasonable arrangement designed to provide Alliant the
benefits and use of such Purchased Asset to the greatest extent practicable,
the same as if such Consent had been obtained, and to provide Hercules the
fulfillment of its duties and obligations under such Purchased Asset to the
greatest extent practicable, the same as if such Purchased Asset had remained

obligation period. Such arrangement shall remain in effect until the earlier

Consent shall have been terminated or shall have expired; (ii) such Consent has
been obtained; or (iii) the Parties have agreed in writing that such Consent is
no longer necessary.

service agreements, col-

15
<PAGE> 24
lection efforts, supply agreements, or other contractual arrangements, all upon
terms and conditions no worse to Hercules than those under the Purchased Asset
in question, and (b) enforcing for the benefit of Alliant (at Alliant's
expense) any and all rights of Hercules in respect of such Purchased Asset;
provided that Alliant shall not be required to accept or enter into, as a
substitute for performance by Hercules under this Agreement, any arrangement
which would impose any material additional cost, expense or liability on
Alliant other than that which would have been incurred by Alliant if a
Purchased Asset had been assigned.

4.4.2 Without limiting any provision of Section 4.4.1 above,
in connection with the Transactions, (i) Hercules and Alliant shall execute
novations in such form as may be reasonably required by the U.S. Government

included in the Purchased Assets or to which a Subsidiary is a party, (ii)
Hercules shall indemnify Alliant against any liability (including setoff by the
U.S. Government, guarantees, and payments) which Alliant may incur under such
novation agreement by reason of any prior failure by Hercules to perform its
obligations under the novated contracts, and (iii) Alliant shall indemnify
Hercules against any liability (including setoff by the U.S. Government,
guarantees, and payments) which Hercules may incur under such novation
agreements by reason of any failure by Alliant to perform its obligations under
the novated contracts.

10.16 Change-of-Control Arrangements. Alliant shall have taken all action
necessary (consistent with applicable law) to ensure that the purchase of the
HAC Business and the payment therefor, as provided herein, will not invoke any
"change of control" or similar provisions in any agreement to which Alliant or
any of the Alliant Affiliates it controls is a party (including any employment,
termination or credit agreement or any stockholder's rights plan).

ARTICLE XI

CERTAIN PROVISIONS AND COVENANTS

11.1 Restrictions on TAEMA Interest.

(A) The Parties recognize and acknowledge that the TAEMA
Interest is subject to conditions, restrictions, encumbrances and other items
described in the documents listed on Schedule 4.2.1(C). Hercules represents
and warrants that it has delivered to Alliant true and complete copies (in
English) of all such documents.

(B) In the event that Hercules is unable to transfer the
TAEMA Interest to Alliant, the Parties agree that the TAEMA Interest shall be
excluded from the Purchased Assets and the Cash Portion of the Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the sum of three million and one hundred thousand dollars
(U.S. $3,100,000).

11.2 Certain State Taxes.

11.2.1

(A) The State of Utah has assessed Hercules and requested
payment of franchise taxes in excess of $13 million with respect to various
matters, including the sale of Hercules' interest in Himont Incorporated.
Other states have similarly requested payments of amounts estimated between $1
and $2 million in the aggregate. The term "States" refers to the State of Utah
and any other states. While Hercules has reserved for these amounts at the
corporate level consistent with normal accounting policy, it has not paid these
amounts and

45
<PAGE> 54
contests the validity of the assessments. Such reserve will not be transferred
to Alliant. In September 1994, Hercules, as pertains to the States assessment,
proposed to the U.S. Government the establishment of an interest bearing escrow
account with an unrelated third party. Hercules would funnel the U.S.
Government payment related to the cost reimbursable portion of the business
into such escrow account. This proposal is still being negotiated with the
U.S. Government with projected settlement before year-end but probable cash
flow beyond year-end through relevant contracts. If Hercules is successful in
contesting the Utah assessment and all or a portion of the taxes are found not
to be due and payable, then all or a corresponding portion of the escrow
account plus pro rate escrow interest will be repaid to the U.S. Government.
Alliant recognizes Hercules' right to retain the remainder of the escrow
account plus the remainder escrow account interest related thereto.

(B) If Hercules is unsuccessful in contesting the State's
assessment, or if during the appeal process the assessment is required to be
paid, the escrow account will be released by the government to pay the
assessment. Hercules agrees to be responsible for, and ultimately pay, any
assessment in excess of the escrow account amount.

(C) If Hercules is successful in contesting the State's
assessment, but the government has not established an escrow account, then no
tax is due and no billing to the government is necessary.

(D) If Hercules is unsuccessful in contesting the State's
assessment, and the government has not established an escrow account by
Closing, then Alliant agrees to seek payment from the government and pay
Hercules such reimbursed tax payments received from the government, subject to
an indemnity from Hercules with respect to any Claims arising out of seeking
such payment.

11.2.2 Hercules paid the relevant state income taxes to the
State of Virginia and is actively pursuing a refund of these taxes from
Virginia. If a refund is received, a portion of the refund must be remitted to
the United States Government, because a portion of the Virginia Tax was
recovered from the U.S. Government in 1992 in conjunction with the cost
reimbursement contract under which Hercules operated the Radford AAP, a GOCO
Plant under the control of the United States Army. Any pro rata portion that
must be remitted to the U.S. Government will remain an obligation of Hercules.
Hercules will either remit a payment directly to the U.S. Government or to
Alliant for transmission to the U.S. Government through the Radford interface.
Alliant will reasonably cooperate with Hercules in such regard.

ARTICLE XII

TERMINATION PRIOR TO CLOSING

12.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time during
the Pre-Closing Period by any one or more of the following:

46
<PAGE> 55
(A) the mutual written consent of Alliant and Hercules;

(B) written notice given by either Party to the other Party,
if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before April 30, 1995; provided
that the Party electing so to terminate this Agreement shall have performed and
complied in all material respects with all of the covenants and agreements set
forth in the Definitive Agreements to be performed by it as of such
termination;

(C) written notice given by either Party to the other Party,
if any court of competent jurisdiction or any Authority shall have issued an
injunction, order, decree, rule or regulation or taken any other action,
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Transactions, and such
order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable, and results in or would reasonably be expected to result in a
frustration of one or more of the essential purposes of the Definitive
Agreements;

(D) written notice given by either Party to the other Party,
if there shall have been a breach by the Party receiving the notice of such
Party's representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in the
Definitive Agreements which breach would entitle Alliant or Hercules, as the
case may be, to decline to consummate the Transactions, and if such breach is
curable, it has not been fully cured to the reasonable satisfaction of the
notifying Party prior to the earlier of (i) 15 Business Days after such written
notice or (ii) the Closing Date;

(E) written notice given by Alliant to Hercules if after the
date hereof any Person (or "group", as defined under the Exchange Act) other
than an employee benefit plan of Hercules shall have (i) acquired or agreed to
acquire or become the beneficial owner of voting securities of Hercules having
30% or more of the voting power of all then outstanding voting securities of
Hercules, (ii) commenced, or publicly announced its intention to commence, a
tender or exchange offer for voting securities of Hercules having 30% or more
of the voting power of all then outstanding voting securities of Hercules, or
(iii) entered into an agreement to merge or combine with Hercules;

(F) written notice given by Hercules to Alliant if after the
date hereof any Person (or "group", as defined under the Exchange Act) other
than an employee benefit plan of Alliant shall have (i) acquired or agreed to
acquire or become the beneficial owner of voting securities of Alliant having
30% or more of the voting power of all then outstanding voting securities of
Alliant, (ii) commenced, or publicly announced its intention to commence, a
tender or exchange offer for voting securities of Alliant having 30% or more of
the voting power of all then outstanding voting securities of Alliant, or (iii)
entered into an agreement to merge or combine with Alliant.

(G) written notice given by Alliant to Hercules if, after
the date hereof, Alliant comes to the good-faith conclusion that, based on the
written opinion of government contract counsel (which counsel may not be an
employee of Alliant or a member or employee of any law firm that was retained
by Alliant in connection with the Transactions) rendered after

47
<PAGE> 56
reasonable consultation with Hercules' counsel, the Transactions would endanger
Alliant's continued eligibility for facilities security clearances due to the
potential existence of foreign ownership, control or influence of Hercules
within the meaning of the Department of Defense Industrial Security Manual;

(H) written notice given by Alliant to Hercules if Alliant
is unable to obtain financing necessary to enable it to consummate the
Transactions solely as a result of the occurrence of one or more of the
following events, which shall have remained in effect for a period of 14
Business Days: (i) any suspension of trading generally on the NYSE; (ii) the
declaration of a banking moratorium by any federal or New York authorities; or
(iii) a calamity, crisis or other unusual event seriously affecting the United
States financial markets;

(I) written notice given by Hercules to Alliant, if the
closing price of the Common Stock on the NYSE on the trading day immediately
preceding the day scheduled for the Closing Date is less than $20.00 per share.

12.2 Effect on Obligations.

12.2.1 Except as provided below and in Section 15.5, in the
event of the termination of this Agreement, this Agreement (other than this
Section 12.2 and Sections 15.5, 15.8 and 15.11) shall become null and void and
neither Party shall have any further obligations or liabilities under this
Agreement.

12.2.2 In the event that (i) termination is effected pursuant
to Section 12.1(D) and (ii) the non-terminating Party has willfully and
intentionally caused the breach of the representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement on which termination is based, then, in addition to any expenses
payable otherwise under the Definitive Agreements, the non-terminating Party
shall be liable to the terminating Party for liquidated damages in the amount
of $16 million plus, in the event that Hercules is the non-terminating Party,
the $6 million amount specified in Section 15.5.2.

12.2.3 In the event that (i) termination by either Party is
effected pursuant to Section 12.1(B) and (ii) at the time of such termination,
the conditions set forth in Sections 9.1, 9.2, 9.4, 9.5, 9.7, 9.8, 9.11 and
9.13 have been satisfied or, if permissible, waived by Alliant and at the time
of such termination, Alliant shall not have obtained the Financing (other than
following an event described in Section 12.1(H)), then Alliant shall be liable
to Hercules for liquidated damages in the amount of $6 million but, in either
case, except as set forth herein Alliant shall have no other obligation or
liability of any kind whatsoever to Hercules (whether under the Definitive
Agreements or otherwise) in connection with the Transactions.

12.2.4 The Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that such
amounts referred to in Sections 12.2.2 and 12.2.3 are acceptable compensation
for all damage and claims which would be incurred with respect to such
termination. Any such amount will be paid in immediately available funds
within 30 days of receipt by (i) the non-terminating Party of written

48
<PAGE> 57
request therefor from the terminating Party, in the case of a termination
subject to Section 12.2.2 above, or (ii) Alliant of written request therefor
from Hercules, in the case of a termination subject to Section 12.2.3.

ARTICLE XIII

SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION

13.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. Except as
provided otherwise in Articles V and VI of this Agreement or in any other
Definitive Agreement, each representation and warranty made in the Definitive
Agreements shall survive the Closing and remain in full force and effect for a
period of 18 months thereafter; provided, however, that representations or
warranties contained in the Tax Agreement shall survive until expiration of any
applicable statute of limitations, and provided, further, to the extent that
written notice of any indemnification claim for breach of any representation or
warranty (indicating with reasonable specificity the basis for such claim)
shall have been delivered to the other Party within the survival period, such
representation and warranty shall survive the termination of the survival
period solely with respect to the subject matter of such claim and continue for
such purpose only until resolution of such claim. The covenants and agreements
contained in the Definitive Agreements shall survive the Closing and continue
in accordance with their terms.

13.2 Indemnification by Hercules. From and after the Closing, Hercules
shall indemnify and hold harmless Alliant, its Affiliates, and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents, consultants, representatives and
successors (collectively, the "Alliant Indemnitees") from and against any and
all Claims incurred by any of them arising out of or resulting from any of the
following:

(A) any breach by Hercules of any of the representations or
warranties made by Hercules in the Definitive Agreements;

(B) any failure by Hercules to perform any of its covenants
or agreements contained in the Definitive Agreements;

satisfy when due any liability or obligation of Hercules or any of its
Affiliates other than the Assumed Liabilities; or

(D) any liability or obligation of the Subsidiaries arising
out of, resulting from or relating to the business and operations of the
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, other than (i) liabilities and obligations
which are part of the Assumed Liabilities and (ii) liabilities and obligations
for which Alliant or the Subsidiaries are to be expressly responsible from and
after the Closing under the Definitive Agreements.

49
<PAGE> 58
13.3 Indemnification by Alliant. From and after the Closing, Alliant
shall indemnify and hold harmless Hercules, its Affiliates, and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, consultants, representatives
and successors (collectively, the "Hercules Indemnitees") from and against any
and all Claims incurred by any of them arising out of or resulting from any of
the following:

(A) any breach by Alliant of any of the representations or
warranties made by Alliant in the Definitive Agreements;

(B) any failure by Alliant to perform any of its covenants
or agreements contained in the Definitive Agreements;

(C) any failure by Alliant to pay, perform, discharge or
satisfy when due any liability or obligation of Alliant or any of its
Affiliates, including any of the Assumed Liabilities;

(D) any liability or obligation of the Subsidiaries arising
out of, resulting from or relating to the business and operations of the
Subsidiaries after the Closing, other than liabilities and obligations for
which Hercules is the indemnitor pursuant to Section 13.2 (D);

(E) any Claim by Alliant stockholders asserted in connection
with the Alliant proxy contest relating to its 1994 Annual Meeting to the
extent that such Claim relates to the Transactions, provided that it is not
judicially determined that such Claim is based on the violation by Hercules by
applicable law; or

(F) to the extent provided on Schedule 13.3 hereto with
respect to the matters therein provided.

13.4 Procedure for Indemnification.

13.4.1 In the event that any Indemnitee shall incur or suffer
any Claims in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder by
Hercules, on the one hand, or Alliant, on the other hand, the Indemnitee shall
assert a Claim for indemnification by written notice with reasonable
information and details of the Claims as then known (the "Notice") to the
Indemnitor stating the nature and basis of such Claim.

13.4.2 Within 60 days after receipt by an Indemnitee of written
notice of the assertion of a claim or the commencement of any action,
litigation or proceeding by any Third Person (a "Third Person Claim") with
respect to any matter for which indemnification is or may be owing pursuant to
Section 13.2 or 13.3, the Indemnitee shall give Notice to the Indemnitor and
shall thereafter keep the Indemnitor reasonably informed with respect thereto.
The Indemnitor shall have the right, at its option and at its own expense, to
participate in or, by giving written notice to the Indemnitee no later than 30
days after delivery of the Notice, to

50
<PAGE> 59
take exclusive control of, the defense, negotiations and/or settlement of any
such Third Person Claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee,
whereupon the Indemnitor shall assume all past and future responsibility for
any Claims incurred by the Indemnitee with respect to such Third Person Claim.
The Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in the defense, negotiation
and/or settlement of any such Third Person Claim with counsel of its own
choosing; provided that after notice from the Indemnitor to the Indemnitee of
the Indemnitor's election to take control of the defense, negotiation and/or
settlement of any Third Person Claim, the Indemnitor shall not be liable to the
Indemnitee for any legal or other expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in
connection with the defense, negotiation and/or settlement thereof other than
reason- able costs of investigation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with
respect to any such Third Person Claim, the defense, negotiation and/or
settlement of which the Indemnitor has taken control, the Indemnitee shall have
the right to retain separate counsel to represent it and the Indemnitor shall
pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel if the parties to
any such Third Person Claim include both the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor and
counsel to the Indemnitee or reasonably determines that defenses available to
the Indemnitee are in conflict with the defenses available to the Indemnitor.
Each Party agrees to cooperate with and render to the other Party such
assistance as may reasonably be requested in order to insure the proper and
adequate defense of any such Third Person Claim or proceeding which assistance
shall include, without limitation, making appropriate personnel reasonably
available for any discovery or trial. If the Indemnitor fails or refuses to
undertake the defense of any such Third Person Claim within 30 days after
delivery of the Notice, the Indemnitee shall have the right to take exclusive
control of the defense, negotiation and/or settlement of such Third Person
Claim at the Indemnitor's expense. Neither the Indemnitor nor the Indemnitee
shall settle or compromise any Third Person Claim without the consent of the
other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

13.4.3 Party to Party Claims. If the Indemnification Notice
does not relate to a Third Person Claim, the Indemnitor shall have 60 days
after receipt of such Notice to object to the subject matter and the amount of
the Claim for indemnification set forth in such Notice by delivering Notice of
objection thereof to the Indemnitee presenting such Notice. If the Indemnitor
does not so object within such 60-day period, it shall be conclusively deemed
to have agreed to the matters set forth in such Notice. If the Indemnitor
sends notice to the Indemnitee objecting to the matters set forth in such
Notice, the Parties shall use their best efforts to settle (without an
obligation to settle) such Claim for indemnification. If the Parties are
unable to settle such dispute, the question shall be resolved in accordance
with Article XIV.

13.5 Limitation on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary, no indemnification shall be payable by an Indemnitor under Section
13.2 or 13.3 unless and until the amount of Claims in respect of all matters
for which indemnification is sought from such Indemnitor shall exceed $1.5
million in the aggregate, in which event the Indemnitor shall only be obligated
to indemnify for the amount of such Claims in excess of $1 million; provided,
however, that no indemnification shall be required hereunder in respect of any
Claim unless the indemnity owed in respect of such Claim and any related Claims
is at least $50,000.

51
<PAGE> 60
13.6 Payment. With respect to Third Person Claims for which
indemnification is payable under the Definitive Agreements, such
indemnification shall be paid by the Indemnitor promptly upon (A) the entry of
a judgment against the Indemnitee and the expiration of any applicable appeal
period; (B) the entry of a non-appealable judgment or final appellate decision
against the Indemnitee; (C) the closing under any settlement or similar
agreement; or (D) the entry of any final non-appealable consent order or decree
binding upon the Indemnitee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided that
there is no reasonable dispute as to whether the Indemnitee is entitled to
indemnification hereunder, expenses of the Indemnitee for which the Indemnitor
is responsible shall be reimbursed on a current basis by the Indemnitor.

13.7 Right To Information About Indemnification Matters. Alliant shall
furnish to Hercules from time to time such information as Hercules may
reasonably request with respect to the matters (including Assumed Liabilities)
which might become the subject of a Claim for indemnification hereunder from
Hercules. Hercules shall furnish to Alliant from time to time such information
as Alliant may reasonably request with respect to the matters which might
become the subject of a Claim for indemnification hereunder from Alliant.

13.8 Covers Other Agreements. The provisions of this Article XIII shall
also govern any right of indemnification granted by any provision of any of the
Definitive Agreements (except for the Human Resources Agreement and, other than
for purposes of Section 13.5 hereof, the Environmental Agreement) and any
indemnification procedure related thereto unless such provision or agreement
specifically provides for a different indemnification right and/or procedure.

13.9 Sole Remedy. Hercules and Alliant acknowledge and agree that, if
the Closing occurs, their sole and exclusive remedy following the Closing with
respect to any and all claims (whether Third Person Claims or otherwise),
relating to the subject matter of the Definitive Agreements (except as
otherwise expressly provided in the Environmental Agreement) shall be pursuant
to the provisions of this Article XIII and each of the Parties hereby waives
any and all rights it may otherwise have against the other Party with respect
thereto.

ARTICLE XIV

RESOLUTIONS OF DISPUTES

14.1 Each and all disputes under the Definitive Agreements (except as
otherwise provided therein) shall be conclusively and exclusively resolved by a
negotiated resolution between the Parties or by the resolution procedure
provided for in this Article XIV.

14.2 The Resolution Panel shall consist of four members, of which two
members shall be the Chief Executive Officer and another authorized
representative of Hercules, and the other two members shall be the Chief
Executive Officer and another authorized representative of

52
<PAGE> 61
Alliant (the "Resolution Panel"). The Resolution Panel may only act by the
affirmative vote of all of its members.

14.3 In the event of a dispute under the Definitive Agreements (except as
otherwise provided in any Definitive Agreement and for disputes covered by the
Adjustment Protocol as the Parties intend that such disputes shall be resolved
exclusively and conclusively in accordance with the Adjustment Protocol),
either Party may give a notice to the other Party requesting that the
Resolution Panel try in good faith to negotiate a resolution of (but without
any obligation to resolve) such dispute. Not later than fifteen (15) days
after said notice, each Party shall submit to the other Party a written
statement setting forth such Party's description of the dispute and of the
respective positions of the Parties on such dispute; and such Party's
recommended resolution and the reasons why such Party feels its recommended
resolution is fair and equitable in light of the terms and spirit of the
Definitive Agreements. The submission and exchange of such written statements
of the Parties shall be simultaneous. Such statements represent part of a
good-faith effort to resolve a dispute and as such, neither statement may be
introduced as evidence or used as an admission against interest in any judicial
resolution of such dispute.

14.4 If the dispute continues unresolved for a period of fifteen (15)
days (or such longer period as the Resolution Panel may otherwise agree upon)
after the simultaneous exchange of such written statements, then the Resolution
Panel shall promptly commence good-faith negotiations to resolve such dispute
but without any obligation to resolve it. The initial negotiating meeting
shall be held in Wilmington, Delaware, if Alliant sent said notice, and in
Hopkins, Minnesota, if Hercules sent said notice.

14.5 Within sixty days after the commencement of good-faith negotiations,
(i) if the Resolution Panel renders an agreed resolution on the matter in
dispute, then both Parties shall be bound thereby and judgment upon such
resolution may be entered in any court having requisite jurisdiction; and (ii)
if the Resolution Panel does not render an agreed resolution, then the matter
in dispute shall be submitted forthwith to a court in the State of Delaware
under the Summary Procedures Act of Delaware, for judicial resolution.

14.6 Summary Procedures Act. The following shall be applicable to any
dispute under the Definitive Agreements which is required to be submitted to a
court in the State of Delaware under the Summary Procedures Act.

(A) Each dispute, which by its nature and/or amount in
controversy, qualifies as a matter of right or discretion to be determined in
the Superior Court of the State of Delaware in and for New Castle County under
its Rules governing Summary Proceedings for Commercial Disputes, shall proceed
and be determined in such Summary Proceedings ONLY. Any dispute which cannot
be determined in such Summary Proceedings shall proceed and be determined in
whichever Delaware Court has requisite jurisdiction.

53
<PAGE> 62
(B) Any disputing party may make application to the said
Superior Court for resolution of a dispute to be determined in such Summary
Proceedings. No disputing party shall directly or indirectly oppose such
application in any way.

(C) No disputing party shall directly or indirectly initiate
or pursue any case, proceeding or claim (whether for damages or other relief)
relating to a dispute in any forum other than a Delaware Court.

(D) Each and all disputing parties hereby reciprocally and
irrevocably waive in advance any and all objections to the Delaware Courts or
directly or indirectly to cause any aspect of the dispute to be heard in
another forum.

(E) For purposes of all actions or proceedings that involve
a dispute, all disputing parties do hereby irrevocably submit themselves to the
personal jurisdiction of each and all Delaware Courts and agree that service of
process may be duly perfected by a lawful method.

ARTICLE XV

MISCELLANEOUS

15.1 Entire Agreement. The Adjustment Protocol, the Due Diligence
Protocol, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Non-Disclosure Agreement, the
Competitive Sensitive Information Agreement and the Definitive Agreements
(including the Exhibits, Schedules, and other documents referred to or

the other Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party shall be entitled
to assign all or any part of its rights and obligations under the Definitive
Agreements to one or more of its wholly owned Affiliates, provided that no such

materially adversely affect such stockholders, unless such amendment is
approved by such stockholders. No amendment, modification or alteration of the
terms or provisions of the Definitive Agreements shall be binding unless the

the terms or provisions of the Definitive Agreements may be waived in writing
at any time by the Party which is entitled to the benefits of such waived terms
or provisions. No waiver of any of the provisions of the Definitive Agreements

15.5.1 Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Definitive
Agreements and except for the Hercules cost paid by Alliant pursuant to the

Letter of Intent - This Adjustment Protocol is the Protocol referred to in
Paragraph 4 of the Letter of Intent dated July 11, 1994, and Section 1.1.1 of
the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated _________, 1994. All references to
numerical paragraphs herein refer to the Letter of Intent (LOI). All terms
used herein and defined in the said Purchase and Sale Agreement shall have the
meanings ascribed to such terms in the said Purchase and Sale Agreement.

DETERMINATION OF PURCHASE PRICE AND NET BOOK VALUE

The purchase price shall be the NET BOOK VALUE, as of the CLOSING DATE, plus
Sixty-six Million Dollars ($66,000,000). The NET BOOK VALUE of the HAC
BUSINESS is equal to the difference between (i) the recorded value of Purchased
Assets related to and used solely or substantially solely in the HAC BUSINESS
(except excluded carve-out assets as stated below), and (ii) the recorded value
of the Assumed Liabilities related to the HAC BUSINESS (except excluded
carve-out liabilities as stated below). Both assets and liabilities will be
valued consistent with Hercules Incorporated's normal accounting policies and
procedures and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP) as consistently applied by Hercules in the carved-out historical
financial statements of the HAC BUSINESS audited by Coopers & Lybrand. To the
extent that certain obligations are not included, any related reserves for
these items will not be transferred.

EXCLUDED CARVE-OUT ASSETS

- Cash
- Research and Experimentation Credits
- Income Taxes - Current and Deferred
- Land and Building Accounts of Kenvil and HDES

EXCLUDED CARVE-OUT LIABILITIES

- Contract deferrals related to the Titan IV SRMU settlement.
- Taxes payable.
- Environmental liabilities.
- Contingent liabilities; e.g., litigation.
- Pension liability.
- FAS 106 difference between APBO values and GAAP values.

While environmental and contingent liabilities, are excluded for the
calculation of NET BOOK VALUE, they shall be dealt with separately in the
Definitive Agreement.
<PAGE> 70

CLOSING

No later than 10 days prior to Closing, Hercules will prepare a preliminary
estimated NET BOOK VALUE STATEMENT of the HAC BUSINESS as of the Closing Date.

No later than 5 days prior to Closing, the PARTIES will agree to an 
estimated NET BOOK VALUE.

The cash payment to be delivered at Closing against the final purchase price
will be determined by the following formula:

Cash Portion - NET BOOK VALUE + $66 Million - $112 Million

LESS: Prepaid amounts to which Alliant is entitled to a purchase price 
credit.
PLUS or LESS: Other adjustments agreed to in writing by Hercules and 
Alliant.

The Cash Portion shall be paid at the CLOSING and no later than 11:30 A.M.
on the CLOSING DATE by bank wire transfer of immediately available funds to bank
account(s) specified by HERCULES.

Alliant will present, at CLOSING, 3,862,069 shares of Alliant Shares in
accordance with the terms and conditions stated in LOI paragraph 5 and
paragraph 3.1(B) of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.

POST CLOSING

The CLOSING BALANCE SHEET of the HAC BUSINESS shall be prepared by HERCULES,
ALLIANT, and the HAC BUSINESS Management, audited by Coopers & Lybrand and
reviewed by Alliant representatives. This CLOSING BALANCE SHEET shall serve as
the data base for developing the NET BOOK VALUE STATEMENT, which shall be
prepared so as to derive the NET BOOK VALUE of the HAC BUSINESS as of the
CLOSING DATE as defined on the previous page.

Hercules, Alliant, and the HAC BUSINESS management will prepare the
Post-Closing NET BOOK VALUE STATEMENT as of the end of business on the CLOSING
DATE. ALLIANT will provide HERCULES with access to the Books and Records.

The NET BOOK VALUE STATEMENT will be attested to by Coopers & Lybrand and
reviewed by Alliant representatives within sixty (60) days of the CLOSING DATE.
If the PARTIES do not agree on matters relating to these statements, except for
excluded items specifically identified in this document, after thirty (30) days
of its presentation, the matter shall be referred to Price Waterhouse for
resolution. The PARTIES will share the fees and
<PAGE> 71
-3-

expenses of Price Waterhouse equally. The PARTIES, and their representatives,
each shall cooperate, promptly and fully with Price Waterhouse so that its
decision can be rendered as soon as practicable, but in any event not later
than sixty (60) days after its engagement. The decision of Price Waterhouse
shall be final and binding on all concerned and may be judicially enforced in
any court having requisite jurisdiction.

The final cash and adjustment payment will be determined by the following
formulas:

Final Cash Portion - CLOSING NET BOOK VALUE as attested by Coopers &
Lybrand + $66 Million - $112 Million.

LESS: Prepaid amounts to which Alliant is entitled to a purchase price 
credit.

PLUS or LESS: Other adjustments agreed to in writing by Hercules and
Alliant.

Adjustment Payment - Final Cash Portion - Cash Portion at Closing.

An Adjustment Payment greater than zero will require an additional payment
from Alliant to Hercules.

An Adjustment Payment less than zero will require a refund payment from 
Hercules to Alliant.

Adjustment payments shall accrue interest from the CLOSING DATE through the
date of payment at an annual rate equal to 6%. Adjustment payments shall be
made by bank wire transfer in immediately available funds no later than five
(5) days after final settlement.

is contrary to any applicable law, such provision shall be of no force or
effect and or affect the validity of the remaining provisions.

7.02 LANDLORD'S REMEDIES

If Tenant fails to perform any affirmative duty or obligation of Tenant under
this Lease, within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice to Tenant
(or in the case of emergency, such lesser time that is prudent under the
circumstances), Landlord may at its option (but without obligation to do so),
perform such duty or obligation on Tenant's behalf, including but not limited
to the obtaining of reasonable required bonds, insurance policies or
governmental licenses, permits or approvals. The costs and expenses of any such
performance by Landlord shall be due and payable by Tenant to Landlord upon
invoice therefor. If any check given to Landlord by Tenant shall not be
honored by the bank upon which it is drawn, Landlord, at its option, may
require all future payments to be made under this Lease by Tenant to be made
only by cashier's check.

In the event of a Default of this Lease by Tenant, as defined in paragraph
7.01, Landlord may, in addition to all other remedies given to Landlord by law
or in equity, by written notice to Tenant, declare the present value of all
installments of Rent for the remainder of the term of this Lease to be
immediately due and payable (whereupon the same shall be immediately due and
payable), and terminate this Lease or, without terminating this Lease, reenter
the Premises pursuant to proper legal proceedings (for which cost Landlord
shall be reimbursed if such re-entry is granted). In the event of such
re-entry Landlord shall use its reasonable efforts to relet the Premises and in
the event of such reletting shall apply the rent therefrom first to the payment
of Landlord's expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by
reason of Tenant's Default and the expense of reletting, including but not
limited to repairs, renovation or alteration of the Premises, and then to the
payment of Rent and all other sums due from Tenant hereunder.

All remedied available to Landlord under this lease, at law, or in equity, are
cumulative and concurrent. No termination of this Lease nor any taking or
recovering of possession of the Premises shall deprive Landlord of any of its
remedies or actions against Tenant for past or future rent or other sums due
hereunder, nor shall the bringing of any action for rent or other Default be
construed as a waiver of the right to obtain possession of the Premises.

7.03 LANDLORD'S DEFAULT

Landlord's failure to perform or observe any of its Lease obligations after a
period of thirty (30) business days or the additional time, if any, that is
reasonably necessary to promptly and diligently cure the failure after
receiving notice from Tenant, is a Default. The notice shall give in
reasonable detail the nature and extent of the failure and identify the Lease
provision(s) containing the obligation(s). After Tenant receives notice of the
third party's name and address and request for notice upon Landlord's Default,
Tenant shall provide the notice required by this paragraph to any such third
party at the same time Tenant gives notice to Landlord.

15
<PAGE> 91

If Landlord commits a Default, Tenant may pursue any remedies given in this
Lease or under the law.

for it permitted uses and are now or hereafter placed by Landlord upon the real
property of which the Premises are a part, to any and all advances made on the
security thereof and to all renewal, modifications, consolidations,
replacements and extensions thereof. The recording of such Security Device or

Security Device, notwithstanding the relative dates of the documentation or
recording thereof.

this Lease including any options to extend the term thereof, will not be
disturbed so long as Tenant is not in breach hereof and attorneys to the record
owner of the Premises.

shall promptly execute and deliver any documents needed to confirm this
arrangement.

Default shall be thirty (30) business days after the Answering Party receives
notice of the Default.

8.03 QUIET POSSESSION

RE: COMPETITIVE-SENSITIVE INFORMATION

Gentlemen:

In connection with the proposed transactions, outlined in the Letter
of Intent signed by Hercules and Alliant and dated July 11, 1994, (the
"Transaction") and in accordance with the Due Diligence Protocol related
thereto, Hercules has begun a due diligence review of relevant business items
and activities of Alliant, and Alliant has begun a due diligence review of
relevant business items and activities of the HAC Business. [Unless otherwise
specified, all terms contained herein shall have the meanings given to such
terms as in the Letter of Intent and Due Diligence Protocol.] To date,
information deemed to be "competitive-sensitive" in nature has been excluded
from the due diligence reviews pursuant to page 4, paragraph 5, of the Due
Diligence Protocol. The paragraphs below set forth the Parties' agreement as
to the limited and restricted disclosure of such competitive-sensitive
information.

1. So that Alliant can complete its due diligence review of the 
HAC Business, Hercules agrees to disclose relevant 
competitive-sensitive information, which may include by way 
of example, but without limitation, business and strategic 
plans, financial data and projections, processes, 
specifications, customer lists, pricing information, reports 
and studies, ONLY to the following single individual 
representing Alliant ("Alliant Internal Individual"):

Name:____________________
Title:___________________
Organization:____________

Hercules' competitive-sensitive information shall only be 
disclosed to the Alliant Internal Individual by one or more
of the following Hercules representatives: George MacKenzie,
Thomas W. Hunsberger and Sue A. Murray.

Other than to the Alliant Internal Individual, no Hercules 
competitive-sensitive information shall be disclosed to
Alliant or its representatives except, as may be necessary, 
in a general form to inform Alliant ONLY of the existence or 
non-existence of material concerns and in all events without 
any details or particulars of such concerns or the underlying 
matters.

2. So that Hercules can complete its due diligence review of 
Alliant's business, Alliant agrees to disclose relevant
competitive-sensitive information, which may include by way 
of example, but without limitation, business and strategic 
plans, financial data and projections, processes, 
specifications, customer lists, pricing information,
reports and studies, ONLY to a single individual representing
Hercules ("Hercules Internal Individual"):

Name:________________________
Title:_______________________
Organization:________________

Alliant competitive-sensitive information shall only be
disclosed to the Hercules Internal Individual by one or more
of the following Alliant representatives ____________________.

Other than to the Hercules Internal Individual, no Alliant
competitive-sensitive information shall be disclosed to
Hercules or its representatives except, as may be necessary,
in a general form to inform Hercules of the existence or
non-existence of material concerns and in all events without
any details of particulars of such concerns or the underlying
matters.

3. Competitive-sensitive information will only be used by the 
Hercules Internal Individual and the Alliant Internal
Individual to prepare reports setting forth the said 
existence or non-existence of material concerns based on the
information reviewed. Hercules and the Hercules Internal 
Individual agree that any workpapers or data developed in
connection with the review of Alliant competitive-sensitive 
information will be the property of Alliant. Alliant and the 
Alliant Internal Individual agree that any workpapers or data 
developed in connection with the review of Hercules 
competitive-sensitive information will be the property of 
Hercules.

4. If the Internal Individual of a Party is given a copy of 
competitive-sensitive information of the other Party, such
Internal Individual shall (i) not copy or duplicate such 
information in whole or material part, in any manner or form 
whatsoever without the prior written authorization of the 
disclosing Party in each instance, and (ii) if the
Transaction does not close, except for one record copy of 
tangible material, promptly return all such information,
including workpapers and data, to the disclosing Party.

5. If the Transaction does not close, the record copy of 
Hercules' competitive-sensitive information shall be promptly
submitted by the Alliant Internal Individual to Coopers & 
Lybrand ("C&L") for retention by C&L until January 14, 1999. 
While the record copy is retained by C&L, it shall not be 
accessed or copied by any person, including the Alliant 
Internal Individual, without Hercules' prior written consent 
in each instance. The record copy will be returned to 
Hercules by C&L at the end of the retention period.

6. If the Transaction does not close, the record copy of Alliant's
competitive-sensitive information shall be submitted by the 
Hercules Internal Individual to Deloitte & Touche (D&T) for 
retention by D&T until January 14, 1999. While the record 
copy is retained by D&T, it shall not be accessed or copied 
by any person, including the Hercules Internal Individual, 
without Alliant's prior written consent in each instance. 
The record copy will be returned to Alliant by D&T at the end 
of the retention period.

7. Any review of competitive-sensitive information will be 
focused on specific topics rather than broad general research 
and will be restricted to what is reasonably necessary to be 
known for purposes of due diligence as opposed to all 
information relevant to the operations in question. The 
objective will be to determine the existence or nonexistence 
of material risk in specified areas.

8. Prior to review of any classified document, the Hercules 
Internal Individual or the Alliant Internal Individual, as
the case may be, will be required to obtain the proper 
security clearances.

9. Hercules agrees that should the Transaction not be completed, 
Hercules will isolate the Hercules Internal Individual from 
all competitive program/pricing activities of the HAC 
Business for the duration of the secrecy period (i.e., until 
January 14, 1999) under the Confidentiality Agreement signed 
by the Parties on January 14, 1994.

10. Alliant agrees that should the Transaction not be completed, 
Alliant will isolate the Alliant Internal Individual from all 
competitive program/pricing activities of the business of 
Alliant for the duration of the secrecy period (i.e., until 
January 14, 1999) under the Confidentiality Agreement signed 
by the Parties on January 14, 1994.

11. This letter is supplemental to the said Confidentiality 
Agreement.

12. The Hercules Internal Individual and the Alliant Internal 
Individual each hereby acknowledges and agrees that he is
bound by the said Confidentiality Agreement and this letter 
agreement and recognizes, intends and agrees that the breach 
of those obligations will result in personal liability.

13. This letter agreement shall be governed by the law of the 
State of Delaware without giving effect to any conflict of 
laws principles.

matter shall be referred to the Negotiating Teams for resolution. The
Hercules Negotiating Team is led by R.K. Elliott, and Alliant's 
Negotiating Team is led by D.E. Willis.

review as soon as practicable, but in any event within the 90-day due 
diligence review period of July 11 through October 10, 1994, except

5
<PAGE> 127
and (ii) does not have a material adverse effect on the operation of a
Facility. The determination of which Response to Environmental Conditions is
the Lowest Cost Response shall be based on the application of the Remediation
Standards pertaining to the Hazardous Substances to be addressed by the
Response to Environmental Conditions (the "Applicable Remediation Standards")
that are: (x) the least stringent Remediation Standards applicable to Land
used for purposes for which the HAC Facilities were used at the time of

Conditions. Taking no action shall constitute the Lowest Cost Response if,
after investigation of the Environmental Conditions of the Area of
Environmental Concern, taking no action is determined to be consistent with
Environmental Laws and Applicable Remediation Standards. If taking no action
is not consistent with Environmental Laws and Applicable Remediation Standards,
the least costly non-permanent remedy (such as an Institutional Control or an
Engineering Control) shall be the Lowest Cost Response, provided that such
non-permanent remedy is consistent with Environmental Laws and Applicable
Remediation Standards and is less costly than the least costly permanent remedy
(such as the excavation and removal of contaminated soil). Approval of a
Remedial Action by an Environmental Authority exercising jurisdiction over an
Area of Environmental Concern is not evidence that such Remedial Action
constitutes the Lowest Cost Response if: (i) a Material Change in a
Remediation Standard with respect to any Hazardous Substances to be addressed
by the Response to Environmental Conditions has occurred; or (ii) a Response to
Environmental Conditions of lower cost reasonably could have been proposed to
such Environmental Authority; provided however, that if: (x) there has not
been a Material Change in the Remediation Standards applicable to the Response
to Environmental Conditions; (y) a Party has presented and diligently pursued a
proposal to the applicable Environmental Authority to implement a Response to
Environmental Conditions; and (z) the Environmental Authority exercising
jurisdiction over such Area of Environmental Concern has rejected such proposal
as inconsistent with Environmental Laws, then such rejection shall create a
rebuttable presumption that the proposal was not the Lowest Cost Response.

"Material Change in a Remediation Standard" means an order of
magnitude (tenfold) increase in stringency of a Remediation Standard between
the numeric value in effect at the time of Closing and the numeric value in
effect at the time a Response to Environmental Conditions is implemented, such
as, for example, a change in the numeric value of a Remediation Standard from
10 parts per million to 1 part per million. With respect to numeric
Remediation Standards that are derived by application of narrative Remediation
Standards (such as risk based criteria), a determination that a Material Change
in a Remediation Standard has occurred shall be based on the evidence of actual
guidances, reports or other documents issued, promulgated or approved by
Environmental Authorities, in effect at the time of Closing, setting forth the
methodology by

6
<PAGE> 128
which numeric Remediation Standards shall be derived from the narrative
Remediation Standards.

13
<PAGE> 135
as follows: (i) following the Closing, Alliant shall initiate and administer
Government Responsibility Demands which Alliant has legal standing to enforce
pursuant to Government Contract Law or Government Contracts to which Alliant is
a party and shall use diligent efforts to secure reimbursement for the
underlying Environmental Claim; and (ii) Alliant shall assume the
administration of any Government Responsibility Demand initiated by Hercules
prior to Closing and shall use diligent efforts to secure reimbursement for the
underlying Environmental Claim.

(b) Alliant shall have no obligation to continue to administer a
Government Responsibility Demand with respect to Environmental Claims arising

the United States Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals or the United States
Court of Claims (the "Negative Decision"). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Alliant shall continue to administer such Government Responsibility Demand
following the issuance of a Negative Decision if Hercules agrees in writing to
pay Alliant for reasonable costs incurred by Alliant in connection therewith,
including but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, experts' and
consultant fees and other reasonable expenses, and to pay a reasonable hourly
fee for time spent by Alliant personnel in administering such Government
Responsibility Demand.

(d) Hercules shall reimburse Alliant for any Environmental Claim
subject to such Government Responsibility Demand, in the manner provided by

such Environmental Claim is a Federal Environmental Responsibility upon: (x)
with respect to a Government Responsibility Demand arising from a HAC Facility
or HAC Business located on Non-Federal Land, the expiration of a Two Year

allowance of, or other consideration or payment received by Alliant with
respect to, the Government Responsibility Demand.

seeks indemnification from Hercules pursuant to this Environmental Agreement,
any dispute with respect to whether the Environmental Claim constitutes a
Federal Environmental Responsibility shall be determined under the dispute
resolution procedures established by Article XIV of the Principal Agreement,

ARTICLE TEN

10. Remedial Actions Under this Agreement.

10.1 Management of Remedial Actions.

Except with respect to the Kenvil Facility and the Clearwater
Facility, all material Remedial Actions at a HAC Facility subject or
potentially subject to an Environmental Indemnification Claim under this
Environmental Agreement shall be subject to the following requirements:

(a) At the Closing, Hercules shall designate a representative to
receive information and consult with Alliant concerning Remedial Actions to be
conducted by Alliant at the HAC Facilities (the "Hercules Environmental
Representative"). From time to time, Hercules may designate a substitute
Hercules Environmental Representative and alternate Hercules Environmental
Representatives to serve if the primary Environmental Representative is
unavailable. Alliant shall make its environmental personnel with
responsibility for addressing Environmental Conditions at a HAC Facility
reasonably available to the Hercules Environmental Representative to discuss
Environmental Conditions at the HAC Facility that require or may require the
performance of Remedial Actions subject to this Environmental Agreement.

(b) If requested by the Hercules Environmental Representative,
Alliant shall provide to the Hercules Environmental Representative reasonable
access to the HAC Facilities and copies of non-privileged information
reasonably necessary to evaluate the Remedial Actions to be taken with respect
to a HAC Facility and the selection of consultants and contractors to implement
such Remedial Activities, including but not limited to reports, analytical
data, correspondence, directives, orders, documents submitted by Alliant to, or
received by Alliant from, any

21
<PAGE> 143
applicable Environmental Authority in connection with a Remedial Action, and
other non-privileged documents created or received by or on behalf of Alliant
in connection with the Remedial Action. Alliant shall provide to the Hercules
Environmental Representative reasonable prior notice of the initiation of any
material Remedial Action and an opportunity to observe all such Remedial
Actions performed.

(c) Alliant shall afford the Hercules Environmental
Representatives a reasonable opportunity to confer with consultants and
contractors retained to perform Remedial Actions.

(d) Upon Hercules' request, Alliant shall provide to the Hercules
Facility Representative a copy of any work plan describing how a Remedial
Action shall be conducted ("Work Plan") or any submission to be made to an
Environmental Authority in connection with any Remedial Action ("Submission")
as long as is reasonably practicable before the date that the Work Plan is
scheduled to be implemented or the Submission is required to be submitted to
any Environmental Authority, provided that Alliant shall have no obligation to
provide drafts of such Work Plans and Submissions.

(e) In the event that the Hercules Environmental Representative
provides comments to Alliant with respect to the performance of any Remedial
Action, including but not limited to, the contents of any Work Plan or
Submission, the Parties shall diligently confer in good faith to attempt to
reach agreement on the subject matter of Hercules' comments. In the event
agreement cannot be reached by the Hercules Environmental Representative and
the Alliant personnel with responsibility for the matter, either Party may
demand that any issue with respect to the Remedial Action be submitted to the
Environmental Review Committee by written notice to each member of the
Environmental Review Committee. Any such demand shall include a concise
written statement of the issue to be considered by the Environmental Review
Committee. The members of the Environmental Review Committee shall personally
confer with respect to this issue as soon as is reasonably practicable, but in
any event within thirty (30) days of receipt of the written demand. Decisions
of the Environmental Review Committee shall require the agreement of both
Parties and shall be final. If the Environmental Review Committee is unable to
reach a decision, either Party may submit the issue for dispute resolution in
accordance with Article XIV of the Principal Agreement, provided however, that
if Alliant is unable, after good faith efforts, to obtain from the
Environmental Authority an extension of the deadline, if any, to make a
Submission or to implement a Work Plan or other Remedial Action and the issue
is not resolved pursuant to this Section 10.1(e) by the expiration of such
deadline, Alliant shall determine the action to be taken without prejudice to
all rights of Hercules to contend that such action is not in accordance with
this Environmental Agreement.

(f) Nothing in this Section 10.1 shall limit the right of Alliant
to propose or implement a Remedial Action: (i) for which it shall not seek
indemnification in accordance with this Environmental Agreement; or (ii) to
take an emergent action that is necessary to address an imminent threat to
human health or the Environment.

22
<PAGE> 144
10.2 Performance of Remedial Action Under this Agreement.

Any Remedial Action, or any part thereof, subject or potentially
subject to an Environmental Indemnification Claim under this Environmental
Agreement, shall be performed in a workmanlike manner, consistent with all
applicable professional standards and in a cost effective manner not exceeding
industry cost standards for comparable work. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Party performing such a Remedial Action shall: (i) be
responsible for the proper and lawful disposition of all wastes, including but
not limited to, soils and groundwater, generated in any Remedial Action; and
(ii) obtain, maintain in full force and effect, and achieve material compliance
with all Environmental Permits that are necessary for the performance of any
Remedial Actions.

10.3 Maintenance of Engineering or Institutional Controls.

As long as Alliant owns or operates a HAC Facility, Alliant shall
properly maintain any Institutional Controls or Engineering Controls installed
or employed at a HAC Facility in connection with any Remedial Action undertaken
by Alliant, subject or potentially subject to an Environmental Indemnification
Claim under this Environmental Agreement. The out-of-pocket fees, costs and
expenses incurred by Alliant pursuant to this Section 10.3 shall be subject to
Alliant's right of indemnification pursuant to Section 8.1(a) of this
Environmental Agreement. The foregoing notwithstanding, Alliant may remove or
discontinue any Institutional or Engineering Controls imposed on the HAC
Facility at any time in its sole discretion, provided that Alliant at its sole
expense complies with any conditions imposed by the Environmental Authority or
required in compliance with Environmental Laws in connection with such removal
or discontinuance (including the performance of any additional Remedial
Action).

ARTICLE ELEVEN

11. Alliant New Jersey Facilities and ISRA.

As to any Alliant New Jersey Facility as to which Alliant shall not
have achieved Compliance with ISRA prior to the Closing, Alliant shall: (i)
take all actions that are necessary to achieve Compliance with ISRA, (ii)
establish and maintain in full force and effect any remediation funding source
required under ISRA; and (iii) pay all fees, costs and expenses necessary or
required to achieve Compliance with ISRA.

ARTICLE TWELVE

12. Kenvil and Clearwater Facilities.

12.1 Leases for Kenvil and Clearwater Facilities.

The Parties specifically acknowledge that, in connection with the
Transaction, Alliant shall execute leases for the Kenvil and Clearwater
Facilities. The term of such leases shall be

23
<PAGE> 145
one year. Alliant shall have options to extend the leases for up to five
additional one year terms. Should Alliant elect to extend its lease at the
Kenvil Facility into a fourth year, Hercules and Alliant shall negotiate in
good faith concerning a method by which Alliant will share in Environmental
Claims incurred by Hercules arising from Releases, if any, occurring at the
Kenvil Facility during Alliant's entire tenancy.

12.2 Compliance with ISRA -- Kenvil Facility.

(a) ISRA Compliance Matter Arising from this Transaction. In
connection with the ISRA Compliance Matter arising from the Transaction with
respect to the Kenvil Facility, Hercules shall: (i) take all actions required
to achieve Compliance with ISRA and the Remediation Agreement; (ii) establish
and maintain in full force and effect any remediation funding source required
under ISRA or the Remediation Agreement; and (iii) pay all fees, costs and
expenses necessary or required to achieve Compliance with ISRA or the
Remediation Agreement. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, Hercules shall have the sole and exclusive right and authority to
propose, negotiate with the NJDEP concerning, and implement Remedial Actions at
the Kenvil Facility required to achieve Compliance with ISRA or the Remediation
Agreement, provided that Hercules shall implement Remedial Actions at such
times, in such a manner and with such advance notice to Alliant as not to
unreasonably interfere with Alliant's day to day operations at the Kenvil
Facility.

(b) Future ISRA Compliance. In the event Alliant takes any action
during its occupancy of the Kenvil Facility that requires the initiation of an
ISRA Compliance Matter, including but not limited to, any closing of operations
(as such term is defined under ISRA) by Alliant at the Kenvil Facility, Alliant
shall pay all filing fees and other costs of an administrative nature to
achieve Compliance with ISRA. Subject to Alliant's obligation to indemnify
Hercules pursuant to Article VIII of this Environmental Agreement for
post-Closing Releases, as such obligation shall be modified by any agreement of
the Parties described in Section 12.1 of this Environmental Agreement, Hercules
shall take all actions and pay all other fees, costs and expenses to achieve
Compliance with ISRA in connection with such ISRA Compliance Matter.

ARTICLE THIRTEEN

13. Miscellaneous.

13.1 Exclusive Remedy.

Hercules and Alliant acknowledge and agree that, if the Closing
occurs, the indemnification given by the Parties under this Agreement shall be
the Parties' sole and exclusive remedies following Closing, each against the
other: (i) with respect to Environmental Claims or arising out of
Environmental Laws relating to: the HAC Business; the ownership, operation,
management, use or control of HAC Facilities; Environmental Conditions at the
HAC Facilities; the ownership, operation, management, use or control of Alliant
Facilities; Environmental Conditions at the Alliant Facilities; and Compliance
with ISRA; and (ii) with

24
<PAGE> 146
respect to any other subject matter of this Environmental Agreement. The
Parties hereby waive and release any other rights, remedies, causes of action
or claims as to which this Environmental Agreement sets forth the exclusive
remedy. The foregoing notwithstanding, this Section 13.1 shall not apply to any
and all Third-Party Claims arising from or relating to Off-Site Environmental
Conditions resulting from the operation of the HAC Business (i) at Federal

Hercules after the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Closing; and (ii) at
Non-Federal Land, but only if such Third-Party Claims are first asserted
against Alliant or Hercules after the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing.
Solely as to the claims described in the preceding sentence, each Party shall
retain against the other all rights, remedies, causes of action or claims they
have or may have under Environmental Laws or otherwise.

13.2 Third Party Actions.

Either Party may, but shall have no obligation to, institute an action
against any third party, at any time and at its sole expense, with respect to
Environmental Claims for which that Party is, or may be, entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this Environmental Agreement, provided however,
that with respect to all such Environmental Claims as to which Alliant is
seeking recovery or reimbursement as a Federal Environmental Responsibility
pursuant to Article VI of this Environmental Agreement, Hercules shall not
institute any action against the United States without Alliant's prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

13.3 Incorporation of Terms of Principal Agreement.

(a) The provisions of Articles XIII, XIV, XV of the Principal
Agreement are incorporated herein and made a part hereof.

Plans (defined below) or any beneficiary thereof.

F. "Alliant Employee Benefit Plan" - Shall mean any Employee
Benefit Plan as defined in ERISA Section 3(3) provided by 
Alliant to its employees.

G. "Hercules Employee Benefit Plan" - Shall mean any Employee
Benefit Plan as defined in ERISA Section 3(3) provided to HAC
Employees prior to the Closing Date.

Section 2 - Employment of HAC Employees

A. As of the Closing Date, Alliant or a subsidiary thereof will
offer to transfer employment on an at-will basis to all HAC
Employees on terms and conditions that, in the reasonable
judgment of Alliant after due inquiry, are in the aggregate
comparable to those applicable to such HAC Employees on the
Closing Date, subject to the terms of this HR

- 3 -
<PAGE> 154
Agreement. This provision shall not apply to named
"Specified Employees" listed in Schedule HR2 whose terms and 
conditions of employment shall be determined in accordance with
agreements reached between Alliant and such Specified 
Employee prior to the Closing Date. In the event an 
agreement is not reached between any such Specified Employee 
and Alliant prior to the Closing Date and such Specified 
Employee is terminated by Hercules, such Specified Employee 
shall pursuant to the Hercules Dismissal Salary Plan be 
considered to have resigned and shall not be eligible for 
benefits thereunder. Hercules will cooperate and use all 
reasonable efforts to assist Alliant in obtaining the 
continued employment of HAC Employees and the Specified 
Employees. Provided, however, nothing contained in this 
HR Agreement nor the Purchase and Sale Agreement prohibits, 
nor shall it be construed to prohibit, Alliant or any 
subsidiary thereof from terminating, discharging, laying off
or otherwise changing the terms and conditions of employment
of Alliant New Employees at any time after the Closing Date.

B. Alliant will offer to transfer employment on an at-will basis
to all employees listed in Schedule HR1 who are ready, able and
willing to return to work within five (5) months following the
Closing Date, or all other employees which it or Hercules is
required by law to hire at the end of such employee's leave of
absence or layoff ("Legal Hire(s)"). If,

- 4 -
<PAGE> 155
within such five (5) month period after the Closing Date,
Alliant or a subsidiary thereof employs any individual who is
listed in Schedule HR1, or Alliant or a subsidiary thereof
hires a Legal Hire, then such individual will be treated as an
Alliant New Employee as of his or her date of hire by Alliant
or a subsidiary thereof and the provisions of this HR Agreement
shall apply to such individual with his or her date of hire
being substituted for the Closing Date.

C. Plant Closing and Layoffs. Hercules agrees that it shall not
at any time during the 90-day period preceding the Closing Date
effectuate (1) a "plant closing" as defined in the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988 ("the 
WARN Act") affecting any site of employment of the HAC 
Business, or (2) take any action to precipitate a "mass 
layoff" as defined in the WARN Act affecting any site of 
employment of the HAC Business, except, in either case, in a 
manner consistent with complying fully with the notice and 
other requirements of the WARN Act. Hercules and Alliant 
agree to indemnify and hold each other harmless from and 
against any and all losses which they may incur in connection
with any claim of violation of the WARN Act based on actions 
taken or not taken by the other party with regard to the HAC 
Business or breach of the provisions of this Section 2.C.

<PAGE> 156
Section 3 - Benefit Plans

Effective on the Closing Date, Alliant shall provide Alliant New
Employees with employee benefit plans or programs as determined in
Alliant's sole discretion subject to the terms of this HR Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of this provision, it is further agreed:

A. Credited Service

Effective on the Closing Date, or for purposes of the
employees listed in Schedule HR1 on their date of hire within
the five (5) month period following the Closing Date and a 
Legal Hire on their date of hire, all Alliant New
Employees shall be immediately credited by Alliant with
credited service for purposes of participation, vesting,
eligibility for benefits, benefit calculation and benefit
accrual under the Alliant Employee Benefit Plans established
pursuant to this Section 3 equal to the credited service
recognized for such purposes by Hercules prior to the Closing
Date (including service for Alliant New Employees eligible for
future reinstatement under Hercules Rules of Service for which
pension assets have been transferred pursuant to Section 3B(1)
of this HR Agreement). Notwithstanding the forgoing, if a HAC
Employee retires under a Hercules Employee Benefit Plan on or
before the Closing Date,

- 6 -
<PAGE> 157
Alliant shall not grant credited service to such HAC
Employee for any pre-retirement service with Hercules or any
of the Subsidiaries and Alliant shall not grant credited
service for service recognized by Hercules to any person hired
by Alliant after the Closing Date who is not an Alliant New
Employee as defined herein.

B. Qualified Defined Benefit Plans
(1) Hercules Pension Plan

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, Alliant
shall, or shall cause a subsidiary to,
establish a defined benefit plan and trust
(collectively the "Alliant New Pension Plan")
to assume the benefit liability for the
Agreed Transfer Amount (defined below) and to
receive and hold assets equal to the value of
the Agreed Transfer Amount. As soon as
practicable after the Closing Date, Alliant
or a subsidiary thereof shall submit such
Alliant New Pension Plan to the Internal
Revenue Service for a determination of its
qualified status under Sections 401(a) and
501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
("Code").

(b) Hercules shall cause the actuary for the
Hercules Pension Plan ("Hercules
Actuary") to determine, as of the Closing

- 7 -
<PAGE> 158

Date, the present value of the
projected benefit obligations of the
Transferred Participants within the meaning
of FASB 87 based on all actuarial assumptions
which underlie the calculation of the
projected benefit obligation which was
disclosed in the Hercules 1993 Annual Report
to Stockholders less the amount of Five
Million and 00/100 Dollars ($5,000,000) in
accordance with the minimum requirements of
Section 414(l) of the Code and Treasury
Regulations ("Treas. Reg.") Section
1.414(1)-l and Section 208 of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974
("ERISA") (such present value shall be the
"Proposed Transfer Amount"). The Proposed
Transfer Amount will be adjusted to reflect
actual change in any participant data prior
to the Closing Date as a result of
termination of employment, retirement or
death of any Transferred Participant.

Any applicable pension surplus (on a
projected benefit obligation basis) as
specifically calculated for the HAC Business
by the Hercules Actuary, as of the Closing
Date, shall also be transferred to Alliant
("Pension Surplus Amount"). This amount
shall be calculated on a basis

- 8 -
<PAGE> 159

consistent with that used to determine
HAC pension deficiencies (projected benefit
obligation in excess of plan assets) as of
December 31, 1993, and December 31, 1992,
which were the basis for determining a
pension liability/asset in the HAC audited
financial statement as of those respective
dates. It is the intent that this
transaction shall be an asset/liability
transfer between two qualified plans and not
a partial termination of the Hercules Pension
Plan. The assumptions used for such
calculation shall be consistent with the
assumptions used in the HAC audited financial
statements as of December 31, 1993.

The computation and the information
used in the computation of the Proposed
Transfer Amount and the Pension Surplus
Amount shall be submitted to any actuary
selected by Alliant ("Alliant Actuary") no
later than sixty (60) days prior to the
Closing Date. In the event that the Alliant
Actuary shall dispute in a written notice to
Hercules the determination of the Proposed
Transfer Amount, compliance with the minimum 
requirements of Section 414(l) and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder, or the
determination of the Pension Surplus Amount,
the Hercules

- 9 -
<PAGE> 160

the Pension Surplus Amount no later
than forty-five (45) days prior to the
Closing Date. In the event the Hercules
Actuary and the Alliant Actuary shall meet to
resolve such dispute and agree on the
Proposed Transfer Amount and the Pension
Surplus Amount no later than forty-five (45)
days prior to the Closing Date. In the event
the Hercules Actuary and the Alliant Actuary
are unable to resolve such dispute within ten
(10) calendar days from the date such written
notice is given, representatives from Alliant
and Hercules shall meet within ten (10)
calendar days to resolve such issue. Should
the parties' representatives fail to reach an
agreement within ten (10) calendar days, the
dispute resolution procedure set forth in the
Purchase and Sale Agreement shall apply. The
amount agreed to by the Hercules Actuary and
the Alliant Actuary or the amount determined
by the parties' representatives shall herein
be referred to as the "Agreed Transfer
Amount".

(c) Effective on the Closing Date, Hercules 
shall cause the trustee of the Hercules
Pension Plan to divide each investment
category of assets of the Hercules Pension
Plan on a pro rata basis determined by
multiplying each investment category in the
Hercules Pension Plan Master Trust by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the
Agreed Transfer Amount and the denominator of
which is the total market value of the assets
in the Hercules Pension Plan

- 10 -
<PAGE> 161

Master Trust as of the Closing Date. 
The constituency of the assets included in
the Agreed Transferred Amount will be
representative of the asset categories of the
Hercules Pension Plan Master Trust as of the
Closing Date.

(d) As soon as practicable on or after the 
Closing Date and after the Alliant New
Pension Plan has received a favorable
determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service or upon written opinion of
Alliant counsel that the Alliant New Pension
Plan will be qualified, Hercules shall,
effective as of the Closing Date, cause the
trustee of the Hercules Pension Plan to
transfer, convey, grant and assign to
Alliant and the Alliant New Pension Plan
without further act or deed all of its right,
title and interest in and to such Pension
assets (as determined under Section 3(c)
above) equal to the Agreed Transfer Amount. 
The Alliant New Pension Plan shall receive a
pro rata share of each investment category of
assets from the Hercules Pension Plan as
determined above. The retention of
transferred assets and appropriate
liabilities by the Alliant New Pension Plan
shall be contingent upon the Alliant New
Pension

- 11 -
<PAGE> 162

Plan's initial qualification pursuant
to Code Sections 401(a) and 501(a) within one
(1) year following the Closing Date.

In the event that the assets cannot be
transferred from the Hercules Pension Plan to
the Alliant New Pension Plan on the Closing
Date, Hercules shall cause the trustee of the
Hercules Pension Plan to create a separate or
sub trust in the Hercules Pension Plan Master
Trust and shall cause the trustee to transfer
to such separate or sub trust on the Closing
Date assets sufficient to fulfill the Agreed
Transfer Amount as determined under the
formula contained in Subsection 3B(1)(c)
above. As soon as administratively feasible
after the Closing Date, the assets in the
separate or sub trust shall be transferred to
the separate trust of the Alliant New Pension
Plan. Benefits payable to Transferred
Participants and plan expenses incurred,
after the Closing Date and before the assets
are transferred to the separate trust of the
Alliant New Pension Plan, shall be paid out
of the separate or sub trust. The Agreed
Transfer Amount will be adjusted by gains and
losses experienced by the investments.

- 12 -
<PAGE> 163

(e) In consideration for the transfer of the 
Agreed Transfer Amount to the separate
or sub trust in the Hercules Pension Plan
Master Trust or to the separate trust
established for the Alliant New Pension Plan,
whichever occurs first, the Alliant New
Pension Plan shall, effective as of the date
of such transfer, assume all of the
liabilities for accrued benefits in respect
of the Transferred Participants. No later
than thirty (30) calendar days prior to the
transfer, Hercules and Alliant shall
cooperate in filing all necessary forms with
the Internal Revenue Service to effectuate
the transfer.

(f) Hercules shall take appropriate steps to 
assure that, effective on the Closing
Date, the Transferred Participants shall
receive no further accruals under the
Hercules Pension Plan.

(g) In the event an employee listed in Schedule 
HR1 or a Legal Hire becomes an Alliant
New Employee pursuant to Section 2A and B
hereof, effective on the first anniversary of
the Closing Date, the Hercules Actuary and
the Alliant Actuary shall perform the process
set forth in Section 3B1(b) hereof

- 13 -
<PAGE> 164

(except that the actuarial assumptions
used to calculate the projected benefit
obligation in the most recent Hercules Annual
Report to Stockholders shall be used) to
determine the present value of the projected
benefit obligation for such employee(s) as of
their date of hire by Alliant and the
Hercules Pension Plan shall transfer such
present value to the Alliant New Pension Plan
and the Alliant New Pension Plan shall accept
liability therefor.

(2) GOCO Pension Plans

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, Alliant
shall, or shall cause a subsidiary to,
establish two defined benefit plans and
related trusts (collectively the "Alliant
GOCO Plans") that are identical to the
Hercules Pension Plan Government-Owned
Hercules-Operated and the Hercules Retirement
Income Plan Government-Owned
Hercules-Operated applicable to employees of
the government owned, company-operated
facilities of the HAC Business (collectively
"Hercules GOCO Plans") to assume the
liability for the Hercules GOCO Plans and to
receive and hold assets equal to the assets
held in the Hercules GOCO Plans' trust. As
soon as practicable after the Closing Date,

- 14 -
<PAGE> 165

Alliant or a subsidiary thereof shall
submit such Alliant GOCO Plans to the
Internal Revenue Service for a determination
of its qualified status under Sections 401(a)
and 501(a) of the Code.

(b) As soon as practicable on or after the
Closing Date and after the Alliant GOCO 
Plans have received a favorable 
determination letter from the IRS or written
opinion of Alliant counsel that the Alliant
GOCO Plans will be qualified, each of the two
Hercules GOCO Plans with their appropriate
trust assets shall be merged, effective as of
the Closing Date, into the corresponding
Alliant GOCO Plan. It is the intent of both
Hercules and Alliant that this transaction
shall be a merger of qualified plans and not
a plan termination for purposes of ERISA.

(c) In consideration for the merger of the
Hercules GOCO Plans and the Alliant
GOCO Plans, the Alliant GOCO Plans shall,
effective as of the date of such merger,
assume all of the liabilities for accrued
benefits in respect of the Transferred GOCO
Participants. No later than thirty (30) days
prior to the merger, Hercules and Alliant
shall

- 15 -
<PAGE> 166

cooperate in filing all necessary forms with
the Internal Revenue Service to effectuate 
the transfer.

C. Qualified Defined Contribution Plans

(1) Effective as of the Closing Date, Alliant shall, or
cause a subsidiary to, establish one or more
defined contribution plans and related trusts
(collectively "Alliant Savings Plans") to assume the
liability for the payment of benefits for the
Transferred Participants who on the Closing Date are
participants in the Hercules Savings and Investment
Plan, the Hercules Savings Plan or the G.E.S. Savings
Plan (collectively "Hercules Savings Plans") and to
receive and hold assets equal to the value of the
account balances of the Transferred Participants in
said plans. As soon as practicable after the Closing
Date, Alliant shall submit to the Internal Revenue
Service the Alliant Savings Plans for a determination
of said plans' qualified status under Section 401(a),
401(k) and 501(a) of the Code as appropriate.

(2) The value of said account balances shall be
determined as of the last Valuation Date of each
Hercules Savings Plan that occurs on or immediately 
precedes the transfer. Such valuation of assets 
shall comply with the minimum requirements of Section
414(l) of

- 16 -
<PAGE> 167

the Code, Treas. Reg. Section 1.414(l)-l(n) and (o),
and Section 208 of ERISA.

(3) As soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date
and after the Alliant Savings Plans have received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal 
Revenue Service or upon written opinion of
Alliant Counsel that the Alliant Savings Plans will
be qualified, Hercules shall, effective as of the
Closing Date, cause the trustee of the Hercules
Savings Plans to transfer, convey, grant and assign
to Alliant and the Alliant Savings Plans without
further act or deed, all of its right, title and
interest in and to assets in the form of cash, cloned
GIC contracts as listed in Schedule HR3, and common
stock of Hercules Incorporated with a value equal to
the account balances of the Transferred Participants
in the Hercules Savings Plans. The retention of
transferred assets and appropriate liabilities by the
Alliant Savings Plans shall be contingent upon such
plans initial qualification pursuant to Code Sections 
401(a), 401(k) and 501(a) within one (1) year
following the Closing Date.

(4) In consideration for the transfer of assets equal to
the account balances of the Transferred Participants,
effective on the Closing

- 17 -
<PAGE> 168

Date, the Alliant Savings Plans shall assume
all of the liabilities for account balances in
respect of the Transferred Participants.

(5) As of the Closing Date, the Transferred Participants
shall no longer be eligible to participate in
or to receive contributions under the Hercules
Savings Plans.

D. Disclaimer
Nothing in this HR Agreement or the Purchase and Sale
Agreement shall be construed to prohibit Alliant from
modifying or terminating any "employee pension benefit plan,"
as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA, provided to Transferred
Participants or Transferred GOCO Participants subsequent to
the Closing Date.

Section 4 - Non-Qualified Supplemental Retirement Plans

A. Effective as of the Closing Date, Alliant shall, or cause a
subsidiary to, establish one or more nonqualified
supplemental retirement plan(s) (SERP) to assume the liability
for payment of benefits to Transferred Participants or
Transferred GOCO Participants who on the Closing Date are
participants in the Hercules Employee Pension Restoration Plan
(or the Hercules Deferred Compensation Plan for purposes of
nonqualified restorative defined contribution plan benefits).

- 18 -
<PAGE> 169

B. The value of the SERP liability as of the Closing Date or the
date of hire, if later, (calculated in accordance with
Section 3B and 3C of this HR Agreement as appropriate) shall
be set forth in Schedule HR4. This SERP liability shall not
include a benefit that any Transferred Participant or
Transferred GOCO Participant exchanged for Hercules common
stock prior to the Closing Date.

C. For purposes of determining Hercules' obligation hereunder,
see Section 10.9 of this HR Agreement.

Section 5 - Health and Welfare Plans
A. Pre-existing condition

With respect to all Transferred Participants and Transferred
GOCO Participants who are eligible and elect to become
participants in the Alliant Employee Benefit Plans providing
medical, dental, life or long-term disability ("LTD")
insurance, Alliant shall waive any pre-existing condition
exclusions and waiting periods under the applicable Alliant
Employee Benefit Plan, provided such Transferred Participants
and Transferred GOCO Participants were not subject to a
pre-existing condition exclusion or waiting period under the
respective Hercules Employee Benefit Plan on the Closing Date. 
In those cases where a Transferred Participant or

- 19 -
<PAGE> 170
Transferred GOCO Participant is subject to such pre-existing
condition exclusion or waiting period under a Hercules
Employee Benefit Plan, Alliant shall amend its respective
plan's pre-existing condition provision to reflect the
remaining pre-existing condition exclusion or waiting period,
which shall be no greater than that which was remaining under
the respective Hercules medical, dental, life or LTD plan.

B. Pre-Closing Claims

Hercules, subject to the procedure outlined in Section
10.9 of this HR Agreement, shall retain all liabilities and
obligations for medical, dental, life and LTD insurance, and
other welfare plan benefits in respect of Alliant New
Employees and their dependents arising out of claims incurred
on or prior to their date of hire by Alliant. Alliant shall
be responsible for claims incurred after such Alliant New
Employees' date of hire to the extent covered under an Alliant
Employee Benefit Plan.

A claim shall be deemed to have been incurred upon the
incurrence of a qualified expense for which reimbursement or
payment is sought; provided however, a claim for a
hospitalization stay (and medical treatment during such stay)
which begins on or prior to their date of hire and which ends
after their date of hire shall be deemed to have incurred
prior to their date of hire.

- 20 -
<PAGE> 171

Hercules shall retain all liabilities and obligations
for all health and welfare benefits with respect to any
Alliant New Employee who on the Closing Date is hospitalized
or an Alliant New Employee's dependent who is hospitalized on
the Closing Date, whether arising out of claims incurred
before or on or after the Closing Date (applicable to the
reason for such hospitalization) and shall continue such
benefits and be liable for claims applicable to such hospital
confinement and related medical treatment until such
individual has been discharged from the hospital and becomes
employed by Alliant pursuant to Section 2.A or B of this HR
Agreement.

C. Post-Retirement Benefits
Effective on the Closing Date, Alliant shall assume all
liabilities and obligations of Hercules, if any, to
provide post-retirement medical and life insurance to
Transferred Participants or Transferred GOCO Participants who
retired prior to the Closing Date and who immediately prior to
the Closing Date are being provided, or are otherwise eligible
for, such benefits by Hercules by virtue of their retirement
status with Hercules.

D. Spending Accounts
The parties agree to cooperate to effect an orderly
transition for Alliant New Employees from the Hercules
spending accounts to the Alliant

- 21 -
<PAGE> 172
Health Care Reimbursement Account and Dependent Daycare
Reimbursement Account as appropriate.

E. Disclaimer

Nothing in this HR Agreement nor the Purchase and Sale
Agreement shall be construed to prohibit Alliant from
modifying or terminating any "employee welfare benefit plan"
as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, provided to Transferred
Participants or Transferred GOCO Participants subsequent to
the Closing Date.

Section 6 - Severance

Effective as of the Closing Date, the severance benefits, if any, to
be provided to any Alliant New Employee who is terminated by Alliant on or 
after the Closing Date shall be determined in accordance with Alliant's 
applicable severance policy as in effect from time to time. Hercules shall 
indemnify and hold Alliant harmless from and against any losses which may be 
incurred or suffered as a result of any claim or claims for payment under any 
Hercules severance plan by an Alliant New Employee because of the purchase and
sale of the HAC Business.

- 22 -
<PAGE> 173
Section 7 - Vacation

As of the Closing Date, Alliant will assume all liabilities of
Hercules relating to pre-closing accrued and unused vacation days for Alliant 
New Employees, provided, however, that Hercules shall, subject to its
obligations under Section 10.9 hereof, promptly, upon request, reimburse
Alliant for repayment of such vacation days to any Alliant New Employee who
voluntarily resigns his or her employment with Alliant within three months
after the Closing Date. For purposes of determining Hercules' obligations
hereunder, see Section 10.9 of this HR Agreement.

Section 8 - Employee Representatives

As indicated in Schedule 1.17, Hercules currently recognizes various
unions at HAC Business locations as the collective bargaining representatives 
for employees and are signatory to certain Collective Bargaining Agreements. 
Alliant and Hercules agree not to interfere with each other with respect to 
such Collective Bargaining Agreements and collective bargaining representatives
on matters relating to this transaction. Prior to the Closing Date, Alliant 
and Hercules agree to consult with each other concerning the subject matter of
such recognition and Collective Bargaining Agreements before any meeting with 
such union representatives which relate to this transaction. Nothing in this 
provision shall prevent either party from taking actions that

- 23 -
<PAGE> 174
are lawful and consistent with their obligations under the Collective
Bargaining Agreement(s) and the National Labor Relations Act.

Section 9 - Workers' Compensation

Responsibility for workers' compensation claims related to the HAC
Business arising out of conditions having a date of injury (or, in the case 
of a claim relating to occupational disease, the last significant exposure) 
on or before the Closing Date shall remain with Hercules to the extent such 
liability exceeds the FAS 112 Accrual as set forth in the HAC Business 
Financial Statement. Alliant shall have responsibility for Hercules' claims 
up to the stated FAS 112 Accrual and such claims having a date of injury
(or, in the case of a claim relating to occupational disease, the last
significant exposure) after the Closing Date.

Section 10 - Hercules Representations and Warranties Applicable to Human
Resource Issues

10.1. Except as set forth in Schedule HR5, there are no other 
written or unwritten labor contracts or agreements or benefit
plans (ERISA or non-ERISA) binding upon Hercules applicable to any
employee group, employee or former employee of the HAC Business
where the cost to Hercules to provide benefits under any such
contract, agreement, or plan

- 24 -
<PAGE> 175
exceeds $25,000 a year including pension, health, medical
expense reimbursement, dental, life insurance, short-term or
long-term disability, profit-sharing, stock purchase, stock
option, bonus, deferred compensation, severance, supplemental
retirement or any other such Hercules-maintained employee benefit
plan, other than any social insurance or government-mandated
program. Schedule HR5 also identifies any insurance contracts in
force on or before the Closing Date used to fund the obligation of
such plans, contracts, or agreements.

10.2 Except as set forth in Schedule HR6, there are no employment
agreements, consulting agreements, executive compensation
agreements, special executive pension arrangements or other
special perquisites applicable to employees functioning in the
capacity of executive or manager or similar employee
classification or former employees in force as of the Closing
Date, nor are there any unfunded pension or similar deferred
benefit obligations for termination (or like indemnities) with
respect to the HAC Business or any employees thereof.

10.3 Except as listed in Schedule HR7, to the best of Hercules'
knowledge, there are no labor strikes or litigation or
administrative proceedings related to employment, labor or benefit
plan matters pending, other than ERISA claims for benefits or
appeals of denied claims (such appeals

- 25 -
<PAGE> 176
shall be listed separately on Schedule HR7), nor to the best of
Hercules' knowledge, threatened against Hercules related to the
HAC Business. Subject to the materiality standard set forth in
the Purchase and Sale Agreement, to the best of Hercules'
knowledge, Hercules is in material compliance with respect to the
HAC Business with all federal and state wage laws, benefit laws,
and other employment-related statutes, laws, rules, regulations,
and has not engaged in any unfair labor practices.

10.4 Except as listed in Schedule HR8, all Hercules Employee
Benefit Plans have been maintained in accordance with their
terms and are in full compliance with all requirements of ERISA,
the Code and other applicable law, except where failure to do so
individually or in the aggregate does not and could not reasonably
be expected to have a material impact on Hercules. To the best of
Hercules' knowledge, there has been no "prohibited transaction"
within the meaning of Section 4975(c) of the Code or Section 406
of ERISA involving the assets of any such plan. All such employee
pension benefit plans (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) and
their respective Trusts, which are to be qualified under Section
401(a) and Section 501(a) of the Code, have, except as listed
under Schedule HR8, received favorable determination letters from
the IRS and since such determination letter, no event has

- 26 -
<PAGE> 177

occurred which would disqualify the plan. Hercules has made
all required contributions and distributions when due.

10.5 Except as listed in Schedule HR9, neither Hercules nor any
ERISA Affiliate is a participant in, nor has been a participant
in a "multi-employer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA)
for the past six (6) years.

10.6 Hercules has not incurred nor, to the best of Hercules'
knowledge, will it incur any unpaid liability under Title IV of
ERISA nor has any Hercules Employee Benefit Plan been subject to
an accumulated funding deficiency, as defined in Section 412 of
the IRS Code, or reportable event, within the meaning of Section
4043(b) of ERISA, which could or would result in a material
liability to Hercules. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
has not instituted or threatened in writing to institute a
proceeding to terminate any such Hercules Employee Benefit Plan
covered under Title IV of ERISA.

(i) Hercules has previously delivered to Alliant with
respect to each Hercules Employee Benefit Plan, true
and correct copies of (a) each Hercules Employee Benefit
Plan and any trust agreements related thereto; (b) the most
recent annual report (Form 5500 Series); and (c) the most
recent summary plan description, as

- 27 -
<PAGE> 178

described in Section 102(a)(1) of ERISA. The annual
reports (Form 5500 Series) with respect to each Hercules
Employee Benefit Plan have been properly filed, including
the payment in full of any late fees, interest and
penalties, if, and to the extent, applicable.

(ii) There are no pending actions which have been asserted
in writing or instituted (other than in respect of
benefits due in the ordinary course which, in the
aggregate, are not material) against the assets of any of
the Hercules Employee Benefit Plans or against Hercules or
any ERISA Affiliate or any fiduciary of the Hercules
Employee Benefit Plans with respect to the Hercules
Employee Benefit Plans.

(iii) Except as required by Section 4980B of the Code as
set forth on Schedule HR10, no Hercules Employee
Benefit Plan or other arrangements provides medical or
death benefits (whether or not insured) with respect to
current or former employees of Hercules or any ERISA
Affiliate beyond their retirement or other termination of
employment. Any continuation coverage provided under any
Hercules welfare benefit plan complies with Section 4980B
of the

- 28 -
<PAGE> 179

Code and, except as forth on Schedule HR10, is at the
expense of the participant or beneficiary.

(iv) Schedule HR10 sets forth each Controlled Group Plan
(other than a multi-employer plan) that is subject to
Title IV of ERISA (a "Title IV Plan"). No accumulated
funding deficiency or unpaid required installments within
the meaning of Section 412 of the Code exists, nor has
there been issued a waiver or variance of the minimum
funding standards imposed by the Code with respect to any
Title IV Plan, nor has any lien been created under Section
302(f) of ERISA or security been required under Section 307
of ERISA, nor are any excise taxes due or hereafter to
become due under Section 4971 or 4972 of the Code with
respect to the funding of any such plan for any plan year
or other fiscal period ending on or before the Closing
Date.

10.8 Except as set forth in Schedule HR12, which sets forth the
respective amounts of money, shares or other
consideration which reasonably would be expected to be paid
or distributed or transferred or otherwise provided
pursuant to this HR Agreement, no Hercules Employee Benefit
Plan or agreement will require any payment, transfer or
distribution of money, property or shares on account of or
in connection with the transaction contemplated in the
Purchase and Sale Agreement.

10.9 The Employee Benefit Accrual (as set forth in the HAC 
Business Financial Statement) transferred to Alliant
pursuant to this HR Agreement shall be sufficient to cover
Hercules' liabilities pursuant to Section 5 hereunder
covering health and dental care claims incurred and
reported but not yet paid on the Closing Date, and those
liabilities incurred by Alliant in connection with Section
4 (vacation) and Section 7 related to non-qualified
supplemental retirement benefits for Alliant New Employees
(and Transferred Participants and Transferred GOCO
Participants to the extent they are eligible to receive a
SERP benefit). Hercules and Alliant shall agree to a method
under which Alliant shall reimburse Hercules for any
Hercules expenses incurred for the payment of incurred and
reported medical and dental claims up to the limits
provided for in this Section 10.9. To the extent that
there is a deficiency in the Employee Benefit Accrual, said
deficiency shall be handled in accordance with the

- 30 -

Net Book Value Adjustment Protocol as attached to the
Purchase and Sale Agreement. To the extent any medical or
dental claims cannot be reconciled by the end of the sixty
(60) day period (required in such Protocol) following the
Closing Date, Hercules shall be responsible for payment of
such incurred but unreported claims.

10.10 To the best of Hercules' knowledge, except as listed in
Schedule HR13, Hercules warrants that each HAC Business
Unit has an adequate number of employees for the conduct of
the businesses in which it participates and that based on
each HAC Business Unit's current business level, the number
of surplus employees, if any, are minimal in number.

10.11 Hercules agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Alliant and 
its affiliates, and any of their successors and permitted
assigns, harmless from and against any and all claims,
damages, losses, expenses and other liabilities whatsoever
(including, without limitation, attorney's fees, court
costs and costs of investigation) arising on or before the
Closing Date and resulting from or arising out of any and
all requirements that Hercules perform or satisfy
obligations relating to Hercules Employee Benefit Plans
pursuant to this HR Agreement.

Section 11 - Alliant Representations and Warranties Applicable to Human
Resource Issues

11.1 Alliant warrants that, pursuant to Tres. Reg. Section
1.411(d)-4 (or successor section thereto), protected benefits
under any qualified plan of Hercules or its affiliates that are
transferred to a plan established and maintained by Alliant or a
subsidiary thereof will not be reduced or eliminated, except as
may be permitted pursuant to such regulation (or successor section
thereto).

11.2 Alliant warrants that (i) any existing Alliant Employee
Benefit Plan that receives assets and/or liabilities from a
Hercules qualified plan is qualified under Section 401(a) of the

curative action taken) to cause its qualification, retroactive to
the transfer date; and (ii) any Alliant Employee Benefit Plan
created for the purpose of this HR Agreement has been or will be

regarding its qualified status.

from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, expenses and
other liabilities whatsoever (including, without limitation,
attorney's fees, court costs and costs of investigation) arising
after the Closing Date and resulting from or arising out of any
and all requirements that Alliant perform or satisfy obligations
relating to Alliant Employee Benefit Plans pursuant to this HR
Agreement.

Section 12 - Subrogation

A. To the extent that an indemnifying party shall make payment to
the indemnified party pursuant to this Agreement, the
indemnifying party shall be subrogated to any and all rights which
the indemnified party may have against third parties with respect
to such indemnifiable loss; provided, however, that if any such
amount shall be paid to the indemnifying party on account of any
subrogation rights while the indemnified party has outstanding any
claim for an indemnifiable loss, such amount shall be received in
trust for the benefit of the indemnified party and shall forthwith
be applied to the satisfaction of such indemnifiable losses.

Section 13 - Hercules Conduct Prior To and After Closing

A. Hercules agrees that during the period from the date of this
Agreement until the Closing Date, except as set forth in
Schedule HR14 or as Alliant may otherwise consent to in writing
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), Hercules shall
not:

(1) grant to any employee any increase in compensation in
any form (other than pursuant to existing
employment agreements and except for increases made
in the ordinary course of business and consistent
with existing policy and past practice) or enter into
or vary the terms of any employment, consulting or
severance agreement with any employee;

(2) make any change in compensation policy or contribute
or make any commitment to, or make any
representations that it will contribute, any amounts
to any Hercules Employee Benefit Plan or arrangement
or otherwise adopt or amend in any respect or

B. Hercules agrees that neither Hercules nor any of its
Affiliates under its control during the period from the Closing
Date until the second anniversary of the Closing Date, except as
Alliant may otherwise consent to in writing (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld), shall not directly or indirectly
solicit any former employee of Hercules or any of the Subsidiaries
who is employed by Alliant solely in connection with the HAC
Business at any time on or after the Closing Date to terminate his
or her relationship with Alliant; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not apply to persons hired by Hercules as a result
of the use of an independent employment agency (so long as the
agency was not directed to solicit any such person or Alliant
employees generally) or as a result of the use of a general
solicitation (such as an advertisement) not specifically directed
to such employees.

C. Hercules agrees to use reasonable efforts to enforce its
existing Secrecy Agreements between Hercules Incorporated and
employees and former employees of Hercules Incorporated as the
subject matter of such agreements may be impacted by the
transaction contemplated herein. In the event Hercules determines
a violation of such an agreement has

- 35 -
<PAGE> 186

occurred concerning proprietary information transferred with
the HAC Business as provided herein, Hercules shall take all
reasonable steps necessary to notify all affected parties of the
violation and take reasonable steps to protect Alliant's interest
pursuant to such violation.

of said Article XIII, (i) they shall be construed to give effect

perform such duty or obligation on Tenant's behalf, including but not limited
to the obtaining of reasonable required bonds, insurance policies or
governmental licenses, permits or approvals. The costs and expenses of any such
performance by Landlord shall be due and payable by Tenant to Landlord upon

recovering of possession of the Premises shall deprive Landlord of any of its
remedies or actions against Tenant for past or future rent or other sums due

construed as a waiver of the right to obtain possession of the Premises.

provision(s) containing the obligation(s). After Tenant receives notice of the
third party's name and address and request for notice upon Landlord's Default,
Tenant shall provide the notice required by this paragraph to any such third
party at the same time Tenant gives notice to Landlord.

If Landlord commits a Default, Tenant may pursue any remedies given in this

Act") the applicable party, and for purposes hereof, when such term is used
with respect to the Stockholder, shall include all directors of the Stockholder
who are also officers of the Stockholder.

2. Term of Agreement. The term (the "Term") of this Agreement
shall commence on the date hereof and shall continue until the earlier to occur
of (i) the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and (ii) the date on which the

Stockholder; provided, however, that nominees who are executive officers or
directors of the Stockholder shall not be subject to the foregoing requirement
unless and until either (i) the Stockholder becomes a party to any business
combination transaction and is not the surviving corporation thereof, or (ii)
any "person" or "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) becomes the

Voting Securities of the Stockholder.

Stockholder shall not be entitled to designate any person as a nominee for
election to the Board if the election of such person would result in any
violation of applicable law or order of any Authority, or render the Company
unable in any material respect to conduct its business.

(c) Any director who has been designated by the
Stockholder shall not be entitled to vote in respect of any action taken by the
Board or the Company relating to any business transaction between the Company
and the Stockholder or relating to this Agreement or any of the other
Definitive Agreements, or any amendment, modification or waiver hereof or
thereof.

Stockholder are not nominated to serve on the Board as set forth above, other

agree that, during the Term (i) it will, and will cause their respective
controlled affiliates to, be present, in person or represented by proxy, at all

be counted for the purpose of determining the presence of a quorum for the
election of directors at such meetings, and (ii) it will, and will cause its
controlled affiliates to, vote, or act by consent with respect to, all Voting
Securities beneficially owned by it and its controlled affiliates for the
election of the nominees for the Board nominated by the nominating committee of
the Board, so long as such nominees consist of individuals meeting the
requirements of the first sentence of Section 3(a) hereof. Other than the
foregoing, there shall be no restrictions on the Stockholder's or its
controlled affiliates' or Capstay or its controlled affiliates' ability to vote
any Voting Securities.

(b) Neither the Stockholder or its controlled
affiliates, nor Capstay or its controlled affiliates shall participate in the
Closing Repurchase (as defined herein).

Stockholder will not, and will cause each of its controlled affiliates not to,
acquire, offer or propose to acquire, or agree to acquire, directly or
indirectly, any Voting Securities or Conversion Securities; provided, however,
that the Stockholder and its controlled affiliates may acquire Voting
Securities and/or Conversion Securities pursuant to this Agreement: (a) as
provided in the Transaction Agreement, (b) by way of stock dividends, stock
splits, reorganization, recapitalization, merger, consolidation or other
similar transactions made available to holders of Common Stock generally, or
(c) in open market or privately negotiated transactions which do not violate
the federal securities laws if, after giving effect to such transactions, the
Stockholder and its controlled affiliates would not beneficially own more than
40% of the Total Voting Power. If, at any time during the Term, the
Stockholder and its controlled affiliates shall become the beneficial owners of
more than 40% of the Total Voting Power as a result of purchases of Common
Stock by the Company, recapitalizations or other comparable actions by the
Company, the Stockholder and/or its controlled affiliates will promptly, and in
any event within 60 days after becoming aware of such fact, sell such number of
Voting Securities or Conversion Securities as shall be necessary to reduce the
beneficial ownership interest of the Stockholder and its controlled affiliates
to 40% or less of the Total Voting Power in compliance with the provisions of
this Agreement (other than Section 7(a) or (b) below).

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (i) any Voting
Securities acquired by the Stockholder or its controlled affiliates subsequent
to the date hereof and within the Term

-5-

shall be subject only to the provisions of Sections 4, 5 and 6 of this
Agreement and shall not be subject to any other provision of this Agreement and
(ii) purchases of Voting Securities or Conversion Securities made by the
trustees of any Exempt Plan shall not be construed as purchases by the
Stockholder or its controlled affiliates.

prior written consent of the Company duly authorized by the Board, the
Stockholder will not, and will cause each of its controlled affiliates not to,
singly or as part of a "group", directly or indirectly, through one or more
intermediaries (i) make, or in any way participate, directly or indirectly, in
any "solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are defined or used in
Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act) with respect to the Voting Securities
(including by the execution of actions by written consent), become a
"participant" in any "election contest" (as such terms are defined or used in
Rule 14a-11 under the Exchange Act) with respect to the Company or seek to
advise or influence any person or entity with respect to the voting of any
Voting Securities; (ii) initiate, propose, or participate in the solicitation
of stockholders for the approval of, one or more stockholder proposals with
respect to the Company as described in Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act or
induce any other individual or entity to initiate any stockholder proposal
relating to the Company; (iii) form, join, influence or participate in a
"group", act in concert with any other person or entity or otherwise become a
"person", for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any
Voting Securities or taking any other actions prohibited under this Section 6;
(iv) make any proposal or, except as may be required by law, any public
announcement relating to a tender or exchange offer for any Voting Securities,
or a merger, business combination, sale of assets, liquidation, restructuring,
recapitalization or other extraordinary corporate transaction relating to the
Company or its material assets; (v) act, alone or in concert with others
(including by providing financing for another party), to seek or offer to
control the Company (provided that actions of the Stockholder's nominees on the
Board pursuant to Section 3(a) shall not be deemed a violation of the
foregoing); (vi) deposit any Voting Securities in a voting trust or subject any
Voting Securities to any arrangement or agreement with respect to the voting
thereof; (vii) disclose any intention, plan or arrangement inconsistent with
the foregoing prohibitions or advise or assist any other person in connection
with the foregoing prohibitions; or (viii) seek, request or propose any waiver,
modification, amendment or termination of any provision of Section 5 or Section
6 of this Agreement (other than any request or proposal made or solicited by
the Company or a request by the Stockholder to the Company to obtain
clarification of any provision of this Agreement);

provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall prohibit the Company
from publicly announcing its position with respect to any matter concerning the
Company.

7. Disposition of Voting Securities.

(a) Except as specifically provided in Section 5 hereof,
until the first anniversary of the date hereof and subject to the provisions of
Sections 7(d), (e) and (f) below, the Stockholder shall not, and shall cause
its controlled affiliates not to, transfer any Voting Securities, whether by
sale, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, gift, bequest, appointment or otherwise,
without the prior written consent of the Company in each instance.

(b) Except as specifically required in Section 5 or 8
hereof, from and after the first anniversary of the date hereof, the
Stockholder and its controlled affiliates may freely sell or transfer Voting
Securities, subject to (i) compliance with federal and state securities laws
and (ii) the provisions of this Section 7(b) and Section 7(c) below. In the
case of any proposed sale or transfer pursuant to this Section 7(b), the
Stockholder shall, and shall cause its controlled affiliates to, comply with
the following provisions:

(i) Promptly upon receipt of a bona fide offer
or the finalization of the terms of a proposed sale or transfer of Voting
Securities to a third party, the Stockholder or its controlled affiliate shall
notify the Company in writing of its intention to sell, transfer or dispose of
such Voting Securities, specifying the number of Voting Securities proposed to
be sold or transferred, the identity or identities of the prospective purchaser
or purchasers thereof, the proposed purchase price therefor, the manner of sale
and the material terms of any agreement relating thereto. Such notification
shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Stockholder Notice".

(ii) The Company shall have the right,
exercisable by written notice of exercise given to the Stockholder or its
controlled affiliate within 5 business days following receipt by the Company of
the Stockholder Notice to purchase (or to cause a person or persons designated
by the Company to purchase) all, but not less than all, of the Voting
Securities specified in such Stockholder Notice at the price, in the manner and
on the terms specified therein. If the purchase price specified in the
Stockholder Notice includes any property other than cash, the purchase price at
which the Company (or its designee) shall be entitled to purchase shall be (x)
the amount of cash, if any, specified in such Stockholder Notice plus (y) cash
in an amount equal to the value of the property specified therein. In

-7-
<PAGE> 233
the event that the purchase price specified in the Stockholder Notice includes
property other than cash, and the Company notifies the Stockholder of its
irrevocable determination to exercise its right to purchase all of the Voting
Securities specified in the Stockholder Notice so long as the value of such
property does not exceed an amount specified in the Company's notice, which
represents the Company's good faith estimate of the value of such property (the
"Company's Valuation"), and the Stockholder or its controlled affiliate does
not agree with such value, the value of such property shall be determined by
two independent financial advisors, one such financial advisor to be selected
by the Company and another to be selected by the Stockholder or its controlled
affiliate, in each case, within 5 days after notice is given from the
Stockholder or its controlled affiliate, to the other party, to the effect that
they are unable to agree as to such value. If, within 5 days after being
selected, the two financial advisors have not agreed as to such value, a third
financial advisor shall be selected within 5 days thereafter by the mutual
consent of the first two financial advisors, or, if such first two financial
advisors shall fail to agree upon the selection of a third financial advisor in
such time, such selection shall be made as promptly as practicable by the
American Arbitration Association. Within 5 days of its selection, the third
financial advisor shall determine the value of such property, which
determination shall be final and binding on all parties hereto. The Company
and the Stockholder or its controlled affiliate shall each bear the costs
incurred in connection with the retention of the respective financial advisor
selected by them. All costs incurred as a result of the retention of a third
financial advisor (including any costs incurred in connection with the
assistance provided by American Arbitration Association) shall be borne equally
between the Company, on the one hand, and the Stockholder or its controlled
affiliate, on the other hand. In the event that the value of such property as
determined pursuant to the preceding sentence is (a) less than or equal to the
Company's Valuation, the Company shall be deemed to have exercised its right to
purchase all of the Voting Securities specified in such Stockholder Notice as
of the date that the purchase price was determined pursuant to this clause (ii)
and (b) greater than the Company's Valuation, the Company shall have five
business days from such date to determine whether to purchase the Voting
Securities specified in such Stockholder's Notice at the purchase price
determined pursuant to this clause (ii).

(iii) If the Company exercises its option to
purchase all, but not less than all, of the Voting Securities being offered
(including by designation of another purchaser or purchasers), the closing of
the purchase of such Voting Securities shall take place as promptly as
practicable, but (unless extended as provided herein) in no event shall such
closing take place more than 5 business days after the later of (a) the date
the Company gives

-8-
<PAGE> 234
notice of such exercise; and (b) the date the purchase price for such Voting
Securities was determined pursuant to clause (ii) above; provided that, if any
governmental or regulatory approval is required for the closing of such
purchase, the Company and the Stockholder shall each use their respective best
efforts to obtain such approval as promptly as practicable and such closing
shall occur not later than 5 days after such approval is obtained.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything contained herein,
the Company shall not have the right to transfer its right of first refusal
contained herein to any purchaser or purchasers, if the nature or identity of
such purchaser or purchasers is reasonably likely to delay the closing of such
purchase for a longer period of time than if the Company were the purchaser.

(v) If the Company elects not to exercise, or
fails to exercise within the time specified for such exercise, its option
provided herein in respect of any particular Stockholder Notice, the
Stockholder or its controlled affiliate shall be free, during the period of 90
calendar days following the last day of the period during which the Company was
permitted to exercise such option (or any earlier date on which the Company
gives notice of an election not to exercise such option), or such period longer
than 90 days as may be reasonably necessary for the Stockholder to obtain all
requisite governmental approvals, to sell the Voting Securities specified in
the Stockholder Notice in the manner, to the purchasers and on the terms and
for not less than the consideration specified in such Stockholder Notice. Any
proposed transfer by the Stockholder or its controlled affiliate of Voting
Securities other than in accordance with the provision hereof or after the
expiration of the applicable 90-calendar day period referred to in this clause
(v) will give rise to a separate right of first refusal of the Company pursuant
to the provisions of this Section 7(b).

(vi) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 7(b), following the second anniversary of the date hereof, the
Stockholder may, from time to time, sell pursuant to Rule 144 under the
Securities Act (or any successor provision) the number of Voting Securities
then permitted under Rule 144 (or any successor provision) without compliance
with the foregoing provisions of this Section 7(b).

(c) The Stockholder shall not, and shall cause its
controlled affiliates not to, at any time during the Term, knowingly sell or
transfer Voting Securities to (x) any person (including that person's
controlled affiliates and any group in which that person or its controlled
affiliates shall be a member if the Stockholder knows of the existence of such

-9-
<PAGE> 235
a group or affiliates), other than an underwriter in connection with a public
offering of Voting Securities, which would, after giving effect to such sale or
transfer, beneficially own in the aggregate Voting Securities representing in
excess of 10% of the Total Voting Power, or (y) any Foreign Person. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Foreign Person" shall have the meaning
given to it under the Regulations Pertaining to Mergers, Acquisitions, and
Takeovers by Foreign Persons, 56 Fed. Reg. 58,774 et seq. (November 21, 1993)
(31 C.F.R. Part 800).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Stockholder and its controlled affiliates shall be free without
any restrictions at all times during the Term to sell or transfer Voting
Securities (i) if a third party makes a bona fide offer to purchase Voting
Securities which represent more than fifty percent (50%) of the Total Voting
Power of the outstanding Voting Securities, which offer is approved and
recommended by the Board (if such recommendation shall not have been withdrawn
or adversely modified prior thereto), (ii) if a third party acquires beneficial
ownership of Voting Securities which represent 30% or more of the Total Voting
Power of the outstanding Voting Securities, (iii) to the Company pursuant to
any offer made by the Company to repurchase Voting Securities made to all
stockholders generally (other than the repurchase, by tender offer, open market
purchase, recapitalization or otherwise, of up to 1.5 million shares of Common
Stock to be consummated within six months of the date hereof (the "Closing
Repurchase")), or (iv) at any time after the first anniversary of the date
hereof on the New York Stock Exchange (or any other national securities
exchange on which the Common Stock is then listed), in the event that the
Company publicly announces or continues to effect a stock repurchase program.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the Stockholder may from time to time sell or transfer free of any
restriction other than as set forth below (the "Permitted Disposition") to
selected individuals who are directors, officers or employees of the
Stockholder up to a maximum of 350,000 shares of Voting Securities, in the
aggregate, during the Term. Any shares disposed of pursuant to the Permitted
Disposition will be included in calculating the Stockholder's ownership of
Voting Securities for the purposes of Section 5 above. The Stockholder agrees
to take all action necessary to ensure that such shares are not sold prior to
the first anniversary of the date hereof and remain subject to Section 7(c)
above.

-10-
<PAGE> 236
(f) The Stockholder agrees to notify the Company
promptly if the Stockholder receives written or oral notice that any United
States government agency is alleging that the Stockholder is under "foreign
ownership, control or influence" within the meaning of the Department of
Defense Industrial Security Manual (as defined in the Transaction Agreement).
Upon the Company's receipt of either (a) such notice from the Stockholder or
(b) notice from any United States government agency that the United States
government considers the Company to be under such "foreign ownership, control
or influence" due to the Stockholder's ownership of the Company's securities,
the Stockholder shall cooperate with the Company in the development of a plan
of action to insure continuation of the Company's facilities security
clearances. The Stockholder agrees that it shall either (x) agree to all such
arrangements as the United States government may require to nullify or negate
the effects of the foreign ownership, control or influence on the Company and
thereby enable the Company to retain its eligibility for facilities security
clearances or (y) if arrangements satisfactory to the United States government
are not in effect within 90 days from the date of the Company's receipt of the
aforesaid notice (or such shorter period as may be prescribed by the United
States government), then the Stockholder shall (i) immediately cease to have
any rights to designate any person to the Board and (ii) sell, and cause each
of its controlled affiliates to sell, all of its Voting Securities (or so much
thereof as shall be necessary to nullify or negate the aforesaid effects) in
compliance with (x) clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of paragraph (b) and
paragraph (c) of Section 7 above or (y) paragraph 8 below, as soon as
practicable, but in any event within 120 days after the end of such 90-day
period (or such shorter period). In order to effectuate such sale, the
Stockholder shall be entitled to request the registration of the Voting
Securities owned by it pursuant to the provisions of Section 8(a) below. Such
120-day period shall be extended for the period of any postponement by the
Company under the provisions of Section 8.

8. Registration Rights.

(a) (i) At any time commencing 270 days after the
date hereof and continuing thereafter until the date on which the Stockholder
and its controlled affiliates own Voting Securities representing less than 5%
of the Total Voting Power, the Stockholder shall have the right to make written
demand upon the Company (each, a "Stockholder Demand"), on not more than three
separate occasions (subject to the provisions of this Section 8), to register
under the Securities Act all or any portion of the shares of Voting Securities
issued to it pursuant to the Transaction Agreement and owned by the Stockholder
or its controlled affiliates (the shares subject to such demand hereunder being
referred to as the "Subject

-11-
<PAGE> 237
Stock"), which Stockholder Demand shall specify the intended method or methods
of disposition of such Subject Stock and the Company shall use its best efforts
to cause such shares to be registered under the Securities Act as soon as
reasonably practicable so as to permit promptly the disposition thereof in
accordance with the intended method or methods of disposition stated in the
Stockholder Demand (including, but not limited to, an offering on a delayed or
continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 (or any successor rule) under the
Securities Act (a "Rule 415 Offering") if the Company is then eligible to
register such Subject Stock on Form S-3 (or a successor form); so long as at
the time of the Stockholder Demand relating to such Rule 415 Offering, the
Stockholder represents to the Company that it has a present intention to sell
all of the Subject Stock included in such Stockholder Demand); provided,
however, that each such demand shall cover at least 750,000 shares of Subject
Stock (subject to adjustment for stock splits, reverse stock splits and stock
dividends after the date hereof). In connection therewith, the Company shall
prepare, and as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 60 days of the
receipt of the request), file, on Form S-3 if permitted or otherwise on the
appropriate form, a registration statement under the Securities Act to effect
such registration. The Stockholder agrees to provide all such information and
materials and to take all such action as may be reasonably required in order to
permit the Company to comply with all applicable requirements of the Securities
Act and the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") and to obtain
any desired acceleration of the effective date of such registration statement.
If the offering to be registered is to be underwritten, the managing
underwriters shall be a nationally recognized investment banking organization
selected by the Stockholder and be subject to the approval of the Company
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and the
Company, the Stockholder and such underwriters shall enter into an underwriting
agreement containing customary terms and conditions.

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
(w) shall not be obligated to cause a registration statement pursuant to this
Section 8(a) to become effective prior to the first anniversary of the date
hereof, (x) shall not be obligated to prepare or file more than one
registration statement pursuant to this Section 8(a) during any twelve-month
period, (y) shall not be obligated to cause any special audit to be undertaken
in connection with any such registration and (z) shall be entitled to postpone
for a reasonable period of time, but not in excess of 90 days, the filing of
any registration statement otherwise required to be prepared and filed by the
Company if (1) the Company is, at such time, conducting or about to conduct an
underwritten public offering of securities and is advised by its managing
underwriter or underwriters that such offering would in its or their opinion be
materially

-12-
<PAGE> 238
adversely affected by the registration so requested (any postponement pursuant
to this clause (1) shall be referred to as a "Company delay") or (2) the
Company determines in its reasonable judgment and in good faith that the
registration and distribution of the shares of Subject Stock would interfere
with any pending or imminent material financing (other than an underwritten
public offering), acquisition, disposition, corporate reorganization or other
material transaction or development involving the Company. In no event shall
the Company invoke a Company delay more than once in any twelve-month period.
In the event of any Company delay, the Stockholder shall have the right to
withdraw the request for registration by giving written notice to the Company
within 20 days after receipt of the notice of postponement (and, in the event
of such withdrawal, such request shall be ignored for purposes of determining
the number of registrations to which the Stockholder is entitled pursuant to
this Section 8(a)) and following any such delay, the Company will not file any
registration statement (other than for purposes of a stock option or other
employee benefit plan) without providing the Stockholder (x) with notice that
the Company delay is no longer in effect and (y) an opportunity for 30 days to
exercise its rights to a demand registration statement.

(iii) In the event that, at any time while any
Rule 415 Offering remains effective, the Company determines in its reasonable
judgment and in good faith that the sale of Subject Stock would require
disclosure of material information which the Company has a bona fide business
purpose for preserving as confidential or that the Company is unable to comply
with SEC requirements, the Stockholder shall, upon written notice of such good
faith determination, suspend sales of Subject Stock for a period (a "Blackout
Period") beginning on the date of receipt of such notice and expiring on the
earlier of (x) the date upon which such material information is disclosed to
the public or ceases to be material or the Company is able to comply with SEC
requirements, as the case may be, and (y) 45 days after the receipt of such
notice from the Company.

(iv) The Company shall agree not to effect any
public sale or distribution of any Voting Securities within 15 days before and
90 days (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the parties hereto) after,
the effective date of any registration statement filed pursuant to Section 8(a)
(except as part of such underwritten registration or pursuant to registration
of securities to be issued pursuant to a stock option or other employee benefit
or similar plan or securities to be proposed to be issued in exchange for
securities or assets of, or in connection with a merger or consolidation with,
another corporation).

-13-
<PAGE> 239
(v) The Company and any other stockholder
having "piggyback" registration rights shall be entitled to register securities
on any registration statement filed pursuant to Section 8(a), provided that if
the offering pursuant to such registration statement is to be made by or
through underwriters, the Company and/or any such stockholder agree to offer
its stock by or through the underwriters selected by the Stockholder and
execute an underwriting agreement in customary form; provided, further, that if
the underwriter managing the offering advises the Stockholder in writing that
in the underwriter's opinion the inclusion of such stock (or any portion
thereof) would materially adversely affect such offering, the Company and the
other stockholders shall reduce or eliminate the shares they propose to
register (among them as they may agree), to the extent required to eliminate
such material adverse effect. If the Company or any other Stockholder has been
permitted to participate in a proposed offering pursuant to this Section 8(a),
the Stockholder may determine not to consummate the sale of such Subject Stock,
in which event, it will have no liability to the Company or such other
Stockholder and, in the event that the Company or such other person(s)
determine to go forward with the registration, such registration statement will
be ignored for purposes of determining the number of registrations to which the
Stockholder is entitled pursuant to Section 8(a).

(b) If, at any time commencing after the first
anniversary of the date of this Agreement and continuing thereafter until the
Stockholder and its controlled affiliates own Voting Securities representing
less than 5% of the Total Voting Power, the Company proposes to register any
Voting Securities under the Securities Act (other than (i) pursuant to Section
8(a) above, (ii) securities to be issued pursuant to a stock option or other
employee benefit or similar plan, or (iii) securities proposed to be issued in
exchange for securities or assets of, or in connection with a merger or
consolidation with, another corporation), the Company shall, as promptly as
practicable, give written notice to the Stockholder of the Company's intention
to effect such registration. If, within 15 days after receipt of such notice,
the Stockholder submits a written request to the Company (a "Stockholder
Request") specifying the amount of Subject Stock that it proposes to sell or
otherwise dispose of in accordance with this Section 8(b), the Company shall
use its best efforts to include the shares specified in the Stockholder's
request in such registration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the offering
pursuant to such registration statement is to be made by or through
underwriters, the Company shall not be required to include Subject Stock
therein if either (A) the Stockholder does not agree to offer its stock by or
through the underwriters selected by the Company for the registration of the
shares of Voting Securities and execute an underwriting agreement in customary
form or (B) the underwriter managing the offering

-14-
<PAGE> 240
advises the Stockholder in writing that in the underwriter's opinion the
inclusion of such stock (or any portion thereof) would materially adversely
affect such offering; provided, however, that (x) in the case of a registration
statement to effectuate the sale of securities for the account of the Company,
the Stockholder shall, after inclusion of the Company shares, be treated on a
pro rata basis with any other stockholder included in such registration, based
on the number of shares proposed to be registered by each such stockholder and
(y) in the case of a registration statement filed at the request or demand of
another stockholder, shall be treated on a similar pro rata basis with all
other selling stockholders after giving priority to the stockholder making such
request or demand. No registration effected under this Section 8(b) shall
relieve the Company of its obligation to effect any registration upon request
under Section 8(a). If the Stockholder has been permitted to participate in a
proposed offering pursuant to this Section 8(b), the Company thereafter may
determine either not to file a registration statement relating thereto, or to
withdraw such registration statement, or otherwise not to consummate such
offering, without any liability hereunder other than the expenses referred to
in Section 8(e).

(c) The Stockholder, and any underwriters participating
in such offering, shall use all reasonable efforts to effect as wide a
distribution of the Stockholder's shares offered pursuant to the registration
statement as is reasonably practicable, and in no event shall any sale (other
than a sale to underwriters making such a distribution) of shares of Subject
Stock be made knowingly to (i) any person (including its affiliates and any
group in which that person or its affiliates shall be a member if the
Stockholder or underwriters know of the existence of such a group or affiliate)
that, after giving effect to such sale, would beneficially own Voting
Securities representing 10% or more of the Total Voting Power or (ii) any
Foreign Person. The Stockholder shall secure the agreement of the
underwriters, in connection with any underwritten offering of its Subject Stock
pursuant to Section 8(a), to comply with the foregoing.

(d) In connection with any offering of shares of Subject
Stock registered pursuant to Section 8(a) or (b), the Company shall (i) furnish
to the Stockholder such number of copies of any prospectus (including
preliminary and summary prospectuses) and conformed copies of the registration
statement (including amendments or supplements thereto and, in each case, all
exhibits) and such other documents as it may reasonably request, but only while
the Company shall be required under the provisions hereof to cause the
registration statement to remain current; (ii)(A) use its best efforts to
register or qualify the Subject Stock covered by such registration statement
under such blue sky or other state

-15-
<PAGE> 241
securities laws for offer and sale as the Stockholder shall reasonably request
and (B) keep such registration or qualification in effect for so long as the
registration statement remains in effect; provided, however, that the Company
shall not be obligated to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation under
the laws of any jurisdiction in which it shall not then be qualified or to file
any general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction in which such a
consent has not been previously filed or subject itself to taxation in any
jurisdiction wherein it would not otherwise be subject to tax but for the
requirements of this Section 8(d); (iii) use its best efforts to cause all
shares of Subject Stock covered by such registration statement to be registered
with or approved by such other federal or state government agencies or
authorities as may be necessary in the opinion of counsel to the Company to
enable the Stockholder to consummate the disposition of such shares of Subject
Stock; (iv) notify the Stockholder, at any time when a prospectus relating to
the registration of its Subject Stock is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act, upon discovery that, or upon the happening of any event as a
result of which, the prospectus, as then in effect, includes an untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (subject to the
good faith determination of the Board as to whether to permit sales under such
registration statement), at the request of the Stockholder promptly prepare and
furnish to it a reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment
of such prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the
purchasers of such securities, such prospectus shall not include an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; (v) comply with all
applicable rules and regulations of the Commission; (vi) use its best efforts
to list, if required by the rules of the applicable securities exchange or, if
securities of the same class are then so listed, the Subject Stock covered by
such registration statement on the New York Stock Exchange or on any other
securities exchange on which the Subject Stock is then listed; (vii) before
filing any registration statement or any amendment or supplement thereto, and
as far in advance as is reasonably practicable, furnish to the Stockholder and
its counsel copies of such documents; the Company shall not file any such
document which contains statements referring to the Stockholder to which the
Stockholder shall reasonably object; and (viii) reasonably cooperate with the
Stockholder in effecting any underwritten offering, including causing its
officers and employees to participate in any "road shows" or similar
presentations relating thereto. In connection with any offering of Subject
Stock registered pursuant to this Section 8, the Company shall (x) furnish to
the underwriter, if any, or the Stockholder unlegended

-16-
<PAGE> 242
certificates representing ownership of the Subject Stock being sold in such
denominations as requested and (y) instruct any transfer agent and registrar of
the Subject Stock to release any stop transfer orders with respect to such
Subject Stock. Upon any registration becoming effective pursuant to Section
8(a), the Company shall use its best efforts to keep such registration
statement current and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with
respect to the disposition of all Subject Stock for a period of 90 days (or 180
days, if the Company is eligible to use a Form S-3, or successor form), plus in
either case, with respect to a Rule 415 Offering, a period of time equal to any
Blackout Period, or such shorter period as shall be necessary to effect the
distribution of the Subject Stock.

The Stockholder agrees that upon receipt of any notice from the
Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in subdivision (iv)
of this Section 8(d), it will forthwith discontinue its disposition of Subject
Stock pursuant to the registration statement relating to such Subject Stock
until its receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus
contemplated by subdivision (iv) of this Section 8(d) and, if so directed by
the Company, will deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies
then in its possession of the prospectus relating to such Subject Stock current
at the time of receipt of such notice. If the Stockholder's disposition of
Subject Stock is discontinued pursuant to the foregoing sentence, unless the
Company thereafter extends the effectiveness of the registration statement to
permit dispositions of Subject Stock by the Stockholder for an aggregate of 90
days (or 180 days, if the Company is eligible to use a Form S-3, or successor
form), plus in either case, with respect to a Rule 415 Offering, a period of
time equal to any Blackout Period, whether or not consecutive, the registration
statement shall be ignored for purposes of determining the number of
registrations to which the Stockholder is entitled pursuant to Section 8(a).

(e) In connection with any registration pursuant to
Section 8(a) or (b): (i) the Stockholder shall only be responsible for
applicable agent fees, transfer taxes, discounts and commissions and
underwriting discounts and commissions related to shares of Subject Stock being
sold by the Stockholder and (ii) the Company shall pay all other fees and
expenses in connection with any registration statement under this Agreement,
including, without limitation, all registration and filing fees, all printing
costs, all fees and expenses of complying with securities or blue sky laws,
fees and disbursements of the Company's counsel and accountants and any
disbursements of underwriters customarily paid by issuers in secondary
offerings and the fees and disbursements of only one Stockholder's counsel.

-17-
<PAGE> 243
(f) In the case of any offering registered pursuant to
this Section 8, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold the Stockholder, each
underwriter, if any, of the Subject Stock under such registration and each
person who controls any of the foregoing within the meaning of Section 15 of
the Securities Act, and any officer, employee or partner of the foregoing,
harmless against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities (including
reasonable legal fees and other reasonable expenses incurred in the
investigation and defense thereof) to which they or any of them may become
subject under the Securities Act or otherwise (collectively "Losses"), insofar
as any such Losses shall arise out of or shall be based upon (i) any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the
registration statement relating to the sale of such Subject Stock (as amended
if the Company shall have filed with the Commission any amendment thereof), or
the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or
(ii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in the prospectus relating to the sale of such Subject Stock (as
amended or supplemented if the Company shall have filed with the Commission any
amendment thereof or supplement thereto), or the omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; provided, however, that the indemnification agreement contained in
this Section 8(f) shall not apply to such Losses which shall arise out of or
shall be based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or
any such omission or alleged omission, which shall have been made in reliance
upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by
the Stockholder or any such underwriter, as the case may be, specifically for
use in connection with the preparation of the registration statement or
prospectus contained in the registration statement or any such amendment
thereof or supplement thereto.

(g) In the case of each offering registered pursuant to
this Section 8, the Stockholder and each underwriter, if any, participating
therein shall agree, substantially in the same manner and to the same extent as
set forth in paragraph (f) of this Section 8, severally to indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and each person, if any, who controls the Company within
the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, and the directors and officers
of the Company, with respect to any statement in or omission from such
registration statement or prospectus contained in such registration statement
(as amended or as supplemented, if amended or supplemented as aforesaid), if
such statement or omission shall have been made in reliance upon and in
conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by the
Stockholder or such underwriter, as the case may be, specifically for

-18-
<PAGE> 244
use in connection with the preparation of such registration statement or
prospectus contained in such registration statement or any such amendment
thereof or supplement thereto.

(h) Each party indemnified under paragraph (f) or (g) of
this Section 8 shall, promptly after receipt of notice of the commencement of
any claim against such indemnified party in respect of which indemnity may be
sought hereunder, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement
thereof. The failure of any indemnified party to so notify an indemnifying
party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability in respect of
such action which it may have to such indemnified party on account of the
indemnity agreement contained in paragraph (f) or (g) of this Section 8, unless
(and only to the extent) the indemnifying party was prejudiced by such failure,
and in no event shall such failure relieve the indemnifying party from any
other liability which it may have to such indemnified party. In case any
action in respect of which indemnification may be sought hereunder shall be
brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify an indemnifying party
of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to
participate therein and, to the extent that it may desire, jointly with any
other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, and
after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its
election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be
liable to such indemnified party under paragraph (f) or (g) of this Section 8
for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party
in connection with the defense thereof, other than reasonable costs of
investigation (unless such indemnified party reasonably objects to such
assumption on the grounds that there may be defenses available to it which are
different from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party in
which event the indemnified party shall be reimbursed by the indemnifying party
for the reasonable expenses incurred in connection with retaining separate
legal counsel).

(i) If the indemnification provided for in this Section
8 is unavailable to an indemnified party or is insufficient to hold such
indemnified party harmless for any Losses in respect of which this Section 8
would otherwise apply by its terms (other than by reason of exceptions provided
in this Section 8), then each applicable indemnifying party, in lieu of
indemnifying such indemnified party, shall have a joint and several obligation
to contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a
result of such Losses, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified
party, on the other hand, in connection with the offering to which such
contribution relates as well as any other relevant equitable

-19-
<PAGE> 245
considerations. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, each party's relative knowledge and access to information
concerning the matter with respect to which the claim was asserted, and the
opportunity to correct and prevent any statement or omission. The amount paid
or payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include any
legal or other fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any
investigation or proceeding, to the extent such party could have been
indemnified for such expenses if the indemnification provided for in this
Section 8 was available to such party.

The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 8(i) were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

(j) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the
indemnification provisions set forth in this Section 8 shall not be subject in
any manner to any indemnification provisions contained in the Transaction
Agreement.

(k) Notwithstanding any provision of Section 7 hereof,
the Stockholder and its controlled affiliates shall be free to sell Subject
Stock that is subject to a registration pursuant to Section 8(a) or (b), free
of any right of first refusal on the part of the Company; provided, however,
that upon receipt by the Company of a Stockholder Demand or a Stockholder
Request, the Company shall have the right, exercisable by written notice of
exercise given to the Stockholder or its controlled affiliate within five
business days following receipt by the Company of the Stockholder Demand or
Stockholder Request, as the case may be, to purchase all, but not less than all
of the Voting Securities specified in such Stockholder Demand or Stockholder
Request, as the case may be, at a price per share equal to 98.5% of the
quotient of (a) the sum of the closing prices of the Common Stock on the NYSE
for each of the five business days immediately preceding the date of the
Stockholder Demand or Stockholder Request, as the case may be, divided by (b)
five. In the event that the Company exercises its option to purchase all, but
not less than all, of the Voting Securities subject to the Stockholder Demand
or Stockholder Request, as the case may be, the closing of the purchase of such
Voting Securities shall take place as promptly

-20-
<PAGE> 246
as practicable, but in no event shall such closing take place more than five
business days after the date the Company gives notice of such exercise.

9. Legend on Certificates.

(a) The Stockholder hereby acknowledges and agrees that,
during the Term, each of the certificates representing Voting Securities
received or acquired by the Stockholder or any controlled affiliate in
accordance with this Agreement shall be subject to stop transfer instructions
and shall include the following legend, to the extent applicable:

The shares represented by this certificate have not
been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the
securities laws of any state. The shares represented by this
certificate may not be transferred whether by sale, assignment,
pledge, encumbrance, gift, bequest, appointment or otherwise, and
Alliant Techsystems Inc. ("Alliant Techsystems") will not register
the transfer of such shares, except pursuant to and subject to that
certain Stockholder's Agreement between Alliant Techsystems and
Hercules Incorporated. A copy of such agreement is on file with the
Secretary of Alliant Techsystems.

The Company agrees (i) to have such legend removed promptly
upon the sale or other disposition of any Voting Securities pursuant to Section
7(b) (v) or Section 8 hereof and (ii) to have such legend (other than the first
sentence thereof) removed promptly following any sale or other disposition of
Voting Securities permitted by this Agreement or the expiration of the Term.

10. Rights Plan. The Company agrees that, during the Term,
so long as the Stockholder is in compliance with its obligations under Sections
5 and 6 of this Agreement, the Company shall not declare the Stockholder to be
an "Adverse Person" under the Rights Plan or take other action under the Rights
Plan, or a successor plan, which would treat the Stockholder as an "Acquiring
Person" or similar entity under the Rights Plan or a successor plan. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Rights Plan" shall mean the Rights
Agreement, dated as of September 28, 1990, between the Company and
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company, now operating under the name of Chemical
Bank, as amended.

-21-
<PAGE> 247
11. Specific Performance. Each of the parties hereto
recognizes and acknowledges that a breach by it of any covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement will cause the other party to sustain damages for
which it would not have an adequate remedy at law for money damages, and
therefore each of the parties hereto agrees that in the event of any such
breach the aggrieved party shall be entitled to the remedy of specific
performance of such covenants and agreements and injunctive and other equitable
relief in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled, at law or
in equity.

12. Amendment and Modification. Subject to applicable law and
Section 6 hereof, this Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented only
by written agreement of the Company and the Stockholder; provided, however,
that any amendment or modification of Section 3 (with respect to the number of
Capstay designees on the Board only) or Section 4 hereof shall also require the
consent of Capstay, so long as Capstay and its controlled affiliates own Voting
Securities representing more than 2.5% of the Total Voting Power.

13. Notices. All notices, requests, demands and other
communications required or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand

any such Delaware Court is an inconvenient forum. The Company, the Stockholder
and Capstay hereby waive trial by jury in any suit, claim, action or proceeding
in any court relating to or

arising under this Agreement. The Company, the Stockholder and Capstay confirm

purposes).

III. CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

A. Transfer Taxes and Recording Expenses.

1. Hercules will pay all Taxes (including sales, use, 
transfer, value added, excise, stamp and similar 
Taxes) imposed by any taxing jurisdiction, recording 
or filing fees, notarial fees and other similar 
costs of closing with respect to the transfer of the 
HAC Business. At the Closing Date, Alliant will 
provide Hercules with such duly executed Resale 
Exemption Certificates as it shall have received 
with respect to those jurisdictions where the 
transfer of inventory would otherwise be taxable and 
Hercules has requested in writing that those 
certificates be obtained.

2. As of the Closing Date, any real and personal 
property Taxes in respect of the HAC Business shall be
apportioned (on a pro rata basis based on the number
of days in the relevant taxable period) between
Alliant and Hercules. Hercules shall be responsible
for all such Taxes relating (as determined under
applicable state law) to pre-closing periods and 
Alliant shall be responsible for all such Taxes 
relating to post-closing periods. Any payments or 
reimbursements of such Taxes required to be made by 
Hercules to Alliant or by Alliant to Hercules 
pursuant to this provision (after giving effect to 
the amounts reflected in Purchased Assets and 
Assumed Liabilities) shall be paid by Hercules or 
Alliant within the later of five days of a request 
by the party who is entitled to payment or five days 
prior to the date on which Hercules or Alliant is 
required to pay or cause to be paid the related Tax 
liability.

- 2 -
<PAGE> 255
B. Tax Returns

1. Hercules shall cause the Subsidiaries to join, for 
all taxable periods of the Subsidiaries ending on or
before the Closing Date for which the Subsidiaries 
are eligible to do so, in Hercules' consolidated 
federal income Tax Return, and in any consolidated, 
combined or unitary state, local or foreign income and
franchise Tax returns which include Hercules in 
accordance with Hercules' prior practice with 
respect to the Subsidiaries. Hercules shall cause 
to be prepared and filed all such consolidated, 
combined or unitary Tax Returns. Hercules shall 
treat (and shall cause the Subsidiaries to treat), 
to the extent permitted, the Closing Date as the 
last date of the Subsidiaries' taxable period in 
which the closing occurs. Hercules shall pay all 
Taxes to which such Tax Returns relate for all 
periods covered by such Tax Returns.

2. Hercules shall be responsible for all income and 
franchise Taxes for the period ending on the Closing 
Date and Alliant shall be responsible for such Taxes 
for the period after the Closing Date. Hercules shall
cause to be timely prepared and filed all required 
state and local income and franchise Tax Returns and
foreign income Tax Returns of the Subsidiaries for 
any period which ends on or before the Closing Date 
for which Tax Returns have not been filed as of the 
Closing Date. To the extent permitted by applicable 
state or local law, Hercules shall treat (and shall 
cause the Subsidiaries to treat) the Closing Date as
the last day of the taxable period in which the 
closing occurs. All other Tax Returns shall be 
prepared and filed by Alliant in a timely manner. 
Any amount owed by Hercules to Alliant pursuant to 
this paragraph (based on the principles of Section 
C, as adjusted to reflect estimated Taxes paid by 
Hercules), shall be paid by Hercules within the 
later of five days of Alliant's request thereof or 
five days prior to the date on which Alliant is 
required to pay or cause to be paid the related Tax 
Liability, provided in the event of a dispute with 
respect to the amount to be paid by Hercules which 
has not been resolved 5 days prior to the date 
Alliant is required to pay such Tax liability, 
Hercules shall immediately pay such liability and the
dispute shall be resolved thereafter in accordance 
with this Agreement. To the extent that such disputed
amount is ultimately resolved in Hercules' favor, it
shall be refunded along with interest at Prime plus 
2%. In the event Hercules' estimated payments 
exceed its Tax liability, such excess shall be paid to
Hercules by Alliant within the later of five days of
Hercules' request thereof or five days prior to the
date on which Alliant is required to pay or cause to
be paid the related Tax Liabilities and filed by
Alliant in a timely manner.

C. Allocation of Certain Income-Based Taxes

For the purposes of this Agreement (and any state and local 
income Tax laws), if a taxable period begins before the 
Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date and the terms of
this Agreement contemplate that the responsibilities of the 
parties be divided as of the Closing Date, then (1) the 
Closing Date shall be treated as the last day of a short 
taxable period, (2) the day following the Closing Date shall be

- 3 -
<PAGE> 256

treated as the first day of a short taxable period, and (3) 
the amount of Taxes attributable to each such period shall be 
based upon, where relevant, the actual operations of the 
relevant Subsidiary or Subsidiaries, through and including 
the Closing Date as shown on its or their permanent books and 
records, including workpapers.

D. Allocation of Purchase Price

The aggregate consideration prescribed by Article III, 
including the Assumed Liabilities will be allocated among
the HAC Business and the non-competition covenant contained 
in Section 8.1 in accordance with Sections 338 and 1060 of 
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder. An 
allocation of the amounts specified in Sections 3.1 and 3.2 
shall be set forth on a schedule which shall be prepared by 
Alliant and mutually agreed to by both Hercules and Alliant 
at least 30 days prior to the Closing Date. Such schedule 
will subsequently be adjusted pursuant to the Post Closing 
Adjustments prescribed in Section 3.3. The allocations set 
forth on such adjusted schedule shall be used by each party 
and their affiliates in preparing all relevant income and 
franchise Tax returns and forms (including the Section 338 
Forms as defined below), subject to adjustment to reflect (a)
Hercules' selling expenses as a reduction of sales proceeds, 
and (b) Alliant's acquisition expenses as an addition to 
purchase price.

E. Section 338 Elections and Forms

1. With respect to the sale and acquisition of the 
shares of the Subsidiaries, (a) Alliant shall 
properly make an election under Section 338(g) of 
the Code, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, 
and any applicable analogous provision of state or 
local law (the "Section 338(g) Elections") and (b) 
Hercules and Alliant shall jointly make an election 
under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code, and the 
regulations promulgated thereunder, and any 
applicable analogous provision of state or local law
(the "Section 338(h)(10) Elections" and, 
collectively with the Section 338(g) Elections, the 
"Section 338 Elections"). Any Tax which is owed by 
Alliant or any of the Subsidiaries arising from the 
Section 338 Elections shall be paid by Hercules to 
Alliant within the later of five days of Alliant's 
request thereof or five days prior to the date on 
which Alliant or any of the Subsidiaries is required 
to pay or cause to be paid such Tax liability.

2. Alliant shall be responsible for the preparation and 
timely filing of all returns (other than income and
franchise Tax Returns the responsibility for the 
preparation and filing of which is governed by 
Section B), documents, statements and other forms 
required to be filed with any federal, state or 
local taxing authority in connection with the 
Section 338 Elections (the "Section 338 Forms"). 
Hercules shall cooperate with Alliant to enable 
Alliant to prepare and file all Section 338 Forms 
and shall execute and deliver to Alliant such 
documents or forms as are required by the Code or 
the regulations promulgated thereunder (and any 
applicable analogous provision of state or local 
law) to properly complete the Section 338 Forms,
provided that such material is completed and 
delivered by Alliant

- 4 -
<PAGE> 257
to Hercules for execution at least (30) days prior 
to the date Alliant wishes to file such material.

F. Indemnification

1. Tax Indemnification by Hercules. Except for Taxes 
described in Section F.2, Hercules shall be liable 
for, and agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the 
Alliant Indemnities against (a) any liability for 
Taxes assessed against the HAC Business for all 
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date;
(b) any liability for Taxes assessed against the HAC 
Business for all taxable periods beginning on or 
before and ending after the Closing Date to the 
extent such Taxes are attributable to taxable 
periods deemed to end on the Closing Date pursuant 
to Section C.; (c) any liability assessed against 
any Subsidiary with respect to any period ending on 
or before the last day of the taxable year of 
Hercules' consolidated group in which the Closing 
occurs by reason of any Subsidiary being severally 
liable for Income Taxes of Hercules or any of its 
Affiliates pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 
1.1502-6 or any analogous state or local provision; 
(d) any liability for Taxes arising from the Section 
338 Elections; and (e) additional Taxes resulting 
from Hercules failure to make the election referred 
to in Section K below if requested by Alliant.

2. Tax Indemnification by Alliant. Alliant shall be 
liable for, and agree to indemnify and hold harmless
the Hercules Indemnities against (a) any liability 
for Taxes assessed any Subsidiary for all taxable 
periods beginning and ending after the Closing Date; 
(b) any liability for Taxes assessed any Subsidiary 
for all taxable periods beginning on or before and 
ending after the Closing Date to the extent such 
Taxes are attributable to taxable periods deemed to 
begin after the Closing Date pursuant to Section C.; 
(c) any liability for Taxes assessed any Subsidiary 
attributable to the acts or omissions of Alliant or 
the Subsidiaries not in the ordinary course of 
business (including, without limitation, any 
transfer or disposition of stock or assets, merger, 
combination, liquidation, winding up, 
recapitalization, reorganization, restructuring, 
dividend, distribution, assumption of liability, Tax 
election, sale or option contract, or similar act) 
after the Closing on the Closing Date; (d) any Tax 
liability assessed for all taxable periods beginning 
on or before the Closing Date to the extent such 
Taxes were considered Assumed Liabilities under 
Section 3.1 of the Agreement.

G. Refunds

Any refunds of Income Tax received by Alliant or any 
Subsidiary attributable to Income Taxes paid by Hercules or
its Affiliates (including the Subsidiaries) for any period 
ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the benefit 
of Hercules. Alliant shall cause any such refund (net of any 
Tax liability resulting from such refund) to be paid to 
Hercules within five days of Alliant's or the Subsidiary's 
receipt thereof.

- 5 -
<PAGE> 258
H. Termination of Tax Sharing Arrangements

Any Tax sharing agreement that may exist between the 
Subsidiaries and Hercules (and Affiliates of Hercules) shall
terminate as to the Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date, and 
any obligation to make payments and any right to receive 
payments thereunder shall be canceled as of the Closing Date.

I. Tax Cooperation

Alliant and Hercules each agrees to furnish or cause to be 
furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to the 
Subsidiaries, their properties and assets and their
businesses generally, as is reasonably necessary for filing 
of all Tax Returns, the making of any election related to 
Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any taxing authority,
and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or 
proceeding relating to any Tax Return. Alliant and Hercules

News Release

RELEASE ON RECEIPT

HERCULES INCORPORATED AND ALLIANT TECHSYSTEMS
TO SIGN DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FORMING
NEW MAJOR AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE COMPANY

October 28, 1994...Hercules Incorporated today announced that it
expects by October 31 to reach a definitive agreement with Alliant Techsystems
for that company to acquire the aerospace operations of Hercules Incorporated.
The transaction, which will be valued at approximately $412 million, represents
a premium of $66 million to book value of the Hercules assets acquired.
Hercules will receive $300 million in cash (with the $14 million paid by
Alliant in July of this year upon signing of a Letter of Intent credited toward
that amount) and 3.86 million newly issued shares of Alliant Techsystems common
stock.
Alliant has agreed with Hercules that, substantially concurrently with
the closing of the Hercules transaction, Alliant will expend approximately $50
million to repurchase approximately 1.5 million shares of its common stock
through cash election or other method, subject to financing and market
conditions. Hercules and Capstay Partners, L.P. will not participate in the
repurchase transaction. Following the acquisition and repurchase, Hercules will
own approximately 30 percent of Alliant Techsystems' outstanding common stock.
Following the acquisition, Alliant Techsystems will be a $1.4-billion
company with leading positions in strategic and tactical propulsion, ordnance
and munition, defense electronics, and marine systems, and will employ
approximately 10,200 people.

Currently, the Alliant operations generate approximately $800 million in annual
revenue with 5 to 6 percent operating margin. The Hercules Aerospace operations
are expected to contribute approximately $600 million in annual revenue,
yielding 8 to 10 percent operating margin, under the existing Hercules overhead
structure. 
Joel Greenblatt, Alliant's chairman, stated, "Alliant will implement 
a comprehensive operating efficiency and cost-reduction plan over the next 
year, with the goal of increasing its stand-alone operating margin by at least 
1 to 2 percent, exclusive of any acquisition-related operating synergies. 
"As a result of the acquisition, we expect to derive substantial
additional benefits through reduced overhead, consolidation of operations, and
combined operating efficiencies. Further, the Hercules operations have annual
depreciation well in excess of capital expenditures and are expected to
contribute significant incremental cash flows. In total, we look for the
Hercules operations and related overhead and operational synergies to
contribute very significantly to pre-tax operating cashflows." 
At the closing of the transaction, Richard Schwartz, executive vice 
president and president of Hercules Aerospace, will become president and chief 
executive officer of the combined company. Toby G. Warson, currently president 
and chief executive officer of Alliant Techsystems, will resign from his 
current position. Kenneth J. Jenson, chief operating officer of Alliant 
Techsystems, will serve as interim chief executive officer and upon closing of 
the acquisition, president of Alliant's current businesses as well as the 
ordnance and defense electronics operations of Hercules.

Alliant will increase its Board from nine to 10 members. The two
companies have agreed that, upon closing, Hercules will hold two of the eight
nonemployee seats on the Alliant Board of Directors. Thomas L. Gossage,
Hercules chairman, president, and chief executive officer, will serve on the
Alliant Board of Directors and R. Keith Elliott, Hercules senior vice president
and chief financial officer, will become nonemployee chairman of the Alliant
Board. Schwartz and Jenson will serve as the two employee members of the board.
Four of the six current outside directors will remain on the Board and two new
outside directors will be selected.
Greenblatt said, "We have examined the transaction, as well as other
alternatives available to Alliant Techsystems, and believe the combined
acquisition and share repurchase will yield the best value to our shareholders.
We expect the transaction will be immediately additive to both earnings and
cash flow per share. Our shareholders, customers, and employees will benefit by
the combination of the respective companies' leading market positions and the
creation of a lower cost, more competitive supplier."
According to Mr. Gossage, "As we noted with the signing of the Letter
of Intent in July, the sale of Hercules Aerospace demonstrates our commitment
to enhanced shareholder value. The sale creates a new major contributor to the
aerospace and defense industries through the combined expertise of Alliant
Techsystems and Hercules Aerospace. From our perspective, Hercules Aerospace
brings to the new company several potential programs that could result in major
added future revenues

and profit. At the same time, Hercules Incorporated and its shareholders will
benefit from the equity ownership in this new company. Equally important, the
employees of Hercules Aerospace and Alliant Techsystems will be better
positioned for future career opportunities in a company that is focused on the
aerospace and defense industries."
The transaction is subject to Government review and approval as well
as approval by Alliant Techsystems shareholders. Alliant Techsystems expects
to finance the acquisition and recapitalization with a combination of
short-term and long-term debt. The transaction is expected to close during the
first quarter of calendar 1995.
Hercules Aerospace is a fully integrated manufacturer of rocket motors
for space launch, strategic and tactical weapons systems, and ordnance for the
U.S. Army. Included in the transaction are the businesses of Space and
Strategic Propulsion, Composite Structures, Tactical Propulsion, Ordnance,
Hercules Defense Electronics Systems, Inc., and Global Environmental Solutions,
Inc. These units reported combined revenues of $660 million in 1993 and
operating profit of $105 million. They employ approximately 5,700 employees in
seven states. Operations included in the sale are located at Magna, Utah;
Clearfield, Utah; Radford, Virginia; Lawrence, Kansas; Rocket Center, West
Virginia; McGregor, Texas; Kenvil, New Jersey; and Clearwater, Florida.
Hercules Incorporated is a diversified, worldwide producer of
chemicals and related products. Upon completion of the anticipated sale of
Hercules Aerospace, Hercules revenues will be approximately $2 billion, and the
company will have

approximately 45 plants located throughout the word, with 20 major facilities
in the United States. 
Alliant Techsystems, headquartered in Hopkins, Minnesota, is a leading 
supplier of defense and marine systems to the U.S. Government and its allies. 
The company had sales of $775 million and operating profit of $39 million for 
the fiscal year ended March 31, 1994, and employs approximately 4,500 people.
