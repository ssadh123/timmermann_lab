DYNAMICS CORPORATION OF AMERICA
REPORTS FIRST QUARTER RESULTS,
SETTLEMENT WITH GOVERNMENT

GREENWICH, CT -- (May 6, 1994) -- At the Annual Meeting of
Shareholders of Dynamics Corporation of America (NYSE:DYA), held
today, Andrew Lozyniak, Chairman of the Board and President,
announced that in the quarter ended March 31, 1994, DCA had net
income of $933,000, or $.24 per share, on sales of $22,716,000. 
This compares with income of $618,000, or $.16 per share, on
sales of $25,591,000 in the first quarter of 1993, before a one-
time net charge for changes in accounting by CTS Corporation,
which resulted in a net loss of $1,098,000, or $.28 per share, in
that first quarter.
First quarter income includes $720,000 of income of CTS
Corporation as compared to CTS income of $451,000 included in the
same period in 1993. This represents the Company's proportionate
share of CTS' first quarter earnings in accordance with the
equity method of accounting required for that investment.
Per share income was computed on the basis of weighted
average common and common equivalent shares outstanding which
were 3,885,886 in the latest period and 3,904,490 in 1993.
Mr. Lozyniak also announced that the Company had signed a 
contract modification with the U.S. Government settling for $6.45
million the preproduction portion of its proposal for an
equitable adjustment for constructive changes under a 1989
contract for the supply of 3KW generator sets to be manufactured
by the Company's discontinued Fermont Division. The settlement
does not involve the production portion of the Company's
equitable adjustment proposal which will be the subject of
further negotiation with the Government.
Dynamics Corporation of America is a diversified company
which manufactures electronic components, mobile vans and
transportable shelters for specialized electronic and medical
diagnostic equipment, portable electric housewares and commercial
appliances, air distribution equipment and specialized air
conditioning equipment.
