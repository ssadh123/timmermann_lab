PREMARK BOARD DECLARES STOCK SPLIT
RAISES QUARTERLY DIVIDEND

DEERFIELD, Illinois, May 4, 1994 -- Premark International,

for one stock split, to be effected in the form of a 100 percent

In a separate action, the Board raised the company's
quarterly cash dividend 43 percent to 40 cents per share from 28
cents on a pre-split basis. On a post-split basis, the new
quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share represents an annualized
rate of 80 cents per share.

The stock split will be effected and the cash dividend paid
on July 5, 1994, to shareholders of record as of June 16, 1994.

Premark recently reported a 58 percent increase in the
first-quarter net income to $37.8 million, or $1.13 per share. 
"Despite softness in certain key markets, the good momentum in
most of our businesses makes our outlook for the second quarter
one of continued solid improvement," said Warren L. Batts,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

Premark International, Inc., a $3.1 billion multinational
company, markets premium products in more than 100 countries
under leading brand names such as Tupperware, Hobart, Wilsonart,
