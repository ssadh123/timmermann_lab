hold harmless the other party (or parties) as well as the party's (or parties')

<PAGE>

directors, officers and employees, from and against such claim and at the
indemnifying party's (or parties') sole expense defend any and all actions,
suits or proceedings involving such claim that may at any time be brought
against those so indemnified and satisfy promptly any settlement or judgment
arising therefrom. If, however, it is ultimately determined in any such
action, suit or proceeding in which the indemnified party (or parties) were
afforded the opportunity to have their counsel participate in the defense, that
the employment was by or services were performed for the indemnified party (or
parties), then the latter shall be responsible under this Section 10.1 and
shall reimburse any amounts theretofore paid by the indemnifying party (or
parties) by reason hereof.

10.2 Entire Agreement; Modification. This Agreement (together with the
Exhibits hereto) sets forth the entire agreement and understanding among the

inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. This Agreement shall not be assignable by any party without
the consent of the other parties and any purported assignment without such

convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and
shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.

10.7 Specific Performance. W&G, ITD and Buyer recognize that any breach
of the terms of this Agreement may give rise to irreparable harm for which
money damages would not be an adequate remedy, and accordingly agree that, in
addition to other remedies, any nonbreaching party shall be entitled to enforce
the terms of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance without the
necessity of proving the inadequacy as a remedy of money damages.

objection which it may now or hereafter have to venue of any such action, suit
or proceeding brought in any such federal or state court and hereby irrevocably
waives any claim that any such action, suit or proceeding brought in any such
court or tribunal has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any
such action, suit or proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the
world, whether within or without the State of New York, provided that notice
thereof is provided pursuant to the provisions for notice under this Agreement.

"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered

shall nominate and recommend for reelection each such director (or, in the case
of CDME Nominees, such other person as CDME shall designate in writing to the
Company) if he agrees to be nominated and, in the case of Mr. Ziegler, if he is
then an officer of the Company, subject to the obligations of CDME to cause

the Company to fill a vacancy shall qualify as an Independent Director.

(b) During the term of this Agreement the Board of Directors of the
Company shall consist of nine members.

(c) CDME and the Company agree that (i) the Executive Committee of
the Board of Directors of the Company and the Nominating Committee shall be
comprised of one CDME Nominee, the chief executive officer of the Company (for

officer is not also a director, then a director approved by a majority of the
Independent Directors) and one Independent Director, (ii) the Audit Committee
of the Board of Directors of the Company shall be comprised solely of
Independent Directors, and (iii) the Executive Compensation Committee shall be
comprised of two Independent Directors and one CDME Nominee, each of whom

the Exchange Act (or any successor rule), or, if no such CDME Nominee so
qualifies, another Independent Director who so qualifies.

(d) W&G shall cause to be maintained in effect for not less than
five years from the Closing the policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by W&G as of the Closing (provided that W&G may substitute
therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions
which are no less advantageous) with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Closing to the extent available, provided that in no event shall W&G be
required to expend to maintain or procure insurance coverage pursuant to this
Section 5(d) any amount per annum in excess of 200% of the aggregate premiums

<PAGE>

paid in 1991 on an annualized basis for such purpose. The directors and
officers of W&G, their heirs and representatives shall be the beneficiaries of
this Section 5(d).

SECTION 6. SECTION 6 OF THE INVESTMENT AGREEMENT IS AMENDED TO ADD THE
FOLLOWING SUBSECTIONS AT THE END THEREOF:

(i) Stock options granted under the Company's 1988 Stock Incentive
Plan, as amended through the date hereof, to any CDME Nominee and any shares of
Common Stock acquired by a CDME Nominee upon exercise of such options will not
be deemed to be beneficially owned by any member of the Buyer Group for
purposes of this Agreement nor subject to any of the provisions hereof.

(j) If CDME desires to purchase additional shares of Common Stock
and such purchase is not prohibited by this Agreement, CDME shall give written
notice to the Company specifying the number of shares that CDME desires to
purchase and the price per share in cash that CDME would agree to pay therefor
(the "Offer Notice"). The Company, if approved by a majority of the
Independent Directors, may elect to sell to CDME up to the number of shares
specified in the Offer Notice at the price per share in cash specified in the
Offer Notice by written notice to CDME given within 10 Business Days after the
Offer Notice is given to the Company (the "Acceptance Notice"). If the Company
so elects, the Company shall sell and CDME shall purchase shares of Common
Stock in accordance with the Acceptance Notice as promptly as practicable,
subject only to approval of the New York Stock Exchange and the Pacific Stock
Exchange of the listing of such shares. If the Company fails to give to CDME
an Acceptance Notice within the time provided above or gives to CDME an
Acceptance Notice indicating that it will sell less than all shares specified
in the Offer Notice, then CDME shall be free (subject to the other restrictions
in this Agreement) to purchase up to the number of shares specified in the
Offer Notice less the number of shares, if any, to be sold to CDME pursuant to
such Acceptance Notice, at any time or from time to time within 180 days after
the date that the Offer Notice was given to the Company for a purchase price
per share at or below the price specified in the Offer Notice. CDME agrees
that any shares of Common Stock purchased by it hereunder shall be for
investment for its own account and not with a view toward any distribution
thereof. No member of the Buyer Group shall acquire beneficial ownership of
any Common Stock from any person other than the Company other than in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6(j).

SECTION 7. THE FIRST SENTENCE OF SECTION 8 OF THE INVESTMENT AGREEMENT IS
AMENDED TO READ IN ITS ENTIRETY AS FOLLOWS:

The obligations of the parties under this Agreement shall terminate
and be of no further force and effect from and after December 31, 1994, except
that the provisions of Section 5(d) shall continue in effect through the fifth
anniversary of the Closing Date.

SECTION 8. MISCELLANEOUS.

(a) Continued Effect. Except as expressly changed hereby, the
Investment Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

<PAGE>

(b) Governing Law. This Amendment shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the substantive law of the State of New York
without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws thereof.

(c) Counterparts. This Amendment may be executed in counterparts,
each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall constitute
one and the same agreement.

(d) Effect of Headings. The section headings herein are for
convenience only and shall not affect the construction thereof.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Amendment to
be duly executed as of the day and year first above written.
