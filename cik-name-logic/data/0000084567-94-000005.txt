FOR RELEASE: AFTER 3:00 P.M. ON MONDAY, JANUARY 17, 1994

SUMMARY: ROCHESTER TEL 1993 OPERATING INCOME HIGHEST IN HISTORY

Superior performance in long distance business
Contributes to 19 percent increase in net income

Rochester, New York -- January 17, 1994 -- Rochester 
Telephone Corporation today reported one of the most profitable 
years in its history. Net income was $82.7 million in 1993, a 
19.1 percent increase over 1992, and earnings per common share 
were $2.42, an increase of 18 percent over fiscal 1992. 
Operating income reached an all-time high of $195 million, an 
11.3 percent increase over 1992.
The company's results for 1993 were led by outstanding 
performance in its long distance line of business and the 
continued contribution of the telephone companies outside of 
Rochester, NY.
"This was a truly outstanding year for the company and its 
owners," stated Ronald L. Bittner, Chairman, President and 
CEO. "Based on our earnings momentum these past few years, it 
is clear that Rochester Tel is successfully making the 
transformation from its utility heritage to a viable competitor 
in our rapidly-changing industry." Bittner noted that the 
company's net income was marginally higher only in 1989, a 
year which included $21 million in one-time gains from the 
sale of a paging company and minority cellular interests.
Bittner stated that for the first time, revenue from the 
company's competitive businesses was greater than either the 
Rochester, NY telephone operating company or the regional 
telephone companies outside of Rochester. "Over 34 percent of 
the company's revenue was derived from its deregulated 
businesses in 1993," he said. Total revenues and sales were 
$906 million for the year, a 12.7 percent improvement over 
1992's results.
Contributing to the company's strong earnings performance 
was net income of $25.6 million, or $.75 per common share, in 
the fourth quarter of the year. The fourth quarter results 
include a one-time, after-tax gain of $2.3 million on the sale 
of a portion of the company's minority investment in a Canadian 
long distance reseller.

For the quarter, revenues and sales were $242.1 million, a 
15 percent improvement over 1992's results. Fourth quarter 
operating income was $53.3 million, a 17.2 percent increase 
over the fourth quarter of 1992. This compares favorably to 
operating income increases of 9.8, 13.4, and 4.9 percent in the 
first, second and third quarters of 1993 over the comparable 
periods in 1992.

TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES
Driven largely by the rapid expansion of the long distance 
business, sales for the Telecommunication Services group 
reached $312.6 million for the year, a 32 percent improvement 
over 1992. The Telecommunications group grew profitably, with 
operating income improving 32.8 percent over 1992.
The long distance business segment generated a 40.1 
percent improvement in revenue over 1992 due to increased 
market penetration and selected new products, including 
revenues of $31 million from a new residential calling program. 
By year-end, there were more than half-a-million long distance 
customers.
Sales from wireless services increased 40.1 percent for 
the year, reaching $29.6 million. Annual customer growth 
remained very strong at 33 percent. During the year, the 
company focused on the expansion of its wireless business with 
the addition of a majority interest in the Utica-Rome, NY 
cellular property, an agreement with NYNEX to form a New York 
State cellular supersystem that Rochester Tel began to manage 
in 1993, and higher marketing and sales expenses to grow the 
customer base.

TELEPHONE OPERATIONS
Revenues in Telephone Operations were $593.9 million, an 
increase of 4.7 percent over 1992, driven largely by increases 
in telephone access lines of 3.9 percent during the year. For 
the second half of the year, revenues from the regional 
telephone companies surpassed that of the Rochester, NY 
operating company for the first time.
Contributing to the revenue improvement were increases in 
local service revenue due to rate increases at several 
telephone companies outside of New York, and growth of 7.7 
percent in overall minutes of use. Increased penetration of 
enhanced services such as custom calling features and advanced 
number identification products like Caller ID also contributed 
to revenue growth.
1993 operating income for Telephone Operations rose 8.1 
percent over 1992. The regional telephone companies continued 
to realize expense savings related to consolidation of certain 
functions across various companies and staff realignments. 
This group improved their operating income by 22.7 percent in 
1993.

At the Rochester, NY operating company, revenues improved 
a modest 1.8 percent for the year and operating income declined 
by 7.4 percent. Operating income was negatively affected by a 
previously-reported $3.3 million write-off for a discontinued 
software project, as well as a revenue reduction of nearly $5.0 
million in anticipation of a rate stability agreement that was 
later approved by the New York State Public Service Commission 
on January 12, 1994. The agreement is intended to stabilize 
rates for the period prior to the final decision and the 
implementation of the company's Open Market Plan, which is 
under consideration by the Commission.

OTHER EARNINGS FACTORS
In addition to the fourth quarter after-tax gain of $2.3 
million on the sale of a portion of the company's minority 
interest in the Canadian long distance company, Rochester Tel's 
overall results for 1993 reflected several one-time items that 
were reported previously. These included the $3.3 million 
pre-tax software write-off at the Rochester, NY operating 
company in the third quarter, partially offset by an after-tax 
gain of nearly $1 million on the sale of S&A Telephone in 
Kansas, which took place on September 16, 1993.
During the year, taxes increased by $2.0 million as a 
result of the federal tax rate increase to 35 percent, as 
mandated by the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993. Also, 
effective January 1, 1993, the company adopted Financial 
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 106, "Employers' 
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions," 
(OPEB), electing to amortize the recognition of the transition 
obligation over a 20-year period. The incremental expense 
included in 1993 operating income was $11.9 million. However, 
part of the increase was offset by a change in accounting for 
pension for rate making purposes at the Rochester operating 
company. The impact of these two items on 1993 earnings, net 
of the income tax benefit, was an expense of $3.8 million.
On June 7, 1993, the Telecommunication Services group 
acquired Budget Call Long Distance, Inc. for cash, and on 
September 30, 1993, Mid Atlantic Telecom was acquired using 
shares of common stock. Both transactions were accounted for 
as purchase acquisitions.
Interest expense decreased $3.5 million, or 7.0 percent, 
in 1993 as a result of both lower debt levels and interest 
rates relative to 1992. During 1993, the company recalled 
$115.4 million of debt.
Rochester Tel has operations that serve 1.5 million 
customers through 49 telecommunications companies in 22 
states. The company's principal lines of business include long 
distance, network systems, wireless communications and 
telephone operations. At December 31, 1993, the company had 
931,650 customer access lines. Rochester Tel is headquartered 
in Rochester, NY and was incorporated in 1920.

<F1> On January 1, 1993, the company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 106 (FAS 
106), "Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions," using the delayed 
recognition of the transition obligation method. Net of a change in accounting for pension costs for 
rate making purposes, at the Rochester Operating Company, additional operating expenses of $1.4 million 
were recognized in the quarter and $5.9 million for the year.

<F2> As a result of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993, the quarter and annual income tax provisions 
include the impact of the federal tax rate increase to 35 percent. The impact amounts to approximately 
$2 million for the year, of which approximately $400,000 is attributable to the fourth quarter.

<F3> As part of the Rochester Company's Settlement Agreement with the New York State Public Service 
Commission, the Company agreed to write-off one-half of costs previously deferred as part of a project 
to redesign customer accounts records, order flow and customer billing systems. The costs were 
incurred from January 1990 to December 1992 and the project was abandoned after it was determined that 
the cost to complete was substantially greater than initially estimated. The remaining one-half of the 
costs previously deferred are being amortized to expense and recovered in rates.

Report of Independent Accountants
- ---------------------------------

To the Share Owners of
Rochester Telephone Corporation

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
and the related consolidated statements of income, shareowners' 
equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, 
the financial position of Rochester Telephone Corporation and 
its subsidiaries at December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, and the 
results of their operations and their cash flows for the years 
then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles. These financial statements are the responsibility 
of the company's management; our responsibility is to express an 
opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We 
conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with 
generally accepted auditing standards which require that we plan 
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about 
whether the financial statements are free of material 
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and 
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the 
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our 
audits provide a reasonable basis for the opinion expressed 
above.

As discussed in Note 11 to the financial statements, during 
the first quarter of 1993 the company adopted the provisions of 
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 106, "Employers' 
Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pensions."

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The accounting policies of Rochester Telephone Corporation 
and its affiliates (the company) are in conformity with 
generally accepted accounting principles and, where applicable, 
conform to the accounting principles as prescribed by federal 
and various state regulatory bodies.

Consolidation-The consolidated financial statements include 
the accounts of Rochester Telephone Corporation and its 
affiliates. The results of operations of Rotelcom Inc., RCI 
Network Services, Inc., RCI Long Distance, Inc., RCI Long 
Distance Canada, Ltd., RCI Long Distance New England, Inc., 
Taconic Long Distance Service Corporation, Mid Atlantic Telecom, 
Inc., Budget Call Long Distance, Inc., Rochester Telephone 
Mobile Communications (RTMC), a partnership in which the company 
is a general partner with an 85 percent interest, Rochester 
Telephone Mobile Communications, Inc., and Rochester Tel 
Cellular Holding Corporation are disclosed in the Consolidated 
Statement of Income and Business Segment Information under the 
caption "Telecommunication Services." Intercompany transactions 
have been eliminated except for intercompany profit on regulated 
company purchases (affiliate sales) from Telecommunication 
Services. In the opinion of management, prices charged by 
Telecommunication Services are comparable to prices the 
regulated companies would be required to pay other suppliers.

Material and Supplies-Material and supplies are stated at the 
lower of cost or market, based on weighted average unit cost. 
The caption "Cost of Goods Sold" relates to Rotelcom and RTMC 
and includes sales associated with the cost of goods sold 
amounting to $29.5 million, $32.2 million and $41.1 million in 
1993, 1992, and 1991, respectively.

Telephone Plant-Additions to and replacements of telephone 
plant are capitalized at original cost, including costs for 
benefits and supervision applicable to construction labor. The 
cost of depreciable property units
retired, plus removal costs, less salvage is charged to 
accumulated depreciation. Replacements, renewals and 
betterments of units of property are capitalized. Replacement 
of items not considered units of property and all repairs and 
maintenance are charged to operating expense.

Telecommunication Property-Property is recorded at cost. 
Improvements that significantly add to productive capacity or 
extend useful life are capitalized, while maintenance and 
repairs are expensed. Upon retirement or disposal of assets, 
the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from 
the accounts and the gain or loss, if any, is reflected in 
earnings for the period.

Depreciation-Depreciation is computed on the straight-line 
method using estimated service lives of the various classes of 
plant. The range of service lives for property, plant and 
equipment is as follows:

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Furniture and fixtures 4 to 20 years
Central office, switches and 
network equipment 5 to 30 years
Local and toll service lines 27 to 35 years
Station equipment 10 to 15 years
Buildings and building improvements 10 to 35 years

Goodwill-The excess of the cost of companies purchased over 
net assets acquired is being amortized on a straight-line basis 
over 25 to 40 years. Accumulated amortization is $15.6 million, 
$10.4 million and $6.7 million at the end of 1993, 1992, and 
1991, respectively.

Employees' Service Pensions and Benefits-The company has 
contributory and noncontributory plans providing for service 
pensions and certain death benefits for substantially all 
employees. The plans also provide disability pensions and 
sickness, accident and death benefits (resulting from accidents 
occurring during employment) for all employees, which are paid 
and charged to current operating expense. The company's 
provisions for service pensions and certain death benefits are 
remitted, at least annually, to the trustees. In addition to 
providing pension benefits, the company provides health care, 
life insurance, and certain other retirement benefits for 
substantially all employees.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments - Cash and cash 
equivalents are valued at their carrying amounts, which are 
reasonable estimates of fair value. The fair value of long-term 
debt is estimated using rates currently available to the company 
for debt with similar terms and maturities. The fair value of 
all other financial instruments approximates cost as stated.

Federal Income Taxes-The company files a consolidated 
federal income tax return.

Tax deferrals resulting from the elimination of gross 
profit on affiliate sales in the consolidated tax return are 
recorded by Rotelcom and are amortized to offset income taxes to 
be paid over the cost recovery periods of telephone plant.

Deferred income taxes are provided by the unregulated 
operations on items recognized for financial reporting purposes 
in different periods than are recognized for income tax 
purposes. Deferred income taxes are recorded by regulated 
operations in compliance with the normalization provisions of 
current tax law and regulatory orders. The major temporary 
differences reflected in the deferred tax liability are 
depreciation and investment tax credits. Excess deferred taxes 
applicable to Telephone Operations are amortized in compliance 
with the normalization provisions of current tax law and 
regulatory orders. This amortization is normalized over the 
same time period as the related asset generating the deferral. 

<PAGE>
<PAGE>
Deferred income taxes have not been provided by Telephone 
Operations for flow-through of temporary differences where the 
regulatory agencies permit only income taxes actually paid to be 
recognized. At December 31, 1993, the cumulative balance of tax 
reductions not previously offset by provisions for deferred 
federal income taxes amounted to $51 million. Similarly, the 
cumulative balance of tax reductions not previously offset by 
provision for deferred state income taxes amounted to $15 
million at December 31, 1993. A deferred tax liability and a 
long-term deferred asset have been recorded to reflect the 
impact applicable to these cumulative reductions and the future 
revenue to be recovered when these taxes become payable.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction- The company 
includes in its telephone plant accounts an imputed cost of debt 
and equity funds used for the construction of telephone plant 
and credits such amounts to other income. The rates used in 
determining the allowance for funds used during construction are 
based on the assumption that construction funds are provided 
from sources of capital in the same proportion as each telephone 
company's capital structure.

The rates used to calculate the allowance for funds used 
during construction for companies in Telephone Operations during 
1993 ranged from 6 percent to 11.96 percent.

Earnings Per Share-Primary earnings applicable to each 
share of common stock and common stock equivalent are based on 
the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each 
year. The average number of common shares outstanding for each 
period was: 33,726,719 in 1993, 33,318,952 in 1992 and 
32,102,724 in 1991.

Computations of earnings per share on a fully diluted basis 
are determined by increasing the average outstanding common 
shares for contingent issuances that would reduce earnings per 
share. In computing the per share effect of the assumed 
conversions, convertible debenture interest (net of income 
taxes) has been added to income applicable to common stock. The 
number of common shares used to compute earnings per share on a 
fully diluted basis for each period was: 33,986,008 in 1993, 
33,582,756 in 1992 and 32,367,770 in 1991.

Cash Flows-For purposes of the Statement of Cash Flows, the 
company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity 
of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.

Actual interest paid was $49.4 million in 1993, $48.4 
million in 1992 and $38.9 million in 1991. Actual income taxes 
paid were $46.6 million in 1993, $37.2 million in 1992 and $36.8 
million in 1991.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

Stock Split - In November 1993, the Board of Directors approved 
a 2-for-1 common stock split effected in the form of a 100 
percent stock dividend with no change in the $1.00 per share par 
value of the stock. The split will be effective upon approvals 
by the New York State Public Service Commission (NYSPSC) and the 
listing with the New York Stock Exchange of the new shares 
created by the split. The record distribution dates will be 
established after these approvals have been obtained.

2. Acquisitions
On April 15, 1993, the company acquired 70 percent ownership 
of the Utica-Rome Cellular Partnership using 702,737 shares of 
original issue common stock. The transaction was accounted for 
as a purchase acquisition. In addition, in 1993 
Telecommunication Services acquired Budget Call Long Distance, 
Inc. on June 7, 1993 for $7.5 million in cash and Mid Atlantic 
Telecom, Inc. on September 30, 1993 using 143,587 shares of 
treasury stock. Both transactions were accounted for as 
purchase acquisitions.

During 1992 the company acquired the Statesboro Telephone 
Company and accounted for the acquisition as a pooling of 
interests. Prior years' financial statements have been restated 
to reflect the accounts and operations of Statesboro. Revenues 
and net income for the period January 1, 1992 to the acquisition 
date for Statesboro were $6.1 million and $1.2 million, 
respectively. A total of 1.5 million shares of common stock 
were exchanged for all of the outstanding stock of Statesboro.

During 1991 the company acquired six companies. All 
acquisitions were accounted for as purchases. Telephone 
Operations acquired the telephone properties of Northern States 
Power Company, now named Minot Telephone Company, DePue 
Telephone Company, the Minnesota telephone properties of Centel 
Corporation, now named Vista Telephone Company of Minnesota, and 
the Iowa telephone properties of Centel Corporation, now named 
Vista Telephone Company of Iowa. Telecommunication Services 
acquired the assets of the Burlington Telephone Company of 
Burlington, Vermont and Taconic Long Distance Service 
Corporation. The purchased companies were included in the 
consolidated financial statements as of their respective dates 
of acquisition. A total of 2.9 million original issue shares, 
115,000 shares of treasury stock valued at $3.3 million, $164.6 
million in cash and certain minority ownership interests in 
cellular properties were exchanged for the 1991 acquired 
companies.

4. Extraordinary and Unusual Items
As part of the Rochester Company's Settlement Agreement with 
the NYSPSC finalized in the third quarter of 1993, the company 
agreed to write-off one-half of the costs ($3.3 million) 
previously deferred as part of a project to redesign customer 
accounts records, order flow and customer billing systems. The 
costs were incurred from January 1990 to December 1992 and the 
project was abandoned after it was determined that the cost to 
complete it was substantially greater than initially estimated. 
The remaining one-half of the costs previously deferred are 
being amortized to expense and recovered in rates. This charge 
is reflected on the consolidated statement of income in the 
caption "Software write-off".

On December 14, 1992, the Executive Committee of the Board 
of Directors approved the refinancing of the $40 million Series 
H, 9 1/2% first mortgage bonds. The company recorded a charge 
of $1.1 million (net of taxes of $.5 million) in 1992 relating 
to the write-off of the call premium, the remaining initial 
discount and associated expenses of the transaction. The bonds 
were retired in January 1993 using internally generated cash and 
the private placement of $35 million of debt at a telephone 
subsidiary.

The company's 1991 results were positively impacted by a 
gain relating to the transfer of cellular properties as part of 
the acquisition of Centel Corporation's Minnesota telephone 
operations on June 28, 1991. A portion of the gain relating to 
the sale of certain cellular properties acquired within two 
years prior to the sale is reflected as an extraordinary gain of 
$3.8 million (net of taxes of $2.4 million) with the remainder 
recorded as an ordinary gain.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

5. Stock Option Plan
In 1992 the company implemented a Directors Stock Option 
Plan and an Executive Stock Option Plan. Under the plans, which 
were approved by share owners in 1990, a maximum of 400,000 
shares of common stock over a ten-year period may be issued.

Under both plans, the exercise price is the fair market 
value of the stock on the date of the grant of the stock 
option. One third of the options become exercisable on the 
first year anniversary of the grant date. Another third become 
exercisable on the second year anniversary and the final third 
become exercisable on the third year anniversary of the grant 
date. The options expire ten years after the date of grant.

Information with respect to options under the above plans

<F1> In July 1993 the company redeemed all of its Series E, F and G First Mortgage Bonds.
<F2> In December 1992, the company entered into an agreement to repurchase its Series H $40 million, 9 1/2%, 
First Mortgage Bonds on January 15, 1993. The bonds were originally due March 1, 2005. As such, these bonds 
were reclassified from long-term to short-term at December 31, 1992. (See Note 4.)
<F3> Certain assets of Telephone Operations are pledged as security for Mortgage Bonds, Rural 
Electrification Administration debt and other debt.
<F4> In December 1992, the company called its 4 3/4% convertible debentures. As such, they have been 
reclassified from long-term to short-term at December 31, 1992. The redemption of these debentures occurred 
in January 1993. Prior to redemption, debentures were convertible at any time into common stock at $11.50 
per share subject to certain adjustments. During 1993, 1992 and 1991, $79,000, $8,000 and $20,000 face value 
of debentures were converted into 6,857, 691 and 1,738 shares of common stock, respectively.
<F5> The debenture is convertible into common stock at any time after October 26, 1998 for $21.075 per 
share. A total of 251,483 shares of common stock are reserved for such conversion.
<F6> In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 107, "Disclosures about Fair 
Value of Financial Instruments," the company estimates that the fair value of the debt, based on rates 
currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities, is $559.7 million.

Gross profit on affiliate sales to telephone companies is deferred by 
Telecommunication Services and is amortized to offset income taxes to be paid 
over the cost recovery periods of the telephone plant. The amortization of 
gross profit deferred in prior years exceeded current year deferrals by 
$558,000 in 1993, $927,000 in 1992 and $1,355,000 in 1991 resulting in deferred 
tax reversals of $195,000, $315,000 and $461,000, respectively.

- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Net periodic pension cost recognized $ (2,708) $ 3,050 $ 3,336
=============================================================================

The projected benefit obligation at December 31, 1993 was determined using 
an assumed weighted average discount rate of 7.25 percent and an assumed 
weighted average rate of increase in future compensation levels of 5.0 
percent. The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan 
assets was assumed to be 8.75 percent. The unrecognized net transition asset 
as of January 1, 1987 is being amortized over the estimated remaining service 
lives of employees, ranging from 12 to 26 years.

The company's funding policy is to make contributions for pension benefits 
based on actuarial computations which reflect the long-term nature of the 
pension plan. However, under Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement 
No. 87 (FAS 87), "Employers' Accounting for Pensions," the development of the 
projected benefit obligation essentially is computed for financial reporting 
purposes and may differ from the actuarial determination for funding due to 
varying assumptions and methods of computation.

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

During 1993, 1992 and 1991, the company funded $.2 million, 
$4.8 million and $4.0 million, respectively, for employees' 
service pensions and certain death benefits. 

The company also sponsors a number of defined contribution 
plans. The most significant plan covers substantially all 
management employees, who make contributions via payroll 
deduction. The company matches 75 percent of that contribution 
up to 6 percent of gross compensation. Total cost recognized 
for all defined contribution plans during 1993 was $4.1 million.

On November 30, 1992, a voluntary pension incentive plan was 
offered to Rochester Tel employees who were pension-eligible and 
retired on or before December 31, 1992. A 7.5 percent 
additional pension benefit will supplement the normal pension 
benefit for up to five years or until age 65, whichever is 
earlier. Accordingly, pension costs for the fourth quarter of 
1992 include a one-time charge of $.8 million. Payments will be 
made from pension plan assets.
<PAGE>
<PAGE>
11. Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
The company provides health care, life insurance, and 
certain other retirement benefits for substantially all 
employees. Effective January 1, 1993, the company adopted 
Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 106 (FAS 106) 
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than 
Pensions." FAS 106 requires that employers reflect in current 
expenses an accrual for the cost of providing postretirement 
benefits to current and future retirees. Prior to 1993, the 
company recognized these costs as they were paid. The cost of 
postretirement benefits was recognized as determined under the 
projected unit credit actuarial method. Plan assets consist 
principally of life insurance policies.

In adopting FAS 106, the company elected to defer the 
recognition of the accrued obligation of $125 million over a 
period of twenty years. For 1993, the adoption of this standard 
resulted in additional operating expenses in the amount of $7.8 
million, net of a deferred income tax benefit of $4.1 million. 
However, a substantial portion of this increase was offset by a 
change in accounting for pensions for rate making purposes at 
the Rochester company. The change requires that the company 
amortize, over a ten year period, the cumulative amount of 
pension funding from January 1, 1987 over the amount of pension 
expense which would have been recognized through December 31, 
1992 under FAS 87, reducing pension expense throughout the 
amortization period. The net impact of adopting FAS 106 and 
recording the accounting change for FAS 87 actually resulted in 
only $3.8 million of additional operating expenses, net of the 
income tax benefit, in 1993.

The funded status of the plans as of December 31, 1993 
follows:
Accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation (APBO) attributable to:
Retirees $ 63,749
Fully eligible plan participants 44,399
Other active plan participants 34,892
--------
Total APBO 143,040
Plan Assets at Fair Value 3,944
--------
APBO in Excess of Plan Assets 139,096
Unrecognized Transition Obligation (117,706)
Unrecognized Net Prior Service Cost (1,458)
Unrecognized Net Loss (3,811)
--------
Accrued Postretirement Benefit Obligation $ 16,121
========
The components of the estimated postretirement benefit cost 
for 1993 follow:
Service Cost $ 2,746
Interest on Accumulated Postretirement
Benefit Obligation 10,046
Amortization of Transition Obligation 6,241
Return on Plan Assets (290)
-------
Net Postretirement Benefit Cost $18,743
=======

<PAGE>
<PAGE>

To estimate these costs, health care costs were assumed to 
increase 12.0 percent in 1994 with the rate of increase 
declining consistently to 5.25 percent by 2006 and thereafter. 
The weighted discount rate and salary increase rate were assumed 
to be 7.25 percent and 6.0 percent, respectively. The expected 
long-term rate of return on plan assets was 7.4 percent. If the 
health care cost trend rates were increased by one percentage 
point, the accumulated postretirement benefit health care 
obligation as of December 31, 1993 would increase by $19.4 
million while the sum of the service and interest cost 
components of the net postretirement benefit health care cost 
for 1993 would increase by $2.1 million.

12. Postemployment Benefits

In 1992 the Financial Accounting Standards Board released 
Statement No. 112, "Employers' Accounting for Postemployment 
Benefits" (FAS 112), which is required to be implemented by 
January 1, 1994. FAS 112 requires that projected future costs 
of providing postemployment, but pre-retirement, benefits, such 
as disability, pre-pension leave (salary continuation) and 
severance pay, be recognized as an expense as employees render 
service rather than when the benefits are paid.

The company will adopt the provisions of FAS 112 effective 
January 1, 1994 by recognizing its obligation for postemployment 
benefits through a cumulative effect charge to net income. This 
nonrecurring, noncash charge is expected to reduce 1994's net 
income by up to $5.9 million. Adoption of FAS 112 is not 
expected to significantly impact future operating expense or the 
company's cash flow.

13. Leases and License Agreements

The company leases buildings, land, office space, fiber 
optic network, computer hardware and other equipment, and has 
license agreements for rights-of-way for the construction and 
operation of a fiber optic communications system. Total rental 
expense amounted to $15.5 million in 1993, $16.4 million in 1992 
and $15.4 million in 1991.

Minimum annual rental commitments under non-cancellable 
operating leases and license agreements in effect on December 
31, 1993 were as follows:

Revenues and sales, operating income, depreciation, 
construction expenditures and identifiable assets by business 
segment are set forth in the Business Segment Information 
included on page 2 of this report.

15. Commitments and Contingencies
It is anticipated that the company will expend $73.7 million 
for additions to property, plant, and equipment during 1994. In 
connection with this construction program, certain commitments 
for the purchase of material and equipment have been made.

15. Commitments and Contingencies Cont.

The NYSPSC issued an order on July 6, 1993 which imposed a 
royalty on Rochester Tel in the amount of two percent of the 
total capitalization of Rochester's unregulated operations. 
Based upon an initial interpretation of the Order, Rochester 
estimates that its effect is in the range of $2.0 million per 
year. The company disputes the justification for the royalty 
proposal which would be treated as an offset to the Rochester, 
New York operating company's regulated revenue requirement from 
regulated intrastate telephone operations. The company is 
vigorously contesting this case but cannot predict the outcome 
with any certainty at this time.

In February 1993, the company filed a petition for 
reorganization with the NYSPSC. The request is twofold, first 
establishing two new subsidiary companies to be constituted from 
the operating assets of the existing Rochester operating 
telephone company. One company would be a competitive 
telecommunications company which would provide an array of 
services on a retail basis in the Rochester marketplace. This 
company would have the flexibility to price and introduce 
services as necessary to compete. The second company would be a 
wholesale network company which would be regulated and would 
provide services to the new competitive subsidiary company and 
all other telecommunications providers on an equal basis. This 
configuration, unique in the telecommunications industry, is 
being proposed to better meet the current and emerging 
competition in the marketplace.

The second aspect of the petition involves the remaining 
assets of the existing Rochester company, primarily investments 
in subsidiaries, which would remain with the newly unregulated 
holding company for the consolidated organization. This 
structure would provide the financing flexibility to continue 
acquisition and diversification efforts necessary for the 
long-term growth of the business. The company will aggressively 
pursue approval of this plan of reorganization but cannot 
predict the outcome.

On March 12, 1993, the company signed a definitive agreement 
with a subsidiary of NYNEX Corporation to form a cellular 
supersystem joint venture in upstate and western New York State 
that will provide cellular telephone customers with expanded 
geographic coverage. The supersystem will include the cellular 
markets in Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Utica-Rome and New York 
Rural Service Area #1, which includes Jefferson, St. Lawrence 
and Lewis counties. The proposed structure of the transaction 
is a 50/50 joint venture partnership, with Rochester Tel 
Cellular as the manager. The transaction is expected to close 
in the first quarter of 1994, subject to various governmental 
approvals and third party consents. On December 21, 1993, the 
company and NYNEX announced their intention to include the 
Binghamton and Elmira areas in the supersystem.
