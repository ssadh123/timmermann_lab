FINANCIAL REVIEW

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Earnings applicable to common stock for the year 1993 were $47 million
($.70 per share), compared with a loss applicable to common stock for 1992 of
$41 million ($.62 per share) and 1991 earnings of $5 million ($.07 per share).

Results from continuing operations, after provision for preferred
dividends, were a loss of $27 million ($.41 per share) in 1993, a loss of
$9 million ($.14 per share) in 1992 and income of $23 million ($.36 per share)
in 1991. Results from continuing operations for 1993 were impacted by the
following items:

- An $8 million after-tax ($12 million pretax) charge for efficiency
enhancements and severance expenses accrued for staff reductions in
Natural Gas Transmission and Distribution operations;

- An $11 million charge to deferred federal income taxes resulting from
the 1% increase in the statutory federal income-tax rate on corpora-
tions;

- A $9 million after-tax ($13 million pretax) write-off of non-U.S. 
gas and oil assets; and 

- A $27 million after-tax ($41 million pretax) charge as a result of 
an adverse judgment in litigation that required additional payment 
in a limited partnership exchange offer made in 1989 beyond the 
amount that the Corporation believes represented fair value. In 
addition, there was a $4 million after-tax ($6 million pretax) 
charge for additional interest awarded.

The 1992 results from continuing operations included an $11 million after-tax
($17 million pretax) write-off of abandoned offshore facilities and a
$10 million after-tax ($15 million pretax) provision for litigation. Results
from continuing operations in 1991 included after-tax gains totaling $10 mil-
lion from the sale of properties.

Revenues for 1993 were $1.9 billion, compared with $1.7 billion in both
1992 and 1991. Operating income for 1993 was $73 million, compared with
$112 million in 1992 and $137 million in 1991. Excluding the effects on
operating income of the unusual charges mentioned above, 1993 operating income
was $140 million versus $129 million for 1992 and $137 million for 1991. 
Variations in operating income by business segment are discussed below.

The 1993 results include income from discontinued operations of
$74 million ($1.11 per share), representing after-tax gains totaling $68 mil-
lion ($1.03 per share) from the sale of the principal operating assets of
Ebasco Services Incorporated and the Corporation's 49% interest in Dorsch
Consult, and income from operations before the sale of $6 million. There was
a $16 million ($.25 per share) loss from discontinued operations in 1992,
primarily related to the sale of Humphreys and Glasgow International and
provisions for real estate formerly utilized by discontinued operations. In
1991, there was a loss of $19 million ($.29 per share). With these sales, the
Corporation has concluded its involvement in the engineering and construction
business and now reflects these results as discontinued operations.

Results for the year 1992 also included a $15 million ($.23 per share)
after-tax extraordinary loss from the extinguishment of high interest-rate debt
and the termination of an interest-rate hedge.

NATURAL GAS TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION

The six-year statistics for Transmission and Distribution operations 
(See table of Operating Data) reflect the effects of variable weather 
patterns and increasing significance of nonregulated markets.

Operating income for Transmission and Distribution operations for 1993 
was $113 million before the $12 million charge relating to the ongoing 
reengineering of this business ($101 million after the charge), compared 
with $102 million for 1992 and $111 million for 1991. Normal winter weather,
combined with aggressive marketing of services and increased capacity, 
contributed to higher sales and transportation volumes in 1993.

Volumes handled during the year were 645 billion cubic feet (Bcf), a 22%
increase from both 1992 and 1991. Gas throughput on Lone Star's pipeline
system reached 554 Bcf in 1993, its highest level since 1981. The volume of
gas sold by Lone Star Gas Company and Enserch Gas Company (EGC) in 1993 totaled
414 Bcf, 18% above the 1992 level and 14% greater than 1991. Sales by EGC
accounted for 59% of total gas sales volumes in 1993 versus 53% in 1992 and 51%
in 1991.

Residential and commercial (R&C) sales volumes were 139 Bcf in 1993, up
16% from the 1992 volumes of 121 Bcf and 8% higher than in 1991, primarily due
to colder winter weather. Heating degree days for 1993 rose 27% over the prior
year and were slightly above normal for the first year since 1989. Industrial
and electric-generation sales volumes of 138 Bcf were 6% greater than in 1992
but 15% less than 1991. Volumes sold to pipelines and others in 1993 totaled
136 Bcf, a 37% improvement from the 1992 level of 99 Bcf, which was improved
40% from the 1991 level of 71 Bcf. 

The overall gas sales margin (revenue less cost of gas purchased and 
off-system transportation expense) for 1993 improved 7% from the prior year.
The overall gross margin per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) on Lone Star's sales was
$2.09 in 1993, $2.06 in 1992 and $1.96 in 1991. Lone Star has an ongoing rate
program to monitor returns from cities and towns served by its distribution
system, as well as the transmission system that supplies them. In the
aggregate, rate increases provided $1.9 million in annual base-rate relief in
1993. The gross margin per Mcf on gas sold by EGC was $.11 in 1993, down from
$.13 in both 1992 and 1991.

The total gas transportation volume in 1993 was 371 Bcf, a 21% 
improvement from 1992 volumes of 307 Bcf, which were slightly above the 1991
level. The gas transportation rate per Mcf averaged $.14 in 1993, compared 
with $.15 in 1992 and $.16 in 1991. The margins on incremental volumes 
generally are at lower rates and thereby reduce the average margin.

Lone Star's gas purchase contracts are discussed below.

NATURAL GAS AND OIL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

Operating income for Exploration and Production operations closely 
follows fluctuations in product prices and volumes that are shown in the 
table of Operating Data.

Before the previously noted litigation charge and write-offs of non-U.S.
gas and oil properties, operating income for Exploration and Production
operations was $17 million for 1993, compared with $10 million for 1992 and
$11 million for 1991. This improvement resulted from significantly increased
natural-gas prices and higher sales volumes.

Revenues for Exploration and Production operations for 1993 of $190 mil-
lion were 11% higher than 1992 and 3% above 1991. In 1993, natural-gas
revenues increased 23% to $146 million, with the average natural-gas price per
Mcf of $2.09 up 15% from the price in 1992 of $1.82. Natural-gas sales volumes
totaled 70 Bcf, a 7% increase from the year-ago period and virtually the same
as 1991. The increase in volumes for 1993 was principally due to accelerated
natural-gas development drilling in East Texas and offshore production from
Mississippi Canyon Block 441 in the Gulf of Mexico, which went on stream in the
second quarter of 1993. Oil revenues declined $8 million to $37 million in
1993 due to a 9% production decline and a 10% decrease in the average sales
price to $17.24 per barrel. The lower volumes in 1993 were primarily the
result of declining production from several North Texas reservoirs.

Spot-market sales, which include monthly and short-term industrial 
sales, covered about 70% of 1993 gas sales, compared with 80% in 1992 and 75% 
in 1991. During 1994, the percentage of gas sold in the spot market is 
expected to be in the range of 75% to 85%.

Drilling activity during the first half of 1993 increased to levels last
experienced by the Corporation in 1987, primarily because of development work
in East Texas. ENSERCH participated in more than 100 wells (79 net) in 1993,
with the majority completed as gas producers in East Texas. Thirty-nine wells
were in progress at yearend. Recompletions and production optimization
measures played a major role in the 1993 production enhancement program. 

Results for 1994 will include a full year of production from the
Mississippi Canyon Block 441 deep-water project in the Gulf of Mexico, which
began production in early 1993. The field is producing some 70 million cubic
feet (MMcf) of natural gas and more than 500 barrels of condensate per day from
six wells. ENSERCH is the operator, with a 37.5% working interest in the
project.

The Garden Banks Block 388 oil development project, also in the Gulf,
remains on schedule and on budget, with initial production anticipated by mid-
1995. The final major contract for the conversion of a semi-submersible
drilling rig to a floating production facility was finalized in early 1994. 
Installation of the offshore facilities, consisting of the subsea template,
gathering and sales pipelines and shallow-water operations, will begin by mid-
year. Three previously drilled oil wells will be connected to the subsea
template. Initial daily production from three predrilled wells is expected to
total 15 thousand barrels (MBbls) of oil and 12 to 15 MMcf of gas by late 1995,
with peak daily production from the Garden Banks project anticipated in late
1996 at 40 MBbls of oil and 60 MMcf of gas. Gross proven reserves are
presently estimated to be equivalent to 28 million barrels (MMBbls) of oil by
DeGolyer and MacNaughton, an independent consulting firm. ENSERCH is 100%
interest owner and operator of the Garden Banks project.

A-6

ENSERCH has budgeted $116 million for exploration and production
activities in 1994, compared with expenditures of $120 million in 1993. In
1992, ENSERCH sharply curtailed its capital spending to $66 million in response
to poor prices for both natural gas and oil. If the early 1994 weakness in oil
prices persists throughout 1994, appropriate cutbacks in spending may be
undertaken. More than half of ENSERCH's 1994 capital expenditures is earmarked
for domestic onshore drilling.

The Corporation follows the full-cost method of accounting for the
acquisition, exploration and development costs of gas and oil properties. The
overall rate of amortization for U.S. properties was $.98 per million British
thermal units produced for both 1993 and 1992, compared with $.90 in 1991. 
Costs of additional offshore projects and increased development costs
associated with older East Texas fields largely account for the increase from
1991. 

During 1993, the Corporation wrote off some $13 million representing all
remaining capitalized costs associated with its non-U.S. gas and oil proper-
ties.

ENSERCH's natural-gas reserves at January 1, 1994, were 1.09 trillion
cubic feet (Tcf), compared with 1.10 Tcf the year earlier, as estimated by
DeGolyer and MacNaughton. Oil and condensate reserves, including natural gas
liquids attributable to leasehold interests, were 39 MMBbls, virtually the same
as the year-ago level.

At January 1, 1994, estimated future pretax net cash flows from 
ENSERCH's owned proved gas and oil reserves, based on average prices and 
contracts in effect in December 1993, were $2.0 billion, about the same as 
the year earlier. The net present value of such cash flows, discounted at 
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)-prescribed 10%, was $1.1 
billion, virtually the same as the prior year. These discounted cash flow 
amounts are the basis for the SEC-prescribed cost-center ceiling for the 
full-cost accounting method. The margin between the cost-center ceiling and 
the unamortized capitalized costs of U.S. gas and oil properties was 
approximately $75 million at December 31, 1993. Product prices are subject 
to seasonal and other fluctuations. A significant decline in prices from 
yearend 1993 or other factors, without mitigating circumstances, could cause 
a future write-down of capitalized costs and a noncash charge against earnings.

In November 1993, an adverse judgment in litigation required additional
payment for a limited partnership exchange offer made in 1989. The award
included $41 million for the units and $21 million of prejudgment and
post-judgment interest ($15 million was charged against an existing reserve for
litigation). The $41 million additional payment was charged against income in
the fourth quarter. The Corporation had believed that any additional
consideration for the units should be capitalized; however, after further
review at the time of the judgment, the expensing of the final court-ordered
payment was prudent and necessary because it did not bring additional value.

NATURAL GAS LIQUIDS PROCESSING

Operating income for Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) Processing operations for
1993 was $5 million, compared with $13 million for 1992 and $21 million for
1991. Higher prices for natural gas, the feedstock used in NGL production, and
continued lower NGL sales prices caused margins to decline. The average NGL

sales price per barrel in 1993 of $12.34 was down 8% from 1992 and was 11%
below 1991, while NGL sales volumes of 6.0 MMBbls were virtually the same as
1992 and 1991.

POWER AND OTHER

ENSERCH's power and other activities, comprised of Enserch Development
Corporation, Lone Star Energy Company and Enserch Environmental Corporation,
had 1993 operating income of $15 million, compared with $20 million for 1992
and $9 million for 1991. Enserch Development Corporation's 1993 operating
income was $5.9 million, compared with $9.8 million for 1992 and $2.1 million
for 1991. Current year results included a $15 million pretax gain from the
sale of a position in a power project that had been scheduled for development,
while 1992 and 1991 results included development fees from cogeneration
projects of $15 million and $5 million, respectively. Lone Star Energy
Company's 1993 operating income was $3.9 million, some 8% higher than 1992 but
slightly below 1991.

Enserch Environmental Corporation, which was retained when Ebasco's
principal operating assets were sold in December 1993, had operating income for
1993 of $5.7 million, compared with $6.8 million for 1992 and $2.9 million for
1991. Backlog was $600 million at December 31, 1993.

OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE ITEMS

Other income/(expense) for 1993 includes pretax gains totaling 
$7 million from the sale of a gas storage facility and the Corporation's 
minority investment in an insurance entity. Partially offsetting was a $5.6 
million provision for the interest awarded in the judgment described earlier,
while the 1992 amount principally reflected a $15 million provision for 
litigation. The sale of Oklahoma utility properties and non-U.S. gas and oil
properties in 1991 resulted in pretax gains of $15 million. Details of other
income/(expense) are included in Note 12.

Interest expense for 1993 was $80 million, including $8 million not
related to borrowings, compared with $97 million for 1992 and $96 million for
1991. The reduction is the result of ongoing restructuring of long-term debt
at lower rates and lower short-term interest rates. Interest capitalized in
1993 was $4.5 million, compared with $5.4 million in 1992 and $7.5 million in
1991.

Income-tax expense for 1993 includes an $11 million charge to deferred
federal income taxes resulting from the 1% increase in the statutory federal
income-tax rate on corporations. Excluding this charge, the income-tax benefit
on the loss from continuing operations equaled 46% of the pretax loss. At
December 31, 1993, the Corporation had domestic net operating-loss carryfor-
wards and suspended losses of $161 million and tax-credit carryforwards of
$37 million. The tax benefits of these carryforwards and suspended losses,
which total some $93 million, are available to reduce future income-tax
payments. Note 9 provides additional information on income taxes.

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES

Net cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations for 1993
were $192 million, compared with $211 million in 1992 and $184 million in 1991. 
Net cash flows from continuing operations, before cash flow effects of gas-
purchase contract settlements and changes in current operating assets and
liabilities, were $155 million versus $150 million in 1992 and $184 million in
1991. Cash flows associated with gas-purchase contract settlements improved
substantially over the three-year period. Recoveries, net of payments,
provided $51 million in 1993 and $26 million in 1992, while there were net
payments of $7 million in 1991. (These payments are discussed in detail under
"Gas-Purchase Contracts.") In 1993, there was a cash requirement of $14 mil-
lion for the increase in current operating assets and liabilities, compared with
decreases that provided $36 million in 1992 and $7 million in 1991.

Cash of $118 million was provided by investing activities in 1993, compared
with cash requirements of $105 million and $127 million in 1992 and 1991,
respectively. These amounts include cash provided by discontinued operations
of $320 million in 1993, $14 million in 1992 and $37 million in 1991. Cash
provided by discontinued operations in 1993 includes net proceeds of $198 mil-
lion from the sale of the principal operating assets of Ebasco and the 49%
interest in Dorsch and proceeds of $100 million from the limited recourse sale
of retained Ebasco receivables, while 1992 includes net proceeds of $41 million
from the sale of Humphreys and Glasgow International. 

There was a net cash requirement for capital spending and other investing
activities of $203 million in 1993, compared with $119 million in 1992 and
$164 million in 1991. The increase in 1993 is primarily due to a higher level
of capital spending for natural-gas and oil exploration and development
programs.

Property, plant and equipment additions by business segments for the past
three years and planned for 1994 are as follows:

The planned expenditures for 1994 are expected to be funded from internal cash
flow and external financings as required. 

In 1993, net cash flows from operating and investing activities totaled
$309 million. In addition, $11 million was provided by the sale of common
stock to employee stock plans and there was a $29 million net decrease in cash
and cash equivalents. After the payment of cash dividends of $26 million, net
cash of $324 million was available to reduce outstanding borrowings, with long-
term debt reduced $200 million and commercial paper and other short-term
borrowings decreased $121 million. In 1992, there was $51 million available
to reduce borrowings or for temporary investment. 

A-9

In June 1993, the Corporation borrowed $200 million under its interim-term
(13-month) bank lines, with the interest rate based on the London Interbank
Offering Rate plus a fixed percentage. The proceeds were used in refinancing
maturing debt consisting of $76 million net due on a Swiss Franc Note that had
an effective interest rate of 8.9% and $100 million of 11 5/8% Notes that
matured in May 1993, with the remainder used to reduce commercial paper
borrowings. The $200 million interim-term borrowing was repaid in December
1993 in connection with the sale of Ebasco assets and Dorsch.

In February 1993, the Corporation announced a reduction in the quarterly
cash dividend on common stock to $.05 per share from $.20 per share, resulting
in a change in annual cash requirements of about $40 million.

In 1992, Enserch Exploration Partners Ltd. (EP) entered into operating 
lease arrangements to provide financing for its portion of the offshore 
platforms and related facilities for the Mississippi Canyon Block 441 (37.5% 
owned) and Garden Banks Block 388 (100% owned) projects. A total of $34 mil-
lion was required for the Mississippi Canyon Block 441 project, which was com-
pleted in early 1993. The lease arrangement to fund the construction costs 
for the Garden Banks facility is estimated to total $235 million when 
completed in 1995. (See Note 6.)

Total capitalization was $1.6 billion at December 31, 1993, a decrease of
$184 million from yearend 1992. The decrease reflects a $226 million reduction
in senior long-term debt and a $42 million increase in common shareholders'
equity. Common shareholders' equity, as a percentage of total capitalization,
increased to 41.7% at December 31, 1993 from 34.8% at the end of 1992. At
December 31, 1993, $350 million of shareholders' equity was free of any
restrictions for payment of dividends or acquisition of capital stock.

The current ratio at December 31, 1993 was .72, compared with 1.0 at 
yearend 1992 and .95 at yearend 1991. The decline in 1993 was partially 
attributable to the sale of $34 million of Ebasco's working capital and the 
classification of a $62 million payment relating to the judgment described 
above as a current liability. This payment was made in January 1994.

ENSERCH uses the commercial paper market and commercial banking facilities
for short-term needs. Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings, net
of temporary cash investments, totaled $32 million at December 31, 1993,
compared with $121 million at yearend 1992 and $156 million at the end of 1991. 
Bank lines for either short- or interim-term borrowings totaled $650 million
at yearend 1993. Presently, all of these lines are unused.

In February 1994, the Corporation issued $150 million of 10-year term notes
at a coupon rate of 6.375%. The proceeds have been designated for use in March
to fully redeem the $75 million of Series D Adjustable Rate Preferred Stock at
par value and to retire all outstanding sinking fund debentures, which have a
combined principal balance of $74 million. The premium for early retirement
is $1.4 million. The preferred stock has a minimum dividend rate of 7.5%,
equivalent to 11.54% on a tax-adjusted basis. The sinking fund debentures have
a weighted average interest rate of 8.5%.

The Corporation expects to file, in March 1994, a shelf registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the sale from time
to time of up to $450 million in the aggregate of securities, which can be its
senior or subordinated debt securities, or its equity securities or the
securities of a special purpose subsidiary. Proceeds received from any sale
will be used to repay obligations of the Corporation, unless otherwise set

A-10

forth in a prospectus supplement. The type and terms of any security to be
offered will be determined at the time of each offering.

Even though inflation has abated considerably from the levels of the early
1980s, and was only about 2.5% in 1993, it continues to have some influence on
the Corporation's operations. Most notable is that allowances for depreciation
and amortization based on the historical cost of fixed assets may be insuffi-
cient to cover the replacement of some long-lived fixed assets.

GAS-PURCHASE CONTRACTS

Lone Star is a fully integrated intrastate natural-gas utility from well- 
head to end use and owns its own gathering, transmission and distribution 
facilities. Lone Star buys gas under long-term, intrastate contracts in 
order to assure reliable supply to its customers. To obtain this relia-
bility, Lone Star entered into many gas-purchase contracts that provide for 
minimum-purchase ("take-or-pay") obligations to gas sellers. In the past, 
Lone Star was unable to take delivery of all minimum gas volumes tendered by 
suppliers under these contracts. This situation principally resulted from 
general economic conditions, the restructuring of regulations in the natural-
gas industry, customers having the availability of lower-priced natural gas 
from competitive sources, certain capacity limitations, Railroad Commission 
of Texas (RRC) rules regulating takes of gas, and warmer-than-normal winter 
temperatures that reduced sales demand. During past years, numerous claims 
have been made by gas suppliers asserting Lone Star's failure to meet its 
minimum purchase obligations, and other claims such as disputing prices paid 
for gas purchased under contracts. Lone Star has substantially reduced the 
potential assertions resulting from such claims through negotiations and 
contractual and statutory provisions. Producer settlement obligations in 
Lone Star's contracts have been reduced substantially in recent years. 
Claims asserted for events during 1992 and anticipated claims for 1993 are 
negligible.

Take-or-pay contract provisions generally allow for payments to be recouped
by taking gas in future periods without payment in accordance with the terms
of the contract. When the gas is taken, the previous advance payment becomes
a part of gas cost that is charged to customers. Alternatively, Lone Star, in
many cases, has negotiated "nonrecoupable" payments that generally are much
less in amount than comparable recoupable payments but provide no rights to
recoup gas in future periods. Nonrecoupable settlement payments are included
in gas costs recovered through customer billings as described below.

Obligations to purchase gas in the future are estimated to be as follows
(in millions): 1994, $150; 1995, $120; 1996, $95; 1997, $90; 1998, $80; and
thereafter, not more than $70, with the final contracts expiring in 2003. 
Based on Lone Star's estimated gas demand of about 170 Bcf annually, which
assumes normal weather conditions, it is expected that normal gas purchases
will substantially satisfy purchase obligations for the year 1994 and
thereafter; however, any payments that may be required to be made for
obligations not met are recoupable under contract provisions or are recoverable
from customers as gas purchase costs. Therefore, a provision for loss is not
required.

Lone Star's regulated rates for residential and commercial customers 
and its contractual rates for industrial and electric-generation customers 
include gas costs recorded each month (including out-of-period costs), an 
allowance for other costs and expenses, and a return on investment. Its 
residential and commercial distribution rates are set at the cost of service 
within each city

A-11

by the local municipal governments. The RRC has appellate jurisdiction over
the city distribution rates and original jurisdiction over the rates outside
city limits. The RRC regulates the intracompany city gate rate or charge for
the transmission service outside city limits that is included as a cost for
distribution service to residential and commercial customers within city
limits. The RRC provides a gas cost recovery mechanism in the city gate rate
that is designed to match gas costs with revenues on a timely basis to prevent
margin erosion or excesses by allowing both positive and negative gas cost
changes to flow through to the customers. The Texas city gate gas cost
recovery mechanism limits the amount of out-of-period gas costs, of which
producer settlements are a part, that can be charged to customers in a
particular month. The existing recovery mechanism does, however, allow for
ultimate recovery of gas costs, including such out-of-period payments. 
Similarly, contractual provisions provide for recovery of the allocated share
of these costs from industrial and electric-generation customers. Therefore,
a provision for loss is not required.

At December 31, 1993, the approximate amount of unsettled gas-purchase
contract claims asserted by suppliers, as well as estimated claims that are
probable of assertion, was $80 million. Of this total, approximately $70
million relates to a claim filed in 1993 primarily related to asserted
obligations for purchases for early through mid-1980s. (See Note 6.) In some
cases, the claimed amount includes other asserted damages in addition to the
take-or-pay claim. The possibility exists that additional gas-purchase
contract claims might be asserted by other claimants. Lone Star expects to
resolve the foregoing claims at substantially less than the claimed amounts. 
Due to the different forms of settlement, as discussed above, the ultimate
liability to a supplier, if any, generally cannot be reasonably estimated prior
to settlement; however, a liability is recorded in the financial statements for
those claims when a settlement is probable and an amount can be reasonably
estimated. A provision for loss is not required since settlement payments are
recoupable under contracts or recoverable through billings to customers, as
previously discussed.

At December 31, 1993, there was an unrecovered balance of gas-purchase
contract settlements of $111 million, down from $173 million at December 31,
1992. The balances include take-or-pay settlements, amounts relating to
pricing and amounts related to the settlement of other contractual matters. 
Of the $111 million, $63 million represented prepayments for gas expected to
be recouped under contracts covering future gas purchases. The remaining
$48 million represented amounts expected to be recovered from customers under
the existing gas cost recovery provisions. Lone Star expects to recoup or
recover the remaining balances of gas settlement payments made to date, as well
as future payments to be made in settlement of remaining claims. The period
of recovery is dependent on the overall demand for gas by Lone Star's
customers, which is influenced by weather conditions.

A summary of transactions related to unrecovered gas settlement payments
during the two years ended December 31, 1993, is as follows:

FOURTH-QUARTER RESULTS

Earnings applicable to common stock for the fourth quarter of 1993 were
$36 million ($.53 per share), compared with a loss of $33 million ($.49 per
share) for the fourth quarter of 1992. Fourth quarter income from discontinued
operations was $70 million ($1.04 per share), compared with a loss of
$16 million ($.25 per share) for the same period a year earlier. Results for
the fourth quarter of 1992 also included a $10 million after-tax extraordinary
loss from debt extinguishment. There was a loss from continuing operations
after provision for preferred dividends for the fourth quarter of 1993 of
$34 million ($.51 per share) versus a loss of $6 million ($.08 per share) for
the year-ago period. Results for the 1993 and 1992 fourth quarters included
all of the unusual items noted for the full year, except for after-tax charges
of $10.8 million for the increase in the statutory federal income tax rate,
$3.6 million for litigation and $2.0 million for write-offs of non-U.S. gas and
oil properties that occurred earlier in 1993. Before unusual items, operating
income for the 1993 fourth quarter was $28 million, compared with $52 million
for the year-earlier quarter. In addition to the unusual items noted, fourth
quarter 1993 operating income was reduced by some $10 million of other year-end
provisions. Results for the fourth quarter of 1992 were enhanced by develop-
ment fees of $15 million from a cogeneration project. Fundamental results were
about the same in both quarters.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

SFAS No. 106, "Employer's Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions," which mandates the accounting for medical and life insurance and
other nonpension benefits provided to retired employees, was adopted by the
Corporation effective January 1, 1993. (See Note 8.)

SFAS No. 112, "Employer's Accounting for Postemployment Benefits," will
become effective for the Corporation in 1994. This standard covers the
accounting for estimated costs of benefits provided to former or inactive
employees before their retirement. The Corporation currently accrues costs of
benefits to former or inactive employees by varying methods. The new standard
is not expected to have a significant effect on results of operations or
financial condition.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of ENSERCH Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ENSERCH
Corporation and subsidiary companies as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the
related statements of consolidated income, cash flows and common shareholders'
equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1993. 
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on our audits. We have previously audited the consolidated
balance sheets of ENSERCH Corporation and subsidiary companies as of December
31, 1991, 1990, 1989 and 1988 and the related statements of consolidated
income, cash flows and common shareholders' equity for the years ended December
31, 1990, 1989, and 1988 (not presented herewith), and have expressed
unqualified opinions thereon.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of ENSERCH Corporation and
subsidiary companies at December 31, 1993 and 1992, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles. 
Also, in our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying table of
selected financial data for the years 1988 through 1993 is fairly stated in all
material respects in relation to the consolidated financial statements from
which such information has been derived.

MANAGEMENT REPORT ON RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of ENSERCH Corporation is responsible for the preparation,
presentation and integrity of the financial statements contained in this
report. These statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States and include amounts that
represent management's best estimates and judgments. Management has estab-
lished practices and procedures designed to support the reliability of the
estimates and minimize the possibility of a material misstatement. Management
also is responsible for the accuracy of the other information presented in the
annual report and for its consistency with the financial statements.

Management has established and maintains internal accounting controls that
provide reasonable assurance as to the integrity and reliability of the
financial statements, the protection of assets from unauthorized use or
disposition, and the prevention and detection of fraudulent financial
reporting. The system of internal control provides for appropriate division
of responsibility and is documented by written policies and procedures that are
communicated to employees with significant roles in the financial reporting
process and updated as necessary. Management continually monitors compliance
with the system of internal accounting controls. The Corporation maintains a
strong internal audit function that evaluates the adequacy of the system of
internal accounting controls. As part of the annual audit of the financial
statements, Deloitte & Touche also performs a study and evaluation of the
system of internal accounting controls as necessary to determine the nature,
timing, and extent of their auditing procedures. The Board of Directors
maintains an Audit Committee composed of Directors who are not employees. The
Audit Committee meets periodically with management, the independent auditors
and the internal auditors to discuss significant accounting, auditing, internal
accounting control and financial reporting matters. A procedure exists whereby
either the independent or the internal auditors through the independent
auditors may request, directly to the Audit Committee, a meeting with the
Committee.

Management has given proper consideration to the independent and internal
auditors' recommendations concerning the system of internal accounting controls
and has taken corrective action believed appropriate in the circumstances. 
Management further believes that, as of December 31, 1993, the overall system
of internal accounting controls is sufficient to accomplish the objectives
discussed herein.

A-19

Management recognizes its responsibility for establishing and maintaining
a strong ethical climate so that the Corporation's affairs are conducted
according to the highest standards as defined in the Corporation's Statement
of Policies. The Statement of Policies is publicized throughout the Corpora-
tion and addresses, among other issues, open communication within the
Corporation; the disclosure of potential conflicts of interest; compliance with
the laws, including those relating to financial disclosure; and the confidenti-
ality of proprietary information.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ENSERCH Corporation and Subsidiary Companies

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

All dollar amounts, except per share amounts, in the notes to the consoli-
dated financial statements are stated in thousands unless otherwise indicated.

Basis of Financial Statements - The consolidated financial statements
include all subsidiaries during the period of ownership and control. The
equity method of accounting is used for investments in affiliates in which
ENSERCH Corporation (ENSERCH or the Corporation) does not have voting control.

Lone Star Gas Company (Lone Star), the gas utility division of ENSERCH
Corporation and principal company in the natural gas transmission and distribu-
tion business operations, is subject to the accounting requirements prescribed
by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. Lone Star's
rates are established by the Railroad Commission of Texas and by municipal
governments.

The statements of consolidated income and cash flows previously reported 
for 1992 and 1991 have been restated to reflect the engineering and construction
segment as a discontinued operation. Current year reported results reflect the
realignment of the segments of business for financial reporting purposes. All
prior year amounts have been reclassified to reflect the new alignments.

Revenue Recognition - Lone Star records revenues on the basis of cycle 
meter readings throughout the month and accrues revenues for gas delivered 
but not billed to customers from the meter reading dates to the end of the 
month.

The environmental business of the Corporation follows the generally 
accepted accounting practice of reporting revenues and income from long-term 
contracts on the percentage of completion basis using estimates of total 
contract revenue and costs at completion. These estimates are updated 
throughout the terms of the contracts and adjustments are made as appro-
priate. All known or anticipated losses on these contracts are charged to 
earnings when identified. 

Gas and Oil Properties - The full-cost method, as prescribed by the Securi-
ties and Exchange Commission (SEC), is used whereby the costs of proved and
unproved gas and oil properties, together with successful and unsuccessful
exploration and development costs, are capitalized by cost centers on a
country-by-country basis. The carrying value for each cost center is limited
to the present value of estimated future net revenues of proved reserves, the
cost of excluded properties and the lower of cost or market value of unproved
properties being amortized. Dry-hole costs resulting from exploration
activities are classified as evaluated costs and are included in the amortiza-
tion base. Costs directly associated with the acquisition and evaluation of
unproved properties are excluded from the amortization base until the related
properties are evaluated. Such unproved properties are assessed periodically
and a provision for impairment is made to the full-cost amortization base when
appropriate. Sales of gas and oil properties are credited to capitalized costs
unless the sale would have a significant impact on the amortization rate.

Gas Purchase Contracts - The Corporation has made accruals for payments to
producers that may be required for settlement of gas purchase contract claims
asserted or that are probable of assertion. Lone Star's rates billed to
customers provide for the recovery of the actual cost of gas (including out-of-
period costs such as gas purchase contract settlement costs). The Corporation

A-25

continually evaluates its position relative to asserted and unasserted take-or-
pay claims, above-market prices or future commitments. Based on this
evaluation and its experience to date, management believes that the Corporation
has not incurred losses for which reserves should be provided at December 31,
1993.

Depreciation and Amortization - Depreciation is provided principally by the
straight-line method over the estimated service lives of the related assets. 
Amortization of evaluated gas and oil properties is computed on the unit-of-
production method by cost center using estimated proved gas and oil reserves
quantified on the basis of their equivalent energy content.

Lone Star's plants are depreciated over approximately 40 years; amortiza-
tion of gas and oil properties was approximately 6.0% in 1993 and 5.7% in both
1992 and 1991.

Earnings Per Share of Common Stock - Earnings per share applicable to com- 
mon stock are based on the weighted average number of common shares, including
common equivalent shares when dilutive, outstanding during the year. Common
equivalent shares consist of those shares issuable upon the assumed conversion
of the 10% Convertible Subordinated Debentures during the periods in which they
were outstanding (which were not dilutive in 1992 and 1991) and exercise of
stock options under the treasury stock method. The 6 3/8% Convertible
Subordinated Debentures were not common stock equivalents. Fully diluted
earnings per share are not presented since the assumed exercise of stock
options and conversion of debentures would not be dilutive.

Gas Stored Underground - Gas stored underground is valued at average cost. 
The volume of gas that is available for sale within 24 months is classified as
a current asset. The remainder is included in property, plant and equipment.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The Corporation has estimated the
fair values of its financial instruments using available market information and
other valuation methodologies in accordance with SFAS No. 107, "Disclosures
About Fair Value of Financial Instruments". Accordingly, the estimates
presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Corporation
could realize in a current market exchange. Determinations of fair value are
based on subjective data and significant judgment relating to timing of
payments and collections and the amounts to be realized. Different market
assumptions and/or estimation methodologies might have a material effect on the
estimated fair value amounts. 

The estimated fair value amounts for specific groups of financial
instruments are presented within the footnotes applicable to such items. When
available, values were based on market quotes from a securities exchange or a
broker-dealer. When such quotes were not available, fair value estimates were
made using a discounted cash flow approach based on the interest rates
currently available for debt with similar terms and maturities. 

The fair value of financial instruments for which estimated fair value
amounts have not been specifically presented is estimated to approximate the
related book value.

2. LINES OF CREDIT AND BORROWINGS

The Corporation maintains domestic and foreign lines of credit that provide
for short- and interim-term (13-month) borrowings and also support commercial
paper borrowings in the U.S. and Europe. Foreign lines provide for borrowings
in either U.S. dollars or in local foreign currencies, with maturities of not
more than 13 months. At December 31, 1993, the aggregate lines of credit were:

<TABLE>

<S> <C>
Domestic bank loan lines............... $400,000
Foreign bank loan lines................ 250,000
--------
Total.............................. $650,000
========
</TABLE>

The domestic lines are subject to renegotiation annually by May 1 and the
foreign lines by November 1. All lines are on a fee basis and do not require
compensating balances or restrictions on the use of cash. All lines provide
for borrowing at the prime rate or at rates related to the London Interbank
Offering Rate (LIBOR), the banks' certificate of deposit rate, or a money
market based rate.

As of December 31, 1993, $15 million was used to support a letter of credit
issued in connection with the appeal of a lawsuit. This letter of credit was
canceled in January 1994, following satisfaction of amounts awarded under the
lawsuit.

The Corporation has an interest-rate swap agreement, expiring in 1995,
whereby the Corporation pays interest at the rate of 12.26% per annum on a
notional amount of $100 million and receives interest at a floating rate based
on LIBOR. Through November 1992, the notional amount of the swap was matched
to variable interest-rate debt, including commercial paper, and was accounted
for as an interest-rate hedge. In December 1992, the Corporation repaid all
variable rate debt, and the swap arrangement could no longer be accounted for
as an interest-rate hedge. A charge of $10.4 million (net of income-tax
benefit of $5.4 million) was recorded for the estimated cost to terminate the
hedge. (See Notes 3 and 4 for other debt extinguishments.)

</TABLE>

In February 1994, the Corporation issued $150 million of 6 3/8% Notes due
2004 in a public offering. Part of the net proceeds of this issue will be used
in March 1994 for early redemption, including call premiums of $1.4 million,
of all the $73.7 million principal amount of the sinking fund debentures
outstanding at December 31, 1993. The remainder of the net proceeds will be
used to redeem in March 1994, all of the $75 million Adjustable Rate Preferred
Stock, Series D. (See Note 5).

In June 1993, the Corporation borrowed $200 million under its interim-term
(13-month) bank lines, with the interest rate based on LIBOR plus a fixed
percentage. The proceeds were used in refinancing maturing debt consisting of
$76 million net due on a Swiss Franc Note that had an effective interest rate
of 8.9% and $100 million of 11 5/8% Notes that matured in May 1993, with the
remainder used to reduce commercial paper borrowings. The $200 million
interim-term borrowing was repaid in December 1993 in connection with the sale
of Ebasco assets and Dorsch.

In March 1992, the Corporation issued $100 million of 8% Notes due 1997 and
$100 million of 8 7/8% Notes due 2001 and in August 1992, issued $150 million
of 7% Notes due 1999, all in public offerings. The net proceeds were used for
early redemption of higher interest-rate debt and convertible subordinated
debentures (see Note 4). The Corporation recognized an extraordinary loss of

A-28

$2.4 million (net of income taxes of $1.2 million) representing the call
premiums, unamortized costs and other expenses associated with the early
extinguishment.

The Corporation has a borrowing of $100 million from a foreign bank under
a variable interest-rate note agreement due November 11, 1994, which provides
for interest at a rate based on LIBOR plus a fixed percentage. The Corporation
entered into a separate $100 million interest-rate swap that fixes interest
payments at an average rate of 9.11% per annum.

The 9.06% Note provides for varying increasing levels of semi-annual
principal payments, including an aggregate of $10.6 million for 1994, with the
last payment due December 28, 1999.

Excluding the sinking fund debentures that have been called for redemption
in March 1994, maturities of senior long-term debt for the following five years
are: 1994, $139.9 million; 1995, $10.6 million; 1996, $13.4 million; 1997,
$117.4 million; and 1998, $17.4 million. The 1994 amount includes $100 million
for the 9.11% Note and $29.3 million for the 8.7% Note which will be refinanced
on a long-term basis. The Corporation is not required to maintain compensating
balances for any of its senior long-term debt.

The estimated fair value of the Corporation's senior long-term debt,
including related interest-rate swaps, was $669 million at December 31, 1993,
and $888 million at December 31, 1992. Such amounts do not include prepayment
penalties which would be incurred upon the early extinguishment of certain debt
issues.

4. CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES

As of December 31, 1993 and 1992, $90,750 of 6 3/8% Convertible 
Subordinated Debentures Due 2002 were outstanding and convertible into 
shares of the Corporation's common stock at $26.88 per share (equal to 37.20 
shares per $1 thousand principal amount). The Corporation, at its option, 
may redeem the 6 3/8% Debentures at 103.82% of the principal amount, plus 
accrued interest, through March 31, 1994, and at declining premiums there-
after. The estimated fair value of the Corporation's convertible 
subordinated debentures was $92 million and $83 million at December 31, 1993 
and 1992, respectively.

An extraordinary loss of $2.5 million (net of income-tax benefit of $1.3
million) was recorded for the call premiums and other expenses associated with
the early extinguishment of the 10% Debentures in 1992.

5. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

As of December 31, 1993, 8,368,968 shares of unissued common stock were
reserved for issuance for stock plans and conversion of convertible subordinat-
ed debentures. The Corporation is authorized to issue up to 2,000,000 shares
of preferred stock and 2,000,000 shares of voting preference stock.

</TABLE>

The Corporation has called for redemption at par in March 1994, all
outstanding shares of the Series D preferred stock at $50 per share, plus
accrued dividends. The Series E stock is deposited with a bank under a
depositary agreement and is represented by 1,000,000 Depositary Shares. The
Series E preferred stock is redeemable at the option of the Corporation at
$103.00 per depositary share through April 30, 1994, thereafter at $100 per
depositary share. Holders of the preferred stock are entitled to its stated
value upon involuntary liquidation.

Dividend rates are determined quarterly, in advance, based on the
"Applicable Rate" (such rate being the highest of the three-month U.S. Treasury
bill rate, the U.S. Treasury ten-year constant maturity rate and the U.S.
Treasury twenty-year constant maturity rate, as defined), as set forth below:

</TABLE>

Shareholder Rights Plan - The outstanding shares of common stock include
one voting preference stock contingent purchase right. The rights are 
exercisable only if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 20% or
more, or commences a tender or exchange offer upon consummation of which such
person or group would beneficially own 30% or more of the Corporation's com-
mon stock. Under those conditions, each right could be exercised to purchase
one two-hundredth share of a new series of voting preference stock at an 
exercise price of $60. 

If any person becomes the beneficial owner of 30% or more of the Corpora-
tion's common stock, or if a 20%-or-more shareholder engages in certain self-
dealing transactions, or if in a merger transaction with the Corporation in
which the Corporation is the surviving corporation and its common stock is not
changed or converted, then each right not owned by such person or related
parties will entitle its holder to purchase, at the right's then-current
exercise price, shares of the Corporation's common stock (or, in certain
circumstances as determined by the Board of Directors, other consideration)
having a value of twice the right's exercise price. In addition, if the

A-30

Corporation is involved in a merger or other business combination transaction
with another person in which its common stock is changed or converted, or sells
50% or more of its assets or earning power to another person, each right will
entitle its holder to purchase, at the right's then-current exercise price,
common stock of such other person having a value of twice the right's exercise
price.

The rights, which have no voting privileges, expire on May 5, 1996. The
Corporation will generally be entitled to redeem the rights at $.05 per right
at any time until the 15th day following public announcement that a 20%
position has been acquired.

Management Incentive Program - As of December 31, 1993, the Corporation's
Management Incentive Program consisted of two separate plans, the Unit Plan and
the Non-Qualified Performance - Stock Option Plan. Key employees participating
in the Unit Plan and Stock Option Plan totaled 62 and 8, respectively.

Under the Unit Plan, a maximum of 900,000 units outstanding at one time
could be awarded from time to time to key employees by the Board of Directors. 
Benefits are payable in cash. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, 316,500 and
347,750 units, respectively, were outstanding. The Unit Plan was terminated
by the Board of Directors in February 1994.

Under the Non-Qualified Performance - Stock Option Plan, options were
granted to key employees to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise
option price equal to par value ($4.45). Outstanding options at December 31,
1993, covered 13,277 shares.

1981 Stock Option Plan - Incentive Stock Options and Non-Qualified Stock
Options were granted to key employees to purchase shares of the Corporation's
common stock at an option price of not less than the fair market value of the
common stock on the date of grant. This plan terminated on September 17, 1991,
and no additional grants of stock options will be made. Options exercised in
1993 were at prices ranging from $16.375 to $21.00 per share. No options were
exercised in 1992 and options exercised in 1991 were at a price of $17.00 per
share. Option prices of grants outstanding at December 31, 1993, ranged from
$16.375 to $25.625 per share. As of December 31, 1993, options to purchase
1,307,568 shares were outstanding under such plan. The number of key employees
participating in the plan was 108 as of December 31, 1993.

1991 Stock Option Plan - Non-Qualified Stock Options may be granted to key
employees for the purchase of not more than 2,000,000 shares of the Corpora-
tion's common stock at an option price of not less than the fair market value
of the common stock on the date of grant. In February 1994, the Board of
Directors amended the 1991 Stock Option Plan, subject to shareholder approval,
to include provisions for Restricted Stock. A total of 88,500 shares of
performance-based Restricted Stock have been authorized for issuance to certain
executive officers, subject to shareholder approval of the plan amendments. 
Performance criteria for lifting the restrictions is related to three-year
total shareholder return compared to the weighted average of a peer group of
companies. Options exercised in 1993 were at prices ranging from $12.50 to
$19.00 per share. No options were exercised in 1992 or 1991. Option prices
of grants outstanding at December 31, 1993, ranged from $12.50 to $19.00 per
share. As of December 31, 1993, options to purchase 1,068,125 shares had been

A-31

granted and were outstanding under such plan. The number of key employees
participating in the plan was 122 as of December 31, 1993.

Dividends - Restrictions on the payment of dividends on common stock (other
than stock dividends) or acquisitions of the Corporation's capital stock are
contained in the Corporation's several trust indentures and other agreements
relating to senior long-term debt and in the Restated Articles of Incorporation
of the Corporation. At December 31, 1993, the amount of dividends on common
stock that could be paid under the most restrictive of these agreements
exceeded the combined total of the retained earnings and paid in capital of the
Corporation which was $350,099 and represented the effective limitation on
common stock dividends. Following the redemption of all of the outstanding
sinking fund debentures and the Adjustable Rate Preferred Stock, Series D, all
of which have been called for redemption in March 1994, $342,139 of the
Corporation's common shareholders' equity as of December 31, 1993, would have
been free of such restrictions.

6. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES

Legal Proceedings - On June 25, 1993, a lawsuit was filed against the
utility division of the Corporation in the 4th Judicial District Court of Rusk
County, Texas. The plaintiff claims that the utility division failed to make
certain production and minimum purchase payments under a gas- purchase
contract. The plaintiff contends that it was fraudulently induced to enter
into a gas-purchase contract which the utility division never intended to
perform; that the plaintiff was fraudulently induced and coerced into
releasing the utility division from its obligation to make minimum purchase
payments; and that the contract was breached. The plaintiff seeks actual
damages in excess of $100 million in addition to punitive damages equal to the
savings produced from a gas price reduction program implemented by the utility
in 1982 or equal to the value of gas supply in excess of its needs which were
added pursuant to a program established in 1978 to increase gas supply. 

A lawsuit was filed on February 24, 1987, in the 112th Judicial District of
Sutton County, Texas, against subsidiaries and affiliates of the Corporation
as well as its utility division. The plaintiffs have claimed that defendants
failed to make certain production and minimum purchase payments under a gas-
purchase contract. In this connection, the plaintiffs have alleged a
conspiracy to violate purchase obligations, improper accounting of amounts due,
fraud, misrepresentation, duress, failure to properly market gas and failure
to act in good faith. In this case, plaintiffs seek actual damages in excess
of $5 million and punitive damages in an amount equal to 0.5% of the consoli-
dated gross revenues of the Corporation for the years 1982-1986 (approximately
$85 million), interest, costs and attorneys' fees. 

Management of the Corporation believes that the named defendants have
meritorious defenses to the claims made in these and other actions. In the
opinion of management, the Corporation will incur no liability from these and
all other pending claims and suits that would be considered material for
financial reporting purposes.

Long-term Contracts - The Corporation's environmental business enters into
contracts which have provisions for significant financial penalties should
certain terms of performance not be achieved. Such contract provisions have
not and are not expected to have a material effect on the Corporation's
operations. 

Gas-Purchase Contracts - See "Financial Review - Gas-Purchase Contracts"
for a discussion of commitments and contingencies relating to gas-purchase
contracts.

Environmental Matters - The Corporation is subject to federal, state, and
local environmental laws and regulations. These laws and regulations, which
are constantly changing, regulate the discharge of materials into the
environment. Environmental expenditures are expensed or capitalized depending
on their future economic benefit. The level of future expenditures for
environmental matters, including costs of obtaining operating permits, enhanced
equipment monitoring and modifications under the Clean Air Act and cleanup
obligations, cannot be fully ascertained at this time. However, it is
management's opinion that such costs, when finally determined, will not have

A-33

a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the
Corporation.

Lease Commitments - In May 1992, EP entered into an operating lease
arrangement to provide financing for its portion of the offshore platform and
related facilities for the 37 1/2% owned Mississippi Canyon Block 441 project. 
A total of $34 million was required for the Mississippi Canyon project, which
was completed in early 1993. EP leased the facilities for an initial period
through May 20, 1994, with an option to renew the lease, with the consent of
the lessor, for up to 10 successive six-month periods. The lease has been
renewed through November 20, 1994 and the Corporation expects to renew the
lease for all renewal periods. EP has the option to purchase the facilities
throughout the lease periods and as of December 31, 1993, has guaranteed an
estimated residual value for the facilities of approximately $27 million should
the lease not be renewed. Expenses incurred under the lease in 1993 were $2.1
million. The estimated future minimum net rentals for the Mississippi Canyon
operating lease is $6.3 million for 1994. 

In September 1992, EP entered into an operating lease arrangement to pro- 
vide financing for the offshore platform and related facilities of its 100% 
owned Garden Banks Block 388 project. The lessor will fund the construction 
cost of the facilities quarterly, up to a maximum of $235 million. As of 
December 31, 1993, a total of $60 million had been advanced to EP under the 
lease as agent for the lessor, $31 million of which was unexpended and 
reflected as a current liability. EP will lease the facilities for an 
initial period through March 31, 1997, with the option to renew the lease, 
with the consent of the lessor, for up to three successive two-year periods. 
EP, as agent for the lessors, will acquire, construct and operate the units 
of leased property and has guaranteed completion of construction of the 
facilities. EP has the option to purchase the facilities throughout the 
lease periods and has guaranteed an estimated residual value for the facil-
ities of approximately $188 million, assuming the full lease amounts are 
advanced and expended, should the lease not be renewed. The estimated future
minimum net rentals for the Garden Banks operating lease are as follows: 
$4.8 million for 1994; $9.1 million for 1995; $9.1 million for 1996; and 
$2.3 million for 1997. Lease payments are being deferred during the con-
struction period and will be amortized when production begins.

In addition, the Corporation had a number of other noncancelable long-term
operating leases at December 31, 1993, principally for office space and
machinery and equipment. Future minimum net rentals under these noncancelable
long-term operating leases aggregate $9.7 million for 1994; $8.9 million for
1995; $6.6 million for 1996; $6.5 million for 1997; $4.7 million for 1998; and
$51.9 million thereafter. Future minimum rental income to be received for
subleased office space is $9.3 million over the next five years. Rental
expenses incurred under operating leases aggregated $14.3 million in 1993;
$19.4 million in 1992; and $20.3 million in 1991. Rental income received for
subleased office space was $3.4 million in 1993; $4.7 million in 1992; and
$4.7 million in 1991.

Sales of Receivables - The Corporation has an agreement, which has been
extended to 1996, with a commercial bank for the limited recourse sale of up
to $100 million of Lone Star's receivables. Additional receivables are
continually sold to replace those collected. The agreement the Corporation had

A-34

for the limited recourse sale of up to $75 million of Ebasco accounts
receivable was assumed by the purchaser as part of the sale of Ebasco. In
December 1993, the Corporation entered into an agreement with a bank for the
limited recourse sale of $100 million of receivables retained from the sale of
Ebasco. This program is self-liquidating as new receivables will not be sold
to replace those collected. As of December 31, 1993 and 1992, the uncollected
balances of receivables sold under all existing agreements were $200 million
and $175 million, respectively.

Contingent Support Agreement - In connection with the sale of its oil field
services segment to Pool Energy Services Co. (PESC) in 1990, ENSERCH entered
into a Contingent Support Agreement (Agreement) by which ENSERCH is providing
PESC with limited financial support. PESC is obligated to repay ENSERCH for
any amounts paid out under guarantees and contingent obligations, together with
interest accrued thereon.

Support provided under the Agreement at January 1, 1994, consists of 
(i) the guarantee supporting the financing of PESC's Saudi Arabian affiliate,
Pool Arabia, Ltd., totaling $3.1 million until July 31, 1996, and (ii) the 
$31 million guarantee outstanding in connection with a facility lease that is
reduced periodically until fully released in March 2003. The stock of Pool
International, Inc. has been pledged to ENSERCH as collateral for the
Agreement. ENSERCH's lien on this collateral will remain so long as the
guarantee of the Pool Arabia loan is outstanding.

Guarantees - In addition to guarantees mentioned above, the Corporation
and/or its subsidiaries are the guarantor on various commitments and obliga-
tions of others aggregating some $60 million at December 31, 1993. The
Corporation is exposed to loss in the event of nonperformance by other parties. 
However, the Corporation does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterpart-
ies.

Financial Instruments With Concentrations of Credit Risk - The transmission
and distribution operations have trade receivables from a few large industrial
customers in the north central area of Texas arising from the sale of natural
gas. The environmental operations have several large receivables from projects
that are subject to governmental funding approvals.

A change in economic conditions in a particular region or industry or 
change in local taxing authority may affect the ability of customers to meet 
their contractual obligations. The Corporation believes that its provision for
possible losses on uncollectible accounts receivable of continuing operations
is adequate for its credit loss exposure. At December 31, 1993 and 1992, the
allowance for possible losses deducted from accounts receivable on the balance
sheet was $4,105 and $6,590, respectively.

7. RETIREMENT PLANS

The Corporation has retirement plans covering substantially all its
employees and employees of its subsidiaries. Upon the sale of the principal
operating assets of Ebasco in 1993, the Corporation retained the obligations
related to the Ebasco pension plan, including the obligation for benefits due
Ebasco employees hired by the purchaser to date of sale and Ebasco employees

A-35

terminated as a result of the sale. The employees hired by the purchaser are
considered fully vested with full rights in the plan but frozen benefits. The
terminated employees are due the benefits for which they were eligible at the
date of their termination. Since no further benefits will accrue to these two
groups of former Ebasco employees, the Corporation recognized a plan curtail-
ment gain in 1993 of $6.9 million, which was included as a part of the gain on
the sale. The following table sets forth the funded status of all plans as of
September 30, 1993 (adjusted to reflect the effects of the sale of Ebasco) and
1992, and the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at
December 31:

</TABLE>

The accumulated benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value
of benefits based on employees' history of service and compensation up to the
measurement dates (September 30, 1993 and 1992). The projected benefit obliga-
tions include additional assumptions about future compensation levels. The
accumulated benefit obligations and the projected benefit obligations for 1993
and 1992 were determined using an assumed discount rate of 7.25% and 8.5%,
respectively, and an assumed rate of compensation increase of 4% for both 1993
and 1992. The assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets was 9.5% for
1993 and 10% for 1992. The benefit obligations fluctuate with the assumed
discount rate. When the rate declines, as it did in 1993 from the broad
reduction in interest rates, the actuarial present value of benefit obligations
increases. Some $68 million of the increase in the benefit obligations was
primarily due to the reduction in the assumed discount rate in 1993 and is
reflected in the unrecognized net actuarial gain (loss).

A-36

The Corporation and its subsidiaries make annual contributions to the plans
in such amounts as are necessary, on an actuarial basis, to satisfy minimum
funding requirements of ERISA. Accrued pension cost represents the amount of
pension cost recognized in excess of contributions paid. 

Benefits vary by plan and generally are determined by the participant's
years of credited service and average compensation during the highest five
years prior to retirement or during each participant's career. Plan assets
consist primarily of preferred and common stocks, corporate bonds and U.S.
government securities.

The components of pension cost were as follows:

8. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

SFAS No. 106, "Employer's Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions," became effective in January 1993 and mandates the accounting for
medical and life insurance and other nonpension benefits provided to retired
employees. The new standard requires accrual of these benefits over the
working life of the employee, similar in manner to the requirement for pension
benefits, rather than charging to expense on a cash basis. 

The Corporation and its subsidiaries provide varying postretirement medical
benefits to its retirees and employees based on their hiring date, years of
service and retirement date. Except for Ebasco employees, retirees and their
dependents who retired on or before December 31, 1990, and employees age 62 or
older on that date who subsequently retire, are entitled to full medical
coverage. Employees hired before July 1, 1989 who retire with a minimum of
five years of service are provided with an annual subsidy, based on years of
service, with which to purchase medical coverage. Employees hired after July
1, 1989, are not eligible for medical benefits when they retire.

Ebasco provided limited postretirement medical benefits to certain of its
employees who retired prior to January 1, 1993. Upon the sale of the principal
operating assets of Ebasco in 1993, the Corporation retained the obligations
to retirees of Ebasco under this plan. 

A-37

The Corporation does not prefund its obligations under the plan. The
following table sets forth the funded status of all plans as of September 30,
1993, and the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheet at December
31, 1993 (in millions):

<TABLE>

=======
</TABLE>

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation represents the actuarial
present value of employee medical and life insurance benefits based on
employees' history of service up to the measurement date (September 30, 1993.) 
It was determined using an assumed discount rate of 7.25% and an assumed
medical cost trend rate of 12% for 1994 declining to a rate of 6% after the
year 2002. If the medical cost trend rate was increased by 1%, the December
31, 1993 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation would have increased by
$7.0 million and the 1993 net periodic benefit cost would have increased by $.9
million.

The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of January 1, 1993,
was $70 million assuming an 8 1/2% discount rate. This transition obligation is
being amortized over allowable periods up to 20 years. In 1993, the reduction
in the discount rate to 7.25% was the primary cause of the increase in the
benefit obligation, which is reflected in the net actuarial loss.

The components of postretirement benefit cost for 1993 were as follows (in
millions):

<TABLE>
<S> <C> 
Service cost (benefits earned) $ .4 
Interest cost on projected benefits 5.6 
Amortization of unrecognized transition obligation 4.0 
------ 
Total expense $ 10.0
======
</TABLE>

Accrued postretirement benefit cost represents the amount of benefit cost
recognized in excess of benefits paid. Cash payments totaled $8.1 million in
1993, $7.5 million in 1992 and $6.9 million in 1991. 

A-38

Of the amounts noted above, about $34 million of the unrecognized transi- 
tion obligation and $4.7 million of the 1993 expense are attributable to Lone
Star's rate-regulated activities. Lone Star's related cash payments in 1993 
were $2.7 million. Cash basis is the method of recovery currently followed 
in the rate-making process. Lone Star has deferred approximately $.5 million
of the $2.0 million difference in the 1993 net periodic expense and cash pay-
ments, although the full amount is subject to future recovery through rates.

At December 31, 1993, the Corporation had domestic net operating-loss
carryforwards and suspended losses from partnerships of $161 million which
begin to expire in 2003, and tax-credit carryforwards of $37 million, which
begin to expire in 1999. The tax benefits of these carryforwards and suspended
losses, which total some $93 million as shown above, are available to reduce
future income-tax payments.

The Corporation made payments (received refunds) for income taxes as

10. LITIGATION JUDGMENT

On April 12, 1989, a complaint captioned MacLane Gas Company Limited
Partnership v. ENSERCH Corporation, et al, was filed as a class action in the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. As previously reported, the
complaint, as amended, sought damages in connection with the Corporation's
exchange offer of its common stock for the Enserch Exploration Partners, Ltd.
units held by the public. Following a trial of the case, the Trial Court found
that the prospectus did not disclose adequately the basis of the exchange
ratio, that the structure and timing of the transaction was unfair to the
unitholders and that the price paid was not a fair price. Damages of $3.42 per
unit were awarded to the plaintiff class. The Delaware Supreme Court affirmed
the Trial Court's judgment and subsequently denied the Corporation's motion for
rehearing. The award included $41 million additional consideration for the
units and $21 million of prejudgment and post-judgment interest ($15 million
was charged against an existing reserve for litigation). The $41 million
additional payment was charged against income in the fourth quarter. The
judgment was paid on January 18, 1994. See "Financial Review" for additional
information.

11. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In December 1993, the Corporation completed the sale of the principal
operating assets of Ebasco for net estimated proceeds of $191 million. The
assets sold include the ongoing operations and goodwill in Ebasco's energy,
infrastructure and quality-engineering services businesses. The Corporation
retained Ebasco's environmental services business, which had net assets of $33
million at December 31, 1993, and will be operated through Enserch Environmen-
tal Corporation. (It is now included in the Power and Other business segment.) 
In addition, the Corporation retained other net assets and liabilities of
$99 million at December 31, 1993, including billed and unbilled accounts
receivable and retainages of $119 million, environmental remediation contracts
with a net book value of $15 million, an accrued pension liability of $32
million and other miscellaneous assets and liabilities. 

Also in December 1993, in a separate transaction, the Corporation
completed the sale of it's 49% interest in Dorsch Consult for $9.3 million,
including the assumption of debt. In 1992, the Corporation sold it's interest
in the business of H&G Engineering.

A-42

Information relating to the discontinued engineering and construction
segment is summarized as follows:

Total from discontinued

========== ========== ==========
</TABLE>

The tax effect of the gain on sale differs from tax at the statutory rate
because of permanent differences in book and tax basis of the assets sold. The
determination of the gain on sale involved significant estimates including the
final purchase price, realization of the estimated value of retained assets,
and related income-tax matters. In management's opinion, adequate provision
has been made for these matters.

12. SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION

Quarterly Results (Unaudited) - The results of operations by quarters are
summarized below and have been restated for the discontinuance of the
engineering and construction business segment and the realignment of operations
for segment of business reporting that became effective in the first quarter
of 1993. Consolidated operating income and net income were not affected by the
realignment. In the opinion of the Corporation, after the restatement, all
adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair
presentation have been made.

Disposal of Significant Assets

In 1993, the Corporation sold a gas storage facility and a minority-
investment in an insurance entity and realized a pretax gain of $7.0 million.

Effective January 1, 1992, the Corporation transferred the assets and
business of Enserch Gas Transmission Company to a new partnership, Gulf Coast
Natural Gas Company, for $19 million and a 50% ownership of the new partner-
ship. No gain or loss resulted from the transfer. The Corporation uses the
equity method to account for its interest in the new partnership.

In December 1991, the Corporation completed the sale of Enserch Nether-
lands, Inc., for $32.1 million and recorded a pretax gain on the sale of $6.0
million. In June 1991, the Corporation completed the sale of its Oklahoma
utility properties, for approximately $31 million, and recorded a pretax gain
on the sale of $9.1 million.

In accordance with industry practice, unbilled costs and fees relating to
contracts having a duration of longer than one year are classified as current
assets. Costs and fees on long-term contracts that have been billed to
clients, but that have not yet been paid, are included in accounts receivable. 
Unbilled costs and fees on uncompleted contracts are generally includable in
the following month's billings, or become billable on a progress basis,
pursuant to the terms of the contract billing schedule. The balances billable
pursuant to retainage provisions in contracts will be due upon substantial
completion of the contract and acceptance by the client.

Assignment of Future Gas Purchase Credits - At December 31, 1993 and 1992,
assignments of future gas purchase credits from advances and prepayments for
gas were $38,191 and $54,114, respectively (of which $26,028 and $18,214,
respectively, were current). The credits are reduced by an amount equal to the
reduction in the related asset, advances and prepayments for gas, which are
based upon amounts of gas purchased by the Corporation under related gas
purchase contracts. The assignment of future gas purchase credits provided for
an average annual finance charge of 3.6% during December 1993.

Restructuring Charges - In December 1993, the Corporation recognized a $12
million charge for efficiency enhancements and severance expenses accrued for
staff reductions in Natural Gas Transmission and Distribution operations.

</TABLE>

Approximately 43% of the excluded costs relates to offshore activities in
the Gulf of Mexico and the remainder is domestic onshore exploration activi-
ties. The anticipated timing of the inclusion of these costs in the amortiza-
tion computation will be determined by the rate at which exploratory and
development activities continue, which are expected to be accomplished within
ten years.

Gas and Oil Reserves (Unaudited) - The following table of estimated 
proved and proved developed reserves of gas and oil has been prepared by the
Corporation utilizing estimates of yearend reserve quantities provided by
DeGolyer and MacNaughton, independent petroleum consultants. Reserve estimates
are inherently imprecise and estimates of new discoveries are more imprecise
than those of producing gas and oil properties. Accordingly, the reserve
estimates are expected to change as additional performance data becomes
available. Oil reserves (which include condensate and natural gas liquids
attributable to leasehold interests) are stated in thousands of barrels (MBbl). 
Gas reserves are stated in million cubic feet (MMcf).

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Relating to Proved 
Gas and Oil Reserve Quantities (Unaudited) - has been
prepared by the Corporation using estimated future production rates and 
associated production and development costs. Continuation of economic con-
ditions existing at the balance sheet date was assumed. Accordingly, 
estimated future net cash flows were computed by: applying contracts and 
prices in effect in December to estimated future production of proved gas and
oil reserves; estimating future expenditures to develop proved reserves; and 
estimating costs to produce the proved reserves based on average costs for 
the year. Average prices used in the computations were: 

<TABLE>

Oil- U.S. (per barrel).................................................... 11.73 16.89 18.35

</TABLE>

Because of the imprecise nature of reserve estimates and the unpredictable 
nature of the other variables used, the standardized
measure should be interpreted as indicative of the order of magnitude only 
and not as precise amounts.
