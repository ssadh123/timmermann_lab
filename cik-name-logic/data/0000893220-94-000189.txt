REPORT OF INDEPENDENT CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

The Board of Directors
Nutmeg Industries, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nutmeg
Industries, Inc. as of January 30, 1993 and January 25, 1992, and the related
consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended January 30, 1993. These financial 
statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. 
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and 
schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Nutmeg
Industries, Inc. at January 30, 1993 and January 25, 1992, and the consolidated
results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended January 30, 1993, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
JANUARY 30, 1993, JANUARY 25, 1992 AND JANUARY 26, 1991

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Nutmeg Industries, Inc. ("Industries") and its direct or indirect wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Nutmeg Mills, Inc. ("Mills"), Home Team Advantage, Inc. ("Home
Team Advantage") (formerly Saturday's Hero, Inc.), McBriar Sportswear, Inc.
("McBriar"), which was acquired in May 1990, and McBriar Cap Company, Inc.
("McBriar Cap") (formerly Brand Images Corp.), which was formed to acquire most
of the net assets of Brand Images, Inc. ("BII") in September 1991. For the
years ended January 25, 1992 and January 26, 1991, the consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of a joint venture, 51% of which was owned by
Home Team Advantage ("the Joint Venture"), which was formed in February 1990
(collectively the "Company"). All intercompany accounts and transactions have
been eliminated. The Company is engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of
apparel, the bulk of which is sold under various sports- related licenses.

ACCOUNTING PERIOD - The Company operates on a 52/53 week annual accounting
period ending on the last Saturday in January. The year ended January 30, 1993
includes 53 weeks. The years ended January 25, 1992 and January 26, 1991 each
include 52 weeks.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE - The Company provided reserves of $3,026,000 and
$2,273,000 at January 30, 1993 and January 25, 1992, respectively, for bad
debts, discounts, and sales returns and allowances.

INVENTORIES - Inventories are primarily carried at the lower of cost (using
the first-in, first-out method) or market.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT - Property, plant and equipment is carried at
cost. For financial reporting purposes, depreciation is determined using the
straight-line method and, for income tax purposes, the Company generally uses
accelerated depreciation methods. Estimated useful lives for purposes of
computing financial reporting depreciation are as follows:

Depreciation expense was $3,109,000, $1,774,000, and $1,446,000 in fiscal 1993,
1992 and 1991, respectively.

GOODWILL - Goodwill arising from business combinations is amortized using the
straight-line method over 15-40 years.

CAPITALIZED ACETATE FILM PRODUCTION COSTS - The Company capitalized
$1,287,000, $1,071,000, and $1,000,000 in fiscal 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively, of costs incurred in the design and production of acetate films
employed to produce silk screens. Costs capitalized are being expensed over
estimated three year useful lives, using the straight-line method. The related
expense was $1,176,000, $978,000, and $627,000 in fiscal 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively. Capitalized amounts included in other assets are $1,881,000 and
$1,770,000 at January 30, 1993 and January 25, 1992, respectively.

DEFERRED LOAN COSTS - Deferred loan costs incurred in connection with the
issuance of debt are amortized over the life of the related debt. Amortization
was $114,000, $245,000, and $119,000 in fiscal 1993, 1992 and 1991,
respectively.

INCOME TAXES - The Company has adopted the provisions of "Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 - Accounting for Income Taxes".

EARNINGS PER SHARE - Earnings per share are computed using the weighted
average number of shares outstanding during the year. Inclusion of common
stock equivalents (stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options
and warrants) in the computation of primary and fully diluted earnings per
share would not be significant for fiscal 1991. Common stock equivalents have
been included in the computations for fiscal 1993 and 1992.

JANUARY 30, 1993, JANUARY 25, 1992 AND JANUARY 26, 1991

CASH EQUIVALENTS - The Company considers all highly liquid investments with
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECLASSIFICATION - Certain prior years' amounts in the
consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the
fiscal 1993 presentation. All share and per share data has been restated to
reflect a 3 for 2 stock split in June 1992.

2. JOINT VENTURE AND ACQUISITIONS

In February 1990, Home Team Advantage, a newly created subsidiary, entered into
an agreement to sell licensed sportswear to mass merchants and chain stores
through the Joint Venture. The Company made an initial equity investment of
$510,000 (51% of contributed capital) and acted as the Joint Venture manager.
In May 1992, the Company and its previous Joint Venture partner agreed that,
effective January 26, 1992, the Company would no longer participate in the
profits or losses of the Joint Venture, and that the Joint Venture would
liquidate its remaining assets and be terminated. The Company's Joint Venture
partner assumed all responsibility for the Joint Venture's outstanding bank
debt (which has since been paid) and, upon fulfillment of certain conditions,
the Company's Joint Venture partner will obtain the rights to the "Saturday's
Hero" name. The Company is continuing to serve certain segments of the mass
merchant market through the "Home Team Advantage" label. The Company,
effective January 26, 1992, is no longer recording any sales or operating
results of the Joint Venture. Although the loss of the Joint Venture's sales
is significant, the Company's operating results have not been materially
adversely affected as a result of the termination of the Joint Venture.

On May 31, 1990, the Company completed the acquisition of McBriar from Bennett
Oltman, who remains with the Company under a long-term employment agreement.
The Company invested approximately $3.7 million in cash (obtained from the
Company's available credit lines) to acquire McBriar, including the repayment
of McBriar's then outstanding indebtedness. The acquisition of McBriar was
accounted for as a purchase. The pro forma impact on the Company's historical
operating results from the acquisition of McBriar is not material.

Effective September 2, 1991, the Company acquired, through McBriar Cap, most of
the net assets of BII, a privately held company with facilities in Waycross and
Screven, Georgia, that produced a variety of caps, primarily for the premium
and specialty advertising industry. BII had sales of approximately $3 million
in the fiscal year that ended in November 1990. The Company has expanded the
operations of McBriar Cap to include the manufacture

of caps for sale by Mills to the licensed sports industry. The pro forma
impact of the acquisition on prior periods is not material.

3. NOTES PAYABLE AND LONG-TERM DEBT

Notes payable and long-term debt consisted of the following (in thousands):

plus 1/8% which were repaid in June 1992.

(b) Represents, at January 30, 1993, a $40,000,000 credit line (the "Line") at
variable interest rates. In March 1993, the line was increased to
$50,000,000, which includes an option by the Company to convert
$15,000,000 to a term loan. The line was also extended by one year to
expire in April 1995 (with an additional one year extension available if
certain financial covenants are satisfied). Borrowings are unsecured as
long as liabilities do not exceed net worth. The agreement requires the
Company to maintain, among other things, net worth of $65,000,000 as of
January 30, 1993 (increased $3,000,000 annually) and a ratio of total
liabilities over net worth not to exceed 150%.

(c) Represents, at January 25, 1992, a revolving credit agreement for the
Joint Venture, which was repaid by the Company's Joint Venture partner.

The Company has complied with all long-term debt covenants for fiscal 1993.

4. STOCK OPTION PLANS

The Company has a qualified, employee incentive stock option plan under which
1,316,214 and 1,628,439 shares of common stock were reserved at January 30,
1993 and January 25, 1992, respectively.

The Company also maintains a non-qualified stock option plan for Directors
under which 682,500 and 303,750 shares of common stock were reserved at January
30, 1993 and January 25, 1992, respectively.

6. INCOME TAXES

Deferred income taxes result primarily from differences between asset
depreciation methods and useful lives and from differences in the periods in
which certain provisions for accounts receivable losses are recognized for tax
and financial reporting.

The components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes are (in thousands):

The Company has adopted Statement No. 109 of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board on accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). The adoption of SFAS 109 did
not have a material impact on net income.

7. MAJOR CUSTOMERS

Sales to one customer for fiscal 1993, 1992 and 1991 were approximately
$34,611,000, $30,151,000 and $22,453,000, respectively.

8. PUBLIC OFFERING

On November 19, 1991, the Company completed the sale of 5,175,000 shares of its
Common Stock at $8 per share. The $38,913,000 net proceeds of the offering
were used to repay indebtedness, to acquire capital assets, for the expansion
of certain facilities and for the Company's working capital requirements.

9. CONTINGENT LIABILITY

The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") completed an examination of the Company's
corporate tax returns for the years ended January 28, 1989, January 27, 1990
and January 26, 1991 and had asserted that the Company's sales representatives
were employees and not independent contractors. The Company has reached a
tentative agreement with the IRS under which the IRS will reverse its
assessment and the Company will treat its sales representatives as "statutory
employees" effective January 1, 1993. The settlement agreement is subject to
final approval and will not have a material adverse impact on the Company's
financial condition or future operating results.

10. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN

In May 1990, Mills initiated a 401(k) profit sharing plan ("the Plan"). All
employees 18 years of age with at least one year of continuous service are
eligible to participate. Mills matches a portion of the employees'
contributions. The Company funds are then utilized by the Plan to acquire the
Company's Common Stock for the benefit of the Plan's participants. The
Company's contributions to the Plan for fiscal 1993, fiscal 1992 and fiscal
1991 were $219,000, $188,000 and $40,000, respectively.

11. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On April 5, 1990, an action naming the Company and certain of its officers and
directors was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District
of Florida, Tampa Division. The action, captioned Ressler vs. Jacobson, et
al., purported to be a class action filed by the plaintiff on behalf of all
purchasers of the Company's common stock during the period May 23, 1989 through
March 7, 1990. The complaint alleged that, during that period, the Company, in
various public statements, including the Prospectus accompanying the May 23,
1989 common stock offering and various other public documents filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, failed to disclose the actual financial
condition of the Company and its actual business prospects, thus allegedly
violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5
promulgated thereunder. The complaint sought an unspecified amount of money
damages. The Company has settled the litigation on terms that did not have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition or operating
results.

12. SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On January 31, 1993 the Company completed the acquisition of Tryrare Ltd.
("Tryrare"), a British company engaged primarily in the sale of licensed
sportswear. The pro forma impact of the acquisition of Tryrare, which had
sales of approximately $9 million in its last fiscal year, is not material.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OCTOBER 30, 1993, OCTOBER 24, 1992, AND JANUARY 30, 1993

(Information pertaining to the three months and nine months ended October 30,
1993 and October 24, 1992 is unaudited)

1. Consolidation and Basis of Presentation
The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Nutmeg Industries, Inc. ("Industries") and its direct or
indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, Nutmeg Mills, Inc. ("Mills"), Home
Team Advantage, Inc. ("Home Team Advantage") (formerly Saturday's Hero,
Inc.), McBriar Sportswear, Inc. ("McBriar"), McBriar Cap Company, Inc.
("McBriar Cap") (formerly Brand Images Corp.) and Tryrare Ltd. ("Tryrare")
which was acquired on January 31, 1993 (collectively the "Company"). The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company
include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring accruals,
which the Company considers necessary for a fair presentation of the
financial position and results of operations for these periods. Results
of operations for the nine months ended October 30, 1993 are not
necessarily indicative of those expected for the entire fiscal year. All
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The Company
is engaged in the design, manufacture and sale of various apparel, the
bulk of which is sold under various sports-related licenses.

2. Subsequent Event
On December 13, 1993, the Company and VF Corporation ("VF") announced that
they had executed a definitive merger agreement whereby VF will acquire
all outstanding shares of the Company for $17.50 cash per share.

The Boards of Directors of the Company and VF have approved the offer and
merger. As the first step in the transaction, a subsidiary of VF will
commence a cash tender offer promptly for all outstanding common shares of
the Company at $17.50 per share. The tender offer is expected to close in
mid-January. The offer will be conditioned, among other things, upon a
majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company being
properly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the offer.

In connection with the transaction, VF has obtained options to acquire
approximately 18.9% of the outstanding stock of the Company from Richard
E. Jacobson and Martin G. Jacobson, Chairman and President of the Company,
respectively, and an option to acquire approximately 2.98 million shares
of the Company's Common Stock from the Company, representing 13.8% of the
amount of the Company's Common Stock that would be outstanding if the
option were exercised.

23
<PAGE> 24
(b) Unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements.

In January 1994, VF Corporation ("VF") acquired H.H. Cutler Company
("Cutler") for a total consideration of $154.7 million. Also in January 1994,
VF acquired Nutmeg Industries, Inc. ("Nutmeg") for a total consideration of
$352.2 million. The acquisitions of Cutler and Nutmeg (the "Acquired
Companies") have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
The following pro forma combined condensed balance sheet of VF and the Acquired
Companies assumes that the acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 1994. The
following pro forma combined condensed income statement of VF and the Acquired
Companies for the fiscal year ended January 1, 1994 assumes that the
acquisitions had occurred on January 3, 1993.

The pro forma combined financial statements are based on the
historical consolidated financial statements of VF and the Acquired Companies.
The historical income statements of the Acquired Companies exclude the
cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles as of January 3, 1993 to
conform their accounting policies to those of VF. These changes in accounting
principles total $11.0 million after giving effect to income taxes and relate 
primarily to differences in the treatment of certain expenses as period
expenses versus deferred costs and the application of VF inventory valuation
policies. 

The pro forma adjustments are as set forth in the accompanying notes.
The Acquired Companies' assets and liabilities have been recorded at
their estimated fair values, and the excess purchase price has been assigned to
intangible assets. Fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are
based on preliminary estimates; revisions are not expected to be material.

Such unaudited pro forma information should be read in conjunction
with the audited financial statements and related notes set forth in VF's
Annual Report on Form 10-K and with the audited and unaudited financial
statements of Nutmeg set forth herein. Such information does not purport to be
indicative of results that would actually have been obtained had such
transactions been completed as of the dates indicated or that may be obtained
in the future.
