INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
____________________________

We have audited the accompanying Historical Summary of Revenues and Certain
Operating Expenses of Western Village, Brentwood Plaza, Hamilton Plaza and
Albany Plaza (the "Properties") for the year ended December 31, 1993. This
Historical Summary is the responsibility of New Plan Realty Trust's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on this Historical
Summary based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Historical Summary is free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the Historical Summary. 
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
presentation of the Historical Summary. We believe that our audit provides
a reasonable basis for our opinion.

The Historical Summary has been prepared for the purpose of complying with
the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and
its use for any other purpose may be inappropriate. Accordingly, as
described in the Note to the Historical Summary, the statement excludes
interest, depreciation, and general and administrative expenses for the
period examined, and is not intended to be a complete presentation of the
properties' revenues and expenses.

In our opinion, the Historical Summary referred to above presents fairly,
in all material respects, the revenues and certain operating expenses
(exclusive of interest, depreciation and general and administrative
expenses) in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

CERTAIN PROPERTY ACQUIRED
HISTORICAL SUMMARY OF REVENUES AND CERTAIN OPERATING
EXPENSES FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 1993

Rental Income $4,023,004 

Repairs and maintenance $238,599
Real estate taxes 519,491
Certain operating expenses 139,296 $ 897,386 
________ __________ 

Excess of revenues over
certain operating expenses $3,125,618 
========== 

NOTE:

The Historical Summary of Revenues and Certain Operating Expenses relate to
the operations of Western Village, Brentwood Plaza, Hamilton Plaza and
Albany Plaza (the "Properties"), while under ownership previous to New Plan
Realty Trust. The Properties are shopping centers.

The summary has been prepared on the accrual method of accounting. 
Operating expenses include maintenance and repair expenses, utilities, real
estate taxes, insurance and certain other expenses. In accordance with the
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, mortgage interest
expense, depreciation, and general and administrative costs have been
excluded from operating expenses, as they are dependent upon a particular
owner, purchase price or financial arrangement.

Minimum future rentals for years ended December 31, under existing
commercial operating leases at the shopping center being reported on are
approximately as follows (in thousands):

1994 - $3,222 1997 - $ 2,288
1995 - 3,162 1998 - 1,722
1996 - 2,975 thereafter - 7,356

The above assumes that all leases which expire are not renewed, therefore
neither renewal rentals nor rentals from replacement tenants are included.

Minimum future rentals do not include contingent rentals which may be
received under certain leases on the basis of percentage of reported
tenants' sales volume, increases in Consumer Price Indices, common area
maintenance charges and real estate tax reimbursements.

INFORMATION PURSUANT TO RULE 3-14 REGULATION S-X

Part I MANAGEMENT ASSESSMENT

Management's assessment of the Property prior to acquisition
includes, but is not limited to, the quality of the tenant base, regional
demographics, the competitive environment, operating expenses and local
property taxes. In addition, the physical aspect of the property,
location, condition and quality of design and construction are evaluated. 
Management also always conducts Phase I and II environmental tests. All
factors, when viewed in their entirety, have met management's acquisition
criteria. Management is not aware of any material factors relating to the
acquisition other than those discussed above. 

Part II ESTIMATES OF TAXABLE OPERATING INCOME AND FUNDS GENERATED FROM
CERTAIN PROPERTY ACQUIRED (UNAUDITED)

a. The following presents an estimate of net income and funds generated
from the operation of the acquired Property for a twelve month
period ended December 31, 1993 based on the Historical Summary of
Revenues and Certain Operating Expenses for the Year Ended December
31, 1993. These estimated results do not purport to present
expected results of operations for the Property in the future and
were prepared on the basis described in the accompanying notes which
should be read in conjunction herewith.

NEW PLAN REALTY TRUST AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO ESTIMATES OF NET INCOME AND FUNDS GENERATED FROM
CERTAIN PROPERTIES ACQUIRED
(UNAUDITED)

Basis of Presentation

1. Estimated depreciation was based upon an allocation of the
purchase price to land (20%) and building (80%) with the
depreciation being taken over a 40 year life using the straight
line method.

2. No income taxes have been provided because New Plan Realty Trust
is taxed as a real estate investment trust under the provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, the Trust does not
pay Federal income tax whenever income distributed to
shareholders is equal to at least 95% of real estate investment
trust taxable income and certain other conditions are met.<PAGE>

NEW PLAN REALTY TRUST AND SUBSIDIARIES
PRO FORMA CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
(UNAUDITED)

The following unaudited pro forma condensed balance sheet at April 30,
1994 reflects the acquisition of four shopping centers (Western Village and
Brentwood Plaza on May 5, 1994 and Hamilton Plaza and Albany Plaza on May
12, 1994) as if the transaction had occurred on that date.

The pro forma condensed statements of income for the year ended July
31, 1993 and the nine months ended April 30, 1994 assume the acquisition of
this property as if it had occurred as of August 1, 1992 and 1993,
respectively. This pro forma information is based on the historical
statements of the Trust after giving effect to the acquisition of these
properties.

The unaudited pro forma condensed financial statements have been
prepared by New Plan Realty Trust management. The unaudited pro forma
condensed statements of income may not be indicative of the results that
would have actually occurred if the acquisitions had been in effect on the
dates indicated. Also, they may not be indicative of the results that may
be achieved in the future. The unaudited pro forma condensed financial
statements should be read in conjunction with New Plan Realty Trust's
audited financial statements as of July 31, 1993 and for the year then
ended (which are contained in the Trust's Form 10-K for the year ended
July 31, 1993) and the unaudited financial statements as of April 30, 1994
and for the nine months then ended (which are contained in the Trust's Form
10-Q for the period ended April 30, 1994) and the accompanying notes.
