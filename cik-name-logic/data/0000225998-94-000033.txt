Item 5. Other Events

On October 26, 1994, Washington Energy Company made the following
press release:

ONE-TIME CHARGES ADD TO FISCAL-YEAR LOSS

SEATTLE -- Washington Energy Company (NYSE: WEG) posted a
fiscal 1994 loss on common stock of $46.3 million, or $1.97 per
share, including previously-announced major charges for efforts
to refocus the business, Chairman, CEO and President William P.
Vititoe announced today. 

Excluding the major charges, the company recorded a loss of
$3.8 million, or 16 cents per share, for the fiscal year ended
Sept. 30.

"The one-time charges significantly increased our loss, but
they set in motion essential strategies to rebuild our long-term
profitability," Vititoe said. "The major factors in the remain-
der of our loss were poor financial performance by our utility,
primarily as a result of lower rates and warmer weather, and
reduced operating income from merchandise sales and oil and gas
exploration and production."

Earnings at the utility subsidiary, Washington Natural Gas,
were down approximately $7 million as a result of rate changes
during the year. "The $15.4 million rate decrease that went into
effect last October was in place throughout the heating season,"
Vititoe said. "We received a rate increase of $19 million in
June, but it came too late to have a significant impact on the
year."

Utility gas sales suffered because weather was 10 percent
warmer than normal during the fiscal year, lowering earnings by
approximately $5 million. 

Charges recorded to launch key strategies

Most of the company's fiscal-year loss resulted from charges
taken to implement key management strategies. 

"Our fundamental strategy is to refocus on our utility,
which remains our key asset," Vititoe said. "In fiscal '94, we
added 21,500 utility customers, a growth rate of 5%, which is
much higher than the national average. 

"To fully develop this asset, we reduced our diversified
activities, merging our exploration and production subsidiary
with Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. and divesting our Unisyn biowaste
technology operation. We also restructured our utility work
force and reduced it by 12 percent, to improve efficiency and
decrease ongoing operating costs."

In carrying out these strategies, the company recorded
charges totalling $42.5 million, or $1.81 per share. Of that,
$40.9 million was recorded in the third quarter. In the fourth
quarter, the company recorded additional charges of $1.6 million,
$600,000 of which relates to the final disposition of the Unisyn
operation (reported under "discontinued operations").

Additional factors affecting fiscal-year results

Other factors contributing to the company's 1994 financial
loss included: 
- - $8.1 million in higher depreciation, interest and general
taxes. 
- - a decline of $8 million in operating income from merchandise
sales, which resulted from the re-establishment of those
activities in a separate subsidiary. 
- - an overall decline of $6.7 million (before interest and
income taxes) from oil and gas exploration and production. 
(These activities contributed $150,000 in fiscal '94, prior
to their May 1 merger with Cabot Oil & Gas, and $850,000
following the merger -- all of which is reported as "other
income.")
- - a $1.3 million increase in preferred dividends following the
issuance of additional shares of Washington Natural Gas
preferred stock, and a one-time premium of $673,000 paid on
the early redemption of higher-dividend gas utility pre-
ferred stock.

Quarterly results

Continuing operations showed a loss of $11.9 million, or 50
cents per share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30, 1994, compared
with a loss of $7.4 million, or 32 cents per share, during the
corresponding quarter one year ago, Vititoe said. 

Lower gas sales resulted in a $3.9 million reduction in
utility margin (pre-tax), primarily because of weather that was
74 percent warmer than in the same quarter one year ago, and 68
percent warmer than normal.

In addition, quarterly results were affected by the same
factors impacting fiscal-year earnings, as discussed above.

As a provider of heating fuel, the company normally posts an
operating loss in its fourth, or summer, quarter. 

Dividend unchanged

Vititoe re-emphasized his commitment not to recommend to the
Board of Directors any change in the current annual dividend at
this time. "The strategies we are implementing should support
the dividend over the long term," Vititoe said.
