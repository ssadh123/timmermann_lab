Agreement dated as of September 25, 1990 (as amended, the "Loan
Agreement") by and among Genicom Corporation ("Genicom"), Genicom
Foreign Sales Corporation ("Genicom FSC"; Genicom and Genicom
FSC, individually and collectively, jointly and severally, the
"Borrower") and The CIT Group/Credit Finance, Inc. ("Lender"), as
assignee of Fidelcor Business Credit Corporation ("Fidelcor"),
together with various other agreements, documents, instruments,
and guaranties, then or now or at any time executed and/or
delivered in connection therewith or otherwise related thereto,
including, but not limited to, the Amended Note (as defined
below) a Letter Agreement re: First Amendment to Financing
Agreements, dated May, 1991, a Letter Agreement, dated March 3,
1992, a Letter Agreement re: Amendment to Financing Agreements,
dated March 24, 1992 and a Letter Agreement re: Extension of and
Amendment to Financing Agreements, dated September 23, 1992 (all
of the foregoing, as the same now exist or may hereafter be
amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, restated or
replaced, being collectively referred to herein as the "Financing
Agreements").

On or about the date hereof, Borrower has requested that
Lender (a) extend the term of the Financing Agreements and
(b) add Enterprising Service Solutions Corporation ("ESSC") as a
"Borrower" under the Financing Agreements and, within the limits
of the Maximum Credit and on and subject to all of the terms and
conditions set forth in the Loan Agreement, make loans, advances
and other financial accommodations available to ESSC; all of
which Lender is willing to do, subject to the terms and
conditions hereof.

In consideration of the foregoing, the parties hereto hereby
agree as follows:

1. Definitions.

(a) Section 10.6(c)(i) of the Loan Agreement is hereby
amended to include ESSC within the definition of the term
"Borrower", and all references to Borrower in the Loan Agreement
and other Financing Agreements shall mean each of Genicom,
Genicom FSC and ESSC, jointly and severally, individually and
collectively, and the successors and assigns of each.

(b) All other capitalized terms used in this Letter
re: Extension of and Amendment to Financing Agreements
("Amendment") which are defined in the Loan Agreement, and are
not otherwise defined herein, shall have the same meaning
specified in the Loan Agreement.

2. Assumption. ESSC hereby (a) expressly assumes, and
confirms and ratifies its assumption of, by means of this
Amendment, all of the Obligations, (b) undertakes and agrees to
perform directly in favor of Lender, jointly and severally with
Genicom and Genicom FSC, which shall remain directly liable
therefor, all of the Obligations in accordance with all of the
terms and provisions of the Financing Agreements; and
(c) acknowledges and confirms that the Obligations so assumed
shall be secured by all assets and properties of ESSC now or
hereafter constituting Collateral.

3. Restatement. The Obligations of Genicom and Genicom
FSC to Lender assumed by ESSC as aforesaid shall be repayable as
follows: (a) the Term Loan to Genicom shall be repayable in
accordance with the terms of the Restated and Amended Promissory
Note, dated as of September 26, 1992, executed and delivered by
Genicom in favor of Lender in the original principal amount of
$3,339,650 (the "Amended Note"), the Loan Agreement and the other
Financing Agreements and (b) the remaining balance of the
Obligations of Genicom and Genicom FSC shall constitute and be
deemed joint and several Obligations of Genicom, Genicom FSC and
ESSC, and shall be repayable in accordance with the terms of the
Financing Agreements.

4. Adoption. All of the Financing Agreements are hereby
and shall be deemed adopted and assumed in full by ESSC and
considered as agreements between ESSC and Lender, except as
otherwise provided herein. ESSC hereby ratifies, restates,
affirms and confirms all of the terms and conditions of the
Financing Agreements.

5. Acknowledgement of Indebtedness. Borrower hereby
acknowledges, confirms and agrees that Borrower is indebted to
Lender as of the close of business on June 7, 1994, for
Obligations in the principal amount of not less than
$20,323,038.63, together with interest accrued and accruing
thereon, and all fees, costs and expenses and other charges now
or hereafter payable by Borrower to Lender under the Financing
Agreements, all of which is unconditionally owed by Borrower to
Lender without offset, defense or counterclaim of any kind,
nature or description whatsoever. Genicom and Genicom FSC each
hereby acknowledges and agrees that the assumption by ESSC of the
Obligations pursuant to this Amendment or otherwise, does not, in
any manner, constitute payment of, impair, limit, cancel,
extinguish, release or diminish the Obligations of Genicom and
Genicom FSC under the Loan Agreement and the other Financing
Agreements. Genicom and Genicom FSC each hereby acknowledges,
confirms and agrees that the Obligations and the security
interests, liens and encumbrances upon their respective
properties and assets heretofore granted to Lender to secure the
Obligations shall continue in full force and effect from and
after the date hereof.

6. Direct Grant of Security Interest by ESSC. As security
for the prompt performance, observance and payment in full of
all Obligations, ESSC hereby grants to Lender a continuing
security interest in, lien upon and a right of setoff against the
Collateral, and ESSC hereby assigns, transfers, pledges and sets
over to Lender all of its now owned and hereafter acquired
interests in the Collateral.

(a) Eligible Accounts Owned by ESSC. The following
sentence is hereby added as the last sentence of Section 2.1(d)
of the Loan Agreement:

"In addition to, and not in limitation of the
foregoing, accounts owed by Computervision
Corporation ("Computervision") to Enterprising
Service Solutions Corporation ("ESSC") shall not
constitute Eligible Accounts unless Computervision
has executed and delivered in favor of Lender a
non-offset letter with respect to all such
accounts, in form and substance satisfactory to
Lender in its sole discretion, which non-offset
letter (i) shall provide, among other things, that
Computervision shall remit directly to Lender
payment of all of Computervision's accounts at any
time owing to ESSC without offset, defense,
counterclaim or deduction and (ii) must at all
times remain in full force and effect and shall
not have been rescinded, terminated, modified or
amended, in whole or in part, by Computervision."

(b) Eligible Inventory. Section 2.1(g) of the Loan
Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the
following:

"(g) "Eligible Inventory" is inventory in one of
the categories of inventory listed in Section
10.1(b)(ii) owned by Genicom Corporation, Genicom
Foreign Sales Corporation or Genicom Limited which
is and remains acceptable to Lender for lending
purposes and is located at one of the addresses
set forth in Section 10.6(e). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, it is expressly understood and agreed
that no inventory now or hereafter owned by
Enterprising Service Solutions Corporation
constitutes, or shall constitute, Eligible
Inventory."

(c) Combined Net Worth. Section 6.11 of the Loan
Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and replaced with the
following:

"6.11 Borrower shall at all times maintain
working capital and net worth (each as determined,
on a consolidated basis, in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles of the
United States, in effect on the date hereof,
consistently applied) in the amounts set forth in
Section 10.5 and Borrower shall not, directly or
indirectly, expend or commit to expend, for fixed
or capital assets (including capital lease
obligations) an amount in excess of the capital
expenditure limit set forth in Section 10.5 in any
fiscal year of Borrower. For purposes of
calculating the Combined Net Worth of the direct
and indirect subsidiaries of Borrower identified
in Section 10.5, amounts due Genicom Corporation
from any such subsidiary shall be considered
equity in such subsidiary."

(d) Term. Section 9.1 of the Loan Agreement is hereby
deleted in its entirety and replaced with the following:

"This Agreement shall only become effective upon
execution and delivery by Borrower and Lender and
shall continue in full force and effect through
and including December 30, 1996 (the "Extended
Term") and shall be deemed automatically renewed
for successive terms of one (1) year thereafter
unless terminated as of the end of the Extended
Term or any renewal term (each a "Term") by either
party giving the other written notice at least
sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then-
current Term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in
the event either Borrower or Lender delivers
written notice to the other, on or before
October 30, 1996, terminating this Agreement as of
the expiration of the Extended Term, at the sole
option of Lender, by written notice delivered by
Lender to Borrower on or before December 15, 1996,
the Extended Term shall be extended to and shall
terminate on January 5, 1997."

(e) Termination; Early Termination Fee. Section 9.2
of the Loan Agreement is hereby deleted in its entirety and
replaced with the following:

"Borrower may also terminate this Agreement by
giving Lender at least thirty (30) days prior
written notice at any time upon payment in full of
all of the Obligations as provided herein,
including the early termination fee provided
below. Lender shall also have the right to
terminate this Agreement at any time upon or
after the occurrence of an Event of Default. If
Lender terminates this Agreement upon or after the
occurrence of an Event of Default, or if Borrower
shall terminate this Agreement as permitted herein
effective prior to the end of the then-current
Term, in addition to all other Obligations,
Borrower shall pay to Lender, upon the effective
date of termination, in view of the impracticality
and extreme difficulty of ascertaining actual
damages and by mutual agreement of the parties as
to a reasonable calculation of Lender's lost
profits, an early termination fee equal to two
(2%) percent of the Maximum Credit if such
termination occurs on or prior to December 30,
1995 and one (1%) percent of the Maximum Credit if
such termination occurs after December 30, 1995
but on or prior to the end of the Extended Term or
the end of any renewal term. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that, prior to such
termination, Genicom Corporation issues additional
shares of its capital stock to a third party in an
aggregate amount equal to at least 19% of the
shares of capital stock of Genicom Corporation
issued and outstanding as of June 5, 1994 in a
transaction with a third party to which Lender has
consented in accordance with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, then the early
termination fee shall in all events be $75,000."

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

GENICOM CORPORATION EXTENDS CREDIT FACILITY AND
ACQUIRES $ 5.8 MILLION OF ITS 12.5% SENIOR SUBORDINATED
NOTES

Chantilly, VA. - - June 14, 1994 - - GENICOM Corporation
(NASDAQ:GECM) today announced that it has reached an
agreement with its lender, THE CIT Group/Credit Finance,
Inc. ("CIT"), to amend its $ 35.0 million Loan and Security
Agreement ("Credit Facility") and has purchased $ 5.8
million of its 12.5% Senior Subordinated Notes ("Notes").

CIT has agreed to extend its Credit Facility to GENICOM,
which was entered into in September 1990, for an additional
twenty-seven (27) month period ending in December 1996.
The amended agreement excludes any renewal fees, provides
for borrowing at Chemical Bank's quoted prime interest rate
plus 3.0% and includes early termination provisions at
GENICOM's option.

The Company acquired the $ 5.8 million Notes in the open
market through several transactions in the first two months
of the Company's 1994 second quarter. The purchases were
made at favorable terms and accordingly, the Company will
report a $ 0.5 million gain, net of taxes and the write-
off of unamortized debt issuance costs in its 1994 second
quarter financial results.

James C. Gale, GENICOM's Senior Vice President Finance and
Chief Financial Officer, commented: "Our relationship with
CIT continues to be a positive and mutually beneficial
relationship. I am pleased that we were able to
successfully negotiate an extension to our current lending
arrangement with CIT which will permit the Company to
continue to focus on the growth of its strategic businesses
of Enterprising Service Solutions, Laser Printing Solutions
and Supplies."

Mr. Gale further commented: "I am pleased to report the
successful open market purchases of our Notes at a reduced
cash outlay. These purchases combined with previous Notes
held in treasury are sufficient to meet the February 1995,
sinking fund requirement for the Notes."

GENICOM Corporation, through its worldwide operations,
designs, manufactures, markets and services a wide range of
computer printer technologies for general purpose
applications as well as a line of hermetically sealed
relays. Through its Enterprising Service Solutions
business, GENICOM provides multivendor depot and field
support services.
