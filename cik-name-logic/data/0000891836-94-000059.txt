Item 5. Other Events.

On July 27, 1994, WLR Foods, Inc. (the "Company") entered
into an Asset Purchase Agreement ("Asset Purchase Agreement"), of same
date, with Cuddy Farms, Inc. ("Cuddy"), Cuddy International Corporation
("Cuddy International") and Wampler-Longacre, Inc., the Company's wholly-
owned subsidiary ("Wampler-Longacre"). The closing (the "Closing") of the
transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement is to be within
three (3) business days after Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance is obtained.

Pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement,
the Company and Wampler-Longacre will acquire substantially all of the
assets of Cuddy's turkey processing division, including, without
limitation, its processing facility, further processing facility, feed
mill, three turkey grow-out farms, a leasehold interest in a second further
processing facility, a partnership interest in a cold storage and
distribution facility and all working capital, machinery, fixtures,
equipment and other tangible personal property for, and inventory in, such
facilities (the "Assets").

The purchase price for the Assets is $73.3 million, $42.5
million of which is payable in cash and the balance to be issued in Shares. 
The number of Shares issued will be based on a ten-day, pre-closing
weighted average stock market value, subject to a floor of $24 per Share
and a ceiling of $28 per Share. The Agreement provides for certain post-
closing adjustments which are not expected to be material.

The Shares issued in this transaction will not be
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and will be subject to a Voting
Trust Agreement by and among the Company, Cuddy and an independent
corporate trustee. The Voting Trust Agreement will terminate upon the
earlier of (a) the fourth anniversary of the Closing date; (b) the date on
which a business acquisition by the Company occurs in which in excess of
five percent (5%) of its then outstanding common stock is issued without
voting and transfer restrictions similar to the Voting Trust Agreement and
Cuddy's stock ownership in the Company after such acquisition is less than
five percent (5%) of the total outstanding shares of the Company's common
stock; or (c) the date on which a "Change of Control" in the Company
occurs. For purposes of the Voting Trust Agreement, a Change of 

-2-
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 3

Control means the acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within
the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) of beneficial ownership (within
the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of more than
30 percent (30%) of either the then outstanding shares of common stock of
the Company or the combined voting power of the then outstanding voting
securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors. During the term of the Voting Trust Agreement, the trustee will
vote in accordance with the recommendation of the Company's Board of
Directors, as it exists at the time of the vote of the Company's
shareholders, or if there is no recommendation, as directed by the
registered holder of the voting trust certificate representing the shares
held by the trustee. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Company,
the voting trust certificates are not transferable except that (a) the
holder thereof may pledge, mortgage or otherwise encumber the certificates
and (b) the holder thereof may transfer the certificates to Cuddy
International or a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cuddy International. Any
transferee shall also be subject to the Voting Trust Agreement. After
termination of the Voting Trust Agreement, Cuddy will have certain demand
and incidental registration rights.

Upon the closing of the transaction contemplated by the
Asset Purchase Agreement, Cuddy, Cuddy International, A.M.C. Family
Holdings, Ltd. and A.M. Cuddy (the "Cuddy Group") will enter into a Non-
Competition and Name Use Agreement by which the Cuddy Group will covenant
not to compete with Wampler-Longacre in the business of poultry production
for processing, further processing or marketing of processed poultry
products (exclusive of production of eggs and poults) (the "Protected
Business") in the geographical area in the continental United States in
which Wampler-Longacre or its affiliates currently conduct business. Sales
to certain existing customers of the Cuddy Group are excluded. The Company
will pay Cuddy $500,000 in cash at Closing in consideration of this
Agreement. Pursuant to the Non-Competition and Name Use Agreement, Cuddy
will also grant Wampler-Longacre a five (5)-year exclusive right and
license to the "Cuddy" name within the continental United States for the
Protected Business. The Non-Competition and Name Use Agreement contains
"standstill" provisions by which the Cuddy Group agrees, for so long as the
Voting Trust Agreement is not terminated, not to: solicit proxies or
participate in an election contest relating to election of the directors;
act together with others to acquire, hold or vote the Company's common
stock; 

-3-

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 4

purchase or otherwise acquire the Company's common stock; or act alone or
together with any person to acquire, or propose a business combination
with, the Company.

The Asset Purchase Agreement also requires Cuddy and
Wampler-Longacre, before Closing, to enter into certain administrative,
supply and processing agreements.

The Asset Purchase Agreement provides that a Cuddy
representative will be appointed to the Company's Board of Directors who
shall serve until the next annual meeting of shareholders and shall be
recommended by the Company's Board of Directors for election at such
meeting. The Closing is subject to customary "due diligence" conditions
and contains mutual indemnifications except that Cuddy and Cuddy
International (the "Cuddy Corporations") shall not be required to indemnify
the Company and Wampler-Longacre (collectively, "Wampler") for losses not
in excess of $250,000. The Voting Trust further requires WLR Foods to
indemnify Cuddy and the trustee for losses, including legal fees and
expenses, in connection therewith.

The parties to the Agreement also signed separate indemnifica-
tion agreements (the "Indemnification Agreements"), mutually agreeing
to certain indemnifications. On the part of the Cuddy Corporations, 
indemnification of Wampler is required in connection with certain 
possible litigation relating to stockholder and employee complaints. 
On the part of Wampler, indemnification of the Cuddy Corporations is 
required in connection with pending or possible litigation relating to 
the efforts of Tyson Foods, Inc. to acquire the Company. Both agree-
ments terminate upon final termination of all actions, suits, 
proceedings or investigations relating to the respective litigations.

The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by 
reference to the Asset Purchase Agreement and the Indemnification
Agreements, copies of which are filed as exhibits hereto and which
are incorporated herein by reference.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 9

trustee of the Voting Trust Agreement described in Section 13.4 hereof (the

Trustee), for the benefit of Cuddy that number of shares of WLR Foods

common stock, rounded to the nearest whole number, which is determined by

dividing the sum of Thirty Million Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars

($30,800,000) by the weighted average closing price of WLR Foods common

stock as quoted by NASDAQ's National Market System for the ten (10)

consecutive WLR Foods common stock trading days ending at the close of

market two business days prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that

if such average is below $24.00 per share, $24.00 shall be the divisor and

(Stock Value), less 100,000 shares.

(c) On the Second Closing Date, (i) if the purchase price,

after making the Post-Closing Adjustments, exceeds $73,300,000, WLR Foods

shall issue to the Trustee on behalf of Cuddy 100,000 shares of WLR Foods

common stock plus that additional number of shares of WLR Foods common

stock, rounded to the nearest whole number, which is determined by dividing

the sum of the Post-Closing Adjustments by the Stock Value; (ii) if the

purchase price, after making the Post-Closing Adjustments, is equal to

$73,300,000, WLR Foods shall issue to the Trustee on behalf of Cuddy

100,000 shares of WLR Foods common stock; or (iii) if the purchase price,

after making the Post-Closing Adjustments is less than $73,300,000, WLR

Foods shall issue to Cuddy 100,000 shares reduced by that number of shares

of WLR Foods common stock, rounded to the nearest whole number, which is

determined by dividing the sum of the Post-Closing Adjustments by the Stock

Value;

provided, however, that if the Post-Closing Adjustments exceed the Stock

Value of 100,000 shares of WLR Foods common stock, Cuddy shall pay to WLR

Foods a sum equal to such excess amount, in cash. Any stock issuances

shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 13.

suits, proceedings or claims with respect thereto arise before or after the

Closing Date. Wampler-Longacre shall not assume or be liable for any tax

liability of Cuddy in respect of any profit derived from the sale provided

conditions and the receipt of the following documents (subject to the right

of Wampler to waive any such requirement):

obligation to close shall be conditioned upon Cuddy's being able to convey

marketable title to the Real Estate, subject only to the title exceptions

listed in Exhibit 5.3(a), and such other matters as do not materially

adversely affect marketability of title. In the event an examination of

title or survey of the Real Estate reveals objections to title not

described above, Wampler shall give Cuddy prompt notice thereof. Upon

receipt of notice of objection, Cuddy shall have the right (but not the

obligation) to attempt to cure the defect, and shall thereby be entitled to

a reasonable extension of the Closing Date during which to attempt to cure

the 30-day

be, either (i) waive the defect and promptly proceed to closing under this

Agreement without reduction in the purchase price set forth in Section 2.1,

or (ii) terminate this Agreement by written notice to Cuddy. To the extent

Wampler-Longacre waives any such objection and agrees to look solely to

such policy for the title insurance with respect to that objection.

Exhibit 1.3

NON-COMPETITION AND NAME USE AGREEMENT

THIS NONCOMPETITION AND NAME USE AGREEMENT is made and entered into

this [Closing Date], by and among WAMPLER-LONGACRE, INC., a Virginia

corporation (Wampler-Longacre) and CUDDY FARMS, INC., a North Carolina

corporation (Cuddy), CUDDY INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION, a corporation

incorporated under the laws of Ontario, A.M.C. Family Holdings, Ltd., a

corporation incorporated under the laws of Ontario, and A.M. Cuddy

(collectively "Cuddy Group").

RECITALS

A. Cuddy has heretofore operated two divisions. The farm division

is a major supplier of turkey eggs and poults with facilities in North

Carolina, South Carolina, Iowa, Missouri, Ohio, Virginia and Minnesota (the

Poult Business). The food division is an integrated turkey processor with

three turkey processing facilities, a feedmill, growout operations, and an

interest in a cold storage distribution center, all located in North

Carolina (the Business).

B. Wampler-Longacre has today purchased substantially all of the

Business.

C. Wampler-Longacre desires to pay Cuddy, on behalf of the Cuddy

Group, a certain sum to protect itself and its affiliates from competition

and control contests by the 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 2

Cuddy Group and for certain rights, described herein, to the use of the

"Cuddy" name.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual

covenants and agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable

consideration the receipt and sufficiency thereof is hereby acknowledged,

the parties represent and agree as follows:

1. Covenant Not To Compete. The Cuddy Group jointly and

severally agrees that it will not engage in, directly or indirectly, either

themselves or for any other person, partnership, corporation, company or

entity, or participate (as defined below) in any enterprise involved in the

businesses of poultry production for processing, further processing or

marketing of processed poultry products (specifically excluded is poultry

production of eggs and poults and the marketing of such products) (the

Protected Business), in the geographical area in the continental United

States in which Wampler-Longacre or its affiliates currently conducts its

business, including without limitation, Virginia, West Virginia, North

Carolina and Pennsylvania, for a period of four (4) years from the date

hereof. As used herein, the term "participate" means lending one's name

to, acting as consultant or advisor to, or acquiring any direct or indirect

interest in any enterprise, whether as stockholder, partner, officer,

director, employee or otherwise (other than by ownership of 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 3

less than two percent of the stock of a publicly-held corporation and

ownership in WLR Foods, Inc.). The Cuddy Group agrees that this covenant

is reasonable in its scope, geographical area and duration. However, Cuddy

International Corporation and its affiliates will continue to be permitted

to provide poultry products for distribution in the United States, but only

to McDonalds, Delta Daily Foods and for distribution under three private

labels, namely President Choice Products, Master Choice Products and

Sensational Brand Products.

2. Covenant of No Contest. The Cuddy Group agrees that during the

period that common stock of WLR Foods, Inc. acquired today by Cuddy in

exchange for the Business is subject to voting and transfer restrictions as

set forth in Section 13.4 of the Asset Purchase Agreement dated the date

hereof, the Cuddy Group, jointly and severally, agrees none of them, nor

any of their affiliates will, directly or indirectly, without in each

instance the prior written consent of WLR Foods, Inc., parent corporation

of Wampler-Longacre, expressed in a resolution duly adopted by the Board of

Directors of WLR Foods, Inc.: (a) solicit any proxies, under any

circumstances, for any matter whatsoever with respect to any class of

capital stock or other securities of WLR Foods, Inc. which is then entitled

to vote in the election of directors or on any other matter (Voting

Securities), or become a "participant" in any "election 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 4

contest" relating to the election of directors of WLR Foods Inc. (as such

terms are used in Rule 14a-11 of Regulations 14A under the Securities

Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or to seek to advise or influence any

person with respect to the voting of any Voting Securities of WLR Foods,

Inc. on any matter whatsoever; (b) act together with any other person for

the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any Voting

Securities of WLR Foods, Inc. or any options or other rights to acquire any

such securities; (c) purchase or otherwise acquire, or offer, propose or

agree to purchase or otherwise acquire, or advise, encourage or assist in

the acquisition of, any Voting Securities of WLR Foods, Inc. or options or

rights to acquire any such securities; or (d) act alone or together with

any person to acquire, or propose a business combination with, WLR Foods,

Inc.

3. Use of "Cuddy" Name. Cuddy hereby grants Wampler-Longacre a

five (5) year exclusive right and license to use the name or mark "Cuddy,"

alone or in combination with other names or marks, within the continental

United States in connection solely with the Protected Business. This five

(5)-year term shall terminate on the fifth anniversary of this Agreement

but shall thereafter be renewable upon such terms and conditions as

Wampler-Longacre and Cuddy may mutually agree. In addition, Cuddy agrees

to allow Wampler-Longacre to license perpetually, or acquire a trademark

for 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 5

"Masterpiece" and "Heritage" in the continental United States.

4. Cuddy Group Rights. Except as set out in Paragraph 3, the

Cuddy Group shall retain all rights to the "Cuddy" name. 

5. Other Users. Cuddy warrants and represents that it has

authorized no other person or entity to use the name "Cuddy" or any similar

name alone or in conjunction with any other word or symbol for any purpose

in the continental United States and that, to its knowledge, no other

person or entity is using in the continental United States, without

authorization, the name "Cuddy" or any similar name for any purpose other

than the corporate name Cuddy Farms, Inc. as used in conjunction with the

Poult Business.

6. Payment. In consideration hereof Wampler-Longacre shall pay

Cuddy, by certified or bank cashier's check or other current funds

acceptable to Cuddy, the sum of Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000)

payable upon execution hereof. The amount of payment, if any, to be made

to D. Bruce Cuddy pursuant to a substantially similar, but separate,

agreement shall reduce this sum.

7. Remedies. The parties acknowledge that a breach of this

Agreement by any party will result in substantial and irreparable injury to

the other party. If any of the provisions herein are violated, in whole or

in part, Wampler-Longacre shall be entitled, upon application to any 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 6

court of proper jurisdiction as herein agreed, to restrain and enjoin the

Cuddy Group, or any one of them, from such violation, and to recover cash

and reasonable attorneys' fees in connection with such action, without

prejudice to any other remedies Wampler-Longacre may have at law or in

equity.

8. Reformation and Severability. In the event that any provision

herein should ever be deemed to exceed the time, geographic, occupational

or use limitations permitted by law, the parties agree that such provisions

shall be and are reformed to the maximum time, geographic, occupation and

use limitations permitted by applicable law. Such determination shall not

affect the remaining provisions of this Agreement, all of which shall

remain in full force and effect.

9. Binding Agreement. All of the terms and provisions of this

Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be

enforceable by, each of the parties hereto and their respective legal

representatives, successors and assigns.

10. Governing Law, Venue. This Agreement shall be governed and

construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia

applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within the

Commonwealth. The Circuit Court of the County of Rockingham, Virginia or

the United States District Court for the Western District of 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 7

Virginia, Harrisonburg Division, as appropriate, shall have exclusive

jurisdiction and venue over any claims or causes of action concerning this

Agreement, except that any claim asserted against Cuddy International

Corporation, A.M.C. Family Holdings, Ltd. and A.M. Cuddy shall be pursued

only in Ontario, Canada courts. 

11. Waiver. A waiver by any party of a breach of any provision of

this Agreement shall not operate as, nor be construed as, a waiver of any

subsequent breach thereof.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this Agreement as of

the date first above written.

EXHIBIT 13.4

VOTING TRUST AGREEMENT

THIS VOTING TRUST AGREEMENT, dated [Closing Date], is made by and

among WLR FOODS, INC., a Virginia corporation (WLR Foods), CUDDY FARMS,

INC., a North Carolina corporation, its successors and assigns (Cuddy), and

[Independent Corporate Trustee], Trustee, and its successors (Trustee) who

agree as follows.

RECITALS:

A. As of the date hereof ____ shares of WLR Foods common

stock (the Shares) have been issued to the Trustee hereunder, on behalf of

Cuddy in consideration for the transfer of certain assets pursuant to the

terms of an Asset Purchase Agreement between Cuddy, WLR Foods and others

dated July 27, 1994. The parties anticipate that additional shares of WLR

Foods common stock may be issued to the Trustee, on behalf of Cuddy,

following certain post-closing adjustments which, when issued, shall also

be considered "Shares" hereunder.

B. A condition precedent to WLR Foods' obligation to issue the

Shares was Cuddy's execution of this Agreement in order for the Cuddy

acquisition not to compromise the continuity and stability of WLR Foods'

long term business strategy and policies as effectively confirmed by a

recent vote of shareholders of WLR Foods and as implemented and managed by

WLR Foods' Board of Directors and management.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 2

C. The Trustee has consented to act under this Agreement for the

purposes hereunder.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and other good and

valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the

parties agree as follows:

1. Transfer of Stock to Trustee. Concurrently with the closing of

the above-referenced Asset Purchase Agreement, the Shares were issued to

Trustee, on behalf of Cuddy, who shall hold the Shares subject to the terms

of this Agreement and shall issue and deliver to Cuddy voting trust

certificates for the Shares.

2. Voting Trust Certificates. The voting trust certificate shall

be in substantially the same form as set forth on Exhibit A attached

hereto.

3. Transfer of Certificates. Unless otherwise agreed to in

writing by WLR Foods, the voting trust certificates are not transferable

except that (a) the holder thereof may pledge, mortgage or otherwise

encumber the certificates and (b) the holder thereof may transfer the

certificates to Cuddy International Corporation or a wholly-owned

subsidiary of Cuddy International Corporation; provided, however, that the

person or persons in whose favor such certificates are transferred shall be

bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement as though that person were

the holder and shall exercise the rights of the voting trust certificates

only in accordance with this Agreement. In the event of any 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 3

permitted transfer, the certificates shall be transferable at the Trustee's

principal office in [place] (and at such other office as the Trustee may

designate by an instrument signed by it and sent by telecopy to the

registered holders of voting trust certificates), on the books of the

Trustee, by the registered owner thereof, either in person or by attorney

thereto duly authorized, upon surrender thereof, according to the rules

established for that purpose by the Trustee.

4. Term of Agreement. This Agreement shall terminate upon the

earlier of:

(a) The fourth anniversary hereof.

(b) The date on which a business acquisition by WLR Foods

occurs in which (i) in excess of five percent (5%) of its then outstanding

shares of common stock is issued without voting and transfer restrictions

similar to those set forth herein, and (ii) Cuddy's stock ownership in WLR

Foods after such business acquisition is less than five percent (5%) of the

total outstanding shares of common stock of WLR Foods.

(c) The date on which a "Change of Control" occurs in WLR

Foods. For the purpose of this Agreement, a "Change in Control" shall mean

the acquisition by any individual, entity or group (within the meaning of

Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as

amended (the "Exchange Act")) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning

of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act) of

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 4

more than thirty percent (30%) of either the then outstanding shares of

common stock of WLR Foods or the combined voting power of the then

outstanding voting securities of WLR Foods entitled to vote generally in

the election of directors.

5. Termination Procedure. 

(a) Immediately upon the termination of this Agreement as

provided in Section 4 above, the voting trust certificates shall cease to

have any effect, and their holders shall have no further rights under this

Voting Trust Agreement other than to receive certificates for shares of the

WLR Foods' stock or other property distributable under the terms hereof and

upon the surrender of such voting trust certificates.

(b) Immediately upon surrender of the voting trust

certificates at the Trustee's offices, the Trustee shall deliver to the

registered holders of all voting trust certificates certificates for the

number of shares of the WLR Foods' common stock represented thereby.

(c) If any voting trust certificate has not been surrendered

within thirty (30) days after the termination of this Agreement, the

Trustee may deposit with WLR Foods stock certificates representing the

number of shares of common stock represented by such voting trust

certificates then outstanding, with authority in writing to WLR Foods to

deliver such stock certificates in exchange for voting trust certificates

representing a like number of shares of the 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 5

capital stock of WLR Foods. Upon such deposit, all further liability of

the Trustee for the delivery of such stock certificates and the delivery or

payment of dividends upon surrender of the voting trust certificates shall

cease, and the Trustee shall not be required to take any further action

hereunder.

6. Dividends. 

(a) Prior to the termination of this Agreement, the holder of

each voting trust certificate shall be entitled to receive payments equal

to the cash dividends, if any, received by the Trustee upon a like number

and class of shares of WLR Foods' common stock as is called for by each

voting trust certificate. If any dividend in respect of the stock

deposited with the Trustee is paid, in whole or in part, in WLR Foods'

common stock, the Trustee shall hold, subject to the terms of this

Agreement, the certificates for stock which are received by it on account

of such dividend. In the event of a dividend payable in cash or stock at

the shareholder's election, the Trustee shall make such election upon the

direction of the registered holder of the voting trust certificate, or, in

the absence of such election, shall elect a cash dividend payment. The

holder of each voting trust certificate representing stock on which such

stock dividend has been paid shall be entitled to receive a voting trust

certificate issued under this Agreement for the number of shares and class

of stock received as such 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 6

dividend with respect to the shares represented by such voting trust

certificate. Holders entitled to receive the dividends described above

shall be those registered as such on the Trustee's transfer books at the

close of business on the day fixed by WLR Foods for the taking of a record

to determine those holders of its stock entitled to receive such dividends.

(b) If any dividend in respect of the stock deposited with

the Trustee is paid other than in cash or in common stock, then the Trustee

shall distribute the same among the holders of voting trust certificates

registered as such on the Trustee's transfer books at the close of business

on the day fixed by WLR Foods for the taking of a record to determine those

holders of its stock entitled to receive such dividends.

(c) In lieu of receiving cash dividends upon the common stock

of WLR Foods and paying the same to the holders of voting trust

certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, the Trustee may

instruct WLR Foods in writing to pay such dividends to the holders of the

voting trust certificates. Upon receipt of such written instructions, WLR

Foods shall pay such dividends directly to the holders of the voting trust

certificates. Upon such instructions being given by the Trustee, all

liability of the Trustee with respect to such dividends shall cease. The

Trustee may at any time revoke such instructions and by written notice 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 7

to WLR Foods direct it to make dividend payments to the Trustee.

7. Rights of Trustee. 

(a) Until the actual delivery to the holders of voting trust

certificates issued hereunder of stock certificates in exchange therefor,

and until the surrender of the voting trust certificates for cancellation,

the Trustee shall have the right, subject to the provisions hereof,

including, without limitation, paragraph (b) below, to exercise, in person

or by his nominees or proxies, all stockholder voting rights and powers in

respect of all stock deposited hereunder, and to take part in or consent to

any corporate or stockholder action of any kind whatsoever. The right to

vote shall include the right to vote for the election of directors, and in

favor of or against any resolution or proposed action of any character

whatsoever, which may be presented at any meeting or require the consent of

the WLR Foods' stockholders. Without limiting such general right, it is

understood that such action or proceeding may include, upon terms

satisfactory to the Trustee or to his nominees or proxies thereto appointed

by him, mortgaging, creating a security interest in, and pledging of all or

any part of the WLR Foods' property, the lease or sale of all or any part

of its property, for cash, securities, or other property, and the

dissolution of WLR Foods, or its consolidation, merger, reorganization, or

recapitalization.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 8

(b) In voting the stock held by him hereunder either in

person or by his nominees or proxies, the Trustee shall vote in accordance

with the recommendation of the WLR Foods' Board of Directors as it exists

at the time of the vote of WLR Foods' shareholders, or if there is no such

recommendation, as directed by the registered voting trust certificate

holder. 

8. Trustees.

(a) The Trustee (and any successor Trustee) may at any time

resign by mailing to the registered holders of voting trust certificates a

written resignation, to take effect ten (10) days thereafter or upon its

prior acceptance. In the event of resignation, a successor Trustee shall

be mutually acceptable to, and designated by, WLR Foods and Cuddy, and, in

the absence of an agreement between the parties, designated by an

independent third party selected by them. No person or entity shall be

named as successor Trustee who is restricted from voting WLR Foods common

stock by any other law, agreement or regulatory or judicial order.

(b) The rights, powers, and privileges of the Trustee named

hereunder shall be possessed by the successor Trustees, with the same

effect as though such successors had originally been parties to this

Agreement. The word "Trustee," as used in this Agreement, means the

Trustee or any successor Trustees acting hereunder, and shall include both

the single and the plural number.

9. Compensation and Reimbursement of 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 9

Trustee. The Trustee shall serve for an annual fee of $____________ which

shall be paid by WLR Foods. The Trustee shall have the right to incur and

pay such reasonable expenses and charges, to employ and pay such agents,

attorneys, and counsel as it may deem necessary and proper to effectuate

this Agreement. All such expenses or charges incurred by and due to the

Trustee shall be reimbursed by WLR Foods.

10. Indemnification. WLR Foods shall indemnify and hold harmless

each of Cuddy and the Trustee and their respective officers, directors,

employees, shareholders, partners, agents, legal counsel and accountants

(each an "Indemnitee" and together the "Indemnitees") to the fullest extent

permitted by applicable law in effect on the date hereof or as such laws

may from time to time be amended from and against any and all losses,

claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys' fees and

expenses and any and all expenses whatsoever incurred in investigating,

preparing or defending any action, suit, investigation or proceeding), and

amounts paid in settlement (together, "Losses") incurred by an Indemnitee

if such Indemnitee is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any

threatened, pending or completed action, suit, investigation or proceeding,

whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigation in nature, arising

from, caused by or in connection with the negotiation, execution, delivery

and performance of this 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 10

Agreement (including any other agreements entered into in connection

herewith), other than as a result of the breach by the Indemnitee of any

terms of this Agreement or such agreements. 

11. Notice.

to or communication with the holders of the voting trust certificates

hereunder shall be deemed to be sufficiently given or made if telecopied or

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT AND RELEASE

This INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT AND RELEASE is made and entered

into this 27th day of July, 1994 ("Agreement"), by and between WLR FOODS,

INC., a Virginia corporation (including its successors, the "Company"), and

CUDDY FARMS, INC., a North Carolina corporation ("Cuddy"):

WHEREAS, the Company desires to purchase certain of the assets

of Cuddy pursuant to a Asset Purchase Agreement, to be dated as of July 27,

1994, between the Company and Cuddy (the "Purchase Agreement"); and

WHEREAS, the Company is the subject of a hostile takeover

attempt by Tyson Foods, Inc. (the "Takeover") and in connection therewith

certain litigation between the Company and Tyson Foods, Inc. is pending in

the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia,

Harrisonburg Division (Civil Action No. 94-0012(H)); and

WHEREAS, Cuddy is concerned that it might incur significant

costs and expenses if it were made a party to the above mentioned

litigation or other litigation which has been or may subsequently be

brought if Cuddy were to enter into the Purchase Agreement; and

WHEREAS, the Company, recognizing Cuddy's legitimate business

concerns and possible exposure, desires to indemnify Cuddy to the fullest

extent permitted by law as set forth herein;

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 2

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the

covenants contained herein, the Company and Cuddy do hereby covenant and

agree as follows:

Section 1. Indemnification. The Company shall indemnify and

hold harmless each of Cuddy, Cuddy Foods, Inc., Cuddy International

Incorporated, and their respective officers, directors, employees,

shareholders, partners, agents, legal counsel and accountants (each an

"Indemnitee" and together the "Indemnitees") to the fullest extent

permitted by applicable law in effect on the date hereof or as such laws

may from time to time be amended from and against any and all losses,

claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys' fees and

expenses and any and all expenses whatsoever incurred in investigating,

preparing or defending any action, suit, investigation or proceeding), and

amounts paid in settlement (together, "Losses") incurred by an Indemnitee

if such Indemnitee is made a party or is threatened to be made a party to

any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, investigation or

proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative in

nature, brought or to be brought in connection with the Takeover or any

action commenced by any bidder which commences its bid on or prior to June

30, 1995 (including the bidder in the Takeover) for control of the Company

arising from, caused by or in connection with the negotiation, execution,

delivery and performance of the Purchase Agreement (including any other

agreements entered into in connection therewith), other 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 3

than as a result of the breach by Cuddy of any of the terms of the Purchase

Agreement (or any other agreement entered into by Cuddy in connection

therewith).

Section 2. Indemnification for Costs, Charges and Expenses of

Successful Party. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement

and in addition to the rights to indemnification set forth in Section 1

hereof, to the extent that any Indemnitee has served as a witness on behalf

of the Company or has been successful on the merits or otherwise

(including, without limitation, obtaining the dismissal of an action

without prejudice), in defense of any action, suit, investigation or

proceeding referred to in Section 1 hereof, or in defense of any claim,

issue or matter therein, such Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all

Losses incurred by such Indemnitee or on behalf of such Indemnitee in

connection therewith.

Section 3. Partial Indemnification. In addition to the rights

to indemnification set forth in Sections 1 and 2 hereof, if any Indemnitee

is only partially successful in the defense, investigation, settlement or

appeal of any action, suit, investigation or proceeding described in

Section 1 or 2 hereof, and as a result is not entitled under Section 1 or 2

hereof to indemnification by the Company for all Losses incurred by such

Indemnitee, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee, as a

matter of right pursuant to Section 2 hereof, to the extent that the

Indemnitee has been partially successful.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 4

Section 4. Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings. 

The Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of an

Indemnitee's request for indemnification, advise in writing the Board of

Directors of the Company that the Indemnitee has made such request for

indemnification. Upon making such request for indemnification, the

Indemnitee shall be presumed to be entitled to indemnification hereunder

and the Company shall have the burden of proof in the making of any

determination contrary to such presumption. The termination of any action,

suit, investigation or proceeding described in Section 1 or 2 hereof by

judgment, order, settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo

contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, adversely affect the

rights of the Indemnitee to indemnification.

Section 5. Advancement of Expenses and Costs. All expenses

and costs incurred by each Indemnitee as to which such Indemnitee may seek

indemnification or contribution hereunder (including attorneys' fees,

retainers and advances of disbursements required of the Indemnitee and any

and all expenses whatsoever incurred in investigating, preparing or

defending any action, suit, investigation or proceeding) shall be paid by

the Company in advance of the final disposition of any action, suit,

investigation or proceeding at the request of the Indemnitee within 10 days

after the receipt by the Company of a statement or statements from the

Indemnitee requesting such reimbursement from time to time. The

Indemnitee's entitlement to such expenses and costs shall include those

incurred in connection with any 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 5

proceeding by the Indemnitee seeking the enforcement of such Indemnitee's

rights under this Agreement. Such statement or statements shall reasonably

evidence the expenses and costs incurred by the Indemnitee in connection

therewith. An Indemnitee may be required by the Company to provide an

undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount on

condition that it is ultimately determined by a court (as provided in

Section 16) that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against

such expenses and costs by the Company as provided by this Agreement or

otherwise.

Section 6. Remedies of Indemnitee in Cases of Failure to

Indemnify or to Advance Expenses. In the event that the Company fails to

indemnify the Indemnitee hereunder, or if expenses and costs are not timely

advanced pursuant to Section 5, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to a final

adjudication in a court (as provided in Section 16) of the Indemnitee's

entitlement to such indemnification or advance. The Company shall not

oppose the Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or any other

claim. Such judicial proceeding or arbitration shall be made de novo and

the Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of a determination (if so

made) by the Company that the Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification

or advancement of costs and expenses, or that the Company has failed to

indemnify the Indemnitee or to so advance costs and expenses. The Company

further agrees to stipulate in any such court that the Company is bound by

all the provisions of this Agreement and is precluded 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 6

from making any assertion to the contrary. If the court shall determine

that the Indemnitee is entitled to any indemnification hereunder, the

Company shall pay all expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs) and

costs actually incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such

adjudication (including, but not limited to, any appellate proceedings).

Section 7. Other Rights to Indemnification. The

indemnification and advancement of costs and expenses (including attorneys'

fees and costs) provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of

any other rights to which any Indemnitee may now or in the future be

entitled under any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws

of the Company, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors,

provision of law, or otherwise.

Section 8. Contribution. (a) In the event any Indemnitee is

not entitled to the indemnification provided for in this Agreement in

respect of any Losses solely as a result of the Indemnitee's conduct, then

the Company, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnitee, shall contribute to

the amount paid or payable by such Indemnitee as a result of such Losses as

between the Company on the one hand and each Indemnitee on the other, in

such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the

Company and of such Indemnitee in connection with the actions or inactions,

statements or omissions giving rise to such Losses as well as any other

relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company on

the one hand and of such 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 7

Indemnitee on the other shall be determined by reference to, among other

things, whether any untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or

alleged omission to state a material fact on which any of such Losses are

based relates to information supplied by such party, and the parties'

relative intent, knowledge, access to information and obligation to correct

or prevent such statement or omission.

(b) The Company and the Indemnitees agree that it would not

be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were

determined by pro-rata allocation or by any other method of allocation

which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in

the immediately preceding subparagraph. No person guilty of fraudulent

misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities

Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty

of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

Section 9. Procedure. The Indemnitee shall give the Company

prompt notice of any claim made on the Indemnitee which relates to a matter

subject to indemnification under this Agreement. The failure of any

Indemnitee to provide such notice shall not relieve the Company from

liability pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent such failure had

a material adverse effect on the ability to defend such matter. The

Company shall have the right to settle such claim (subject to the consent

of the Indemnitee if the proposed settlement involves any action or

inaction by the Indemnitee, which consent will not be 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 8

unreasonably withheld) and to control the response thereto or the defense

thereof in any suit, action or proceeding arising therefrom. The Company

shall advise the Indemnitee within 10 days of receipt of notice of any

claim whether it elects to settle such claim, or control the response

thereto or defense thereof. If the Company does not timely advise the

Indemnitee as provided above, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to settle

such claim, or control the response thereto or defense thereof at the cost

and expense of the Company as herein provided. After consultation with the

Indemnitee, the Company shall employ competent counsel at the Company's

expense in connection with any such settlement or defense, and the

Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in such defense. The

Indemnitee shall cooperate with all reasonable requests of the Company or

counsel retained by the Company with respect to any such settlement or

defense, and the Company shall keep the Indemnitee informed of the progress

of any such settlement or defense and obtain the consent of the Indemnitee

as contemplated herein.

Section 10. Attorneys' Fees and Other Expenses To Enforce

Agreement. In the event that an Indemnitee is subject to or intervenes in

any proceeding in which the validity or enforceability of this Agreement is

at issue or seeks an adjudication to enforce such Indemnitee's rights

under, or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, the Indemnitee,

if such Indemnitee substantially prevails in such action, shall be entitled

to recover from the Company and shall be indemnified by 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 9

the Company against, any actual expenses for attorneys' fees and

disbursements reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with

such action.

Section 11. Release by Company. The Company hereby fully and

unconditionally releases and discharges all claims and causes of action

which it or its successors, or assigns ever had, now have, or hereafter may

have against the Indemnitees, in each case, past, present, or as they may

exist at any time after the date of this Agreement, and each person, if

any, who controls, controlled, or will control any of them within the

meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Section

20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, except claims and

causes of action arising out of, based upon, or in connection with a breach

by Cuddy of the terms of the Purchase Agreement (or any other agreement

entered into in connection therewith).

Section 12. Term of Agreement. The term of this Agreement

shall expire upon the final termination of all actions, suits, proceedings

or investigations with respect to or relating in any way to the Takeover or

any action commenced by any bidder which commences its bid on or prior to

June 30, 1995 (including the bidder in the Takeover) for control of the

Company. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Company and its

successors and assigns and shall inure to the benefit of the Indemnitees

and their respective successors, assigns, spouses, heirs, devises, 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 10

executors, administrators and other legal representatives, as the case may

be.

Section 13. Severability. If any provision or provisions of

this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable for

any reason whatsoever: (a) the validity, legality and enforceability of the

remaining provisions of this Agreement (including, without limitation, all

portions of any paragraphs of this Agreement containing any such provision

held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves

invalid, illegal or unenforceable) shall not in any way be affected or

impaired thereby; and (b) to the fullest extent possible, the provisions of

this Agreement (including, without limitation, all portions of any

paragraph of this Agreement containing any such provision held to be

invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that are not themselves invalid, illegal

or unenforceable) shall be construed so as to give effect to the intent

manifested by the provision held invalid, illegal or unenforceable.

Section 14. Notices. All notices and other communications

provided for or contemplated by this agreement shall be delivered by hand

or sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed as follows:

Indemnitee's death or incapacity, any notice or communication from the

Company may, at the Company's option, be addressed either to the Indemnitee

at his or her last address specified pursuant to this Section 14 or to the

Indemnitee's estate, executors, administrators, heirs, or legal

representative.

Section 15. Counterparts; Governing Law. This Agreement may

be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an

original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same

instrument. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in

accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia without giving

effect to the conflict of laws.

Section 16. Jurisdiction, Venue and Service of Process. The

parties hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue

<PAGE>

this Agreement or any such document or instrument. In any such action or

proceeding, the parties waive personal service of any summons, complaint,

or other process and agrees that service thereof may be made in accordance

may be mutually agreed upon in writing by the attorneys for the parties to

such action or proceeding, the party so served shall appear or answer such

appear or answer within such 30-day period or such extended period, as the

case may be, the party so served shall be deemed in default and judgment

hereof, supersedes all existing agreements between them concerning such

subject matter, and may be modified only by a written instrument executed

by the Company and Cuddy. Any waiver by any party of a breach of any

provision of this Agreement shall not operate as or be construed to be a

waiver of any other breach of such provision or of any breach of any other

provision of this Agreement. The failure of a party to insist upon strict

adherence to any term of this Agreement on one or 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 13

more occasions shall not be considered a waiver or deprive that party of

the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any

other term of this Agreement. Any waiver must be in writing.

Section 18. Headings. The headings in this Agreement are

solely for convenience of reference and shall be given no effect in the

construction of interpretation of this Agreement.

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT AND RELEASE

THIS INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT AND RELEASE is made and entered into

this 27th day of July, 1994 ("Agreement"), by and among CUDDY FARMS, INC.,

a North Carolina corporation ("Cuddy") and CUDDY INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION,

an Ontario corporation and controlling shareholder of Cuddy Farms, Inc.

("CIC") (together, including their successors, the "Company"), and WLR

FOODS, INC., a Virginia corporation ("WLR"):

WHEREAS, WLR desires to purchase certain of the assets of Cuddy

pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, to be dated as of July 27, 1994,

between the Company and WLR and Wampler-Longacre, Inc. (the "Purchase

Agreement"); and

WHEREAS, there is a possibility that the Company may be the subject

of complaints by stockholders and former employees in connection with

certain actions taken by the senior management of the Company with respect

to management and employment issues and litigation with respect thereto

could ensue (the "Cuddy Litigation"); and

WHEREAS, the WLR is concerned that it might incur significant costs

and expenses in connection with any Cuddy Litigation or other litigation

related to the subject matter of the Cuddy Litigation; and

WHEREAS, the Company, recognizing WLR's legitimate business concerns

and possible exposure, desires to 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 2

indemnify WLR to the fullest extent permitted by law as set forth herein;

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants

contained herein, the Company and WLR do hereby covenant and agree as

follows:

Section 1. Indemnification. The Company shall indemnify and hold

harmless each of WLR Foods, Inc., Wampler-Longacre, Inc., and their

respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, partners, agents,

legal counsel and accountants (each an "Indemnitee" and together the

"Indemnitees") to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law in affect

on the date hereof or as such laws may from time to time be amended from

and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses

(including attorneys' fees and expenses and any and all expenses whatsoever

incurred in investigating, preparing or defending any action, suit,

investigation or proceeding), and amounts paid in settlement (together,

"Losses") incurred by an Indemnitee if such Indemnitee is made a party or

is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed

action, suit, investigation or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,

administrative or investigative in nature, brought or to be brought in

connection with the Cuddy Litigation and arising from, caused by or in

connection with the negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of the

Purchase Agreement (including any other agreements entered 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 3

into in connection therewith), other than as a result of the breach by WLR

of any of the terms of the Purchase Agreement (or any other agreement

entered into by WLR in connection therewith).

Section 2. Indemnification for Costs, Charges and Expenses of

Successful Party. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement

and in addition to the rights to indemnification set forth in Section 1

hereof, to the extent that any Indemnitee has served as a witness on behalf

of the Company or has been successful on the merits or otherwise

(including, without limitation, obtaining the dismissal of an action

without prejudice), in defense of any action, suit, investigation or

proceeding referred to in Section 1 hereof, or in defense of any claim,

issue or matter therein, such Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all

Losses incurred by such Indemnitee or on behalf of such Indemnitee in

connection therewith.

Section 3. Partial Indemnification. In addition to the rights to

indemnification set forth in Sections 1 and 2 hereof, if any Indemnitee is

only partially successful in the defense, investigation, settlement or

appeal of any action, suit, investigation or proceeding described in

Section 1 or 2 hereof, and as a result is not entitled under Section 1 or 2

hereof to indemnification by the Company for all Losses incurred by such

Indemnitee, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee, as a

matter of right 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 4

pursuant to Section 2 hereof, to the extent that the Indemnitee has been

partially successful.

Section 4. Presumptions and Effect of Certain Proceedings. The

Secretary of the Company shall, promptly upon receipt of an Indemnitee's

request for indemnification, advise in writing the Board of Directors of

the Company that the Indemnitee has made such request for indemnification. 

Upon making such request for indemnification, the Indemnitee shall be

presumed to be entitled to indemnification hereunder and the Company shall

have the burden of proof in the making of any determination contrary to

such presumption. The termination of any action, suit, investigation or

proceeding described in Section 1 or 2 hereof by judgment, order,

settlement or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its

equivalent, shall not, of itself, adversely affect the rights of the

Indemnitee to indemnification.

Section 5. Advancement of Expenses and Costs. All expenses and

costs incurred by each Indemnitee as to which such Indemnitee may seek

indemnification or contribution hereunder (including attorneys' fees,

retainers and advances of disbursements required of the Indemnitee and any

and all expenses whatsoever incurred in investigating, preparing or

defending any action, suit, investigation or proceeding) shall be paid by

the Company in advance of this final disposition of any action, suit,

investigation or proceeding

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 5

at the request of the Indemnitee within 10 days after the receipt by the

Company of a statement or statements from the Indemnitee requesting such

reimbursement from time to time. The Indemnitee's entitlement to such

expenses and costs shall include those incurred in connection with any

proceeding by the Indemnitee seeking the enforcement of such Indemnitee's

rights under this Agreement. Such statement or statements shall reasonably

evidence the expenses and costs incurred by the Indemnitee in connection

therewith. An Indemnitee may be required by the Company to provide an

undertaking by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount on

condition that it is ultimately determined by a court (as provided in

Section 16) that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified against

such expenses and costs by the Company as provided by this Agreement or

otherwise.

Section 6. Remedies of Indemnitee in Cases of Failure to Indemnify

or to Advance Expenses. In the event that the Company fails to indemnify

the Indemnitee hereunder, or if expenses and costs are not timely advanced

pursuant to Section 5, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to a final

adjudication in a court (as provided in Section 16) of the Indemnitee's

entitlement to such indemnification or advance. The Company shall not

oppose the Indemnitee's right to seek any such adjudication or any other

claim. Such judicial proceeding or arbitration shall be made de novo and

the Indemnitee shall not be prejudiced by reason of a 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 6

determination (if so made) by the Company that the Indemnitee is not

entitled to indemnification or advancement of costs and expenses, or that

the Company has failed to indemnify the Indemnitee or to so advance costs

and expenses. The Company further agrees to stipulate in any such court

that the Company is bound by all the provisions of this Agreement and is

precluded from making any assertion to the contrary. If the court shall

determine that the Indemnitee is entitled to any indemnification hereunder,

the Company shall pay all expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs)

and costs actually incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with such

adjudication (including, but not limited to, any appellate proceedings).

Section 7. Other Rights to Indemnification. The indemnification and

advancement of costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs)

provided by this Agreement shall not be deemed exclusive of any other

rights to which any Indemnitee may now or in the future be entitled under

any provision of the charter documents or By-laws of Cuddy or CIC,

agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, provision of

law, or otherwise.

Section 8. Contribution. (a) In the event any Indemnitee is not

entitled to the indemnification provided for in this Agreement in respect

of any Losses solely as a result of the Indemnitee's conduct, then the

Company, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnitee, shall contribute to 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 7

the amount paid or payable by such Indemnitee as a result of such Losses as

between the Company on the one hand and each Indemnitee on the other, in

such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the

Company and of such Indemnitee in connection with the actions or inactions,

statements or omissions giving rise to such Losses as well as any other

relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the Company on

the one hand and of such Indemnitee on the other shall be determined by

reference to, among other things, whether any untrue statement of a

material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact

on which any of such Losses are based relates to information supplied by

such party, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to

information and obligation to correct or prevent such statement or

omission.

(b) The Company and the Indemnitees agree that it would not be just

and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 8 were determined by

pro-rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not

take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately

preceding subparagraph. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation

(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be

entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such

fraudulent misrepresentation.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 8

Section 9. Procedure. The Indemnitee shall give the Company prompt

notice of any claim made on the Indemnitee which relates to a matter

subject to indemnification under this Agreement. The failure of any

Indemnitee to provide such notice shall not relieve the Company from

liability pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent such failure had

a material adverse effect on the ability to defend such matter. The

Company shall have the right to settle such claim (subject to the consent

of the Indemnitee if the proposed settlement involves any action or

inaction by the Indemnitee, which consent will not be unreasonably

withheld) and to control the response thereto or the defense thereof in any

suit, action or proceeding arising therefrom. The Company shall advise the

Indemnitee within 10 days of receipt of notice of any claim whether it

elects to settle such claim, or control the response thereto or defense

thereof. If the Company does not timely advise the Indemnitee as provided

above, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to settle such claim, or control

the response thereto or defense thereof at the cost and expense of the

Company as herein provided. After consultation with the Indemnitee, the

Company shall employ competent counsel at the Company's expense in

connection with any such settlement or defense, and the Indemnitee shall be

entitled to participate in such defense. The Indemnitee shall cooperate

with all reasonable requests of the Company or counsel 

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 9

retained by the Company with respect to any such settlement or defense, and

the Company shall keep the Indemnitee informed of the progress of any such

settlement or defense and obtain the consent of the Indemnitee as

contemplated herein.

Section 10. Attorneys' Fees and Other Expenses To Enforce Agreement. 

In the event that an Indemnitee is subject to or intervenes in any

proceeding in which the validity or enforceability of this Agreement is at

issue or seeks an adjudication to enforce such Indemnitee's rights under,

or to recover damages for breach of, this Agreement, the Indemnitee, if

such Indemnitee substantially prevails in such action, shall be entitled to

recover from the Company and shall be indemnified by the Company against,

any actual expenses for attorneys' fees and disbursements reasonably

incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with such action.

Section 11. Release by Company. The Company hereby fully and

unconditionally releases and discharges all claims and causes of action

which it or its successors, or assigns ever had, now have, or hereafter may

have against the Indemnitees, in each case, past, present, or as they may

exist at any time after the date of this Agreement, and each person, if

any, who controls, controlled, or will control any of them within the

meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Section

The purchase price for the Cuddy assets is approximately $73.8 million and

includes a five-year non-competition agreement. WLR Foods will pay

$43 million in cash and issue common stock for the balance. The

transaction will be handled as a purchase of assets, and not as a pooling

of interest. The purchase price is subject to certain post-closing

adjustments which are not expected to be material.

In making the announcement, James L Keeler, president and chief executive

officer of WLR Foods, commented: "WLR Foods has been talking with Cuddy

about this acquisition for several years, and we are excited to have Cuddy

now join the WLR Foods family and our first-rate turkey division. The

board's decision to acquire Cuddy's food division is another example of its

commitment to building shareholder value through smart, friendly

acquisitions. We are most pleased to expand WLR Foods significantly,

especially in further processed foods, without expanding the industry's

capacity. With Cuddy, we will become the nation's second largest turkey

processor, supplying 11% of the American turkey market sales in the coming

year. Building value for WLR

Foods shareholders has been our top priority, and we expect a positive

impact on earnings per share even before improvements and economies of

scale from this acquisition are realized. WLR Foods will achieve a billion

dollars in sales in 1995, ahead of our projected management goals."

Following the acquisition, Cuddy is expected to own between nine and 10.5%

of WLR Foods outstanding common stock. According to terms of the

agreement, Cuddy's stock will be voted with recommendations of WLR Foods

board of directors for four years unless there is an earlier change of

control in WLR Foods. Peter Green, chief executive officer of Cuddy

International, will be named to the WLR Foods Board of Directors at the

closing of the acquisition, which is expected within 30 days.

Cuddy will retain its farm division, a major supplier of turkey eggs and

poults.

WLR Foods is a fully integrated provider of high quality turkey and chicken

products primarily under the Wampler-

[WLR FOODS, INC. LETTERHEAD]

July 28, 1994

Dear Fellow Shareholder:

We are very pleased to enclose your quarterly dividend check. If you
participate in our dividend reinvestment plan, you will receive your
activity statement within two weeks. But most importantly, I'm pleased to
enclose our announcement of the agreement to acquire Cuddy Farms, Inc. --
Food Division.

Cuddy's production numbers right now, when coupled with Wampler-Longacre,
Inc.'s, clearly make us second in the nation in the turkey industry without
changing market supply. Cuddy's product line is excellent, diversified and
further processed, exactly into the strategic direction WLR Foods is
headed. Close to us geographically, yet taking us into new market areas,
Cuddy will enable us to expand our entire distribution line.

Timing couldn't be better as we look forward to the Thanksgiving holiday
season with strong tom prices and quite adequate hen prices. We expect
this proposed merger to receive regulatory approval and to be completed by
late August. As turkey clearly becomes the meat of choice in the 1990s for
the American lifestyle and diet, Wampler-Longacre, with the new addition of
Cuddy Farms, will be even better positioned to meet customer needs.

On behalf of the Board of Directors, we appreciate your investment and
belief in WLR Foods and the promising future that each day becomes reality
at our company. Our commitment to enhance shareholder value continues day-
by-day, and we expect the market to reflect the success of our producers
and employees. Thank you for your continuing investment in WLR Foods.

Sincerely,

James L. Keeler
President and Chief Executive Officer
