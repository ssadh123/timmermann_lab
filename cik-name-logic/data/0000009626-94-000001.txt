THE BANK OF NEW YORK COMPANY, INC. REPORTS
------------------------------------------
RECORD FOURTH QUARTER AND FULL YEAR NET INCOME AND E.P.S.
---------------------------------------------------------

Fourth Quarter Net Income $157 Million; E.P.S. $1.53, up 42%
Full Year Net Income $559 Million; E.P.S. $5.44, up 36%

NEW YORK, N.Y., January 13, 1994 -- The Bank of New York Company, Inc. 
reported record fourth quarter net income of $157 million, which compares
with net income of $112 million in the fourth quarter of 1992. Fully
diluted earnings per share in the fourth quarter of 1993 were a record
$1.53 compared with $1.08 per share last year, an increase of 42%. 
Spreads widened, reflecting a continuing shift in asset mix toward higher
yielding loans and a lower level of nonperforming assets. Fee income was
strong, especially from credit cards and securities and other processing. 
A lower provision for loan losses and continued control of operating

<PAGE> 2.

expenses contributed to higher earnings. In addition, the acquisition of
62 branches from Barclays Bank of New York, N.A. (Barclays) in December,
1992, and improved performance at the 105-branch National Community Banks,
helped to increase earnings.
Net income for the full year 1993 was a record $559 million, a 42%
increase over the $393 million earned in 1992. Net income was a record
$5.44 per fully diluted share, a 36% increase over the $4.00 earned last
year. Net income for 1993 was affected by pre-tax restructuring charges
of $45 million ($30 million after-tax) recorded by National Community
Banks in the second quarter.
The Company's estimated Tier I capital and total capital ratios were 
8.77% and 13.51% at December 31, 1993 compared with 8.51% and 13.33% at
September 30, and 7.59% and 12.30% at December 31, 1992. Tangible common
equity as a percent of total assets was 7.00% at December 31, 1993
compared with 6.72% at September 30 and 5.83% one year ago. 
Return on average assets in the fourth quarter was 1.32% - a record
for the Company - compared with 1.28% in the third quarter of 1993 and
.94% in the fourth quarter of 1992. Return on average assets for the full
year 1993 was 1.20% - also a record for the Company - compared with .85%
for 1992.
Return on average common equity was 16.16% in the fourth quarter of
1993 compared with 15.95% in the third quarter and 12.52% in the fourth
quarter of 1992. Return on average common equity was 14.98% for the full
year compared with 12.00% for 1992.

million of nonperforming real estate loans were added. For the year,
nonperforming commercial real estate assets declined by $233 million or

The allowance for loan losses was $970 million, or 3.17% of loans 
at December 31, compared with $1,004 million, or 3.31% of loans at 
September 30, 1993. 

NET INTEREST INCOME
- -------------------
On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest income amounted to $392 
million in the fourth quarter of 1993, compared with $377 million in the
same period of 1992, an increase of 4%. The net interest rate spread was
3.12% in the fourth quarter of 1993 compared with 3.09% in the third
quarter and 2.95% one year ago. The net yield on interest earning assets
was 3.83% in the fourth quarter of 1993 compared with 3.81% in the third
quarter and 3.67% in the same period last year.
For the full year, net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis

<PAGE> 5.

was $1,550 million, compared with $1,434 million in the same period of
1992. The year to date net interest rate spread was 3.12% in 1993
compared with 2.91% in 1992, while the net yield on interest-earning
assets was 3.84% in 1993 and 3.61% in 1992.
There was continued strong performance in credit cards, as the number
of card accounts increased by 22% to 4.8 million and managed outstandings
were up by 19% to $6.2 billion from one year ago. The spread and yield
modestly benefitted from the start in November of the amortization phase
of the Company's credit card securitization. This phase will continue
through March 1995 and return $1.35 billion of credit card loans to the
balance sheet.

NONINTEREST INCOME
- ------------------
Noninterest income increased 6% to $307 million in the fourth
quarter, compared with $290 million in the same period last year. 
Noninterest income totaled $1,319 million in 1993, compared with $1,185
million in 1992, an increase of 11%. 
Trust, investment, and processing fees were $154 million for the
quarter, an $11 million, or 8% increase over the fourth quarter of last
year. The Barclays acquisition also contributed to the increase in
noninterest income. 
Securities gains and foreign exchange profits and trading activities
were $18 million in the fourth quarter of 1993 compared with $14 million
in the same period last year. For the full year, securities gains and
foreign exchange profits and trading activities were $143 million in 1993
and $136 million in 1992.

During the year, special strength was noted in institutional
investment management. Significant growth in the securities processing
area occurred in American depositary receipts, government securities
clearance, master trust, mutual fund custody, stock transfer, and
corporate trust. In other processing, there was strong performance in 
funds transfer. 

SERVICE CHARGES AND FEES
- ------------------------
Service charges and fees, excluding other processing fees, were $115
million in the fourth quarter of 1993, compared with $114 million in the 
fourth quarter of last year. In the fourth quarter, noninterest income
attributable to the Company's credit card securitization was $2 million
less than the comparable period of last year due in part to these assets
starting to return to the balance sheet. For the year, service charges
and fees, excluding other processing fees, were $460 million, compared
with $442 million in 1992. Strong growth in credit cards contributed to
the full year rise.

NONINTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME TAXES
- ------------------------------------
Total noninterest expense was $409 million and $1,646 million in the
fourth quarter and full year compared with $390 million and $1,519 million

<PAGE> 7.

in 1992. Other real estate expense decreased to $4 million from $21
million in the fourth quarter of 1992. 
Salaries increased 6% in the fourth quarter to $149 million from $140
million in the same period last year, and profit sharing increased to $16
million from $11 million. The Barclays acquisition contributed
significantly to the increase in these costs. Furniture and equipment
expenses and other employee benefits - primarily incentive compensation
and health care expenses - were unchanged from the fourth quarter of last
year. 
The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 1993 was 31.4%
compared with 32.1% for the fourth quarter of 1992. The effective rate
for the full year was 36.9% compared with 33.2% for the same period last
year.
