ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

On March 17, 1994, Allied Products Corporation ("Allied") entered into a
Credit Agreement and a Security Agreement with Continental Bank N.A.,
individually and as Agent ("Agent"), and LaSalle National Bank ("LaSalle")
(together the Agent and LaSalle are referred to as the "Lenders"). Pursuant
to the Credit Agreement, the Lenders provided a credit facility not to exceed
$50,000,000 consisting of a Revolving Loan facility of up to $35,000,000 and a
facility of up to $15,000,000 to support standby and commercial letters of
credit. The facility is evidenced by Revolving Notes in the principal amounts
of $35,000,000 and $15,000,000 issued by the Agent and LaSalle, respectively.
On December 31, 1994, the aggregate amount of the Revolving Loan facility
provided by the Lenders will be reduced to $25,000,000 (such reduction being
pro rata between the Lenders according to their respective loan percentages).
The proceeds of the loans will be used by Allied for working capital and other
general operating purposes.

Pursuant to the Security Agreement and in exchange for the loans, Allied
granted to the Lenders a first priority security interest in the inventory,
accounts receivable, and other collateral of Allied related thereto. The
security interest granted to the Lenders will terminate after September 30,
1994 if Allied meets certain income projections as provided in the Security
Agreement.

Simultaneously with the funding under the Credit Agreements, Allied used a
portion of the loan amount to prepay the balance of outstanding loans made to
Allied's operating subsidiaries, Bush Hog Corporation, Coz Corporation, and
Verson Corporation (collectively, the "Subsidiaries"). The lenders to each of
the Subsidiaries simultaneously released all of their security interests in
the assets of the Subsidiaries. The Subsidiaries were then dissolved pursuant
to Plans of Liquidation and Dissolution by which Allied assumed all of the
assets and all of the liabilities of each of the Subsidiaries, which shall
continue to operate as divisions of Allied.

At the closing for the Credit Agreement, Allied also received a Termination
and Release delivered by Continental Bank N.A., as Agent, terminating the
Amended and Restated Credit and Debt Restructuring Agreement dated as of
January 28, 1993 and releasing all security interests previously held by the
lenders thereunder.

Rate borrowing,

- 2 -

<PAGE>

and on a Business Day at least two Business Days prior to the proposed date of
such borrowing, in the case of a Eurodollar borrowing. Each such notice shall
be effective upon receipt by the Agent, shall be in writing (or by telephone to
be promptly confirmed in writing by the Company), and shall specify the date,
amount and type of borrowing and, in the case of a Eurodollar borrowing, the
initial Interest Period for such borrowing. Promptly, upon receipt of such
notice, but in any event by 12:30 P.M., the Agent shall advise each Bank
thereof. Not later than 2:00 P.M. Chicago time, on the date of the proposed
borrowing, each Bank shall provide the Agent at the principal office of the
Agent in Chicago with immediately available funds covering such Bank's
Percentage of the borrowing, and, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
precedent set forth in SECTION 11 with respect to such borrowing, the Agent
shall pay over the requested amount to the Company on the requested borrowing
date. Each borrowing shall be on a Business Day and shall be in an aggregate
amount of at least $500,000 and an integral multiple of $100,000.

(b) Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Bank prior to the
proposed date of any borrowing in the case of a Eurodollar borrowing, or prior
to 12:30 P.M., Chicago time, on the proposed date of any Floating Rate
borrowing, that such Bank will not make available to the Agent such Bank's
ratable portion of such borrowing, the Agent may assume that such Bank has made
such portion available to the Agent on the date of such borrowing in accordance
with SUBSECTION (a) above and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption,
make available to the Company on such date a corresponding amount. If and to
the extent such Bank shall not have so made such ratable portion available to
the Agent, such Bank and the Company severally agree to repay to the Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount together with interest thereon,
for each day from the date such amount is made available to the Company until
the date such amount is repaid to the Agent, (i) in the case of the Company, at
the interest rate applicable at the time to the Revolving Loans comprising such
borrowing and (ii) in the case of such Bank, at the Federal Funds Rate. If such
Bank shall repay to the Agent such corresponding amount, such amount so repaid
shall constitute such Bank's Revolving Loan as part of such borrowing for
purposes of this Agreement. Nothing in this SUBSECTION (b) shall be deemed to
diminish the Commitments of any Bank.

(c) The failure of any Bank to make the Revolving Loan to be made by it as
part of any borrowing shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligation
hereunder to make its Revolving Loan on the date of such borrowing, but no Bank
shall be responsible

- 3 -

<PAGE>

for the failure of any other Bank to make the Revolving Loan to be made by such
other Bank on the date of any borrowing.

SECTION 1.4 CONVERSION PROCEDURES. Subject to the provisions of SECTION
1.2, the Company may Convert all or any part of any outstanding Revolving Loan
into a Revolving Loan of a different type by giving notice to the Agent of such
Conversion by 11:00 A.M., Chicago time, on the proposed date of such Conversion,
in the case of Conversion into a Floating Rate Loan, and at least two Business
Days prior to the proposed date of such Conversion, in the case of Conversion
into a Eurodollar Loan. Each such notice shall be effective upon receipt by the
Agent, shall be in writing (or by telephone to be promptly confirmed in writing
by the Company), shall specify the date and amount of such Conversion, the
Revolving Loan or portion thereof to be so Converted, the type of Revolving Loan
to be Converted into and, in the case of a Conversion into a Eurodollar Loan,
the initial Interest Period. Promptly upon receipt of such notice the Agent
shall advise each Bank thereof. Subject to SECTIONS 1.12 and 1.13, such
Revolving Loan shall be so Converted on the requested date of Conversion. Each
Conversion shall be on a Business Day and shall be in an aggregate principal
amount of at least $500,000 and an integral multiple of $100,000.

SECTION 1.5 PRO RATA TREATMENT. All borrowings, Conversions and
repayments shall be effected so that after giving effect thereto all types and
Groups of Revolving Loans shall be pro rata among the Banks according to their
respective Percentages.

SECTION 1.6 LETTER OF CREDIT PROCEDURES. Provided that the conditions
in SECTION 11.2 are satisfied, the Company shall give notice to Continental of
the proposed issuance of each Letter of Credit on a Business Day which is at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the proposed date of issuance of such
Letter of Credit. Each such notice shall be accompanied by a Letter of Credit
Application, duly executed by the Company and in all respects satisfactory to
Continental, together with such other documentation as Continental may request
in support thereof, it being understood that each Letter of Credit Application
shall specify, among other things, the date on which the proposed Letter of
Credit is to be issued, the expiration date of such Letter of Credit (which
shall not extend beyond the earlier of (a) one year from the date of issuance of
the Letter of Credit or (b) the Revolving Termination Date) and whether such
Letter of Credit is to be transferable in whole or in part. Subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent set forth in SECTION 11 with respect to
the issuance of such Letter of Credit, Continental shall issue such Letter of
Credit on the requested issuance date.

<PAGE>

SECTION 1.7 PARTICIPATION IN LETTERS OF CREDIT. Concurrently with the
issuance of each Letter of Credit, (it being expressly understood that all
letter of credit obligations of the Company and Subsidiaries existing before the
Effective Date shall be deemed issued as of the Effective Date solely for
purposes of this SECTION 1.7) Continental shall notify each Bank of such
issuance and shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each other Bank,
and each other Bank shall be deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have
purchased and received from Continental, without recourse or warranty, an
undivided interest and participation, to the extent of such other Bank's
Percentage, in such Letter of Credit and the Company's reimbursement obligations
with respect thereto. For the purpose of this Agreement, the unparticipated
portion of each Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be Continental's
"participation" therein. Continental hereby agrees, upon request of any Bank,
to deliver to such Bank a list of outstanding Letters of Credit, copies of such
Letters of Credit, Letter of Credit Applications and related documentation as
such other Bank may from time to time reasonably request.

SECTION 1.8 REIMBURSEMENT OBLIGATIONS. The Company hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to reimburse Continental for each payment
or disbursement made by Continental under any Letter of Credit honoring any
demand for payment made by the beneficiary thereunder, on the date that such
payment or disbursement is made. Any amount not reimbursed on the date of such
payment or distribution shall bear interest from and including the date of such
payment or disbursement to but not including the date that Continental is
reimbursed by the Company therefor, payable monthly in arrears, at a rate per
annum equal to the Alternate Reference Rate from time to time in effect (but not
less than the Alternate Reference Rate in effect at the date of such payment or
disbursement by Continental) PLUS (x) 2% per annum. Continental shall notify
the Company whenever any demand for payment is made under any Letter of Credit
by the beneficiary thereunder; PROVIDED, however, that the failure of
Continental to so notify the Company shall not affect the rights of Continental
or the Banks in any manner whatsoever.

SECTION 1.9 LIMITATION ON CONTINENTAL'S OBLIGATIONS. In determining
whether to pay under any Letter of Credit, Continental shall have no obligation
to the Company or any Bank other than to confirm that any documents required to
be delivered under such Letter of Credit appear to have been delivered and that
they appear to comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of
Credit. Any action taken or omitted to be taken by Continental under or in
connection with any Letter of Credit, if taken or omitted in the absence of
gross negligence or willful misconduct, shall not impose upon Continental any
liability to

- 5 -

<PAGE>

the Company or any Bank and shall not reduce or impair the Company's
reimbursement obligations set forth in SECTION 1.8 or the funding obligations of
the Banks pursuant to SECTION 1.10.

SECTION 1.10 FUNDING BY BANKS TO CONTINENTAL. In the event that
Continental makes any payment or disbursement under any Letter of Credit and the
Company shall not have reimbursed Continental in full for such payment or
disbursement by 10:00 A.M., Chicago time, on the date of such payment or
disbursement, or in the event that any reimbursement received by Continental
from the Company is or must be returned or rescinded upon or during any
bankruptcy or reorganization or otherwise, each Bank shall be obligated to pay
to Continental, in full or partial payment of the purchase price of its
participation in such Letter of Credit, its pro rata share, according to its
Percentage, of such payment or disbursement (but such obligation of the Banks
shall not diminish the obligation of the Company under SECTION 1.8), and the
Agent shall promptly notify each other Bank thereof. Each other Bank
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to so pay to the Agent in immediately
available funds for Continental's account the amount of such other Bank's
Percentage of such payment or disbursement. If and to the extent any Bank shall
not have made such amount available to the Agent by 2:00 P.M., Chicago time, on
the Business Day on which such Bank receives notice from the Agent of such
payment or disbursement (it being understood that any such notice received after
noon, Chicago time, on any Business Day shall be deemed to have been received on
the next following Business Day), such Bank agrees to pay interest on such
amount to the Agent for Continental's account forthwith on demand for each day
from and including the date such amount was to have been delivered to the Agent
to but not including the date such amount is paid, at a rate per annum equal to
the Federal Funds Rate. Any Bank's failure to make available to the Agent its
Percentage of any such payment or disbursement shall not relieve any other Bank
of its obligation hereunder to make available to the Agent such other Bank's
Percentage of such payment, but no Bank shall be responsible for the failure of
any other Bank to make available to the Agent such other Bank's Percentage of
any such payment or disbursement.

SECTION 1.11 CASH COLLATERAL. If any Letter of Credit remains
outstanding on the Revolving Termination Date, the Company shall deposit with
the Agent, as security for all outstanding Letters of Credit and pursuant to
documentation in form and substance satisfactory to the Banks, cash collateral
in an amount equal to the Stated Amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit,
which cash collateral may be placed in an interest bearing account acceptable to
the Banks and the Company.

<PAGE>

SECTION 1.12 WARRANTY. Each notice of borrowing and/or of Conversion
pursuant to SECTION 1.3 or 1.4 and the delivery of each Letter of Credit
Application pursuant to SECTION 1.6 shall automatically constitute a warranty by
the Company to the Agent and each Bank to the effect that on the date of such
requested borrowing or Conversion (other than any Conversion from a Eurodollar
Loan to a Floating Rate Loan required by SECTION 1.13 or 8.3) or the issuance of
the requested Letter of Credit, as the case may be, (a) the warranties of the
Company contained in SECTION 9 of this Agreement shall be true and correct as of
such requested date as though made on the date thereof and (b) no Event of
Default or Unmatured Event of Default shall have then occurred and be continuing
or will result therefrom.

SECTION 1.13 CONDITIONS. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no Bank shall be obligated to make any Revolving Loan or to Convert
into or permit the continuation at the end of the applicable Interest Period of
any Eurodollar Loan, and Continental shall not be obligated to issue any Letter
of Credit, if an Event of Default or Unmatured Event of Default exists or would
result therefrom.

SECTION 2 NOTES EVIDENCING LOANS.

SECTION 2.1 REVOLVING NOTES. The Revolving Loans of each Bank shall be
evidenced by a promissory note (herein individually called a "Revolving Note"
and collectively for all Banks called the "Revolving Notes") substantially in
the form set forth in EXHIBIT C, with appropriate insertions, dated the
Effective Date payable to the order of such Bank in the principal amount of the
Revolving Loan Commitment of such Bank (or, if less, in the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of such Bank's Revolving Loans). Each Bank shall record in its
records, or at its option on the schedule attached to its Revolving Note, the
date and amount of each Revolving Loan made by such Bank, each repayment or
Conversion thereof and, in the case of each Eurodollar Loan the dates on which
each Interest Period for such Revolving Loan shall begin and end and, in the
event that any Bank assigns or transfers its Revolving Note, such Bank shall
record on the schedule attached to its Revolving Note, the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of Revolving Loans of such Bank on the date of such assignment
or transfer. The aggregate unpaid principal amount so recorded shall be
rebuttable presumptive evidence of the principal amount owing and unpaid on such
Revolving Note. The failure to so record any such amount or any error in so
recording any such amount shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the
obligations of the Company hereunder or under any Revolving Note to repay the
principal amount of the Revolving Loans evidenced by such Revolving Note
together with all interest accruing thereon.

SECTION 3. INTEREST.

SECTION 3.1 INTEREST RATES. The Company hereby promises to pay interest
on the unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan for the period commencing
on the date of such Revolving Loan until such Revolving Loan is paid in full, as
follows:

(a) At all times while such Revolving Loan is a Floating Rate Loan,
at a rate per annum equal to the Alternate Reference Rate from time to time
in effect;

(b) At all times while such Revolving Loan is a Eurodollar Loan, at a
rate per annum equal to the Eurodollar Rate (Reserve Adjusted) applicable
to each Interest Period for such loan plus the Margin; and

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding CLAUSES (a) and
(b), in the event that any principal of any Revolving Loan is not paid when
due (whether by acceleration or otherwise), interest shall accrue after the
due date of such principal until such principal is paid, at a rate per
annum equal to the applicable interest rate from time to time in effect
(but not less than the applicable interest rate in effect for such
Revolving Loan as at such due date), plus 2% per annum.

SECTION 3.2 INTEREST PAYMENT DATES. Accrued interest on each Floating
Rate Loan shall be payable on the last day of each calendar quarter and at
maturity, commencing with the first of such dates to occur after the date
hereof. Accrued interest on each Eurodollar Loan shall be payable on the last
day of each Interest Period relating to such Loan and at maturity. After
maturity, accrued interest on all Revolving Loans shall be payable on demand.

SECTION 3.3 INTEREST PERIODS. Each Interest Period for a Eurodollar
Loan shall commence on the date such Eurodollar Loan is made or Converted from a
Floating Rate Loan, or on the expiration of the immediately preceding Interest
Period for such Eurodollar Loan, and shall end on the date which is 1, 2 or 3
months thereafter, as the Company may specify:

(a) in the case of an Interest Period which commences on the date a
Eurodollar Loan is made or Converted from a Floating Rate Loan, in the
related notice of borrowing or Conversion pursuant to SECTION 1.3 or 1.4,
or

(b) in the case of a succeeding Interest Period with respect to any
Eurodollar Loan, by notice to the Agent by

11:00 A.M., Chicago time, at least two Business Days prior to the first day
of such succeeding Interest Period, it being understood that (i) each such
notice shall be effective upon receipt by the Agent and shall be in writing
(or by telephone to be promptly confirmed in writing) and (ii) if the
Company fails to give such notice, such Loan shall automatically become a
Floating Rate Loan at the end of its then-current Interest Period.

Each Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan which would otherwise end on a day
which is not a Business Day shall end on the next succeeding Business Day
(unless such next succeeding Business Day is the first Business Day of a
calendar month, in which case such Interest Period shall end on the next
preceding Business Day). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
the Company may not select any Interest Period that (i) extends beyond the
Revolving Termination Date or (ii) would result in the aggregate portion of the
Revolving Loans which have Interest Periods extending beyond December 31, 1994
to be in excess of the aggregate amount of such Revolving Commitments as
provided in SECTION 1.1.4.

SECTION 3.4 SETTING AND NOTICE OF EURODOLLAR RATES. The applicable
Eurodollar Rate for each Interest Period shall be determined by the Agent, and
notice thereof shall be given by the Agent promptly to the Company and each
Bank. Each determination of the applicable Eurodollar Rate by the Agent shall
be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto, in the absence of
demonstrable error. The Agent shall, upon written request of the Company or any
Bank, deliver to the Company or such Bank a statement showing the computations
used by the Agent in determining any applicable Eurodollar Rate hereunder.

SECTION 3.5 COMPUTATION OF INTEREST. Interest shall be computed for the
actual number of days elapsed on the basis of a year of 360 days. The
applicable interest rate under CLAUSES (a) and (c) of SECTION 3.1 shall (to the

true and lawful attorney (and agent-in-fact) to sign the name of the Company on

authorizes the Agent to charge any demand deposit account maintained by the
Company with Continental for the amount of any such payment on the due date
therefor, but the Agent's failure to so charge such account shall in no way
affect the obligation of the Company to make any such payment. The Agent shall
notify the Company after any charge is so made by the Agent against any demand
deposit account maintained by the Company with Continental; PROVIDED that the
failure of the Agent to so notify the Company shall not affect the rights of the
Agent or the Banks in any manner whatsoever. The Agent shall promptly remit to
each Bank or other holder of a Revolving Note its share of all such payments
received in collected funds by the Agent for the account of such Bank or holder.

All payments under SECTIONS 8.1 and 8.4 shall be made by the Company

payment.

SECTION 7.3 DUE DATE EXTENSION. If any payment of principal or interest
with respect to any of the Revolving Loans or the Notes falls due on a Saturday,
Sunday or other day which is not a Business Day, then such due date shall be
extended to the next following Business Day, and additional interest shall
accrue and be payable for the period of such extension.

SECTION 7.4 SETOFF. The Company agrees that the Agent and LaSalle, and
each remaining Bank and each remaining holder of a Revolving Note provided it
obtains the prior consent of the Agent (it being understood that LaSalle may
exercise the rights provided in this Section 7.4 without obtaining the prior
consent of the Agent), have all rights of setoff and bankers' lien provided by
applicable law, and in addition thereto, the Company agrees that at any time (i)
any payment or other amount owing by the Company under this Agreement is then
due to the Agent, LaSalle or any Bank or (ii) any Event of Default or event
which might mature into an Event of Default described in SECTION 12.1.4 exists,
the Agent, LaSalle, and each remaining Bank and each remaining holder of a
Revolving Note provided it obtains the prior consent of the Agent, may apply to
the payment of such payment or other amount (or, in the case of CLAUSE (ii)
above, any obligation of the Company hereunder, whether or not then due) any and
all balances, credits, deposits, accounts or moneys of the Company then or
thereafter with the Agent. The Agent, LaSalle and each remaining Bank shall
undertake to notify the Company following the exercise by the Agent, LaSalle and
each remaining Bank of any of the rights described in this SECTION 7.4; PROVIDED

Company shall not affect the rights of the Agent, LaSalle, the Banks, or the
holder of any Revolving Note in any manner whatsoever.

and interest on the Revolving Notes (or such participation) then held by them,
such Bank or other holder shall purchase from the other Banks or holders such

SECTION 8 INCREASED COSTS; SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR EURODOLLAR LOANS.

SECTION 8.1 INCREASED COSTS.

(a) If (i) Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System, or (ii) after the date hereof, the adoption of any applicable law, rule
or regulation, or any change therein, or any change in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority, central bank or comparable
agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance
by any Bank (or any Eurodollar Office of such Bank) with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such authority,
central bank or comparable agency

(A) shall subject any Bank (or any Eurodollar Office of such Bank) to
any tax, duty or other charge with respect to its Eurodollar Loans, any of
its Revolving Notes or its obligation to make Eurodollar Loans, or shall
change the basis of taxation of payments to any Bank of the principal of or
interest on its Eurodollar Loans or any other amounts due under this
Agreement in respect of its Eurodollar Loans or its obligation to make
Eurodollar Loans (except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net
income of such Bank or its Eurodollar Office imposed by the jurisdiction in
which such Bank's principal executive office or Eurodollar Office is
located); or

(B) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve (including,
without limitation, any reserve imposed by the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, but excluding any reserve included in the
determination of interest rates pursuant to SECTION 3), special deposit or
similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of,
or credit extended by, any Bank (or any Eurodollar Office of such Bank); or

(C) shall impose on any Bank (or its Eurodollar Office) any other
condition affecting its Eurodollar Loans, any of its Revolving Notes or its
obligation to make Eurodollar Loans;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to (or in the
case of Regulation D referred to above, to impose a cost on) such Bank (or any
Eurodollar Office of such Bank) of

- 16 -

<PAGE>

making or maintaining any Eurodollar Loan, or to reduce the amount of any sum
received or receivable by such Bank (or its Eurodollar Office) under this
Agreement or under any of its Revolving Notes with respect thereto, then within
10 days after demand by such Bank (which demand shall be accompanied by a
statement setting forth the basis of such demand), the Company shall pay
directly to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Bank for such increased cost or such reduction.

(b) If any Bank shall reasonably determine that the adoption or phase-in
of any applicable law, rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any
change therein, or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by
any governmental authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Bank (or its
Eurodollar Office) or any Person controlling such Bank with any request or
directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of
any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, has or would have the
effect of reducing the rate of return on such Bank's or such controlling
Person's capital as a consequence of such Bank's obligations hereunder
(including, without limitation, such Bank's Revolving Loan Commitment or Letter
of Credit Commitment) to a level below that which such Bank or such controlling
Person could have achieved but for such adoption, change or compliance (taking
into consideration such Bank's or such controlling Person's policies with
respect to capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Bank or such
controlling Person to be material, then from time to time, within 10 days after
demand by such Bank (which demand shall be accompanied by a statement setting
forth the basis of such demand), the Company shall pay to such Bank such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank or such controlling
Person for such reduction.

(c) Each Bank will promptly notify the Company and the Agent of any event
of which it has knowledge which will entitle such Bank to compensation pursuant
to this SECTION 8.1.

SECTION 8.2 BASIS FOR DETERMINING INTEREST RATE INADEQUATE OR UNFAIR.
If with respect to any Interest Period:

(a) deposits in Dollars (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered
to one or more Banks in the relevant market for such Interest Period, or the
Agent otherwise determines (which determination shall be binding and conclusive
on all parties) that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank
eurodollar market adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining
the applicable Eurodollar Rate; or

- 17 -

<PAGE>

(b) Banks having an aggregate Percentage of 20% or more advise the Agent
that the Eurodollar Rate (Reserve Adjusted) as determined by the Agent will not
adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Banks of maintaining or funding
Eurodollar Loans for such Interest Period, or that the making or funding of
Eurodollar Loans has become impracticable as a result of an event occurring
after the date of this Agreement which in the opinion of such Banks materially
affects such Loans, THEN the Agent shall promptly notify the other parties
thereof and, so long as such circumstances shall continue, (i) no Bank shall be
under any obligation to make or Convert into Eurodollar Loans and (ii) on the
last day of the current Interest Period for each Eurodollar Loan, such Loan
shall, unless then repaid in full, automatically Convert to a Floating Rate
Loan.

SECTION 8.3 CHANGES IN LAW RENDERING CERTAIN LOANS UNLAWFUL. In the
event that any change in (including the adoption of any new) applicable laws or
regulations, or any change in the interpretation of applicable laws or
regulations by any governmental or other regulatory body charged with the
administration thereof, should make it (or in the good faith judgment of any
Bank raise a substantial question as to whether it is) unlawful for any Bank (an
"Affected Bank") to make, maintain or fund Eurodollar Loans, then the Affected
Bank shall promptly notify each of the other parties hereto and, so long as such
circumstances shall continue, (a) the Affected Bank shall have no obligation to
make or Convert into Eurodollar Loans (but shall make Floating Rate Loans
concurrently with the making of or Conversion into Eurodollar Loans by the Banks
which are not Affected Banks, in each case in an amount equal to the Affected
Bank's Percentage of all Eurodollar Loans which would be made or Converted into
at such time in the absence of such circumstances) and (b) on the last day of
the current Interest Period for each Eurodollar Loan (or, in any event, if the
Affected Bank so requests, on such earlier date as may be required by the
relevant law, regulation or interpretation), such Eurodollar Loan shall, unless
then repaid in full, automatically Convert to a Floating Rate Loan. Each
Floating Rate Loan made by an Affected Bank which, but for the circumstances
described in the foregoing sentence, would be a Eurodollar Loan (an "Affected
Loan") shall, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, remain
outstanding for the same period as the Group of Eurodollar Loans of which such
Affected Loan would be a part absent such circumstances.

SECTION 8.4 FUNDING LOSSES. The Company hereby agrees that upon demand
by any Bank (which demand shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth the
basis for the calculations of the amount being claimed) the Company will
indemnify such Bank against any net loss or expense which such Bank may sustain
or

- 18 -

<PAGE>

incur (including, without limitation, any net loss or expense incurred by reason
of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other funds acquired by such
Bank to fund or maintain Eurodollar Loans), as reasonably determined by such
Bank, as a result of (a) any payment or prepayment or Conversion of any
Eurodollar Loan of such Bank on a date other than the last day of an Interest
Period for such Loan (including, without limitation, any Conversion pursuant to
SECTION 8.3) or (b) any failure of the Company to borrow or Convert any Loans on
a date specified therefor in a notice of borrowing or Conversion pursuant to
this Agreement. For this purpose, all notices to the Agent pursuant to this
Agreement shall be deemed to be irrevocable.

SECTION 8.5 RIGHT OF BANKS TO FUND THROUGH OTHER OFFICES. Each Bank
may, if it so elects, fulfill its commitment as to any Eurodollar Loan by
causing a foreign branch or Affiliate of such Bank to make such Loan, PROVIDED
that in such event for the purposes of this Agreement such Loan shall be deemed
to have been made by such Bank and the obligation of the Company to repay such
Loan shall nevertheless be to such Bank and shall be deemed held by it, to the
extent of such Loan, for the account of such branch or Affiliate.

SECTION 8.6 DISCRETION OF BANKS AS TO MANNER OF FUNDING.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each Bank shall
be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of its Revolving
Loans in any manner it sees fit, it being understood, however, that for the
purposes of this Agreement all determinations hereunder shall be made as if such
Bank had actually funded and maintained each Eurodollar Loan during each
Interest Period for such Loan through the purchase of deposits having a maturity
corresponding to such Interest Period and bearing an interest rate equal to the
Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period.

SECTION 8.7 CONCLUSIVENESS OF STATEMENTS; SURVIVAL OF PROVISIONS.
Determinations and statements of any Bank pursuant to SECTION 8.1, 8.2, 8.3 or
8.4 shall be conclusive absent demonstrable error. Banks may use reasonable
averaging and attribution methods in determining compensation under SECTIONS 8.1
and 8.4, and the provisions of such Sections shall survive termination of this
Agreement.

the Agent nor any of its directors, officers, employees or agents shall (i) be

agency hereby created shall in no way impair or affect any of the rights and
powers of, or impose any duties or obligations upon, Continental in its
individual capacity.

SECTION14.4 CREDIT INVESTIGATION. Each Bank acknowledges that it has
made such inquiries and taken such care on its own behalf as would have been the
case had such Bank's Commitments been granted, the Letters of Credit issued and
such Bank's Revolving Loans been made directly by such Bank to the Company
without the intervention of the Agent or any other Bank. Each Bank agrees and
acknowledges that the Agent makes no representations or warranties about the
credit worthiness of the Company or any other party to this Agreement or with
respect to the legality, validity, sufficiency or enforceability of this
Agreement, any Revolving Note, any Letter of Credit Application or the value of
any security therefor.

SECTION 14.5 AGENT AND AFFILIATES. The Agent shall have the same rights
and powers hereunder as any other Bank and may exercise or refrain from
exercising the same as though it were not the Agent, and the Agent and its
Affiliates may accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business
with the Company or any Subsidiary as if the Agent were not the Agent hereunder.

SECTION 14.6 RESIGNATION. The Agent may resign as such at any time upon
at least 30 days' prior notice to the Company and the Banks. In the event of
any such resignation, the Banks shall as promptly as practicable appoint a
successor Agent. If no successor shall have been so appointed, and shall have
accepted such appointment, within 30 days after the giving of notice of such
resignation, then the retiring Agent may, on behalf of the Banks, appoint a
successor Agent, which shall be a commercial bank organized under the laws of
the United States of America having a combined capital, surplus and undivided
profits of at least $400,000,000. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as
Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such successor Agent shall thereupon
succeed to and become vested with all rights, powers, privileges and duties of
the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from all further
duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any resignation pursuant to
this SECTION 14.6, the provisions of this SECTION 14 shall inure to the benefit
of the retiring Agent as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while
it was Agent hereunder.

evidencing such Revolving Loan; or

Agent QUA the Agent shall be made without consent of the Agent.

No failure or delay on the part of the Agent, any Bank or the holder of any
Revolving Note in exercising any power or right under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such power or right preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other power or right. No notice to or
demand on the Company in any case shall entitle it to any notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances. No waiver or approval by the Agent, any Bank or
the holder of any Revolving Note under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
shall, except as may be otherwise stated in such waiver or approval, be
applicable to subsequent transactions. No waiver or approval hereunder shall
require any similar or dissimilar waiver or approval thereafter to be granted
hereunder.

Debtor of its obligations hereunder are within the Debtor's corporate powers,
have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action, have received all

by-laws of the Debtor or of any agreement, instrument or order binding upon the

the Debtor, enforceable in accordance with its terms; and (xi) the Debtor is in
compliance in all material respects with the requirements of all applicable
laws, rules, regulations and orders of every governmental authority.

SECTION 4 PROCESSING, SALE, COLLECTIONS, ETC. Until such time as a
Default shall have occurred and remained continuing and the Agent shall have
notified the Debtor of the revocation of such power and authority, the Debtor
may, in the ordinary course of its business, at its own expense, sell, lease or
furnish under contracts of service any of the Inventory normally held by the
Debtor for such purpose, and use and consume, in the ordinary course of its
business, any raw materials, work in process or materials normally held by the
Debtor for such purpose.

Upon the request of the Agent at any time a Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Debtor will (except as the Agent may otherwise consent in
writing) forthwith, upon receipt, transmit and deliver to the Agent, in the form
received, all cash, checks, drafts, chattel paper and other instruments or
writings for the payment of money (properly endorsed, where required, so that
such items may be collected by the Agent) which may be received by the Debtor at
any time in full or partial payment or otherwise as proceeds of any of the
Collateral. Except as the Agent may otherwise consent in writing, any such
items which may received by the Debtor after such request by the Agent will not
be commingled with any of its funds or property, but will be held separately and
apart from its own funds or property and upon express trust for the Agent until
delivery is made to the Agent. The Debtor will comply with the terms and
conditions of any consent given by the Agent pursuant to the provisions of this
paragraph.

If and to the extent that a perfected security interest hereunder in any
Collateral shall cease to be perfected due to the sale of Inventory or release
of all or any balance of the Assignee Deposit Account or use or disposition by
the Debtor of any proceeds of Collateral, then such Collateral (referred to in
this paragraph "released Collateral") shall be deemed thereby released from the
security interest hereunder in exchange, as of

- 4 -

<PAGE>

the time of such release, for any other Collateral of equivalent value in which
a first perfected security interest hereunder is being obtained
contemporaneously or has most recently obtained, but only to the extent such
other Collateral does not represent either (x) Collateral in exchange for which
any previously released Collateral shall have been deemed released or (y)
Collateral of equivalent value to any loan or advance (otherwise than by renewal
of extension) from any Bank to the Debtor in which Collateral a first perfected
security interest hereunder shall have been obtained contemporaneously with or
most recently prior to such loan or advance.

So long as any Default has occurred and is continuing, the Agent is
authorized to endorse, in the name of the Debtor, any item, howsoever received
by the Agent, representing any payment on or other proceeds on the Collateral.

SECTION 5. CERTIFICATES, SCHEDULES AND REPORTS. The Debtor will from time
to time, as the Agent may reasonably request, deliver to the Agent a schedule
identifying each Account Receivable (not previously so identified) subject to
the security interest hereunder, and such additional schedules and such
certificates and reports with respect to all or any of the Collateral at the
time subject to the security interest hereunder, and the items or amounts
received by the Debtor in full or partial payment or otherwise as proceeds of
any of the Collateral, all to such extent as the Agent may reasonably request.
Any such schedule, certificate or report shall be executed by a duly authorized
officer of the Debtor and shall be in such form and detail as the Agent may
reasonably specify. Any such schedule identifying any Account Receivable
subject to the security interest hereunder shall be accompanied (if the Agent so
requests) by a true and correct copy of the invoice evidencing such Account
Receivable and by evidence of shipment or performance. The Debtor shall
immediately notify the Agent of the occurrence of any event causing any loss or
depreciation in the value of the Inventory and such notice shall specify the
amount of such loss or depreciation.

SECTION 6. AGREEMENTS OF THE DEBTOR. The Debtor will (i) upon reasonable
request of the Agent, execute such Uniform Commercial Code financing statements
and other documents (including, without limitation, any assignment of claim form
under or pursuant to the federal assignment of claims statute, 31 U.S.C.
Section 3726, any successor or amended version thereof or any regulation promul-
gated under or pursuant to any version thereof), and pay the cost of filing or
recording the same or this Security Agreement in all public offices deemed
necessary or appropriate by the Agent and do such other acts and things
(including, without limitation, delivery to the Agent of any Instruments

- 5 -

<PAGE>

which constitute Collateral), all as the Agent may from time to time reasonably
request to establish and maintain a valid, first perfected security interest in
the Collateral (free of all other liens, claims and rights of third parties
whatsoever other than Permitted Liens) to secure the performance and payment of
the Liabilities; (ii) keep all the Inventory, unless the Agent shall otherwise
consent in writing, at its own premises at address(es) shown on SCHEDULE I
hereto; (iii) furnish the Agent such information concerning the Debtor, the
Collateral and the Account Debtors as the Agent may from time to time reasonably
request; (iv) permit the Agent and its designees, from time to time during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to inspect Debtor's Inventory,
and to inspect, audit and make copies of and extracts from all records and all
other papers in the possession of the Debtor, and will, upon request of the
Agent at any time when a Default has occurred and is continuing, deliver to the
Agent all of such records and papers which pertain to the Collateral and the
Account Debtors; (v) except for the sale or lease of Inventory in the ordinary
course of its business and the creation or existence of Permitted Liens, not
sell, lease, assign or create or permit to exist any lien on or security
interest in any Collateral to or in favor of anyone other than the Agent;
(vi) at all times keep all the Inventory insured under policies maintained with
reputable insurance companies against loss, damage, theft and other risks to
such extent as is customarily maintained by companies similarly situated (and,
in any event, as required by applicable law), and cause all such policies to
provide that loss thereunder shall be payable to the Agent as its interest may
appear (it being understood that (A) so long as no Default shall be existing,
the Agent shall deliver any proceeds of such insurance which may be received by
it to the Debtor and (B) whenever a Default shall be existing, the Agent may
apply any proceeds of such insurance which may be received by it toward payment
of the Liabilities, whether or not due, as set forth in SECTION 8) and such
policies or certificates thereof shall, if the Agent so requests, be deposited
with or furnished to the Agent; (vii) take such actions as are reasonably
necessary to keep its Inventory in good repair and condition; (viii) promptly
pay when due all license fees, registration fees, taxes, assessments and other
charges which may be levied upon or assessed against the ownership, operation,
possession, maintenance or use of the Inventory (as applicable); provided,

a failure to exercise reasonable care in the custody or preservation of such

provision of this Security Agreement shall be effective unless the same shall be
