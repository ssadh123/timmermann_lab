Item 5. Other Events

After the November 20, 1994 announcement by Kemper Corporation (the
"Company") that its merger agreement with Conseco, Inc. had been terminated
by mutual consent of the parties, Standard & Poor's Corporation ("Standard
& Poor's") and Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co. ("Duff & Phelps") revised
their ratings of the Company and its life insurance subsidiaries.

On November 21, 1994, Standard & Poor's revised its senior debt and
preferred stock ratings of the Company from "CreditWatch with 'negative'
implications" to "CreditWatch with 'developing' implications." On December
1, 1994, Duff & Phelps changed its rating of the Company's senior debt
securities and the claims-paying ability ratings of the Company's life
insurance subsidiaries from "Rating Watch - Down" to "Rating Watch -
Uncertain."

Also, on November 30, 1994, Moody's Investors Service indicated that it
continues to review for possible downgrade the senior debt and preferred
stock ratings of the Company and the financial strength ratings of the
Company's life insurance subsidiaries.
