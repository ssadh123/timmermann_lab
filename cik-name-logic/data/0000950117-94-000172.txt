FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

THE COOPER COMPANIES IS SENTENCED IN CONNECTION
WITH HIGH-YIELD BOND "FRONTRUNNING" ARRANGEMENT
INVOLVING A FORMER OFFICER

FORT LEE, NEW JERSEY, JULY 15, 1994 . . . The Cooper Companies,
Inc. (NYSE:COO) was sentenced today in connection with a high-
yield bond "frontrunning" scheme involving Gary A. Singer, a
former Co-Chairman of the Company. United States District Judge
Robert J. Ward, who presided over the trial of Gary Singer and
the Company in New York, sentenced the Company to pay, over a
period of three years, a non-interest bearing fine of $1,831,568. 
In addition, the Company was ordered to make restitution in the
amount of $1,310,166 within the next 30 days. Singer's
sentencing will occur at a later date.

Singer and the Company were indicted in November 1992 in
connection with a "frontrunning" arrangement involving the
purchase and sale of high yield bonds by Gary Singer. On January
13, 1994, Singer was found guilty on twenty-one counts, including
RICO, money laundering, and mail and wire fraud. Singer, who had
been on a leave of absence since May 1992, resigned from all of
his positions with the Company on January 20, 1994. Based upon
Singer's criminal acts, Cooper was found guilty of seven counts
of mail and wire fraud. The Company was acquitted of two other
counts.

Page Two

At the time of its indictment, the Company also was charged in
a civil enforcement action by the Securities and Exchange
Commission in connection with the "frontrunning" arrangement, the
alleged manipulation of the price of the Company's 10-5/8%
Convertible Subordinated Reset Debentures due 2005 to avoid an
interest-rate reset and other matters. The Company and the
Enforcement staff of the Commission have negotiated a settlement
of that action, and the staff has informed the Company that it
will recommend approval of the settlement by the Commission. The
principal terms of the settlement involve the Company's agreement
to permanent injunctions against violation of certain provisions
of the federal securities laws and against employment of any
members of the Singer family, the disgorgement of $1,621,474
(including $1,310,166 in disgorgement to the mutual funds that
lost profits due to the "frontrunning" arrangements) and the
payment of a civil penalty in the amount of $1,150,000. The
settlement agreement provides that the "frontrunning"
disgorgement and the penalty (but not disgorgement of $311,308
relating to the interest rate reset issue) are to be reduced by
the amounts of the restitution and fine, respectively, ordered to
be paid in the criminal case. Accordingly, the Company's payment
of the restitution and fine imposed at the sentencing today will
satisfy all but $311,308 of the Company's monetary obligations
under the proposed settlement with the SEC.

NOTE TO THE EDITOR: The principal subsidiaries of The Cooper
Companies, Inc. are CooperVision, Inc., CooperVision
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CooperSurgical, Inc. and Hospital Group of
America, Inc.

<PAGE>
INCORPORATION OF CERTAIN DOCUMENTS BY REFERENCE

A copy of any or all of the documents incorporated in the
Prospectus by reference (other than exhibits unless such exhibits
are specifically incorporated by reference in any such document)
will be provided without charge to any person, including a
beneficial owner, to whom a copy of the Prospectus and this
Supplement is delivered, upon written or oral request. Requests

number: (201) 585-5100).

THE COMPANY

The information under "The Company" on page 3 of the
Prospectus is supplemented by the following: "The principal
executive offices of the Company are located at 1 Bridge Plaza,
Fort Lee, New Jersey 07024, and its telephone number is (201)
585-5100."

SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS

The information under "Significant Investment Considerations
- - - Diversification" and "- Investment Company Act of 1940" on page
4 of the Prospectus is no longer applicable. 

HISTORY OF LOSSES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

The information under "- History of Losses and Financial
Condition," commencing on page 3 of the Prospectus, is
supplemented as follows:

"The Company has experienced substantial losses from
continuing operations in each of the fiscal years ended October
31, 1988 through 1993. During the six months ended April 30,
1994, the Company experienced a net loss of $9,000,000, which
resulted in the Company's stockholders' equity moving into a
deficit position. A large portion of such $9,000,000 reflects
legal fees and other costs related to the Company's criminal
trial and SEC action (see "- Indictment and SEC Complaint" in
this Supplement). That loss, together with costs associated with
the Company's exchange offer and consent solicitation, completed
in January 1994, resulted in a decrease of $7,595,000 in the
Company's cash, cash equivalents and temporary investments during
the first six months of fiscal 1994. In connection with the
exchange offer and consent solicitation, the Company (i) issued
approximately $22,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 10%
Senior Subordinated Secured Notes due 2003 (the "Notes") and paid
approximately $4,350,000 in cash in exchange for approximately
$30,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 10-5/8% Convertible
Subordinated Reset Debentures due 2005 (the "Debentures"), (ii)
amended the indenture governing the Debentures (the "Indenture")
to, among other things, (a) eliminate a covenant (with which the
Company was not in compliance) requiring the Company to
repurchase Debentures and (b) reduce the conversion price at
which holders may convert Debentures into Common Stock from
$27.45 to $5.00 per share, and (iii) obtained a waiver of any and
all Defaults and Events of Default (as such terms are defined in
the Indenture) that occurred or may have occurred prior to the
expiration of the exchange offer at 5:00 p.m., Eastern Standard
Time, on January 6, 1994.

"The Company currently anticipates that, at least during the
remainder of fiscal 1994, it is likely to continue to experience
net cash outflows, primarily as a result of continued legal and
other costs associated with pending litigation, payments required
by the Company's settlement of liabilities relating to breast
implants, as discussed under "- Litigation" in this Supplement,
penalties imposed upon the Company, as discussed under "-Indictment
and SEC Complaint" in this Supplement, and research and
2
<PAGE>
development costs of CooperVision Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
("CVP"). As a result, the Company needs to raise funds through
borrowings or other financings or sales of assets.

"The Independent Auditors' report on the Company's
consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year
ended October 31, 1993, contained in the Company's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 1993 (the
"1993 Annual Report"), contains the following statement:

"The accompanying financial statements have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. 
During the past three fiscal years, the Company has suffered
significant losses and negative cash flows. In addition, as 
discussed in Note 18 to the financial statements the Company
is exposed to contingent liabilities related to a criminal
conviction and a Securities and Exchange Commission action. 
Such losses, negative cash flows, and contingent liabilities
raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedules do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these
uncertainties." 

"In light of the foregoing, there is no assurance that the
Company will not face severe liquidity problems or that the
Company could not be forced in the future to seek protection
under the Bankruptcy Code. The Company is currently exploring
numerous alternatives for raising cash, including sales and
leasebacks, debt financing, factoring and out-licensing rights to
Verapamil, outside of North America. (Verapamil, which is
presently undergoing Phase III testing with the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, is CVP's compound patented for the treatment
of ocular hypertension and other symptoms of glaucoma.) There
can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in
raising adequate cash through these activities.

"See Item 2 "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Capital Resources
& Liquidity" in Part I of the Company's Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q for the fiscal quarter and six months ended April 30, 1994
(the "1994 Second Quarter Report"), which document is
incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement of
which the Prospectus is a part."

LITIGATION

The information under "- Litigation," commencing on page 5
of the Prospectus, is supplemented as follows:

"On September 28, 1993, the Company reached an agreement
(the "MEC Agreement") with MEC and BMS which limited the
Company's liability for breast implant litigation. Pursuant to
the MEC Agreement, MEC agreed, subject to limited exceptions, to
take responsibility for substantially all of the breast implant
liability, and the Company agreed to pay MEC an aggregate amount
of between $12,000,000 and $30,000,000 over ten years, the actual
amount to be determined by the Company's net income before taxes
in each of the years 1999 through 2003. In October 1993 the
Company made an initial payment of $3,000,000 to MEC. See Note
14 for a discussion of the schedule of payments to be made to
MEC, and Note 18 for a description of the breast implant
liability and the MEC Agreement, of Item 8 "Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements" in the 1993 Annual Report.

"For information with respect to other litigation, see "-Indictment
and SEC Complaint" in this Supplement and Item 3
"Legal Proceedings" in the 1993 Annual Report and Item 1 "Legal
Proceedings in the 1994 Second Quarter Report, Part II, which
documents are incorporated by reference into the Registration
Statement of which the Prospectus is a part."

<PAGE>
INDICTMENT AND SEC COMPLAINT

The information under "- Indictment and SEC Complaint,"
commencing on page 6 of the Prospectus, is supplemented as
follows:

"On January 13, 1994, the Company was found guilty on six
counts of mail fraud and one count of wire fraud in connection
with the "front-running" scheme, based upon Gary Singer's
conduct, but acquitted of charges of conspiracy and aiding and
abetting violations of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, as
amended. Mr. Singer was found guilty on 21 counts. One count
against Mr. Singer and the Company was dismissed at trial, and
two counts against Mr. Singer relating to forfeiture penalties
were resolved by stipulation between the government and Mr.
Singer. Mr. Singer, who had been on a leave of absence since May
1992, resigned from all of his positions with the Company on
January 20, 1994. The Company was sentenced on July 15, 1994, at
which time it was ordered to make restitution to Keystone in the
amount of $1,310,166 within 30 days and to pay a non-interest-
bearing fine over the next three years in the amount of
$1,831,568.

"On July 15, 1994, the Company announced that it had
completed negotiating an agreement with the SEC settling the SEC
civil enforcement action in connection with the "front-running"
arrangement, the alleged manipulation of the price of the
Company's 10-5/8% Convertible Subordinated Reset Debentures due
2005 to avoid an interest-rate reset and other matters, and that
the staff of the SEC intends to recommend to the SEC that it
approve the settlement. The principal terms of the agreement
involve the Company's agreement to permanent injunctions against
violations of the antifraud, periodic reporting and certain other
provisions of the federal securities laws and from employing any
members of the Singer family, the disgorgement of $1,621,474
(consisting of $1,310,166 to Keystone and $311,308 relating to
the interest rate reset issue) and the Company's payment of a
civil penalty in the amount of $1,150,000. The agreement
provides, however, that the amount of disgorgement will be
reduced by any restitution paid, and the amount of the penalty
will be reduced by the amount of any fine imposed, in the
criminal case. As a result of such offsets, the Company will be
required to pay a penalty of $311,308 to the SEC upon approval of
the settlement agreement.

"See "- History of Losses and Financial Condition" in this
Supplement for information with respect to the possible effect of
such sentence and settlement on the financial condition of the
Company."

MANAGEMENT

The information under "- Management" on page 7 of the
Prospectus is supplemented as follows:

"Gary Singer, who had been on a leave of absence since May
1992, resigned from all of his positions with the Company on
January 20, 1994. Steven Singer, an Executive Vice President and
Chief Operating Officer of the Company, has been on a leave of
absence since March 29, 1994. He and the Company are negotiating
the terms of his termination agreement. Joseph C. Feghali,
Steven Singer's father-in-law, will not stand for reelection as a
director at the Company's 1994 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to
be held on September 13, 1994. See "- Indictment and SEC
Complaint" in this Supplement. On May 23, 1994, the Company's
Board of Directors promoted A. Thomas Bender, President of the
Company's CooperVision subsidiary and previously Senior Vice
President, Operations of the Company, to the positions of
Executive Vice President and Acting Chief Operating Officer of
the Company, and elected Mr. Bender a director to fill the
vacancy created by the resignation from the Board of Robert S.
Weiss, who remains the Company's Senior Vice President, Treasurer
and Chief Financial Officer. On July 7, 1994, Allan E. Rubenstein,
who had served as Acting Chairman of the Board since April 14,
4
<PAGE>
1993, was elected Chairman of the Board. Dr. Rubenstein and directors
Mark A. Filler and Mel Schnell currently comprise the Management
Committee of the Board, which oversees the management and
direction of the Company's businesses. For information on the
Selling Stockholder's designation of certain persons to the Board
of Directors of the Company, including Mr. Schnell, see "The
Selling Stockholder" in this Supplement."

THE SELLING STOCKHOLDER

The information under "The Selling Stockholder," commencing
on page 5 of the Prospectus, is supplemented as follows:

"On June 14, 1993, the Company acquired from CLS all of the
Company's then outstanding Senior Exchangeable Redeemable
Preferred Stock, together with all rights to any dividends or
distributions thereon, in exchange (the 'Exchange') for 345
shares of a newly created series of preferred stock of the
Company designated Series B Preferred Stock (the 'Series B
Preferred Stock'), having a par value of $.10 per share and a
liquidation preference of $10,000 per share (an aggregate of
$3,450,000). Shares of Series B Preferred Stock are convertible,
at the option of CLS, into one share of Common Stock for each
$1.00 of liquidation preference of such Series B Preferred Stock
(subject to customary antidilution adjustments). The Company has
the right to compel conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock at
any time after (a) the average of the closing sale prices for the
common stock on its principal trading market on the trading days
during any period of 90 consecutive calendar days is at least
$1.375 and (b) on at least 80% of the trading days during such
period the closing sale price is at least $1.375. The Company
has entered into a registration rights agreement providing for
the registration under the Securities Act of the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series B Preferred Stock.

"The Company also entered into a Settlement Agreement, dated
June 14, 1993 (the 'Settlement Agreement'), to resolve all
disputes with CLS, pursuant to which, among other things, CLS
agreed to certain restrictions on its voting and transfer of
securities of the Company, and the Company agreed to nominate and
use its reasonable best efforts to cause, and CLS agreed to vote
all shares of Common Stock owned by it in favor of, the election
of a Board of Directors of the Company consisting of eight
members, five of whom are to be designated by the Company and
three (who are reasonably acceptable to the Company) are to be
designated by CLS. Pursuant to such agreement, three members of
the Board (Messrs. Donald Press, Steven Rosenberg, Vice President
and Chief Financial Officer of CLS, and Mel Schnell, President
and a Director of CLS) have been designated by CLS. The number
of CLS designees will decline to two if CLS owns less than
5,400,000 shares of Common Stock and to one if CLS owns less than
2,400,000 (but at least 1,000,000) shares of Common Stock
(treating as owned for this purpose any shares of Common Stock
into which Series B Preferred Stock owned by CLS is convertible),
subject to CLS's right to designate additional directors if the
term of the agreement is extended under certain circumstances. 
For a detailed description of the Exchange, the Settlement
Agreement and the Series B Preferred Stock, see Notes 8 and 15 of
Item 8 "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" in the 1993
Annual Report, which document is incorporated by reference into
the Registration Statement of which the Prospectus is a part."

MANAGEMENT CHANGES

The information under "Management Changes," commencing on
page 9 of the Prospectus, is no longer applicable. See the
Company's Proxy Statement, dated August 12, 1993, relating to the
1993 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which document is
incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement of
which the Prospectus is a part, and "Significant Investment
Considerations - Management" and "The Selling Stockholder" in
this Supplement.

<PAGE>
EXPERTS

The information under "Experts" on page 10 of the Prospectus
is supplemented as follows:

"The consolidated financial statements and schedules of the
Company as of October 31, 1993 and October 31, 1992 and for each
of the years in the three year period ended October 31, 1993 have
been incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement of
which the Prospectus is a part in reliance upon the report of
KPMG Peat Marwick, independent certified public accountants,
incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement of
which the Prospectus is a part, and upon the authority of said
firm as experts in accounting and auditing.

"The report of KPMG Peat Marwick covering the October 31,
1993 consolidated financial statements and schedules of the
Company contains an explanatory paragraph stating that the
Company's significant losses, negative cash flows and, as
discussed in Note 18 to the financial statements, exposure to
contingent liabilities related to a criminal conviction and SEC
action raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial
statements and financial statement schedules do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of these
uncertainties. See "Significant Investment Considerations -
History of Losses and Financial Condition", "- Litigation" and "-
Indictment and SEC Complaint" in this Supplement for a further
description of these matters."
