ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On June 30, 1994, Charter Medical Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of 18
psychiatric hospitals, seven chemical-dependency treatment facilities, one
residential treatment facility and one physician outpatient practice (the
"Selected Psychiatric Hospitals") from National Medical Enterprises, Inc., a
Nevada corporation ("NME"). The Company presently intends to use or operate the
assets acquired from NME for the purposes NME operated such assets. The purchase
price for the assets was approximately $88.7 million in cash, plus $2 million in
cash for a covenant not to complete, plus an additional amount of cash equal to
the net working capital of the facilities acquired, amounting to approximately
$38.4 million. The amount paid for the net working capital of the facilities
acquired is subject to adjustment. In addition, the Company assumed certain
liabilities related to the acquired assets. The purchase price for the
facilities acquired was determined by NME following its solicitation of bids for
the facilities and arm's-length negotiations with the Company. NME and the
Company are not related to each other.

Approximately $98.5 million of the purchase price of the facilities acquired
was financed by the Company from the proceeds of the Company's issuance on May
2, 1994, of $375 million aggregate principal amount of 11 1/4% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2004 (the "Senior Subordinated Notes"). Approximately
$11.1 of the purchase price was financed by the Company from borrowings pursuant
to the Second Amended and Restated Subsidiary Credit Agreement, dated May 2,
1994, among certain subsidiaries of the Company, Bankers Trust Company, as
Agent, First Union National Bank of North Carolina, as Co-Agent, and the
financial institutions participating therein. The remaining approximately $19.5
million of the purchase price was provided by cash on hand.

Independent Auditors' Report

The Boards of Directors
National Medical Enterprises, Inc. and
Charter Medical Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying combined balance sheets of the Selected
Psychiatric Hospitals of National Medical Enterprises, Inc. (the "Selected
Psychiatric Hospitals") as of May 31, 1994 and 1993, and the related combined
statements of operations, owners' equity and cash flows for each of the years in
the three-year period ended May 31, 1994. These combined financial statements
are the responsibility of the management of National Medical Enterprises, Inc.
("NME"). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these combined financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As discussed in Note 9 to the combined financial statements, NME and certain
of its subsidiaries at May 31, 1993 were engaged in various lawsuits and were
the subject of governmental investigations concerning possible improper
practices, some of which may have involved practices at certain of the Selected
Psychiatric Hospitals. Subsequent to May 31, 1993, the majority of these
lawsuits were settled, and on June 29, 1994, NME entered into a settlement
agreement with certain Federal government agencies which finalized all of its
open investigations of NME. While NME agreed to pay substantial amounts as part
of these settlements and agreements, no settlement amounts have been
specifically attributed to individual facilities.

In our opinion, the combined financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial position of Selected
Psychiatric Hospitals of National Medical Enterprises, Inc. as of May 31, 1994
and 1993 and the results of their combined operations and their cash flows for
each of the years in the three-year period ended May 31, 1994 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
MAY 31, 1992, 1993 AND 1994

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The combined financial statements have been prepared in connection with the
acquisition by certain subsidiaries of Charter Medical Corporation (Charter) of
substantially all of the assets of the 18 psychiatric hospitals, seven
chemical-dependency treatment facilities, one residential treatment center and
one physician outpatient practice, including related outpatient facilities and
other associated assets, (collectively the "Selected Psychiatric Hospitals")
from various subsidiaries of National Medical Enterprises, Inc. ("NME"), which
transaction is described in more detail in Note 10.

The combined financial statements present the historical combined financial
position and results of operations of the Selected Psychiatric Hospitals and, as
a result, include certain assets and liabilities of the Selected Psychiatric
Hospitals that Charter will not acquire or assume as part of the transaction
described in Note 10.

One of the Selected Psychiatric Hospitals is owned and operated by a
partnership in which NME currently owns a controlling interest. It is
anticipated that NME's interest in this partnership will be transferred as part
of the transaction described in Note 10. This Selected Psychiatric Hospital has
been consolidated in the financial statements with the respective minority
interest being recorded. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions
between the Selected Psychiatric Hospitals have been eliminated.

NET OPERATING REVENUES

Net operating revenues consist primarily of net patient service revenues
which are based on the hospitals' established billing rates less allowances and
discounts principally for patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid and other
contractual programs. These allowances and discounts were $174,617,000 in 1992,
$147,925,000 in 1993 and $171,346,000 in 1994. Payments under these programs are
based on either predetermined rates or the costs of services. Settlements for
retrospectively determined rates are estimated in the period in which the
related services are rendered and are adjusted in future periods as final
settlements are determined. Management believes that adequate provision has been
made for adjustments that may result from final determination of amounts earned
under these programs. Such amounts, however, are necessarily based upon
estimates and the amounts ultimately realized may vary substantially from these
estimates. Approximately 15%, 26% and 35% of net operating revenues in 1992,
1993 and 1994 respectively is from the participation of the Selected Psychiatric
Hospitals in Medicare and Medicaid programs.

The Selected Psychiatric Hospitals provide care without charge or at amounts
substantially less than their established rates to patients who meet certain
financial or economic criteria. Because the Selected Psychiatric Hospitals do
not pursue collection of amounts determined to qualify as charity care, they are
not reported as gross revenue and are not included in deductions from revenue or
in operating and administrative expenses.

Bad debt expense for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable, net of
recoveries, is included in operating and administrative expenses and was
$20,798,000 in 1992, $12,881,000 in 1993, and $14,677,000 in 1994.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, net of accumulated
depreciation. The Selected Psychiatric Hospitals principally use the
straight-line method of depreciation for buildings, improvements and equipment
over their estimated useful lives as follows: buildings and improvements --
generally 20 to 50 years; equipment -- 3 to 15 years.

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
MAY 31, 1992, 1993 AND 1994

1. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Preopening costs are generally amortized over 3 to 5 years. Costs in excess
of the fair value of identifiable net assets of purchased businesses are
generally amortized over 40 years. The straight-line method is used to amortize
most intangible assets. During 1994 the remaining preopening costs and other
intangible assets net of accumulated amortization were written off as part of
the provision for loss on sale of Selected Psychiatric Hospitals.

CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Selected Psychiatric Hospitals treat highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents.

INCOME TAXES

The operations of the Selected Psychiatric Hospitals are included in the NME
consolidated Federal income tax return and in various unitary and consolidated
State income tax returns. NME charges or credits the Selected Psychiatric
Hospitals for amounts from applicable separate State income tax returns, if any,
and allocates to such hospitals a charge or credit for current and deferred
income tax expense attributable to consolidated and unitary Federal and State
income taxes. These allocations approximate income tax expense which would be
calculated on a stand alone basis. Such allocations are recorded as Due to
Owners and Affiliates.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences of
the Selected Psychiatric Hospitals are recorded on the books of an affiliate.

2. DISCLOSURE ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The carrying amount of cash, cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts
payable, interest payable and due to owners and affiliates approximates fair
value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The fair value of the
Selected Psychiatric Hospitals' long-term debt, (1) calculated by discounting
scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using estimated market
discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the
loans, or (2) based on current rates available for debt of the same remaining
maturities available to NME, also approximates carrying value.

3. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT
Property, plant and equipment consist of the following at May 31, 1993 (in
thousands):

down the carrying value of the assets by approximately $94,000,000 to the amount
of the expected sales proceeds and has classified the property, plant and
equipment as current assets held for sale. See further discussion in Note 10. No
depreciation on property, plant and equipment has been recorded subsequent to
November 30, 1993, the date the selected facilities were determined to be held
for sale.

4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Certain Selected Psychiatric Hospitals participate in the NME cash
management program which requires that cash deposits be transferred to
NME-controlled bank accounts. In this system, generally all cash accounts are
zero-balance accounts. Increases and decreases in the NME due to/from owners and
affiliates account are principally a function of cash flow and accrued interest
(10% in 1992, 1993 and 1994) and noncash entries for certain overhead and
expense transfers. Intercompany charges reflected in the combined financial
statements are summarized as follows (in thousands):

Total interest expense was calculated monthly at a rate of 10% on due
to/from owners and affiliates account balances for the years ended May 31, 1992,
1993 and 1994.

Salaries, general and administrative expenses include gross insurance
premiums paid to Health Facilities Insurance Corporation, Ltd. (HFIC), a wholly
owned subsidiary of NME, for professional and other insurance coverage. NME also
provides certain management and administrative services to the Selected
Psychiatric Hospitals for which it charges a fee. Each of the Selected
Psychiatric Hospitals is allocated a portion of the fee based on a specified
percentage of gross revenues earned, which is included in salaries, general and
administrative expenses in the accompanying combined statements of operations.

During the fiscal year ended May 31, 1994, capital contributions totalling
approximately $117 million were made to the Selected Psychiatric Hospitals by
decreasing the amount due to owners and affiliates.

provisions, this standard requires deferred

tax balances to be determined using enacted tax rates for the years in which the
taxes will actually be paid or refunds received. At May 31, 1993, deferred tax
accounts recorded by an affiliate applicable to the Selected Psychiatric
Hospitals' timing differences reflect the statutory rates that were in effect
when the deferrals were initiated. Upon adoption, such deferred tax accounts
applicable to the temporary differences of Selected Psychiatric Hospitals were
adjusted and the affiliate recognized an income tax benefit on account of the
change of method. Selected Psychiatric Hospitals continue to receive an
allocation of current and deferred income tax expense, modified to reflect the
principles contained in SFAS 109.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities relating to the assets and liabilities
of the Selected Psychiatric Hospitals are recorded on the books of an affiliate.
As of June 1, 1993 and May 31, 1994, these amounts were as follows (in

9. OTHER CONTINGENCIES

UNUSUAL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Beginning in its fiscal year ending May 31, 1992, NME became involved in
significant legal proceedings and investigations of an unusual nature related
principally to its psychiatric business which are further described below. At
May 31, 1993, neither the ultimate disposition of the unusual lawsuits,
investigations and claims nor the amount of liabilities or losses arising from
them could be determined. Furthermore, at May 31, 1993, NME expected to incur
substantial legal charges until these matters could be disposed of, for which
NME established a reserve at the parent Company level of the Selected
Psychiatric Hospitals.

1. INSURANCE LITIGATION -- Beginning in July, 1992, various insurance
companies filed three lawsuits against NME and certain of its subsidiaries
alleging that NME's psychiatric hospitals engaged in certain fraudulent
practices. The suits did not allege a specific dollar amount of damages, but
sought the return of alleged overpayments, punitive and treble damages, and
attorney fees. NME settled these lawsuits in November, 1993 and February, 1994
and paid an aggregate of approximately $215,000,000. In return, the insurers
agreed, on an individual basis, to resume standard business relations with NME.

2. INVESTIGATIONS -- During the fiscal year ending May 31, 1993, NME
became aware that certain government agencies were investigating whether some of
NME's psychiatric facilities engaged in improper practices. The Federal
Government was seeking documents by subpoena from certain facilities, hospitals
and regional offices and interviewing and seeking testimony from present and
former employees. In addition, on August 26, 1993, the Psychiatric Division's
headquarters in Santa Monica, California, the Psychiatric Division's regional
offices in Dallas, Texas and Fairfax, Virginia and nine psychiatric facilities
unexpectedly were served with search warrants, issued by the Department of
Justice, for various categories of documents.

On June 29, 1994, NME entered into a settlement with various federal
agencies which became effective on July 12, 1994 when it was approved by a
federal judge. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, NME agreed to pay
approximately $362,700,000 to conclude the federal investigations. In addition,
NME reached agreements-in-principle with 27 states and the District of Columbia
to pay an additional $16,300,000 to resolve their potential claims related to
certain of its psychiatric hospitals.

3. SHAREHOLDERS' LAWSUITS -- In October and November, 1991, shareholder
derivative actions and federal class actions were filed against NME. The
derivative action was dismissed by the court in May, 1993, but the dismissal is
being appealed by the plaintiffs. On December 20, 1993, shareholders' lawsuits
were consolidated into one action. The federal class action alleges violations
of the Federal Securities law against NME and certain of its executive officers.
The factual allegations underlying these suits are similar to those allegations
referred to above. Through a mediation process, the parties to both lawsuits
have reached an agreement-in-principle for the settlement of these lawsuits,
including contributions to the settlement by certain insurance companies.

4. PSYCHIATRIC MALPRACTICE CASES INVOLVING FRAUD AND CONSPIRACY
CLAIMS -- In addition, NME and certain of its officers and directors are
defendants in a number of lawsuits filed on behalf of patients making various
claims including conspiracy, false imprisonment, fraud and gross negligence. NME
has now settled approximately two-thirds of these lawsuits for $20,500,000.

The aggregate amount of the reserves recorded by NME in connection with
these settlements and agreements as of May 31, 1994 amounted to approximately
$740,000,000 including $65,000,000 which was accrued as of May 31, 1993 for an
estimate of the costs of defending itself through the trial phase

9. OTHER CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)
of the cases listed above. These settlements and agreements were reached in the
aggregate and were not allocated or apportioned to individual facilities, and
management believes that any allocation to facilities would be arbitrary and
therefore inappropriate. Accordingly, none of these reserves have been reflected
in the accompanying combined financial statements, nor has any provision or any
liability resulting from the ultimate disposition of these matters been
recognized in such financial statements.

10. DISPOSAL OF PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES
On November 30, 1993, NME adopted a plan to discontinue its psychiatric
business and dispose of substantially all of its psychiatric hospitals and
substance abuse facilities. Accordingly, the Selected Psychiatric Hospitals
included in these financial statements have been written down by approximately
$94,000,000 to their estimated realizable value as of November 30, 1993.

NME entered into two separate Asset Sale Agreements, each dated as of March
29, 1994, to sell 47 psychiatric hospitals to certain subsidiaries of Charter
for approximately $147 million. One Asset Sale Agreement ("First Facilities
Agreement") provides for the sale of 30 facilities for an approximate sales
price of $92 million in cash, plus $2 million in cash for a covenant not to
compete, plus an additional amount of cash equal to certain components of net
working capital of the facilities. The second Asset Sale Agreement ("Subsequent
Facilities Agreement") provides for the sale of 17 facilities for an approximate
sales price of $55 million in cash, plus $1 million in cash for a covenant not
to compete, plus an additional amount of cash equal to certain components of net
working capital of the facilities. NME and Charter received a request for
additional information related to the sale from the Federal Trade Commission
("FTC") in connection with obtaining approval pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Anti-Trust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. The FTC issued approval on June
24, 1994 to the sale of those 30 facilities covered by the First Facilities
Agreement. The facilities covered by the Subsequent Facilities Agreement are
still subject to the FTC's request for additional information, which is being
responded to by NME and Charter.

On June 30, 1994, NME closed the sale of 27 Selected Psychiatric Hospitals
of the 30 facilities covered by the First Facilities Agreement for an
approximate aggregate purchase price of $88 million plus $2 million for a
covenant not to compete plus an additional amount for certain components of net
working capital. The remaining 3 facilities covered by the First Facilities
Agreement are expected to be closed in the near future. Based on discussions
with the FTC, NME believes that the FTC will not approve the sale of 5
facilities (including a residential treatment center that is leased to a third
party) out of the 17 facilities covered by the Subsequent Facilities Agreement.
The aggregate purchase price for substantially all of the assets (excluding
working capital) of the 42 facilities Charter expects to acquire is
approximately $132 million. No specific date has been set to close these sales
or the sale of the remaining 3 facilities covered by the First Facilities
Agreement, except that all closings under the sales agreements must occur prior
to September 30, 1994, unless mutually extended under certain conditions.

(b) Pro Forma Financial Information

The Company entered into two separate Asset Sale Agreements with NME, each
dated March 29, 1994, providing for the purchase of substantially all of the
assets of 36 psychiatric hospitals, eight chemical-dependency treatment
facilities, two residential treatment centers and one physician outpatient
practice. On June 30, 1994, the Company purchased 27 of the facilities covered
by the Asset Sale Agreements from NME. The Company believes that it will not
obtain a regulatory approval required for it to acquire five of the facilities
(including a residential treatment center that is leased to a third party). The
facilities acquired on June 30, 1994, along with the 15 facilities the Company
expects to acquire from NME are referred to as the "Target Hospitals."

The unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for
the year ended September 30, 1993, and the nine months ended June 30, 1994, and
the unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30,
1994, set forth below, have been prepared by combining the Company's audited
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended September 30, 1993 with
the Target Hospitals' unaudited combined condensed statement of operations for
the twelve months ended August 31, 1993; combining the Company's unaudited
condensed consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended June
30, 1994 with the Target Hospitals' unaudited combined condensed statement of
operations for the nine months ended May 31, 1994; combining the Company's
unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 1994 with the
assets and liabilities of the remaining 15 Target Hospitals; and giving effect
to the issuance of the Senior Subordinated Notes, the borrowings pursuant to its
amended and restated credit agreements with a group of financial institutions
(the "New Credit Agreement"), the application of the proceeds thereof to the
repayment of certain debt and to finance the acquisition of the Target Hospitals
(the "Financing Transactions") and the payment of the estimated related
expenses.

The unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for
the year ended September 30, 1993, and the nine months ended June 30, 1994, were
prepared as if the Financing Transactions had occurred on October 1, 1992 and
1993, respectively. The unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet
as of June 30, 1994, was prepared giving effect to the Financing Transactions,
to the extent of the acquisition of 27 Target Hospitals on such date, and the
assumption of certain debt of such Target Hospitals and as if the acquisition of
the remaining Target Hospitals and related borrowings had occurred on such date.

For purposes of presenting pro forma results, no changes in revenues and
expenses have been made to reflect the result of any modification to operations
that might have been made had the Financing Transactions been consummated on the
assumed effective dates of such transactions. The pro forma expenses include the
recurring costs which are directly attributable to such transactions, such as
interest expense, and the related tax effects. The pro forma financial
information does not purport to be indicative of the results which would
actually have been attained had such transactions been completed as of the date
and for the periods presented or which may be attained in the future.

(e) To eliminate intercompany management fees and corporate overhead allocated

(f) To remove the historical depreciation and amortization of the Target
Hospitals and record depreciation expense on buildings and equipment
purchased and amortization expense related to intangibles as follows:

Pro forma depreciation and amortization are less than historical Target
Hospital amounts for the year ended September 30, 1993 because the values
assigned to property, plant and equipment and intangibles are less than the
historical values.

Pro forma depreciation and amortization exceed historical Target Hospital
amounts for the nine months ended June 30, 1994 because depreciation and
amortization had not been recorded since November 30, 1993 due to NME's

(k) Loss per common share for the nine months ended June 30, 1994 was calculated
by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding during the period. Common equivalent shares would have been
antidilutive and were therefore not included in the calculation of loss per
common share. Pro forma earnings per common share and common equivalent
share were calculated by dividing net income by the total weighted average
common shares outstanding during the period (26,225,316) increased by the
number of shares issuable on the exercise of options and warrants
outstanding, reduced by the number of common shares that are assumed to have
been purchased with the proceeds from the exercise of the options and
warrants (1,052,443). Those purchases were assumed to have been made at the
average price of the common stock during the period. Pro forma earnings per
common share assuming full dilution were calculated in the same manner.
However, purchases assumed in the computation of pro forma earnings per
common share assuming full dilution were computed using the common stock
price at the end of the period, which was higher than the average price. The
net increase resulting from the exercise of options and warrants outstanding
would have been 1,062,739.
