REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

Board of Directors
Del Monte Corporation

We have audited the accompanying Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net
Assets of the Del Monte Corporation Can Manufacturing Operations (an
operation of Del Monte Corporation) as Constituted for Sale to Silgan
Containers Corporation, as of June 30, 1993, and the Schedule of Sales and
Cost of Sales for the year then ended. This financial statement and
schedule are the responsibility of Del Monte Corporation's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Statement of Assets,
Liabilities and Net Assets and the Schedule of Sales and Cost of Sales are
free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statement and schedule. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the presentation of the overall financial statement and
schedule. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

The Del Monte Corporation Can Manufacturing Operations is an operation of
Del Monte Corporation and has no separate legal status or existence.

In our opinion, the Statement of Assets, Liabilities and Net Assets and the
Schedule of Sales and Cost of Sales referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Del Monte Corporation
Can Manufacturing Operations as Constituted for Sale to Silgan Containers
Corporation at June 30, 1993 and the sales and cost of sales for the year
then ended in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENT AND SCHEDULE
JUNE 30, 1993
(Dollars in Thousands)

NOTE A - BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The financial statement and schedule of Del Monte Corporation Can
Manufacturing Operations as Constituted for Sale to Silgan Containers
Corporation have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles. The financial statement includes the assets to be
purchased and certain related liabilities which are to be assumed of DMC's
can manufacturing operations ("Can Man") pursuant to the Purchase Agreement
(the "Agreement") dated September 3, 1993, as amended by the Amendment to
the Purchase Agreement dated December 10, 1993, between Del Monte
Corporation ("DMC") and Silgan Containers Corporation ("Silgan"). Can Man,
comprising DMC's metal food and beverage container manufacturing
operations, has no separate legal status or existence.

Substantially all of the metal containers produced by Can Man are used by
DMC in its canning business. DMC has accounted for Can Man as a cost
center. Due to DMC's highly-integrated operations, interest, general and
administrative costs, including income taxes, have never been allocated to
Can Man and no allocation of these costs has been made in the financial
statement or schedule. As a cost center, the transfer of metal containers
to DMC canneries has not resulted in the exchange of cash, and as a result,
no statement of cash flows is presented.

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Inventories: Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market
utilizing the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. For purposes of the
purchase price determination, inventories will be valued utilizing the LIFO
method, however there will be no adjustments for a LIFO reserve.

Property, Plant and Equipment: Property, plant and equipment is stated at
cost. Significant expenditures that increase useful lives are capitalized.
Maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred.

Depreciation is calculated by the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the respective assets. The principal estimated useful
lives are: land improvements - 10 to 30 years; buildings and leasehold
improvements - 4 to 25 years; machinery and equipment - 3 to 15 years.

JUNE 30, 1993
(Dollars in Thousands)

NOTE B - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Sales: Due to DMC's highly-integrated operations, no intercompany sale is
recorded when metal containers manufactured by Can Man are transferred into
the canning process. Since virtually all of DMC's metal containers have
been supplied from its can manufacturing facilities, and since sales of
unpacked metal containers to third parties have been minimal, DMC cannot
reasonably estimate an arms-length market price for Can Man's metal
containers. Therefore, sales in the Schedule of Sales and Cost of Sales
are presented on the basis of cost and may not be indicative of market
price.

Cost of sales: Cost of sales represents fully absorbed manufacturing costs
directly related to the manufacturing of metal containers.

Interest and other general and administrative expenses: DMC does not
allocate corporate interest or general and administrative expenses to its
facilities. Accordingly, no such expenses are reflected in the Schedule of
Sales and Cost of Sales.

The financial statement and schedule of Del Monte Corporation Can

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NARRATIVE DISCLOSURE
(REFLECTING THE ACQUISITION OF THE DEL MONTE CORPORATION
CAN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS)

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The pro forma adjustments reflect the acquisition of the Del Monte
Corporation Can Manufacturing Operations ("DM Can") by Silgan Containers
Corporation an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Silgan Holdings Inc.
("Silgan") which occurred on December 21, 1993. The acquisition will be
accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the total
purchase cost will be allocated first to the tangible and identifiable
intangible assets and liabilities of DM Can acquired and assumed based upon
their respective fair values as determined from preliminary appraisals and
valuations, and the remainder, if any, will be allocated to the excess of
cost over fair value of assets acquired. The aggregate purchase cost and
its preliminary allocation to the assets and liabilities are as follows:

(Dollars in

amounts at September 30, 1993 $ 58,481

SILGAN HOLDINGS INC.
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(REFLECTING THE ACQUISITION OF THE DEL MONTE CORPORATION
CAN MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS)

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

The pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and upon
certain assumptions that Silgan believes are reasonable. The final
purchase price allocation may differ from that shown above, although it is
not expected that the final allocation of purchase price will differ
materially. The pro forma financial data do not purport to be indicative
of Silgan's financial position or results that would actually have been
obtained had such transactions been completed as of the date or for the
periods presented, or to project Silgan's financial position or results of
operations at any future date or for any future period.

DISCUSSION OF CASH FLOWS

Because substantially all of the metal containers produced by DM Can were
used by Del Monte Corporation ("DMC") in its canning business, DMC
accounted for DM Can as a cost center. As a cost center, the transfer of
metal containers to DMC canneries did not result in the exchange of cash,
and as a result, no statement of cash flows is presented.

For the year ended December 31, 1992 and the nine months ended September
30, 1993 Silgan generated cash from operations of $15.4 million and $0.7
million, respectively. On a pro forma basis after giving effect to the DM
Can acquisition, cash provided from operations would have been
approximately $30 million for the year ended December 31, 1992 and $11
million for the nine months ended September 30, 1993.

Because Silgan sells metal containers used in food processing, its sales
are seasonal. As a result, a significant portion of Silgan's revenues will
be generated during the first nine months of the year. As is common in the
packaging industry, Silgan must build inventory and carry accounts
receivable beyond the end of the season. Due to these seasonal
requirements, Silgan expects to incur short term indebtedness to finance
its working capital requirements, and it is estimated that approximately
$40 million will be drawn from the working capital revolver at its peak in
July 1994.

<PAGE>

SILGAN HOLDINGS INC.
UNAUDITED PRO FORMA FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)
(REFLECTING THE ACQUISITION OF THE DEL MONTE CORPORATION

DISCUSSION OF CASH FLOWS (continued)

As a result of the seasonal nature of its business, during the three month
periods ended December 31, 1992 and 1993 Silgan generated cash from
operations of approximately $49 million and $46 million, respectively.

In addition to its operating cash needs after giving effect to the DM Can
acquisition, Silgan's cash requirements for 1994 and 1995 are expected to
consist primarily of annual capital expenditures of $27 million to $32
million (approximately $13 million of which is nondiscretionary in each
year) and principal amortization payments of term loans under the Credit
Agreement of $20 million in both 1994 and 1995.
