On December 17, 1993, it was discovered that, following the
formation of the Lincoln Telecommunications Company (the "Company") in
late 1980 and the reorganization of The Lincoln Telephone and Telegraph
Company ("LT&T"), effective February 23, 1981, at which time the common
stock of LT&T became wholly-owned by the Company (as described in a Form
S-14 Registration Statement filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on November 25, 1980, File No. 2-70020), LT&T inadvertently
failed to continue to file reports required under Section 13(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") despite
having a class of Preferred Stock with over 500 holders of record. The
last such report which LT&T filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission was its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 1980. On December 22, 1993, the Company notified the Securities and
Exchange Commission in writing of this omission and on January 21, 1994,
LT&T filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 1992 and all Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for fiscal year
1993. All holders of LT&T Preferred Stock have received Quarterly and
Annual Reports from the Company commencing with the Company's first
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 1981.

Section 21(a)(3) of the Exchange Act provides that if a
violation of the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder
occurs, the Securities and Exchange Commission may bring an action in a
United States district court to seek the imposition of a civil penalty of
up to $50,000 per violation, or, under certain circumstances, a civil
penalty of up to $250,000 per violation. Further, if such violation
directly or indirectly resulted in substantial losses or created a
significant risk of substantial losses to other persons, such a civil
penalty could be up to $500,000 for each violation.

The Company has no reason to believe that any person, directly
or indirectly, incurred substantial losses or was exposed to a significant
risk of substantial losses as a result of the omissions described above. 
Further, the Company does not believe that such omissions were under
circumstances which would warrant imposition of a civil penalty of up to
$250,000 per violation. The Securities and Exchange Commission has not,
to date, expressed a position to the Company or to LT&T with respect to
this matter.
