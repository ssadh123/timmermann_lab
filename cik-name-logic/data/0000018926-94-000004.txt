CENTURY TELEPHONE ENTERPRISES, INC. REPORTS
INCREASES IN FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS

Monroe, LA. . . . Century Telephone Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE Symbol:
CTL) reports increases in first quarter 1994 revenues, net income and
earnings per share as compared with the first quarter of 1993.
During the first quarter, consolidated revenues increased 24.9% to
$120,980,000 from $96,825,000 a year ago. Net income was up 22.0% to
$19,201,000 from $15,740,000 in the first quarter of 1993. Fully
diluted earnings per share increased to 35 cents per share compared
with 31 cents per share a year ago, a 12.9% increase on 5.5% additional
shares.
"First quarter increases are a result of the continued strength of
our telephone operations and improvements in cellular revenues and
operating efficiency," said Glen F. Post, III, President and Chief
Executive Officer.
Telephone revenues for the first quarter of 1994 increased 16.2% to
$91,770,000 from $78,951,000 a year ago, while operating income was up
19.7% to $30,890,000 from $25,800,000. Of the increases in revenue and
operating income, $5,453,000 and $1,751,000, respectively, resulted
from the acquisition of San Marcos Telephone Company in April, 1993.
Mobile communications revenues grew 63.4% to $29,210,000 from
$17,874,000 during the first quarter of 1993. Mobile communications
operating income increased 102.5% to $4,996,000 from $2,467,000 a year
ago.
"Growth in the number of cellular subscribers remained strong during
the first quarter of 1994 with additions exceeding the first quarter of
1993 by 88.5%," Post said. "In the first quarter we added 15,303 net
new customers, excluding the customer base added as a result of an
acquisition. The total number of cellular subscribers in majority owned
markets now exceeds 160,000."
Also during the first quarter, Century completed the acquisition of
Celutel, Inc. Celutel provides cellular service to approximately 28,000
customers in five cellular systems in metropolitan areas in Mississippi
and Texas that have a combined population of 1.4 million. With the
acquisition, Century gained more than 1 million pops (Century's portion
of the population based on ownership interest).
At the end of March, Century completed the acquisition of Kingsley
Telephone Co. which serves approximately 2,400 telephone access lines
in northern Michigan near other Century operations. With the
acquisition, Century also gained an additional 11% interest in the
cellular partnership which serves Rural Service Areas 3 and 5 in
northern Michigan and which Century operates.
Century Telephone, Inc. headquartered in Monroe, Louisiana, is a
diversified telecommunications company. Century is the 15th largest
local exchange telephone company and the 15th largest cellular operator
in the United States.
