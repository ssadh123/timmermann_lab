6.2. Retiree Benefits. On the Effective Date, pursuant 
to Section 1129(a)(13) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Reorganized 
Debtor will continue to be obligated to pay all retiree benefits, 
as that term is defined in Section 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code, 
and shall continue to pay such retiree benefits as they become 
due at the level(s) established at any time prior to the 
Confirmation Date pursuant to Subsection (e)(1)(B) or (g) of said 
Section 1114, for the duration of the period the Debtor has 
obligated itself to provide such benefits.

6.3. Disputed Claims. (a) Except with respect to those 
Claims the holders of which have and preserve the right to 
liquidation of such Claims before a court other than the 
Bankruptcy Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 157(b)(5), all Disputed 
Claims shall be liquidated and determined, and allowed or 
disallowed, by the Bankruptcy Court.

(b) The Bankruptcy Court may, on or prior to the 
Confirmation Date or such date or dates thereafter as the 
Bankruptcy Court may set, fix or liquidate the amount of any 
contingent or unliquidated Claim or Equity Interest pursuant to 
Section 502(c) of the Bankruptcy Code, in which event the amount

distribution under the Plan.

(c) The Debtor shall notify all holders of Claims

(d) The Debtor shall not be required to create or 
maintain any reserves for the payment of Disputed Claims.

(e) The failure of the Debtor to include any claim on 
the Schedule of Disputed Claims shall not constitute an admission 
that such claim is an undisputed, noncontingent, liquidated claim 
and the Debtor reserves all defenses, offsets and counterclaims 
with respect to such claim.

ARTICLE VII
EXECUTORY CONTRACTS AND UNEXPIRED LEASES

7.1 Assumption and Rejection of Executory Contracts 
and Unexpired Leases. (a) On the Effective Date, and to the 
extent permitted by applicable law, all executory contracts and 
unexpired leases of the Debtor will be assumed in accordance with 
the provisions of Section 365 and Section 1123 of the Bankruptcy 
Code, including, without limitation, the Asset Purchase 
Agreement, the TECo Subcontracts, the collective bargaining 
agreement currently in effect between the Debtor and the UMWA and 
a certain Settlement Agreement between Westmoreland and the UMWA 
dated July 27, 1994, but excluding (i) any and all executory 
contracts and unexpired leases which are listed on any "Schedule 
of Rejected Executory Contracts" filed by the Debtor on or before 
entry of the Confirmation Order, all of which contracts and 
leases shall be rejected by order of the Bankruptcy Court 
pursuant to the provisions of Section 365 and Section 1123 of the 
Bankruptcy Code, (ii) any and all such contracts and leases 
rejected by order of the Bankruptcy Court prior to entry of the 
Confirmation Order and (iii) any and all such contracts and 
leases which are the subject of any motion to reject pending on 
the date of entry of the Confirmation Order, but only in the 
event that such motion to reject is granted by a Final Order. 
Entry of the Confirmation Order by the Bankruptcy Court shall 
constitute approval of such assumptions or rejections pursuant to 
Sections 365(a) and 1123 of the Bankruptcy Code. Contracts 
entered into after the Petition Date will be performed by the 
Debtor in the ordinary course of business. Any Claims arising 
out of the rejection of contracts or leases under this 
Article VII must be filed with the Bankruptcy Court within thirty 
(30) days after the later of the Confirmation Date or the date of 
any Final Order approving the Debtor's rejection of such contract 
or lease or be forever barred.

(b) Unless otherwise agreed by the holder of such a 
Claim or otherwise provided in an order of the Bankruptcy Court, 
all Claims with respect to payments to cure defaults or to 
provide compensation for actual pecuniary loss resulting from 
such default or adequate assurance of future performance that may 
be required by Bankruptcy Code Section 365(b)(1) shall be paid in 
full in cash on the Distribution Date.

(c) Confirmation of the Plan shall not impair or 
otherwise affect any lien on property of the Debtor existing in 
favor of any lessor of equipment to the Debtor.

7.2 Compensation and Benefit Programs. Except as 
otherwise specifically set forth in the Plan, all employment and 
severance policies, and all compensation and benefit plans, 
policies, and programs of the Debtor applicable generally to its 
employees, including without limitation, all savings plans, 
retirement plans, health care plans, disability plans, severance 
benefit plans, incentive plans and life, accidental death, and 
dismemberment insurance plans, are treated as executory contracts 
under the Plan and on the Effective Date will be assumed pursuant 
to the provisions of Sections 365 and 1123 of the Bankruptcy 
Code.

ARTICLE VIII
EFFECTS OF PLAN CONFIRMATION

8.1 Discharge. Except as otherwise expressly provided 
in Section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code or the Plan, the 
distributions made pursuant to the Plan will be in full and final 
satisfaction, settlement, release and discharge as against the 
Debtor of any debt that arose before the Confirmation Date and 
any debt of a kind specified in Sections 502(g), 502(h) or 502(i) 
of the Bankruptcy Code and all Claims and Equity Interests of any 
nature, including, without limitation, any interest accrued 
thereon from and after the Petition Date, whether or not (i) a 
proof of a Claim or interest based on such debt, obligation or 
interest is filed or deemed filed under Section 501 of the 
Bankruptcy Code, (ii) such Claim or Equity Interest is allowed 
under Section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, or (iii) the holder of 
such Claim or Equity Interest has accepted the Plan. Therefore, 
upon the Effective Date or such later date on which a Claim 
becomes a Disputed Claim, all holders of Disputed Claims and 
Equity Interests shall be precluded from asserting against the 
Debtor or the Reorganized Debtor, or against any assets or 
properties of the Debtor or the Reorganized Debtor, any other or 
further Claims or Equity Interests based upon any act or 
omission, transaction or other activity of any kind or nature 
that occurred prior to the Effective Date, and the Confirmation 
Order shall permanently enjoin said holders of Disputed Claims 
and Equity Interests, their successors and assigns, from 
enforcing or seeking to enforce any such Disputed Claims or 
Equity Interests against the Debtor, the Reorganized Debtor, or 
their respective assets or property.

8.2 Revesting. On the Effective Date, except as 
otherwise expressly provided in the Plan or the Confirmation 
Order, the Debtor will be vested with all of the property of the 
Estate free and clear of all Claims, liens, encumbrances, charges 
and other interests of creditors and equity security holders, and 
may operate its businesses free of any restrictions imposed by 
the Bankruptcy Code or by the Bankruptcy Court.

8.3 Retention and Enforcement of Causes of Action. 
Except as otherwise provided in the Confirmation Order, nothing 
contained in the Plan shall be deemed to be a waiver or 
relinquishment of any claims, rights, or causes of action that 
constitute property of the Estate or of the Debtor, whether 
arising under the Bankruptcy Code or under nonbankruptcy law, 
including, without limitation, all fraudulent conveyance claims 
under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code or under applicable 
nonbankruptcy law as applied through Section 544(b) of the 
Bankruptcy Code, all of which are expressly (a) retained and may 
be enforced by the Debtor and any successors in interest, 
including the Reorganized Debtor, and (b) may be pursued, as 
appropriate, in accordance with the best interests of the Debtor, 
the Reorganized Debtor, or such successors; provided, however, 
that the Confirmation Order shall state that the Debtor hereby 
waives all claims for recovery of voidable preferences under 
Section 547 of the Bankruptcy Code or under applicable nonbank-
ruptcy law as applied through Section 544(b) of the Bankruptcy 
Code.

8.4 Retention of Jurisdiction. Notwithstanding entry 
of the Confirmation Order or the Effective Date having occurred, 
the Bankruptcy Court, to the extent permitted under the 
applicable sections of Title 28 of the United States Code, will 
retain jurisdiction (a) to determine any Disputed Claims, (b) to 
determine requests for payment of Claims entitled to priority 
under Section 507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, including 
compensation of and reimbursement of expenses of parties entitled 
thereto, (c) to resolve controversies and disputes regarding 
interpretation and implementation of the Plan, (d) to enter 
orders in aid of the Plan, including, without limitation, 
appropriate orders (which may include contempt or other 
sanctions) to protect the Debtor, (e) to modify the Plan pursuant 
to Section 9.1 of the Plan, (f) to determine any and all 
applications, Claims, Equity Interests, adversary proceedings and 
contested or litigated matters pending on the Effective Date or 
commenced after the Effective Date as contemplated in the Plan, 
including, without limitation, matters relating to the Asset 
Purchase Agreement or TECo Subcontracts, (g) to allow, disallow, 
estimate, liquidate or determine any Claim or Equity Interest 
(including, without limitation, Claims that are either not 
Allowed Claims or Disputed Claims) and to enter or enforce any 
order requiring the filing of any such Claim before a particular 
date, (h) to determine any and all pending applications for the 
rejection or disaffirmance of executory contracts or leases, or 
for the assumption or assignment of executory contracts and 
leases, and to hear and determine, and if need be to liquidate, 
any and all Claims arising therefrom, (i) to determine any 
actions or controversies described in Section 8.3 of the Plan, 
and (j) to enter a final decree closing the Reorganization Case.

8.5 Post-Consummation Effect of Evidences of Claims. 
All evidences of Claims against the Debtor shall, effective upon 
the Effective Date, represent only the right to participate in 
the distributions contemplated by the Plan.

8.6 Failure of Court to Exercise Jurisdiction. If the 
Court abstains from exercising or declines to exercise 
jurisdiction, or is otherwise without jurisdiction over any 
matter arising out of the Reorganization Case, including the 
matters set forth in this Article VIII, this Article VIII shall 
not prohibit or limit the exercise of jurisdiction by any other 
court having competent jurisdiction with respect to such matter.

8.7 Term of Injunctions or Stays. Unless otherwise 
provided, all injunctions or stays provided for in the 
Reorganization Case pursuant to Section 105 or Section 362 of the 
Bankruptcy Code or otherwise and in effect on the Confirmation 
Date shall remain in full force and effect until the Effective 
Date.

ARTICLE IX
MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

9.1 Modification of Plan. The Debtor reserves the 
right, in accordance with and subject to Section 1127 of the 
Bankruptcy Code, to amend or modify the Plan prior to the entry 
of the Confirmation Order. After the Effective Date, the 
Reorganized Debtor may, upon order of the Court, amend or modify 
the Plan in accordance with Section 1127(b) of the Code, or 
remedy any defect or omission or reconcile any inconsistency in 
the Plan in such manner as may be necessary to carry out the 
purpose and intent of the Plan.

9.2 Additional Proponents of the Plan. In the event 
that following the Petition Date but prior to the Confirmation 
Hearing a subsidiary or affiliate of any Debtor commences a case 
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code which is jointly 
administered along with cases number 94-1066 through 94-1070 in 
the Bankruptcy Court, the Debtor shall have the option to add 
such subsidiary or affiliate as a proponent of the Plan by filing 
a notice in writing of the same with the Bankruptcy Court and 
serving a copy of the same on all creditors and equity security 
holders in the Reorganization Case, in which event such 
subsidiary or affiliate shall, without further order of the 
Bankruptcy Court, be deemed to constitute a "Debtor" and a 
"Reorganized Debtor" under this Plan and its case commenced under 
Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code shall be deemed to be included 
in the defined term "Reorganization Case."

9.3 Withdrawal of Plan. The Debtor reserves the 
right, at any time prior to entry of the Confirmation Order, to 
revoke and withdraw the Plan. If the Debtor revokes or withdraws 
the Plan under this Section, or if entry of the Confirmation 
Order does not occur, then the Plan shall be deemed null and 
void. In that event, nothing contained in the Plan shall be 
deemed to constitute a waiver or release of any Claims by or 
against the Debtor or any other person, or to prejudice in any 
manner the rights of the Debtor or any other person in any 
further proceedings involving the Debtor or any other person.

9.4 Releases. Holders of Claims which receive 
distributions under the Plan shall be deemed to release each of 
the Reorganized Debtors and their respective present and former 
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives from 
any and all Claims and liabilities relating to or against any of 
them arising from the Petition Date up to the Effective Date, 
including Claims and causes of action arising in or under the 
Bankruptcy Code, but excluding (a) any claim of a Private 
Placement Lender relating to any such Private Placement Lender's 
ordinary course business relationship with the Debtor but which 
is not related to a Private Placement Lender Claim and (b) any 
claim of any party in interest who objects to such release prior 
to the Confirmation Hearing.

9.5 Cancellation of Certain Agreements. On the 
Effective Date, the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Private 
Placement Loan Agreement and the Repayment Agreement shall, 
except for purposes of making distributions under the Plan, be 
deemed cancelled, terminated, and of no further force or effect, 
and such cancellation shall extinguish the rights and obligations 
of the Debtors and of the Revolver Banks, the Private Placement 
Lenders and the DTA Banks thereunder.

9.6 Limitation of Liability. Neither the Reorganized 
Debtors, nor any of their employees, officers, directors, agents 
or representatives, nor any professional persons employed by any 
of them, shall have or incur any liability to any person or 
entity for any act taken or omission made in good faith in 
connection with or related to formulating, implementing, 
confirming or consummating this Plan, the Solicitation Materials 
and Disclosure Statement, or any contract, instrument, release or 
other agreement or document created in connection with this Plan.

9.7 Saturday, Sunday, or Legal Holiday. If any 
payment or act under the Plan is required to be made or performed 
on a date that is not a Business Day, then the making of such 
payment or the performance of such act may be completed on the 
next succeeding Business Day, but shall be deemed to have been 
completed as of the required date.

9.8 Means of Cash Payment. Cash payments made pur-
suant to the Plan to holders of Class 2, Class 3, and Class 4 
Claims shall be in U.S. funds and shall be made by wire transfer.

9.9 Severability of Provisions. If prior to 
Confirmation any term or provision of the Plan, which does not 
govern the treatment of Claims or Equity Interests or the 
conditions to the Effective Date, is held by the Bankruptcy Court 
to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, the Bankruptcy Court shall 
have the power to alter and interpret such term or provision to 
make it valid or enforceable to the maximum extent practicable, 
consistent with the original purpose of the term or provision 
held to be invalid, void, or unenforceable, and such term or 
provision shall then be applicable as altered or interpreted. 
Notwithstanding any such holding, alteration or interpretation, 
the remainder of the terms and provisions of the Plan will remain 
in full force and effect and will in no way be affected, 
impaired, or invalidated by such holding, alteration, or 
interpretation. The Confirmation Order shall constitute a 
judicial determination and shall provide that each term and 
provision of the Plan, as it may have been altered or interpreted 
in accordance with the foregoing, is valid and enforceable 
pursuant to its terms.

9.10 Headings. Headings are used in the Plan for 
convenience and reference only, and shall not constitute a part 
of the Plan for any other purpose.

9.11 Binding Effect. The Plan shall be binding upon 
and inure to the benefit of each of the Reorganized Debtors, its 
creditors, the holders of Equity Interests, and their respective 
successors and assigns.

9.12 Governing Law. Unless a rule of law or procedure 
is supplied by federal law (including the Bankruptcy Code and 
Bankruptcy Rules) or the Delaware General Corporation Law, the 
laws of the State of New York shall govern the construction and 
implementation of the Plan and any agreements, documents, and 
instruments executed in connection with the Plan.

9.13 Filing of Additional Documents. On or before 
substantial consummation of the Plan, the Reorganized Debtor 
shall file with the Bankruptcy Court such agreements and other 
documents as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate and 
further evidence the terms and conditions of the Plan.

9.14 Withholding and Reporting Requirements. In 
connection with the Plan and all instruments issued in connection 
therewith and distributions thereon, the Debtor shall comply with 
all withholding and reporting requirements imposed by any 
federal, state, local, or foreign taxing authority and all 
distributions hereunder shall be subject to any such withholding 
and reporting requirements.

9.15 Charter. On the Effective Date, each Reorganized 
Debtor will file its Amended and Restated Certificate of 
Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of 
Delaware in accordance with Sections 228, 242 and 245 of the 
Delaware General Corporation Law. The Amended and Restated 
Certificate of Incorporation of each Reorganized Debtor will, 

among other things, prohibit the issuance of non-voting equity 
securities as required by Section 1123(a)(6) of the Bankruptcy 
Code.

Westmoreland Settles Assignment
Dispute with TECO; Court 
Approves Westmoreland's Plan 
Of Reorganization

Philadelphia, PA - December 16, 1994 - Westmoreland Coal 
Company (NYSE:WCX) announced today that it had reached 
agreement with TECO Coal Corporation whereby TECO will 
consent to the assignment of two coal supply subcontracts by 
Kentucky Criterion Coal Company to CONSOL of Kentucky, Inc. 
as a part of Westmoreland's sale of the assets of Kentucky 
Criterion to CONSOL.

The resolution of this dispute was approved by the United 
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware today 
as a part of that Court's approval of Westmoreland's Plan of 
Reorganization in its "prepackaged" Chapter 11 proceeding. 
The approval of the Plan will permit Westmoreland and CONSOL 
to proceed as soon as possible with the closing of the sale 
of the Kentucky Criterion Assets. Westmoreland will emerge 
from Bankruptcy upon the completion of the Criterion sale.

The proceeds from the sale will be used by Westmoreland to 
pay in full its outstanding indebtedness to its principal 
creditors of approximately $39 million, fund equity 
contributions through 1995 of approximately $28 million for 
a current power plant projects of Westmoreland's wholly-
owned subsidiary, Westmoreland Energy, Inc., and to meet 
other needs related to Westmoreland's strategic 
repositioning.

Christopher K. Seglem, Westmoreland's President and Chief 
Executive Officer said, "The resolution of our dispute with 
TECO and the approval of our Plan of Reorganization to 
enable Westmoreland to proceed with the closing of the 
Kentucky Criterion asset sale are major milestones for 
Westmoreland. The way is cleared for us to retire our 
burdensome debt obligations which have threatened our short 
term viability and hampered our ability to stabilize the 
Company. Having the cash to make full equity contributions 
in our independent power projects maximizes our opportunity 
for strong operating profits from that sector of our 
Company."

Westmoreland Completes Sale of Kentucky Criterion
Assets to CONSOL, of Kentucky, Inc.
And Emerges From Bankruptcy

Philadelphia, PA - December 22, 1994 - Westmoreland Coal 
Company (NYSE:WCX) announced today that it had completed the 
sale of the assets of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kentucky 
Criterion Coal Company, to CONSOL of Kentucky, Inc., a 
member of the CONSOL, coal group, for $81 million after 
adjustments to reflect the settlement with TECO Coal 
Corporation and the sale of a parcel of land at Kentucky 
Criterion for which Westmoreland has received full payment. 
The price is also subject to certain normal post closing 
adjustments. 

As previously announced Westmoreland will use the proceeds 
from this sale to pay in full its outstanding indebtedness 
to its principal creditors of approximately $39 million. At 
that point Westmoreland will emerge from bankruptcy. The 
Company also will use the proceeds to meet near term 
expenses, including taxes, related to the sale of 
approximately $6 million. Other proceeds will be used to 
fund, when due, equity contributions of approximately $28 
million for current power plant projects of Westmoreland's 
wholly-owned subsidiary, Westmoreland Energy, Inc. and for 
other corporate purposes.
