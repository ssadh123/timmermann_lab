Item 5. Other Events

On February 22, 1994, Washington Energy Company made the following press
release:

SHAREHOLDERS' CLASS-ACTION SUIT

SEATTLE -- A class-action complaint has been filed against Washington Energy
Company (NYSE:WEG) alleging violations of state and federal securities act
provisions and associated violations of Washington state law.

The company has not been served with the complaint, but has obtained a
copy.

The essence of the complaint concerns alleged disclosure violations
regarding the nature or the extent of the downside financial risk associated
with the 1992 rate request filing of the company's Washington Natural Gas
subsidiary before the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission.

The company denies the allegations stated in the complaint and strongly
denies that it has violated any federal or state laws and intends to vigorous-
ly defend the suit.

The company expects to issue a further statement when the contents of
the lawsuit have been evaluated.
