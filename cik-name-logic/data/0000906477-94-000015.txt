Item 5. Other Events.
------------

On July 8, 1994, Showboat, Inc., a Nevada corporation,
was notified that the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe has withdrawn its
request for approval from the National Indian Gaming Commission
(NIGC) of the Tribe's proposed casino management agreements with
both Showboat and another casino operator. As Showboat
previously disclosed in its registration statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on June 28, 1994 (as amended
on July 8, 1994), a newly elected Tribal chief has indicated an
intent to re-examine the agreements. According to public
statements by Tribal officials, the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe has
withdrawn the contracts to permit the Tribal members to review
any gaming contract. As a result of this action, there can be no
assurance that the proposed agreements with Showboat will be
consummated in their present form or that the Tribe and Showboat
will determine to pursue a proposed casino.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits.
