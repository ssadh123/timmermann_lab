Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

(a) On April 19, 1994, Chance Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and
newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant, acquired all of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of A. B. Chance Industries, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Chance"), from Chance's stockholders. Chance is engaged
in the manufacture of electrical apparatus (overhead and underground
distribution switches, fuses, contacts, enclosures and sectionalizers);
anchors; hardware; insulators (porcelain and polymer); and hot-line tools and
other safety equipment.

Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated March
16, 1994, by and among Registrant, Chance, and the stockholders of Chance,
attached hereto as Exhibit (c)1., Registrant (a) purchased all the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Chance for $40,379,821 (including the "cash-out"
of stock options for $1,140,692 and the redemption of preferred stock for $10
million), and (b) retired Chance's existing debt of $69,620,179. The funds
required for the acquisition were provided from (a) the liquidation of certain
portfolio investments and (b) short-term borrowings of $45 million from Shawmut
Bank Connecticut, N.A.

The purchase price was a result of arm's-length negotiation among
representatives of the respective managements of Registrant and Chance, and the
principal stockholders of Chance. There is no material relationship between
any of the stockholders of Chance and the Registrant or any of its affiliates,
any director or officer of the Registrant, or any associate of any such
director or officer.

(b) Certain of the assets of Chance constitute plant, equipment, and
other physical property utilized in the business of Chance as previously
described, and Registrant intends to continue such use.

Item 7. Financial Statements and Exhibits.

(a) Financial statements of business acquired. Audited financial
statements of Chance for the years ended November 30, 1993 and 1992.

(b) Pro forma financial information. Unaudited pro forma combined
balance sheet as of March 31, 1994 and a combined summary of operations for the
year 1993.

(c) Exhibits. The following exhibits are filed with this report, and
their contents are incorporated herein by reference:

1. Stock Purchase Agreement, dated March 16, 1994, by and among
Registrant, Chance and the stockholders of Chance. A copy of

NOVEMBER 30, 1993 AND 1992

(WITH INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT THEREON)

Independent Auditors' Report

The Board of Directors
A. B. Chance Industries, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of A. B. Chance
Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of November 30, 1993 and 1992, and the
related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash
flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial statements are
the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of A. B. Chance
Industries, Inc. and subsidiaries as of November 30, 1993 and 1992, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Notes 1(h), 4, and 6 to the consolidated financial statements,
the Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes in fiscal year
1993 to adopt the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income
Taxes." As discussed in Notes 1(i), 4, and 10 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company has also adopted the provisions of the Financial
Accounting Standards Board's Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
106, "Employees' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits other than Pensions" in
fiscal year 1993.

A. B. CHANCE INDUSTRIES, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOVEMBER 30, 1993 AND 1992

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

(a) Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of A. B.
Chance Industries, Inc. (Industries), A. B. Chance Company
(Chance), A. B. Chance Canada Ltd. (Chance Canada), and A. B.
Chance U.K. Ltd. (Chance U.K.), collectively referred to
hereinafter as "the Company." All significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

(b) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventory
values are based upon standard costs which approximate average
costs. Standard costs are revised at the beginning of the
fiscal year, and variances incurred during the year are
allocated to inventories and cost of sales.

(c) Property, Plant and Equipment
Investments in land, buildings, and machinery and equipment are
recorded at cost. Improvements are capitalized, while repair
and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. When
assets are retired or disposed of, the related cost and
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts; gains or
losses are included in operating results.

Depreciation is computed principally using accelerated methods over
estimated service lives. Service lives for principal assets are
30 to 40 years for buildings and 4 to 12 years for machinery and
equipment.

(d) Excess of Cost Over Net Assets of Businesses Acquired
Assets acquired and liabilities assumed relating to business
combinations accounted for as purchase transactions are recorded
at their respective fair values. Excess of cost over net assets
of businesses acquired is amortized on a straight-line basis
over 40 years.

(e) Noncompete Agreement
The noncompete agreement is being amortized on a straight-line
basis over the five-year term of the agreement.

(f) Debt Issuance Costs
Debt issuance costs are being amortized on a straight-line basis
which approximates the interest method over the terms of the
related debt agreements.

(g) Foreign Currency Translation
Chance Canada and Chance U.K. have foreign functional currencies.
Accordingly, their assets and liabilities are translated into
U.S. dollars at current exchange rates. Revenues and expenses
are translated at average exchange rates during the year. The
resulting net translation adjustment is included as a separate
component of stockholders' equity.

(h) Income Taxes
In February 1992, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (Statement)
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." Under the asset and
liability method of Statement 109, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences
attributable to differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their
respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply

(Continued)
<PAGE> 12
2

A.B. CHANCE INDUSTRIES, INC.
AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under
Statement 109, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities
of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period
that includes the enactment date.

As discussed in Notes 4 and 6, the Company adopted Statement 109 as
of December 1, 1992 and has reported the cumulative effect of
that change in the method of accounting for income taxes in the
1993 consolidated statement of operations.

The Company previously used the asset and liability method under
Statement 96. Under the asset and liability method of Statement
96, deferred tax assets and liabilities were recognized for all
events that had been recognized in the consolidated financial
statements. Under Statement 96, the future tax consequences of
recovering assets or settling liabilities at their financial
statement carrying amounts were considered in calculating
deferred taxes. Generally, Statement 96 prohibited
consideration of any other future events in calculating deferred
taxes.

The foreign subsidiaries compute and pay their own taxes. No
provision is made for deferred income taxes on the undistributed
earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries primarily because reinvestment
of these earnings is considered essential for their continuing
operations. In those cases where distributions have been made,
additional income taxes, if any, have been minimal due to
offsets by available foreign tax credits.

(i) Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions
In December 1990, FASB issued Statement 106, "Employers' Accounting
for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions." Statement 106
requires the application of accrual accounting to postretirement
benefits rather than recognizing expense as claims are paid. As
discussed in Notes 4 and 10, the Company adopted Statement 106
as of December 1, 1992 and has reported the cumulative effect of
that change in the method of accounting for such benefits in the
1993 consolidated statement of operations.

(j) Warranty Costs
A reserve for estimated warranty costs is accrued when products are
sold and warranty costs, as incurred, are charged against the
reserve. The accrual is adjusted on an ongoing basis to the
current estimate of actual warranty costs to be incurred on all
previously recognized sales.

(k) Research and Development
Research and development costs, which are expensed as incurred,
amounted to approximately $4,274,000 and $4,326,000 in 1993 and
1992, respectively.

(l) Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows
Cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and highly liquid
investments with original maturities of three months or less.
The Company earned approximately $158,000 and $55,000 of
interest income in 1993 and 1992, respectively. Supplemental
disclosure of cash flow information is as follows:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Supplemental disclosure of noncash investing and financing
activities: During 1993 and 1992, the Company recognized an
additional minimum liability in accordance with Statement 87,
"Employers Accounting for Pensions." An intangible asset was
recognized to the extent of the unrecognized prior service cost
and the excess, approximately $1,824,000 and $339,000, was
reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity, net of
approximately $693,000 and $129,000 deferred tax benefit for
1993 and 1992, respectively.

As a result of the decision to terminate the Parkersburg Division
pension plan, the intangible asset of $158,000 and the component
of stockholders' equity of $422,000, net of deferred tax benefit
of $162,000, recognized in accordance with Statement 87 were
written off during fiscal year 1993.

(m) Preferred Stock
The redemption value of the preferred stock is being accreted up to
the redemption date using the interest method.

(n) Postemployment Benefits
In November 1992, the FASB issued Statement 112, "Employers'
Accounting for Postemployment Benefits." The Company has no
plans which meet the criteria of this statement.

(o) Reclassification
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
current year presentation.

(2) Acquisition
On December 30, 1987, Industries was formed and acquired all issued
and outstanding capital stock of Chance and its subsidiaries and
the outstanding capital stock of Chance Canada and Chance U.K. from
Emerson Electric Co. (Emerson) under a Stock Purchase 
Agreement among Emerson, Chance, and Industries. The acquisition
has been accounted for by the purchase method, with the purchase 
price allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition.

(3) Discontinued Operations
During fiscal 1993, the Company announced its intentions to offer
for sale the Parkersburg Division of Chance. The Company expects
to finalize the sale of Parkersburg during fiscal 1994 at a selling
price of approximately $2,000,000. In accordance with Accounting 
Principles Board Opinion No. 30, the financial results for this
division are reported as "Discontinued Operations."

At November 30, 1993, the accrued expenses of the discontinued
operations include pension termination costs of approximately 
$1,209,000 and other close-down costs of approximately $437,000.
Accounts payable of the discontinued operations at November 30,
1993 and 1992 are $485,000 and $393,000, respectively.

(4) Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change
The Company adopted Statement 106 as of December 1, 1992. The
Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change was a charge of 
approximately $1,242,000, net of income tax benefit of
approximately $761,000. The Company also adopted Statement 109, as
of December 1, 1992. The Cumulative Effect of Accounting
Change was a benefit of approximately $425,000.

(5) Other Expenses, Net

On October 17, 1988, the Company entered into an agreement in principle
to sell its former 51%-owned subsidiary, Ritz-Chance Industria
Comercio S.A. (Ritz-Chance), to the minority stockholder for
$2,000,000. Due to no payments being received in fiscal 1992 and
given past payment history, management chose to write-off $679,000,
the balance of the note receivable as reflected in the year ended

For the years ended November 30, 1993 and 1992, the change in deferred
income taxes represents the effect of changes in the amounts of
temporary differences. The types of temporary differences that give
rise to significant portions of deferred income tax as of November
30, 1993 and 1992 and the tax effects of changes in those temporary
differences during 1993 and 1992 consist of the following:

The Company's federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended
November 30, 1989 and 1988 were under audit by the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS). The IRS had issued a preliminary report which
included the reallocation of certain interest deductions among
members of the consolidated group. The effect of the preliminary
finding would have been to substantially reduce the income tax
refunds received for the years under examination, while allowing the
deductions on a carryforward basis. The Company had previously
established reserves for any settlement that might have arisen from
the IRS audit. In fiscal year 1992, the Company received a letter
from the IRS indicating the returns for the years under audit had
been accepted as originally filed. As the IRS accepted the returns
as originally filed, the Company changed its accounting estimate of
such reserves resulting in a decrease in deferred tax expense for
the year ended November 30, 1992 of $1,000,000.

In December 1987, the Company entered into a revolving credit and term
loan agreement (Credit Agreement) with six banks enabling the
Company to borrow up to $71,400,000. The Credit Agreement provides
a maximum revolving credit of $36,000,000, subject to a qualified
borrowing base. The borrowing base is determined by the amounts of
certain receivables and inventories. At November 30, 1993, the
borrowing base was $31,075,000, of which $17,900,000 was borrowed.
Commitment fees are equal to 1/2% per year on the unused portion of
the available credit up to $24,000,000, plus 1/8% per year on the
remaining $12,000,000. The Company may prepay all or part of the
revolving amounts outstanding, except in the case of Eurodollar
loans which may only be prepaid at the end of the applicable
interest period. The Company is required to periodically reduce the
borrowings by an amount equal to 70% of the excess cash flow of the
Company for the next preceding semiannual period plus the amount of
proceeds received from disposition of certain assets. Such
reduction will be applied first to the term loans, as the term loans
must be repaid prior to the cancellation of the revolving credit.
As of November 30, 1993, the Company has remitted $3,300,000 against
the term loan balances which approximates the after-tax proceeds
from the sale of these assets. Loans under the revolving credit
will, at the Company's option, bear interest payable quarterly at
either prime plus 1% or LIBOR plus 2%. Borrowings under the term
loans will, at the Company's option, bear interest payable quarterly
at either prime plus 1-1/2% or LIBOR plus 2- 1/2%. At November 30,
1993, the prime and LIBOR interest rates were 5.5% and 3.19%,
respectively. The Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts
will be due and payable on November 30, 1995, or upon repayment and
cancellation of the revolving credit.

On December 31, 1992, the Company paid $6,000,000 to repay the 11.25%
Tral Senior Notes. Funds used to retire the debt were obtained
through increased borrowings on the LIBOR plus 2% Revolving Credit
Notes. The prepayment penalty paid for early extinguishment of the
debt due subsequent to fiscal 1993 was approximately $148,000.

The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (Teachers)
Senior Notes may be prepaid on or after December 31, 1992, at a
premium over the principal amount that declines in equal annual
increments from 3.29% to zero at December 31, 1994. Payments in
excess of those specified by the Teachers Senior Subordinated Notes
may be made on or after December 31, 1992, at a premium over the
principal amount that declines in equal annual increments from 5.78%
to zero at December 31, 1996.

The Teachers Senior and Teachers Senior Subordinated Notes may be
prepaid, without premium, at any time from the proceeds from the
sale of common stock, merger, consolidation, or the sale of stock or
assets of the Company.

The Junior Subordinated Note accrues interest at a rate of 14% and is
payable semiannually at the rate of 3% through December 31, 1995 and
7% from January 1, 1996 through December 31, 1997. Interest which
is accrued but unpaid is added to the principal amount of the note
and bears interest at a rate of 14% compounded semiannually. The
principal and unpaid interest are due on December 31, 1998.
Obligations of the Company under the Junior Subordinated Note are
subordinated to senior indebtedness of the Company.

The financing arrangements contain certain covenants that, among other
things, require the Company to (a) maintain certain minimum levels
of (i) cumulative consolidated gross revenues from sales less (ii)
the sum of consolidated selling and general administrative expenses
and costs of sales for such period; (b) maintain certain minimum
ratios of the sum of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes,
and depreciation to interest expense; and (c) maintain certain
minimum ratios of operating cash flow to debt. Additional covenants
limit, among other things, the ability of the Company to (a) incur
indebtedness and certain other fixed obligations, (b) create certain
liens on their respective assets, (c) pay dividends on the Company's
capital stock, (d) make certain investments in or loans to entities,
(e) merge or consolidate with, or sell their assets to, other
entities, (f) make capital expenditures in excess of specified
amounts, and (g) engage in certain transactions with affiliates.

(8) Stockholders' Equity
The preferred stock, which is owned by Emerson, has no dividend
provisions and is nonvoting, except the Company cannot create or
issue any additional stock of any class senior to the preferred
stock without approval of at least 2/3 of the total number of
preferred shares outstanding. The Company is required to redeem,
for $100,000 per share, all of the outstanding shares on December
31, 1999, or prior to a merger or consolidation. In the event of
liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, subject to
the prior rights of the Company's creditors to its assets, the
holders of shares of preferred stock will be entitled to receive a
liquidation distribution of $100,000 per share.

The Classes A, B, and C common stocks have identical rights, terms, and
conditions except voting. Class A common stock is entitled to vote
on each matter on which stockholders of the Company shall be
entitled to vote, one vote for each share. Class B common stock
shall not have any voting rights except that such holders shall be
entitled to vote, as a separate class, on any amendment, repeal, or
modification of any provision of the certificate of incorporation,
one vote for each share. Class C common stock shall be entitled to
vote on each matter on which the stockholders of the Company shall
be entitled to vote, other than the election of directors, one vote
for each share. In addition, the holders of Class C common stock
shall be entitled to vote, as a separate class, on any amendment,
repeal, or modification of any provision of the certificate of
incorporation, one vote for each share. Holders of Class B common
stock and Class C common stock, under certain circumstances, are
entitled to convert their shares into Class A common stock on a
share-for-share basis.

(9) Stock Option Plan
Under the terms of the 1988 Stock Option Plan, 100,000 shares of Class A
common stock can be issued to key employees of Industries or its
subsidiaries at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. Options are
exercisable upon granting and must be exercised within 15 years from
the date of granting. At November 30, 1993 and 1992, 61,000 shares
had been granted. As of November 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively,
2,100 and 800 shares of Class A common stock had been issued

As discussed in Notes 1(i) and 4, the Company adopted Statement 106
effective December 1, 1992. The Company sponsors several defined
benefit postretirement plans that cover both salaried and
nonsalaried employees. These plans provide health care and life
insurance benefits. The health care plans are contributory with
deductibles and benefit levels adjusted periodically. The life
insurance plans are noncontributory. The Company has reserved the
right, subject to existing agreements, to modify or terminate these
benefits. The Company's postretirement health care and life
insurance plans are unfunded.

The following table sets forth the combined financial status of
postretirement benefits other than pensions in the Company's
consolidated balance sheet at November 30, 1993:

<TABLE>

Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation:

Plan assets at fair value -

Net periodic postretirement benefit cost for the year ended November 30, 1993
includes the following components:

<TABLE>
<S> <C>
Service cost (benefits earned during the year) $ 83,390
Interest cost on the projected benefit obligation 172,913
-------
Net periodic postretirement benefit cost $ 256,303
=======
</TABLE>

For measurement purposes, a 12% annual rate of increase in the per
capita cost of covered health benefits for 1993 was assumed. The
rate was assumed to decline gradually to 5.25% by fiscal year 2008
and remain level thereafter. The health care cost trend rate
assumption has an effect on amounts reported. For example,
increasing the health care cost trend rate by one percentage point
in each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation as of November 30, 1993, by approximately $157,000 and
increase the service and interest cost components of the net
periodic postretirement benefits cost by approximately $22,000.

The assumed discount rate used in the actuarial calculations of the
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation was 7.25% at December
1, 1992 and November 30, 1993. The rate of compensation increase
varies by age of employee. The range of assumed increases in
compensation is from 4.5% for employees age 56 and above to 7.5% for
employees under age 25.

(11) Operating Leases

The Company leases computers, transportation equipment, and various
other property under operating lease agreements. Rent expense for
all such leases was $1,793,000 and $1,758,000 for the years ended
November 30, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

At November 30, 1993, future minimum lease payments under such
noncancellable operating leases are as follows:

(13) Commitments and Contingencies
The Company has contingent liabilities, which consist of guarantees and
various other claims occurring in the normal course of business.
These other contingent liabilities are not expected by management to
result in actual liabilities which will have a material effect on
the financial position of the Company.

party, would result in a default or loss of any right thereunder or the
creation of any Lien upon any of the assets or properties of the Company or any

to or bound by, any judgment, injunction or decree of any court or governmental
authority which restricts or interferes with the performance of this Agreement.

documents, and permit Sellers and their respective representatives and agents
to examine, make extracts from and, at Sellers' expense, copy such books,
records or documents at any time during normal business hours to reasonably
facilitate (i) the preparation by Sellers of any tax returns as they may be
required to file with respect to the operations of what was Sellers' or the
Company's business, the making of any election related to Taxes or in
connection with any audit, amended return, claim for refund or any suit or
proceeding with respect thereto, (ii) the investigation, litigation and final
disposition of any claims, suits or proceedings which may have been or may be
made against Sellers in connection with what was Sellers' or the Company's
business or (iii) otherwise reasonably relating to Sellers' ownership of
capital stock of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall
have the right to destroy all or part of such books, records and documents at
an earlier time by giving each party hereto 30 days' prior written notice of
such intended disposition and by offering to deliver to such party at its
expense, custody of such books, records and documents as the Company intends to
destroy.
7.2 Directors and Officers Insurance and Indemnification. Buyer
and the Company shall use their best efforts to secure a one year extended
reporting period for any
<PAGE> 70
66

directors and officers insurance policy which may be in effect on the Closing
Date, upon expiration thereof. The terms and conditions of such coverage shall
be no less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Company and the
Subsidiaries than that which is in effect as of the date hereof. For a period
of five years from the Closing Date, the Company and the Subsidiaries will
maintain, without any reduction in scope, and will fully comply with, the
indemnification provisions for present and former directors and officers
contained in the certificates or articles of incorporation and by-laws of the
Company and the Subsidiaries. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, during such five year period, the Company and the Subsidiaries will
(a) indemnify to the maximum extent permitted by law all present and former
directors and officers of the Company and the Subsidiaries against any claim,
liability or expenses arising out of or related to their services as such or
otherwise on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary and (b) in the event of
any claim, investigation or proceeding, pay as incurred any such present or
former director's or officer's reasonable legal and other expenses upon receipt
of an undertaking to repay such amounts if it is finally determined that he or
she is not entitled to be indemnified.
7.3 Cooperation. Sellers and Buyer will use their reasonable best
efforts to cause all post-Closing transactions and events to occur as soon as
practical following Closing, and will cooperate with each other as reasonably
required for such purpose. From and after the Closing, Buyer and Sellers shall
<PAGE> 71
67

execute and deliver or use their reasonable best efforts to cause to be
executed and delivered to one another such further instruments, documents and
conveyances, and to make all filings with and to obtain all consents, approvals
or authorizations of any governmental or regulatory authority or any other
person under any permit, license, agreement, indenture or other instrument, and
shall take such other action as may be reasonably required to effectively carry
out the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

ARTICLE VIII

INDEMNIFICATION

8.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties. The
representations and warranties of Sellers contained in Sections 3.1 and 3.3(a)
of this Agreement or in stock transfer powers delivered hereunder or pursuant
hereto shall survive the Closing and shall continue in effect indefinitely.
None of the other representations and warranties or certificates of any of the
Sellers, the Company or Buyer shall survive the Closing.
8.2 Indemnification by Sellers. (a) Sellers, severally and not
jointly, agree to indemnify and hold Buyer and each of its affiliates and their
directors, officers, employees and agents harmless against and in respect of
(i) any loss, claim, liability or damage incurred or sustained by any of Buyer,
its affiliates or their directors, officers, employees and agents, as a result
of any inaccuracy of or breach by such Seller of its representation and
warranty contained in Sections 3.1 and 3.3(a), or in stock transfer powers
delivered hereunder or
<PAGE> 72
68

pursuant hereto, and (ii) all reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by each of Buyer, its affiliates and their
directors, officers and employees, in connection with any action, suit,
proceeding, demand, assessment or judgment arising out of any such inaccuracy
or breach.
(b) Promptly after receipt by Buyer under this Section 8.2 of
notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, Buyer shall, if a claim
in respect thereof is to be made against a Seller under this Section 8.2,
notify such Seller in writing of the claim or the commencement of that action,
provided that the failure to notify such Seller shall not relieve it, him or
her from any liability which it, he or she may have to Buyer to the extent that
such Seller has not been prejudiced thereby. If any claim shall be brought
against Buyer, and it shall so notify a Seller, such Seller shall be entitled
to participate therein, and to assume the defense thereof with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, and to settle and compromise any such claim
or action, provided, however, that, if such settlement provides for any
obligation on the part of Buyer, the Company or any Subsidiary, such settlement
or compromise shall be effected only with the consent of Buyer, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. After notice from such Seller to Buyer of
its, his or her election to assume the defense of such claim or action, such
Seller shall not be liable for other expenses subsequently incurred by Buyer in
connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable out-of-pocket costs
of investigation, provided, however, that Buyer shall have the right
<PAGE> 73
69

to employ counsel to represent it if, in Buyer's reasonable judgment, it is
advisable for Buyer to be represented by separate counsel, and in such event
the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by Buyer. Buyer
and Sellers each agree to render to each other such assistance as may
reasonably be requested in order to insure the proper and adequate defense of
any such claim or proceeding.

ARTICLE IX

TERMINATION

9.1 Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be terminated at
any time prior to the Closing: 
(a) By mutual written consent of Sellers' Representative and Buyer; 
(b) By either Buyer or Sellers' Representative in the event that 
the other party hereto shall, contrary to the terms of this Agreement, 
intentionally fail or refuse to consummate the transactions contemplated 
hereby or to take any other action referred to herein necessary to 
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, after affording such 
defaulting party a five day period after notice in which to cure; or
(c) By either Sellers' Representative or Buyer in the event the
Closing does not take place (other than as a result of the failure of
such party to perform its obligations hereunder) on or prior to June 30,
1994, unless such date is extended by the mutual written consent of
Sellers' Representative and Buyer.
<PAGE> 74
70

9.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect,
other than in the event of a termination pursuant to Section 9.1(b), with no
liability on the part of any party hereto, except for the provisions of
Sections 5.3(a) and 10.6 which shall survive the termination hereof. In the
event there is a breach of this Agreement prior to its termination pursuant to
Section 9.1 and such breach does not give rise to liability under Section
9.1(b), then the sole remedy of the parties hereunder for such breach shall be
termination of this Agreement.

ARTICLE X

MISCELLANEOUS

10.1 Entire Agreement and Modification. This Agreement, the
Schedules attached hereto and the documents delivered pursuant hereto, and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the parties
and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, written and oral,
between the parties hereto, with respect to the subject matter hereof. No
changes of, modifications of, or additions of this Agreement shall be valid
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged
thereby.
10.2 Binding Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties named herein and to their
respective successors and assigns, provided that this Agreement shall not be
binding upon the Company or any of the Sellers until duly executed by the
Company
<PAGE> 75
71

and all of the Sellers. This Agreement shall not be assignable by any party
without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that this
Agreement may be assigned by Buyer to any wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer (in
which event, however, Buyer shall remain fully liable hereunder). Any
attempted assignment of this Agreement in breach of this provision shall be
void and of no effect. There are no third party beneficiaries of this
Agreement, other than the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns and except as provided in Section 7.2 hereof.
10.3 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument.
10.4 Headings. The Article and Section headings contained in this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the

contracts to be wholly performed within such state.

other experts and all other expenses incurred by such party incident to the
negotiation, preparation and execution of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby. Buyer expressly
<PAGE> 76
72

acknowledges and agrees that JPM and Bryan Cave have been retained by and their
fees and expenses shall, upon presentation of customary statements therefor, be
paid by the Company, and agrees that any such fees and expenses not paid on or
before the Closing Date will be paid promptly upon presentation of such
statements; provided that in the event the aggregate of the fees and expenses
of JPM and Bryan Cave (including for such purpose all amounts paid in
connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement prior to the
date hereof) exceed $1,430,000, such excess shall be paid by Sellers. Other
than JPM, no party has retained any broker, finder or agent or agreed to pay
any brokerage fees, finder's fees and commissions with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of Buyer and Sellers
(severally and not jointly) agree to indemnify and hold the other harmless from
and against all loss, cost, damage, claims and expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees, which the other may sustain by reason of any claim for
brokerage commissions or finders' or similar fees arising by reason of any act
of the indemnifying party in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

the one hand, and Sellers, collectively, on the other, for purposes of notice
