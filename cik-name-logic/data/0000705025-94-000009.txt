ITEM 4. CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT 

KPMG Peat Marwick was previously the principal accountant for
INTRUST Financial Corporation. On September 16, 1994 that
firm's appointment as principal accountant was terminated and
Arthur Andersen LLP was engaged as principal accountant. The
decision to change accountants was approved by the audit
committee of the board of directors.

In connection with the audits of the two fiscal years ended
December 31, 1993, and the subsequent interim period through
September 16, 1994, there were no disagreements with KPMG Peat
Marwick on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedures,
which disagreements if not resolved to their satisfaction would
have caused them to make reference to the subject matter of the
disagreement in connection with their opinion or reports.

The audit reports of KPMG Peat Marwick on the consolidated
financial statements of INTRUST Financial Corporation and
subsidiaries as of and for the years ended December 31, 1993 and
1992 did not contain any adverse opinion or disclaimer of
opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty,
audit scope, or accounting principles. A letter from KPMG Peat
Marwick is attached as Exhibit 16.

ITEM 7. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We were previously principal accountants for INTRUST Financial
Corporation and, under the date of February 4, 1994, we reported
on the consolidated financial statements of INTRUST Financial
Corporation and subsidiaries as of and for the years ended
December 31, 1993 and 1992. On September 16, 1994, our
appointment as principal accountants was terminated. We have
read INTRUST Financial Corporation's statements included under
Item 4 of its Form 8-K dated September 23, 1994, and we agree
with such statements, except that we are not in a position, to
agree or disagree with INTRUST Financial Corporation's statement
that the change was approved by the audit committee of the board
of directors.

Very truly yours,

/s/KPMG PEAT MARWICK LLP
