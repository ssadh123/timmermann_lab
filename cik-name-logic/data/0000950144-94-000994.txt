INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT

Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

Effective April 22, 1994, Peoples Financial Services, Inc. ("Peoples
Financial") merged with and into Trans Financial Bancorp, Inc. ("Trans
Financial") and each of the outstanding shares of common stock of Peoples
Financial were converted into 5.5 shares of common stock of Trans Financial for
an aggregate issuance of approximately 1,302,273 shares of Trans Financial
common stock. Holders of shares of Peoples Financial common stock received
cash, without interest, in lieu of fractional shares of Trans Financial common
stock.

The transaction was effected pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization and related Plan of Merger (collectively, the "Merger
Agreement") dated December 27, 1993, between Trans Financial and Peoples
Financial, and was approved by the shareholders of Peoples Financial at a
special meeting held on April 12, 1994. Peoples Financial is a bank holding
company headquartered in Cookville, Tennessee. Peoples Financial owned one
hundred percent (100%) of the outstanding capital stock of Peoples Bank & Trust
of the Cumberlands, Cookville, Tennessee, and Citizens Federal Savings Bank,
Rockwood, Tennessee. At December 31, 1993, Peoples Financial reported total
consolidated assets of approximately $123 million. The consideration given by
Trans Financial for the acquisition of Peoples Financial was determined in
accordance with the Merger Agreement.

The only material relationship between any of Peoples Financial or its
shareholders and Trans Financial or any of its affiliates, any director
or officer of Trans Financial or any associate of any such director or officer
was as follows: each director of Peoples Financial granted Trans Financial
concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement the option to purchase
the shares of Peoples Financial beneficially owned by him.

The assets acquired by Trans Financial in the transaction consisted of
Peoples Financial's two subsidiary banks, Peoples Bank & Trust of the
Cumberlands and Citizens Federal Savings Bank. It is anticipated that the
physical assets of the two banking subsidiaries of Peoples Financial will
continue to be used by them for general banking purposes.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT

The Board of Directors
Peoples Financial Services, Inc.
Cookeville, Tennessee:

We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of Peoples Financial Services,
Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993 and the related consolidated
statements of earnings, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the
year then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing 
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of 
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence 
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit 
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis 
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the 1993 consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Peoples
Financial Services, Inc. and Subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

Separate financial statements of Peoples Financial Services, Inc. and
Subsidiary and Citizens Federal Savings Bank included in the 1992 and 1991
restated consolidated financial statements were audited and reported on
separately by other auditors prior to restatement for the 1993 pooling of
interests. The other auditors expressed unqualified opinions on the 1992 and
1991 financial statements of Peoples Financial Services, Inc. and Subsidiary
and Citizens Federal Savings Bank in reports dated February 4, 1993 and
February 26, 1993, respectively.

As discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed its method of accounting for income taxes in 1993.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1993 AND 1992

(1) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

GENERAL
Peoples Financial Services, Inc. (the "Company") was organized in
March, 1990 for the purpose of becoming a holding company for the
Peoples Bank and Trust of the Cumberlands (PB&T). PB&T is a state
chartered bank organized in June, 1988. In February, 1993 the
Company acquired Citizens Federal Savings Bank (CFSB) as discussed in
note 11. The accounting and reporting policies of Peoples Financial
Services, Inc. and subsidiaries conform to generally accepted
accounting principles. The following is a description of the more
significant of those policies which the Company follows in preparing
and presenting its consolidated financial statements.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Peoples Financial Services, Inc. and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, Citizens Federal Savings Bank and Peoples Bank & Trust
of the Cumberlands. All significant intercompany balances are
eliminated in consolidation.

During 1992, Citizens Capital Corporation, formerly a wholly-owned
subsidiary, was merged into CFSB. Citizens Capital Corporation had
been included in the consolidated financial statements since its
incorporation, and the merger did not affect the comparability of the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
For the purposes of reporting cash flows, cash and cash equivalents
include cash, interest bearing deposits in other banks with original
maturities of three months or less, and federal funds sold.
Generally, federal funds are sold for one-day periods.

Cash and due from banks include legal reserve requirements which must
be maintained on an average basis in the form of cash and balances
due from the Federal Reserve Bank and other banks in the amount of
$174,000 and $204,000 at December 31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

INVESTMENT AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES
Securities are classified as investment securities or securities held
for sale and primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities,
obligations of U.S. Government agencies and mortgage-backed
securities. Mortgage-backed securities are comprised substantially
of participating interests in pools of long-term first mortgage loans
originated and serviced by the issuers of the securities.

Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at
the time of purchase. If management has the intent and the Company
has the ability at the time of purchase to hold securities until
maturity, they are carried at amortized historical cost. Securities
to be held for indefinite periods of time and not intended to be held
to maturity are classified as held for sale and carried at the lower
of cost or market Securities held for indefinite periods of time
include securities that management intends to use as part of its
asset/liability management strategy and that may be sold in response
to changes in interest rates, resultant prepayment risk and other
factors related to interest rate and resultant prepayment risk
changes. All securities held for sale including mortgage-backed
securities are included in investments held for sale on the balance
sheet.

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED

INVESTMENT AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES
Premiums and discounts are amortized using a method, which
approximates the interest method, over the remaining period to
contractual maturity, adjusted for prepayments. Gains and losses on
the sale of securities held for sale are determined using the
specific identification method and are included in other operating
income, including adjustments to lower of aggregate cost or market.

LOANS AND LOANS HELD FOR SALE
Loans receivable are recorded at the unpaid principal balance owed by
borrowers less deferrals, unearned interest, the allowance for loan
losses and purchase discounts. Discounts on loans purchased are
accreted to interest income using the interest method over the
remaining period to contractual maturity, adjusted for prepayments.
Unearned income on consumer loans is recognized over the lives of the
loans using the interest method. Loans held for sale are carried at
the lower of cost or fair value. Management determines the
appropriate classification at the date of origination.

The allowance for loan losses is based upon analyses of the loan
portfolio and is maintained at a level considered adequate by
management to provide for probable loan losses. The analyses include
management's consideration of such factors as economic conditions,
loan portfolio characteristics, prior loan loss experience, and
results of reviews of the portfolio. allowance is increased by
provisions charged against income and reduced by net charge-offs.

While management believes it has established the allowance for
possible loan losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles and has taken into account the views of its regulators and
the current economic environment, there can be no assurance that in
the future the Banks' regulators or its economic environment will not
require further increases in the allowance.

Loans which management has doubts as to the borrower's ability to
repay principal or interest are placed on nonaccrual status.
Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are recognized as
income on a cash basis.

LOAN ORIGINATION FEES AND RELATED COSTS
Loan origination fees and certain direct loan origination costs are
deferred, and the net fee or cost is recognized in income using the
interest method over the contractual lives of the loans, adjusted for
expected prepayments and loan sales. If deferred fees are associated
with a loan placed on nonaccrual status, amortization of the fees is
ceased.

LOAN SERVICING FEES
Fees arising from servicing loans for others are recognized as earned.

PREMISES AND EQUIPMENT
Premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Depreciation is computed on straight-line and
accelerated methods based on the estimated useful lives of the
related assets. Costs of replacing structural parts and major units
are considered individually and are expensed or capitalized as the
facts dictate.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED

(1) SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, CONTINUED

REAL ESTATE OWNED
Real estate acquired either through loan foreclosure or in substance
foreclosure is initially recorded at the lower of the related loan
balance, less any specific allowance for loss, or fair value at the
date of foreclosure. Costs relating to developing and improving
property are capitalized, whereas costs relating to holding property
are expensed.

Valuations are periodically performed by management. If the carrying
value of a property exceeds its fair value, an allowance is
established through a provision for losses charged to earnings.

INVESTMENTS REQUIRED BY LAW
CFSB, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank system, is required
to acquire and hold shares of stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank,
subject to certain minimum levels. The stock is carried at cost and
dividends are recognized as income when received.

INCOME TAXES
Deferred income taxes are provided on items which are reported in
different years for tax purposes than for financial statement
purposes.

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for
Income Taxes" (SFAS 109). This statement requires the use of the
asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting
for income taxes.

In accordance with SFAS 109, the Company has recorded deferred tax
assets to reflect the tax benefits of accumulated temporary
differences between financial and tax reporting. Financial
statements for prior periods have not been restated. The cumulative
effect of the accounting change as of January 1, 1993 resulted in an
increase in net earnings of $306,404.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS
The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued Statement
No. 114, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan", which
becomes effective for years beginning after December 15, 1994. The
statement generally requires impaired loans to be measured based on
the present value of expected future cash flows, or at the loan's
observable market value or the fair value of the collateral if
the loan is collateral dependent. The Company has not addressed the
potential future impact of this statement.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board has also issued Statement
No. 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity
Securities", which becomes effective for years beginning after
December 31, 1993. The statement generally requires securities to be
categorized as held-to-maturity (HTM), available-for-sale (AFS) or
trading. HTM securities will be carried at amortized cost. AFS
securities will be carried at fair value with unrealized gains or
losses included as a separate component of equity. Trading
securities will be carried at fair value with unrealized gains or
losses included in current earnings. The Company has not determined
the effect of implementing this statement.

At December 31, 1993 and 1992, loans on which the accrual of interest
had been discontinued totaled $217,058 and $293,000, respectively.
During the years ended December 31, 1993 and 1992, gross interest
income that would have been recorded on loans accounted for on a
nonaccrual basis if the loans had been current throughout the
periods, and the amount of interest income that was recorded for such
loans during these periods was not material. There were no
commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers on nonaccrual
status.

In the ordinary course of business, the Bank makes loans to directors
and executive officers and their related interests. Such loans were
made on substantially the same terms, including interest and
collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable
transactions with other borrowers and did not involve more than the
normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features.
Loans to directors and executive officers and their related interests
are as follows:

Mortgage loans serviced for others are not included in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The unpaid principal
balances of these loans are $28,360,643 and $17,242,761 at December
31, 1993 and 1992, respectively.

(5) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK
AND SIGNIFICANT GROUP CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK

The Company is a party to financial instruments with
off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the
financing needs of its customers and to reduce its own exposure to
fluctuations in interest rates. These financial instruments include
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Those
instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and
interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the
consolidated balance sheets. The contractual notional amounts of
those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has
in particular classes of financial instruments.

The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance
by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to
extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the
contractual notional amount of those instruments. The Company uses
the same credit policies in making these commitments and conditional
obligations as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.

(5) FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTAL WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK
AND SIGNIFICANT GROUP CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK, CONTINUED

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as
long as there is no violation of any condition established in the
contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other
termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some
commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the
total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash
requirements. The Company evaluates each customer's credit
worthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral
obtained if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit
is based on management's credit evaluation of the borrower.
Collateral held varies but may include property, plant, and equipment
and income-producing commercial properties.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the
Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.
The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially
the same as that involved in extending loan facilities customers.

Outstanding letters of credit as of December 31, 1993 and 1992,
amounted to $380,000 and $142,000, respectively. Outstanding
commitments as of December 31, 1993 and 1992, amounted to $3,213,000
and $1,163,000, respectively. Undisbursed advances on customer lines
of credit were $6,064,000 at December 31, 1993 and $4,869,000 at
December 31, 1992. The outstanding standby letters of credit
generally have terms of one year or less. The Company does not
anticipate any losses as a result of these transactions.

Most of the Company's business activity is with customers located
within the state of Tennessee. A majority of the loans are secured
by residential or commercial real estate or other personal property.
The loans are expected to be repaid from cash flows or proceeds from
the sale of selected assets of the borrowers.

The Company has four loans with an aggregate net carrying value of
$2,125,773 at December 31, 1993, that are secured by commercial real
estate located in Texas, Mississippi, Virginia, and Florida.

(9) BONDS PAYABLE

During 1985, CFSB initiated a long-range restructuring program which
resulted in the formation of Citizens Capital Corporation, a
wholly-owned subsidiary. In conjunction with the restructuring, CFSB
exchanged approximately $12.8 million in first mortgage loans for
guaranteed mortgage pass-through certificates issued by the Federal
National Mortgage Association (FNMA certificates) with an effective
yield of approximately 8.8 percent. The FNMA certificates were
transferred to Citizens Capital Corporation, which issued
approximately $9.6 million in bonds payable, secured by the FNMA
certificates. The bonds bore interest at 11.375 percent, and were
scheduled to mature on February 1, 2003.

During 1992, CFSB paid in full its obligation under the bonds prior
to the merger of Citizens Capital Corporation into the Bank. The
FNMA certificates held by Citizens Capital Corporation were
transferred to CFSB.

CFSB is allowed a special bad debt deduction for tax purposes limited
generally to the greater of 8% of otherwise taxable income or actual
loss experience. CFSB used the experience method in 1993, 1992, and
1991. If the amounts that qualify as deductions for Federal income
tax purposes under the percentage of income method are later used for
purposes other than for bad debt losses, they will be subject to
Federal income tax at the then current corporate rate. Retained
earnings at December 31, 1993 and 1992, includes approximately
$733,000 and $550,000, respectively, for which Federal income tax has
not been provided.

(11) ACQUISITIONS

On February 1, 1993, the Company sold 31,225 shares of newly-issued
common stock in connection with the the acquisition of Citizens
Federal Savings Bank, Rockwood, Tennessee, (CFSB) pursuant to a
definitive agreement entered into by the Company and CFSB in May,
1992. In connection with the acquisition, the Company and CFSB
adopted a Plan of Conversion/Acquisition (Plan) whereby CFSB was
converted from a federally-chartered mutual institution to a
federally-chartered stock institution. Pursuant to the Plan, shares
of capital stock of the Company were offered initially for
subscriptions to eligible members of CFSB and to certain other
persons as of specified dates and subject to various subscription
priorities as provided by the Plan. The capital stock was offered at
a price determined by the Company's Board of Directors based upon an
appraisal made by an independent appraisal firm. The offering raised
gross proceeds of approximately $1,405,000, all of which was used in
the acquisition of CFSB. This business combination was accounted for
as a pooling-of-interests and, accordingly, the Company's historical
consolidated financial statements were restated to include the
accounts and results of operations of CFSB.

In connection with the offering, the Company filed a registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company
incurred costs of $510,840 associated with the offering. All costs
incurred associated with the sale of stock and acquisition were
deducted from the proceeds of the sale of stock.

On May 31, 1991, PB&T acquired and assumed from the Resolution Trust
Corporation (RTC) certain assets and liabilities of the former
Tennessee Federal Savings Bank, Bartlett, Tennessee (TFSB). The Bank
paid to the RTC $414,000 for the right to acquire and assume certain
assets and liabilities of TFSB. The aggregate amount of liabilities
assumed approximated $18,788,000 and the assets acquired approximated
$15,886,000, including $11,450,000 of net loans. Also acquired was
$2,829,000 in cash equivalents and $1,575,000 in federal funds sold.
As part of the purchase and assumption agreement with the RTC, PB&T's
excess in the fair value of liabilities assumed from the RTC over the
fair value of assets acquired is funded by the RTC. PB&T recorded a
receivable of $2,507,835 at December 31, 1991 due from the RTC to
recognize the net liabilities assumed and other miscellaneous items
due from the RTC. Since the RTC paid cash to PB&T for the
difference between the fair value of liabilities and assets, no
goodwill was recorded in connection with this acquisition. Discount
recorded on loans amounted to $2,053,000. The discount is being
accreted to yield a constant rate over the expected life of the
loans acquired. The amount due from the RTC was received in 1992 and
included $400,000 paid by the RTC to the bank as consideration for a
settlement and release agreement between the RTC and the PB&T with
respect to the purchase and assumption agreement.

The TFSB transaction was accounted for as a purchase whereby assets
acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated 
fair market value as of the acquisition date. Results of operations
of the acquired assets and liabilities have been included in the 
Company's consolidated statements of earnings since acquisition.

(12) EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND DEFERRED COMPENSATION

CFSB has a noncontributory, defined-benefit retirement plan for
substantially all eligible employees. CFSB is a member of the
Financial Institutions Retirement Fund, which is a nonprofit pension
trust through which the Federal Home Loan Bank, savings banks and
similar institutions may cooperate in providing for the retirement of
their employees. No contributions were required in 1993, 1992, and
1991. The Bank's policy is to fund pension costs as accrued.

In January 1992, the CFSB paid its deferred compensation obligation
to its directors and terminated all deferred compensation agreements.
Deferred compensation expense amounted to $61,679 for the year ended
December 31, 1991. There was no deferred compensation expense in
1993 or 1992.

The Company does not provided postretirement or postemployment
benefits other than those mentioned above.

(13) FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1991

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991
(FDICIA) was signed into law on December 19, 1991. FDICIA includes
provisions requiring "prompt corrective action" for insured
depository institutions that do not meet certain capitalization
criteria. Regulations implementing the prompt corrective action
provisions of FDICIA became effective on December 19, 1992. In
addition to the prompt corrective action requirements, FDICIA
includes significant changes to the legal and regulatory environment
for insured institutions, including reductions in insurance coverage
for certain kinds of deposits, increased supervision by the federal
regulatory agencies, increased reporting requirements for insured
institutions, and new regulations concerning internal controls,
accounting, and operations.

The prompt corrective action regulations define specific capital
categories based on an institution's capital ratios. The capital
categories, in declining order, are "well capitalized "adequately
capitalized", "undercapitalized", "significantly undercapitalized",
and "critically undercapitalized". To be considered "adequately
capitalized," an institution must generally have a leverage ratio of
at least 4%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 4%, and a
total risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%. An institution is
deemed to be "critically under capitalized" if it has a tangible
equity ratio of 2% or less.

At December 31, 1993, PB&T and CFSB meet the criteria for "Adequately
Capitalized" institutions as defined by FDICIA.

(14) SUPERVISORY AGREEMENT

CFSB entered into a supervisory agreement with the Office of Thrift
Supervision dated September 13, 1991. CFSB complied with the
provisions of the agreement and on November 17, 1993, the Office of
Thrift Supervision released CFSB from the agreement.

(15) RESTRICTIONS ON DIVIDENDS

Dividends paid by the subsidiaries are the primary source of funds
available for payment of normal operating expenses of the Company.
The subsidiaries are subject to federal and state statutes and
regulations that impose restrictions on the amounts that may be
declared. Under the most restrictive of the statutes and
regulations, the subsidiaries could declare dividends up to
approximately $4,800,000 and $3,700,000 at December 31, 1993 and
1992, respectively.

In connection with the conversion of Citizens Federal Savings Bank
from a mutual savings bank to a stock savings bank, CFSB established
a liquidation account equal to its retained earnings as of the date
of the latest consolidated balance sheet (approximately $1,750,000)
used in the final conversion offering circular. In the event of
future liquidation of CFSB (and only in such event), an eligible
deposit account holder who continues to maintain his deposit account
shall be entitled to receive a distribution from the liquidation
account, in the proportionate amount of the adjusted balance from
deposit accounts held at that time, before any liquidation
distributions may be made with respect to capital stock. No
dividends may be paid to stockholders if such dividends reduce
retained earnings of CFSB below the amount required for the
liquidation account.

(16) CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS

Regulatory capital guidelines of the Federal Reserve Board for bank
holding companies which require a minimum of 4.0 percent for a Tier I
leverage capital ratio (essentially equity divided by total assets),
4.0 percent for Tier I capital to risk weighted assets ratio, and 8.0
percent total capital to risk-weighted assets. The risk-based
guideline is based on the assignment of risk weights to assets and
off-balance sheet items depending on the level of credit risk
associated with them. The Company's capital ratios were in excess of
the minimum regulatory requirements at December 31, 1993.

(17) STOCK OPTIONS

A senior officer of the Company, as part of his employment contract,
has the option to purchase 2,000 shares of common stock at the
original issue price of $25 per share. This option may be exercised
after the officer completes ten years of continuous service with the
Company. The option may not be exercised before 1998.

Two officers of CFSB have the right to receive 1,111 shares of common
stock, subject to their continued employment with CFSB through
February 1, 1995, at which time they will receive these shares.

(18) PENDING MERGER

The Company has entered into an agreement and plan of reorganization
with Trans Financial Bancorp, Inc. (TFB), whereby each outstanding
share of the Company will be exchanged for 5.5 shares of TFB common
stock. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and is
expected to be consummated in the second quarter of 1994.
