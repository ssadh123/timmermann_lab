FOR RELEASE AT 5:55 AM PDT THURSDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1994

Louisiana-Pacific Completes Best Quarter Ever;
Nine-Month Earnings Already Surpass
Best Full-Year Results in L-P History
(Portland, Ore.; Oct. 13, 1994) -- Louisiana-Pacific Corp. (NYSE:
LPX) today reported its best quarter ever, setting records in both earnings
and sales.
Third quarter 1994 earnings were a record $95.1 million, up 129
percent from 1993 third quarter earnings of $41.5 million. Third quarter
sales of $818.4 were also a record, exceeding 1993 third quarter sales by 30
percent.
On a per share basis, L-P earned $.86 in the third quarter of this
year, compared to $.38 in the comparable quarter a year ago.
"Both demand and pricing of structural panels -- particularly
oriented strand board -- were exceptional during the quarter," said Harry A.
Merlo, Louisiana-Pacific's chairman and president. "We also saw a return to
profitability for our pulp business after 12 straight quarters of losses."
Mr. Merlo said that nine-month earnings of $262.2 million already
surpassed the previous full-year earnings record set last year. On a per
share basis, the company earned $2.38 in the first nine months of 1994,
compared to 1993 nine-month earnings of $1.78
Louisiana-Pacific is a major building products company known for its
innovation in developing high-performance, affordable, environmentally sound
building materials and for its commitment to totally chlorine-free paper
pulp.

CONSOLIDATED SUMMARY OF EARNINGS
(Dollar amounts in millions except per share) (Unaudited)

NOTES:

(1) Earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the periods (110,120,000 in 1994 and
109,670,000 in 1993). The effect of common stock equivalents is not
material. The number of shares and per share data have been retroactively
adjusted for stock splits.

(2) The effective income tax rate is based on estimates of annual amounts of
taxable income, foreign sales corporation income and other factors. These
estimates are updated quarterly.

(3) Determination of interim LIFO inventories requires estimates of year-end
inventory quantities and costs. These estimates are revised quarterly and
the estimated annual change in LIFO inventory reserves is expensed over the
remainder of the year.

(4) The cumulative effects of accounting changes relates to the adoption of
two Financial Accounting Standards Board Statements during the first quarter
of 1993. Adoption of Statement No. 106, "Employers' Accounting for
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions" resulted in a charge of $3.2
million or $.03 per share, net of $1.9 million in income taxes. Adoption of
Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" resulted in a charge of $7.2
million or $.06 per share.
