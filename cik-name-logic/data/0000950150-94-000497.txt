ITEM 2. ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

On April 26, 1994, DE Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation
and wholly-owned subsidiary of Spelling Entertainment Group Inc. (the
"Company") merged (the "Merger") with and into Republic Pictures Corporation, a
Delaware corporation ("Republic"). As a result of the Merger, Republic became
a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Republic is engaged in the
development and production of television programming and the distribution of
its extensive library of feature films and television programming.

In connection with the Merger, each share of the common stock of Republic
("Republic Common Stock") outstanding immediately prior to the effective time
of the Merger (the "Effective Time") was converted into the right to receive
$13.00, without interest. Options and warrants to acquire Republic Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time were converted into the
right to receive, upon payment of the exercise price (as adjusted as set forth
below), 1.6508 shares of the Company's common stock for each share of Republic
Common Stock into which such option or warrant was exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time. The exercise price of such options and warrants
was adjusted by multiplying such exercise price by 0.6058.

In connection with the Merger, the Company in October 1993 issued 13,362,215 
shares of its Common Stock to Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation
("Blockbuster") in exchange for 3,652,542 shares of Blockbuster's common stock
(the "Blockbuster Shares"). The Blockbuster Shares were subsequently resold,
with the Company realizing approximately $100,445,000 in proceeds. The Company
used these proceeds to prepay or redeem (i) all of the outstanding principal
amount of its 10% Senior Subordinated Notes and 12% Subordinated Debentures,
(ii) approximately $39,500,000 of bank debt and (iii) all of the Company's
outstanding preferred stock. As a result, the Company borrowed $100,000,000 
under its credit agreement, dated January 31, 1994, by and between the 
Company and Blockbuster and the balance of the consideration necessary to fund
the Merger came from the Company's working capital.

The press release relating to the Merger, dated April 26, 1994, is 
attached hereto as Exhibit 99 and incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

The Company hereby provides the following description of its common stock,
which description supersedes and replaces all prior descriptions of such common
stock:

All holders of common stock, $.10 par value per share, of the Company ("Common
Stock") are entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters
submitted to a vote of the Company's shareholders. Votes may not be cumulated
in the election of directors. Holders of Common Stock have no preemptive or
subscription rights. The Common Stock is neither redeemable nor convertible.
Holders of Common Stock are entitled to dividends when and as declared by the
Company's Board of Directors from funds legally available therefore and are
entitled, in the event of liquidation, to share ratably in all assets remaining
after payment of liabilities, subject in each instance to any preferential
rights of the holders of any outstanding preferred stock of the Company.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To Republic Pictures Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Republic
Pictures Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and subsidiaries as of December
31, 1993, and the related consolidated statements of operations and cash 
flows for the year then ended. These financial statements are the 
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express 
an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of Republic Pictures Corporation
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1993, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for the year then ended in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

REPUBLIC PICTURES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 - Significant Accounting Policies:

Basis of presentation: The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Republic Pictures Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its
subsidiaries (collectively, the "Company"), after elimination of intercompany
balances and transactions. These financial statements present the Company's
historical financial results and other information on an independent, going
concern basis, and do not give effect to the Company's pending merger with
Spelling Entertainment Group Inc. ("Spelling") (see Note 3).

Revenues and participations: Television and international video and theatrical
license agreements are recognized when the license agreement is accepted, the
film is available to the licensee and collectibility of the license fee is
reasonably assured. Sales of videocassettes are recognized upon shipment, less
an allowance for estimated returns. Participation expenses, if applicable, are
recognized concurrently with the related revenue.

Film costs: Film costs include production, acquisition and certain film
servicing costs. These costs are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable
value. Approximately $32,151,000 of the Company's net film costs at December
31, 1993 related to acquisition or production costs being amortized using the
individual film forecast method, whereby costs are expensed in the proportion
that gross revenues bear to management's estimate of ultimate aggregate
revenues. Additional net film costs of $5,360,000, related principally to
older product, are amortized using the straight-line basis generally over a
10-year period, which in management's opinion should not differ materially from
the individual film forecast method. Accumulated film cost amortization at
December 31, 1993 and 1992 was $159,927,000 and $129,115,000, respectively.
Based upon the Company's estimates of revenue as of December 31, 1993,
approximately 60% of unamortized film costs will be amortized during the
three-year period ending December 31, 1996.

Inventories: Inventories, substantially consisting of finished goods, include
blank and completed videocassettes. Inventories are stated at the lower of
cost or net realizable value.

Fixed assets: Fixed assets are depreciated using the straight-line basis over
the estimated useful asset lives, generally within five years.

Income taxes: Income taxes in 1991 were provided for earnings at the
appropriate statutory rates. Deferred income taxes are established for revenue
and expense items recognized in different periods for financial reporting
purposes than for income tax purposes.

Cumulative effect on prior years of a change in accounting principles:
Effective January 1992 the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 109, "Accounting For Income Taxes," ("SFAS 109"). The adoption of
SFAS 109 changed the Company's method of

8
<PAGE> 10
REPUBLIC PICTURES CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(CONTINUED)

NOTE 1 - Significant Accounting Policies (continued):

accounting for income taxes from the deferred method to an asset and liability 
approach. Previously, the Company deferred the tax effect of timing differences
between financial reporting and taxable income. On the other hand, the asset
and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and
assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and the tax bases
of other assets and liabilities.

Earnings per common share: Earnings per share are computed by dividing net
income (loss) available to common shareholders by the weighted average number
of common shares and dilutive common share equivalents (stock options and
warrants) outstanding.

NOTE 2 - Notes Payable:

As of July 15, 1991, the Company entered into a three-year, $50 million
revolving credit facility (the "Agreement") with a consortium of commercial
banks, including Chemical Bank serving as agent. At the Company's election,
outstanding borrowings bear an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1 3/4% or the prime
rate plus 3/4%. The facility also bears a commitment fee at an annual rate of
3/8% on unused funds. Availability under the facility is determined using a
borrowing base, which includes eligible accounts receivables and certain other
assets. As of December 31, 1993, total availability was $50,000,000 and there
were no outstanding borrowings. Borrowings under the Agreement are secured by
film costs, inventories, receivables and other assets. Pursuant to the
Agreement, the Company is required to obtain the bank group's consent prior to
entering into certain significant transactions, and restrictions are placed on
the Company's ability to declare dividends. The Agreement contains certain
covenants regarding net worth, retained earnings, general and administrative
expenses and the ratio of total liabilities to net worth, all of which the
Company is satisfying.

Notes payable consisted of the following at December 31, 1993 and 1992:

NOTE 2 - Notes Payable (continued):

Interest paid, net of amounts capitalized, for all debt in 1993, 1992 and 1991,
amounted to $658,000, $1,135,000 and $1,657,000, respectively.

Inasmuch as the Company expects to complete its merger with Spelling in April
1994 (see Note 3), there are no plans to renew or extend the Agreement, which
is scheduled to expire on June 30, 1994.

NOTE 3 - Shareholders' Equity:

In January 1993 the Company and Blockbuster Entertainment Corporation
("Blockbuster") entered into an agreement (the "Agreement"), pursuant to which
in February 1993 an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Blockbuster acquired
from the Company 2,500,000 shares of newly issued Class A Common Stock for
$10.00 per share. Pursuant to the Agreement, the $25,000,000 proceeds from the
stock issuance were placed in an escrow account until shareholder approval of a
recapitalization of the Company's Common Stock, which occurred on July 27,
1993.

The recapitalization, for which $562,000 in costs were incurred, involved the
establishment of a new, single class of Common Stock ("New Common Stock"), of
which one share and 1.2 shares were issued in exchange for each existing share
of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock, respectively. Holders of the
old Class A and Class B Common Stock had been entitled to one vote and ten
votes per share, respectively. A total of 15,000,000 shares of the New Common
Stock are authorized for issuance. The Company also has authorized the issuance
of 1,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, of which none have been issued. A
summary of activity in shareholders' equity appears below (dollar amounts in
thousands):

</TABLE> 

These options vest within no more than three years and are exercisable at the

During 1993, there were a total of 255,000 shares of Common Stock issued upon
the exercise of stock options which had been granted outside of the Plans, at
exercise prices of $5.00 - $6.00 per share. As of December 31, 1993, there

50,000 shares of Common Stock at $9.13 per share.

The Company has issued three Common Stock purchase warrants, each of which

which may purchase an aggregate of 810,000 shares at $11.50 per share. The
third warrant, owned by a limited partnership of which the Company's Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer is the general partner, provides for the
acquisition of 500,000 shares at $12.50 per share.

NOTE 6 - Consolidated Television Venture:

In January 1989 the Company and United Artists Entertainment Company ("UAE"),
now a wholly owned subsidiary of Tele-Communications, Inc. ("TCI"), formed a
joint venture, Republic Pictures Television ("RPT"), to finance substantially
all of the Company's television development and production activities through
1993. The Chairman of TCI is a Director of the Company. In 1992 the Company
entered into an agreement in principle with TCI to amend their joint venture
agreement, whereby the Company will purchase TCI's interest in RPT by June 30,
1996, at a price and on terms to be negotiated, which will be affected by the
venture's current and projected future operating results. As of January 1,
1992, TCI was relieved of its cash funding obligations to RPT, in exchange for
which the Company received priority recoupment of its additional investment and
accelerated recoupment of certain previously deferred fees.

The Company's consolidated financial statements include RPT. Beginning in 1992
TCI's share of the joint venture has been reclassified in the Company's
Statement of Operations from minority interest to television operating results.

For the years ended December 31, 1993, 1992 and 1991, RPT's operating revenues
were $11,297,000, $11,515,000 and $26,123,000, respectively, and its operating
losses were $2,231,000, $5,838,000 and $574,000, respectively. As of December
31, 1993 and 1992, RPT's total assets were $18,146,000 and $18,028,000,
respectively. Total assets at December 31, 1993 included $4,918,000 in film
costs, of which $774,000 are recoupable, nonrefundable advances to writers and
producers which are allocable to projects which may arise within the respective
contractual terms.

NOTE 6 - Consolidated Television Venture (Continued):

As of December 31, 1993, RPT's future commitments to writers and producers
under contract amounted to $713,000. The Company leases offices on behalf of
RPT under a 5-year agreement which commenced in May 1990. The lease provides
for lease payments of $484,000 and $163,000, respectively, for the years
ending December 31, 1994 and 1995. Pursuant to the terms of the lease
agreement, the Company is responsible for all maintenance, insurance and
property taxes.

NOTE 7 - Business Segments:

The Company operates principally in two business segments: the distribution to
domestic and international television broadcasters of theatrical and television
programming, some of which is produced by the Company, and the sale in North
America of videocassettes or the licensing to international licensees of video
and theatrical rights. The consolidated statement of operations presents

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA CONDENSED COMBINED
FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The following Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet and 
Statement Of Operations assume (i) the acquisition by the Company of 100% of
the outstanding shares of common stock of Republic and (ii) the issuance of
13,362,215 shares of the Company's Common Stock, which occurred on October 5,
1993 but was negotiated in connection with (and in order to fund) the Company's
then proposed Merger with Republic. This information has been prepared on the
basis of and utilizing the historical and pro forma financial information
described in the accompanying Notes to Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed
Combined Financial Information ("Notes"). This information should be read in
conjunction with the historical financial statements of the Company and
Republic and related Notes thereto.

The accompanying pro forma financial information with respect to Republic 
is preliminary in nature, because the Company does not yet have final
information as to the fair market value of Republic's individual assets and
liabilities or the effect of the consolidation of the operations of the Company
and Republic. The actual adjustments to the accounts of Republic will be made
on the basis of the Company's appraisals and internal valuations as of the
consummation of the acquisition of Republic, and, therefore, the pro forma
information does not give effect to all adjustments which may ultimately be
required to reflect the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed
or the effect of the consolidation of operations.

The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance Sheet assumes that the 
Company acquired Republic on December 31, 1993 and adjusted its historical 
balance sheet as of that date to reflect the pro forma effects of the
Merger under the purchase method of accounting and the financing of this
transaction. The Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of
Operations for the year ended December 31, 1993 assumes that the Company
acquired Republic on January 1, 1993 and adjusted its historical statement of
operations to reflect the Merger under the purchase method of accounting, and
the effects of the issuance of the Company's Common Stock and the
financing of the Merger.

This pro forma financial information is not intended to reflect the results of 
operations or the financial position which would have actually resulted had the
Merger been effective on the dates indicated. Moreover, this pro forma
information is not intended to be indicative of the results of operations or
the financial position which may be obtained in the future.

NOTE 2 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information is based on
historical financial statements of the Company and Republic, adjusted in the
case of Republic to reflect the purchase method of accounting.

NOTE 3 - ALLOCATIONS OF PURCHASE PRICE FOR REPUBLIC

The aggregate purchase price paid for the shares of Republic by the Company
exceeded the historical book value of the identifiable net assets of Republic
by $53,865,000. For purposes of the pro forma presentation, on the basis of
the Company's current estimates of fair values, the carrying values of the
Company's real estate and certain liabilities has been increased, together with
the related income tax effect. Of the total shares acquired, 2,550,000 shares
were owned by Blockbuster; accordingly, the Company has accounted for such
shares at Blockbuster's carrying value. The excess of the cash consideration
paid to Blockbuster over such carrying value has been recorded as a charge
($7,650) to the Company's capital in excess of par value. The remainder of the
purchase price after such allocations is reflected as cost in excess of fair
value of net assets acquired.

NOTE 4 - ADJUSTMENTS TO HISTORICAL BALANCE SHEET

Preliminary adjustments to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Balance 
Sheet are as follows (in thousands):

(a) To reflect changes in cash due to payment of costs related to
the Merger.

(b) The fair value of Republic's film and television costs are
currently being evaluated.

(c) To increase the book value of Republic's real estate to
estimated fair value of $2,500.

(d) To eliminate deferred merger costs.

(e) To record excess of purchase price over the fair value of net 
assets acquired, net of an adjustment of $7,650 to reflect 
the excess of the cash consideration paid for Blockbuster's 
ownership interest in Republic over Blockbuster's carrying 
value for such interest.

(f) To record estimated severance and other costs related to 
certain employees expected to be terminated as a result of 
the Merger.

(g) To record funds borrowed under the Blockbuster credit facility
to fund the cash payments to the shareholders of Republic.

(h) To record the income tax effect of book/tax basis differences
related to the above purchase adjustments.

(i) To eliminate Republic's historical equity accounts.

NOTE 5 - ADJUSTMENTS TO HISTORICAL STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS

Preliminary adjustments to the Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined 
Statement of Operations are as follows:

(a) Since the fair values of the film and television costs are
currently being evaluated, no amortization effect can be
computed for such assets. Amortization of the excess of cost 
over fair value of net assets acquired has been computed 
using an estimated life of forty years.

(b) The Company is currently evaluating the potential
opportunities for reducing costs which may result from the
consolidation of the operations of the Company and Republic.

(c) To eliminate merger costs which had been expensed.

(d) To reflect interest costs related to the debt financing under
the Blockbuster credit facility.

(e) To reflect the reduction in interest costs and dividends
resulting from the redemption and repayment of bank and other
debt and Preferred Stock as of January 1, 1993 with the 
proceeds from the issuance of Common Stock, such reductions 
being limited to the extent of actual interest expense and 
dividends paid for the year ended December 31, 1993.

(f) A tax provision has been computed on the pro forma adjustments
using a marginal tax rate of 43%.

(g) To reflect the effect of the issuance of the 13,362,215 shares
of Common Stock as of January 1, 1993.

NOTE 6 - EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

The unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statement of Operations does not
reflect the extraordinary items or discontinued operations reflected in the
historical financial statements of the Company.

NOTE 7 - NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE

Net income per common share amounts are based on the pro forma weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the year ended December 31, 1993.
Pro forma primary and fully-diluted net income per common share are not
presented as they result in a dilution of less than 3% from basic net income
per common share.
