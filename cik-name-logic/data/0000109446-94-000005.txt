FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 22, 1994
ZURN INDUSTRIES, INC. COMMENTS ON 
FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS ESTIMATES

Erie, PA ... Zurn Industries, Inc. (New York Stock Exchange), a leading

designer, constructor and manufacturer of systems and equipment for power

generation and water control, and Lynx golf equipment, announced today that it

expects the fourth quarter ending March 31, 1994 to be only marginally

profitable and substantially below both last year's fourth quarter earnings of

$.47 per share, excluding gains from the sales of businesses, and earnings of

$.40 per share in the third quarter of the current year. Lower than expected

sales of golf clubs and the combined effect of high warranty costs and low

operating levels in the boiler equipment business are the main contributors to

the reduced earnings expectation.
