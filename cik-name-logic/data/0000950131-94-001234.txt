CHEMICAL WASTE MANAGEMENT, INC. RECEIVES PROPOSAL
FROM WMX TECHNOLOGIES, INC. FOR ACQUISITION OF SHARES

Oak Brook, Illinois, July 28, 1994 -- Chemical Waste Management, Inc. 
today announced that its parent company, WMX Technologies, Inc., has proposed to
acquire the outstanding Chem Waste shares that WMX does not already own.

Under the proposal, each holder of Chemical Waste Management shares other 
than WMX would receive .27 of a WMX share for each share of Chemical Waste 
Management common stock held.

WMX Technologies owns approximately 78.6 percent of Chemical Waste 
Management's 209.1 million outstanding shares with the balance, approximately 
44.9 million shares, being publicly held. On July 28, 1994, the closing price of
Chemical Waste Management common stock on the New York Stock Exchange was $7.875
per share, and for WMX was $29.125 per share.

At a meeting held earlier today, Chemical Waste Management's Board of 
Directors referred the WMX proposal to a special committee of independent Chem 
Waste directors. The WMX proposal contemplates a tax-free merger of Chem Waste 
and a WMX subsidiary and would be subject to the approval of the holders of a 
majority of Chemical Waste Management's outstanding shares other than shares 
held by WMX voting on the proposal at a stockholders meeting. The special 
committee has engaged the law firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom as 
its independent counsel and will also select an investment banking firm to 
advise it on the proposal.
