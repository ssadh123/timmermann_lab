Item 5. Other Events

On November 15, 1993, NYNEX Corporation
("NYNEX") and New England Telephone and
Telegraph Company ("New England Telephone")
filed suit in the United States District Court
for the District of Maine seeking an order
declaring that section 533(b) of the Cable
Communications Policy Act of 1984 is
unconstitutional and permanently enjoining the
United States from enforcing section 533(b)
against NYNEX. Section 533(b) prohibits NYNEX
from providing video programming to subscribers
in areas where New England Telephone or New
York Telephone Company ("New York Telephone")
provide service. On December 8, 1994, the
court issued an opinion and order declaring
that section 533(b) is unconstitutional and
stating that it will enjoin the enforcement of
section 533(b) against NYNEX and its
subsidiaries, including New York Telephone,
within the NYNEX service area. The Department
of Justice is expected to appeal.
