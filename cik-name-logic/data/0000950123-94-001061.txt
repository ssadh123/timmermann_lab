ITEM 8. CHANGE IN FISCAL YEAR

On March 28, 1994, the Board of Directors of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. ("Lehman Brothers") approved a change in its fiscal year-end from
December 31 to November 30. Such a change was subject to the completion of the
distribution (the "Distribution") by American Express Company ("American
Express") to its common shareholders of record on May 20, 1994, of all of the 
common stock of Lehman Brothers, par value $.10 per share, that American 
Express held on the date of the Distribution. The change in the fiscal 
year-end became effective on May 31, 1994, the date on which the Distribution 
was effected.

Lehman Brothers expects to file a Report on Form 10-Q for the
quarterly period ending June 30, 1994 with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") on or about August 14, 1994; and, in conjunction
with its decision to change its fiscal year, Lehman Brothers anticipates that
its financial statements for the transition period ending November 30, 1994, 
will be contained in a Report on Form 10-K which it expects to file with the
Commission on or about February 28, 1995.
