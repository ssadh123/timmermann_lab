Alcoa Begins Process To Close California Plant

Pittsburgh, Pa., March 15, 1994 -- Alcoa is beginning
an orderly shutdown of its plant at Vernon, CA, near Los Angeles.
The closure follows a vote Saturday March 12, by employees
represented by Local 808 of the United Auto Workers to reject a
proposal by the company to renegotiate the present labor
agreement.

The plant produces aluminum forgings and extrusions,
principally for the aerospace industry, and has about 700
employees.

Announcing the closing, Alcoa reported that the action
will result in an after-tax charge of $50.0 million, or $0.56 a
common share, against first quarter 1994 earnings.

Alcoa said it had sought contract concessions to offset
financial losses caused by declining levels of business and by
competitors with lower total compensation costs. The company
added that at meetings held last week before the vote, employees
were told that a rejection to discuss the concessions would
result in the shutdown of the plant.

Customers are being notified of the closing, and Alcoa
is studying the extent to which the plant's orders can be
redirected to other company locations.
