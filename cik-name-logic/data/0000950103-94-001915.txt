FEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION
THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 1994
FINANCIAL RESULTS

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

MEMPHIS, March 11, 1994 ... Federal Express Corporation today reported net
income for the quarter ended February 28, of $31.2 million or $0.55 per
share, compared to net income of $8.5 million or $0.15 in last year's third
quarter.

Revenues for the quarter were $2,077.4 million , up 7% year-over-year
from $1,939.8 million. Operating income was $85.3 million, compared to
last year's $58.3 million and pretax income was $57.7 million, compared
to $16.9 million last year. Non-operating income included a pre-tax gain
of $10.9 million from the sale of several 727-100 aircraft and engines
during the quarter.

The company also reported an international operating loss for the quarter
of $18.3 million, on international revenues of $539.3 million, compared to
an operating loss of $61.3 million on revenues of $513.7 million in last
year's third quarter.

U.S. domestic operating profit was $103.6 million, compared to $119.6
million last year. U.S. domestic revenues increased 8% to $1,538.1
million, from $1,426.1 million during the same period a year ago.

Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frederick W. Smith commented, "The
reduction of our international operating loss in this quarter was again the
primary factor in our year-over-year earnings improvement. The
repositioning of many of our international flights on March 1, 1993,
reduced the capacity available for non-time-definite air freight and
improved our delivery times for express packages. This schedule change has
provided lower, year-over-year, international expenses for the last four
quarters. Also, we had continued strong volume growth in our International
Priority service, which was up 15% over last year's third quarter.
International Priority package yields remain stable, contributing to high
incremental profit margins on our largely fixed-cost international air
system."

With respect to the company's U.S. domestic operations, Chief Financial
Officer Alan B. Graf, Jr. said, "During the quarter, we suffered the combined
effects of lower than anticipated package volume during the last week of
December and higher operating costs due in part to the Los Angeles
earthquake in January and several severe snowstorms in the eastern U.S.
Consequently, our U.S. domestic operating income fell below last year's
level."

"However, our U.S. operations did achieve productivity increases, improved
healthcare claims experience, double-digit package volume growth and
benefited from lower fuel prices," Graf continued. "In the absence of
pricing flexibility in today's U.S. express market, we will continue to
aggressively pursue cost reductions through technological and operational
improvements."

Note: As previously reported, fiscal year 1993 first, second and third

for the adoption of an accounting standard (FAS 106) that requires
current period accrual of expense related to future postretirement
health care benefits. The accounting change added $3.8 million to
the third quarter operating expense reported last year ($0.04 per
share, after tax).
