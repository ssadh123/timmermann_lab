Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On July 18, 1994, Vishay Intertechnology, Inc.

("Registrant") consummated an agreement with Thomas & Betts

Corporation, a New Jersey corporation ("Seller"), to purchase all

of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Vitramon,

Incorporated, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned

subsidiary of Seller, and Vitramon Limited, an English

corporation, and an indirect subsidiary of Seller (collectively,

"Vitramon"), for consideration of $184 million in cash. 

Vitramon's business involves the design, manufacture and sale of

multilayer ceramic chip capacitors and certain types of filters

(the "Business"). Registrant has no current intention to change

the nature of the Business.

The purchase price was funded from a $200,000,000 bridge and

term loan facility made available to Registrant under the Vishay

Intertechnology, Inc. $200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement

dated as of July 18, 1994 (the "Acquisition Loan Agreement"), by

and among Registrant and Comerica Bank, N.A., NationsBank of

North Carolina, N.A., Berliner-Handels-und Frankfurter Bank,

Signet Bank / Maryland, CoreStates Bank, N.A., Bank Hapoalim,

B.M., ABN AMRO Bank, N.V. New York Branch, Credit Lyonnais New

York Branch, Meridian Bank, Bank Leumi le-Israel, B.M. and Credit

Suisse (collectively, the "Banks"), and Comerica Bank, N.A. as

agent for the Banks (the "Agent"). The Acquisition Loan

Agreement is comprised of a $100 million bridge facility due on
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 3

July 18, 1996 (the "Bridge Facility") and a $100 million non-

amortizing term facility due on July 18, 2001 (the "Acquisition

Term Facility"). The facilities will bear interest at variable

rates based, at the option of Registrant, on the prime rate or

LIBOR. In addition, with respect to the Acquisition Term

Facility, Registrant may, at its option, elect a fixed rate of

interest for the remainder of the term of the loan.

In addition, on July 18, 1994, Registrant and certain of its

subsidiaries entered into bank agreements (the "Bank Agreements")

with the Banks and the Agent. The Bank Agreements amended and

restated Registrant's previously-existing revolving credit and

term loan agreements. 

After giving effect to the Bank Agreements and the

Acquisition Loan Agreement, the Company's domestic credit

facilities consist of a $200,000,000 revolving credit facility

that matures on December 31, 1997, subject to the Company's right

to request year-to-year renewals thereafter, a $102,500,000

domestic term loan (the "Domestic Term Loan") that matures on

December 31, 2000, the $100,000,000 Bridge Facility, due on July

18, 1996 and a $100,000,000 non-amortizing domestic term loan

due July 18, 2001. Borrowings under these facilities bear

interest at variable rates based on the prime rate or, at the

Company's option, LIBOR; at July 18, 1994, the rates ranged from

4.9375% to 5.5%. With respect to the Domestic Term Loan, the
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 4

Company may elect, at its option, a fixed rate of interest for

the remainder of the term of such loan.

The Banks also provide Deutsche Mark ("DM") denominated

revolving credit and term loan facilities for certain of the

Company's German subsidiaries, which permit borrowings, in the

aggregate, of DM 153,821,990 including a DM 40,000,000 revolving

credit facility that matures on December 31, 1997, subject to the

borrower's right to request year-to-year renewals thereafter, a

DM 9,506,000 term loan that matures on December 31, 1994 and a DM

104,315,990 term loan that matures on December 31, 1997. 

Borrowings bear interest at variable rates based on LIBOR; at

July 18, 1994, the rates ranged from 5.875% to 6.0%.

As a result of the amendments contained in the Bank

Agreements, all of the Company's bank facilities are unsecured

and all collateral currently held by the Banks in connection with

the previously-existing revolving credit and term loan agreements

will be released. However, the facilities are cross-guaranteed

by the Company and certain of its subsidiaries. The Bank

Agreements also resulted in a decrease in interest rates from

those previously in effect, as well as a significant reduction in

the number of financial and restrictive covenants. Financial

covenants are currently limited to requirements regarding

leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and minimum tangible
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 5

net worth. Other restrictive covenants include limitations on

the payment of cash dividends, guaranties and liens.

The foregoing is a summary of certain terms of the

Acquisition Loan Agreement and the Bank Agreements and is

qualified in its entirety by reference to such agreements, copies

of which are annexed as exhibits to this Report on Form 8-K.

Further, Registrant intends shortly to file a Registration

Statement on Form S-3 with the Commission relating to a public

offering of approximately 2,750,000 shares of Registrant's common

stock, and to use the net proceeds (estimated at approximately,

$111,375,000, based on a closing price of $42.50 of the common

stock on July 14, 1994) to repay the Bridge Facility and to

reduce Registrant's revolving credit borrowings. Accordingly,

the Pro Forma Financial Information annexed to this Report gives

effect to the sale of shares of Registrant's common stock, and

the use of the estimated net proceeds therefrom to repay the

Bridge Facility and to reduce Registrant's revolving credit

borrowings. Footnote F to the Pro Forma Condensed Consolidated

Financial Statements sets forth relevant financial information to

take into account the adjustments to the Pro Forma Financial

Information in the event the public offering is not consummated.

(Unaudited)

The following pro forma condensed consolidated balance sheet
(unaudited) as of March 31, 1994 and pro forma condensed

stock of Vitramon from Thomas & Betts Corporation and (ii) the
sale by Vishay of 2,750,000 shares of Common Stock pursuant to a

$42.50 per share based on the closing market price of the Common
Stock on July 14, 1994) and the use of such proceeds to fund the
prepayment of the Bridge Facility and reduce revolving credit
borrowings. The pro forma condensed consolidated statements of

Vishay as if both of the above mentioned transactions were

based on the historical financial statements of Vishay and
Vitramon, giving effect to the acquisition under the purchase
method of accounting and the assumptions and adjustments set
forth in the accompanying notes.

These pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared by Vishay's management based upon the audited
combined financial statements of Vitramon for the year ended
January 1, 1994 and the unaudited combined interim financial
statements of Vitramon as of and for the quarter ended April 2,
1994. These pro forma financial statements may not be indicative
of the results that actually would have occurred if Vishay had
acquired all of the capital stock of Vitramon on the dates
indicated or those that may be obtained in the future. The pro
forma financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements of Vishay included in Vishay's
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1993
and Vishay's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended

NOTES TO PRO FORMA CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(UNAUDITED) (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS)

Certain financial information has been derived from the combined
audited financial statements and notes thereto of Vitramon for
the year ended January 1, 1994 and from Vitramon's unaudited
combined interim financial statements as of and for the quarter ended
April 2, 1994.

(A) Reflects an increase in outstanding indebtedness as a result
of the purchase by Vishay of all of the capital stock of Vitramon
from Thomas & Betts. Assumes additional borrowings of $200,000
(including $100,000 Bridge Facility) from a syndicate of banks,
use of $186,700 of such borrowings to finance the acquisition and
use of $13,300 to reduce revolving credit borrowings, which
results in increased long-term debt of $186,700. Purchase price
and related costs financed through long-term debt:

Purchase price . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 184,000
Professional fees and other liabilities. . . . . . . 2,700
---------
Total purchase price . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 186,700
=========
(B) Reflects the assumed receipt of the estimated net proceeds
of $111.4 million from the proposed sale by Vishay of 2,750,000
shares of Common Stock pursuant to a contemplated public offering
(assuming a public offering price of $42.50 per share based on
the closing market price of the Common Stock on July 14, 1994)
and the use of such proceeds to fund the prepayment of the
$100,000 Bridge Facility and to reduce revolving credit borrowings.

Common stock . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 275 
Other stockholders' equity . . . . . . . . . . . . . 111,100 

(C) Under purchase accounting, Vitramon's assets and liabilities
are required to be adjusted from historical amounts to their
estimated fair values. Purchase accounting adjustments have been
preliminarily estimated by Vishay's management based upon
available information and are believed by management to be
reasonable. There can be no assurance, however, that the
estimated adjustments represent the final purchase accounting
adjustments that will ultimately be determined by Vishay. The
following pro forma adjustments have been made to reflect the
estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities of Vitramon
as of March 31, 1994 and to eliminate assets and liabilities

Vitramon's management charges from parent noted above represent
services provided by Thomas & Betts for general management,
accounting, internal audit, cash management, risk management,
human resources, legal and tax services. These costs have been
eliminated as Vishay's current organization is structured to
provide these management services without incurring significant
additional costs.

(E) Earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 1993 and
the three months ended March 31, 1994 were computed as follows
(in thousands, except earnings per share data):

(F) The pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements
are presented assuming that Vishay will complete a contemplated
public offering of 2,750,000 shares of common stock as described 
in Note B. While it is Vishay's current intention to complete such
offering, Vishay cannot assure that the offering will occur as
planned. If such offering does not occur, the pro forma long-
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 18

term debt would increase by $111,375 and pro forma stockholders'
equity would decrease by a corresponding amount. Also, pro forma
interest expense for the year ended December 31, 1993 and the
three months ended March 31, 1994 would increase by $6,126 and
$1,531, respectively. After considering applicable income tax
effects, pro forma net earnings and earnings per share would be

Independent Auditors' Report
- ----------------------------

The Boards of Directors
Vitramon, Incorporated and Vitramon Limited (UK):

We have audited the combined balance sheets of Vitramon, Incorporated
and subsidiaries and Vitramon Limited (UK) (both of which are
directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiaries of Thomas & Betts
Corporation) as of January 1, 1994 and January 2, 1993, and the
related combined statements of earnings, cash flows, and shareholder's
equity for the years then ended. These combined financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these combined financial
statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. These standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. 

In our opinion, the combined financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of
Vitramon, Incorporated and subsidiaries and Vitramon Limited (UK) at
January 1, 1994 and January 2, 1993, and the results of their
operations and their cash flows for the years then ended in conformity
with generally accepted accounting principles.

VITRAMON INCORPORATED AND VITRAMON LIMITED (U.K.)

NOTES TO COMBINED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of Presentation
On July 17, 1987, a merger of Vitramon, Incorporated with a subsidiary
of Thomas & Betts Corporation was completed. The accompanying
combined financial statements include Vitramon, Incorporated and
subsidiaries and Vitramon Limited (UK) (collectively, Vitramon). 
These legal entities are directly or indirectly wholly owned by Thomas
and Betts Corporation. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.

A minority investment in a Thomas & Betts affiliate held by Vitramon
Incorporated, which is excluded from the proposed sale of Vitramon
(see Note 10), has been excluded from the accompanying combined
financial statements.

Fiscal Year
Vitramon's fiscal year consists of 52 and 53 weeks ending on the
Saturday closest to the end of the calendar year. 

Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or
market. Costs included in inventories consist of materials, labor,
and manufacturing overhead that are related to acquisition or
production costs.

Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Expenditures for
maintenance and repair are charged to costs and expenses as incurred.
Significant renewals and betterments that extend the lives of assets
are capitalized. Depreciation is computed principally on an
accelerated method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
which range principally from 5 to 40 years for land improvements, 35
to 45 years for buildings, and 5 years for machinery and equipment.

Income Taxes
Income taxes payable represent foreign taxes to be remitted directly
by Vitramon to Non-U.S. taxing authorities. All federal and state
income taxes are included in Accounts Payable - Parent Corporation. 
Federal and state income taxes are remitted by parent Thomas & Betts
Corporation to the taxing authorities.

Effective January 3, 1993, Vitramon changed from the deferred method
of accounting for income taxes under APB Opinion No. 11, to the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes." The effect of adopting SFAS No.
109 was not material to the combined financial statements. Prior
years' financial statements have not been restated. SFAS No. 109
requires the asset and liability method of accounting for income
taxes. Under this method, the Corporation provides deferred income
taxes to record temporary differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.

Deferred taxes are not provided on undistributed net earnings of
foreign subsidiaries, approximately $1,900,000 at January 1, 1994, to
the extent that those earnings are expected to be permanently
reinvested in the subsidiaries. It is estimated that taxes ultimately
payable on the distribution of these earnings would not be
significant.

VITRAMON INCORPORATED AND VITRAMON LIMITED (U.K.)

Cash Flow Information
Foreign cash flows have been converted to U.S. dollars at
appropriately weighted average exchange rates or exchange rates in
effect at the time of the cash flows where determinable.
Net cash provided by operating activities for the years 1993 and 1992
respectively, reflect cash payments for trade interest of $1,684,000
and $2,035,000 respectively; interest on Thomas & Betts debt of
$1,271,000 and $952,000, respectively; and income taxes paid directly
by Vitramon or paid on its behalf by parent company, of $3,747,000 and
$4,878,000 respectively. 

2. INCOME TAXES
Income taxes were determined as if Vitramon were a stand-alone
corporation. Actual U.S. income taxes were determined as part of the
parent company's consolidated return. The consolidated return
reflected certain tax planning strategies available to the parent that
were not used in calculating the tax provision in the accompanying
combined financial statements, which resulted in an increased tax rate
in both years due primarily to taxes in excess of the U.S. tax rate on
foreign earnings.

The components of earnings before income taxes are as follows:

In thousands 1993 1992 

Domestic $3,586 $3,202

The reconciliation between the Federal statutory tax rate and
Vitramon's effective tax rate is as follows:

1993 1992
Federal statutory tax rate 35.0% 34.0%
State tax 1.8 2.4

All U.S. taxes are recorded as payable to parent, Thomas & Betts
Corporation, and therefore, all U.S. deferred taxes will eventually be
settled against that payable to parent.

were:

The net change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was
a reduction of $115,000 in 1993. The change relates to a loss carry
forward recovered in 1993. Carry forwards remaining at January 1,
1994 can be carried forward indefinitely.

4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
Vitramon received and paid for management services provided by Thomas
& Betts. Generally, these management services included general
management, accounting, internal audit, cash management, risk
management, human resource, legal and tax services. The cost of such
services was $5,783,000 and $4,965,000 for the years 1993 and 1992
respectively. Management believes that all allocations are made on a
reasonable basis; however, these costs are not necessarily
representative of the costs which would have been incurred by
Vitramon as an independent company.

Vitramon paid sales commissions to a Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC)
wholly owned by Thomas & Betts to obtain favorable tax treatment on
export sales.

5. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
Vitramon has a noncontributory pension plan covering substantially all
its domestic employees. This plan generally provides pension benefits
that are based on compensation levels and years of service. 
Vitramon's funding policy for this plan is to contribute amounts
sufficient to maintain a benefit-security ratio (fair value of plan
assets over accumulated benefit obligation) of at least 125 percent. 
Plan assets are primarily invested in equity securities, fixed income
securities, cash equivalents and real estate.

Net periodic pension cost for 1993 and 1992 for Vitramon's defined
benefit pension plan included the following components:

In thousands 1993 1992 

Service cost - benefits earned

Vitramon's balance sheet:

balance sheet) $ (419) $(195)
======= =====
The present value of projected benefits for the above plan for
December 1, 1993 was determined using a discount rate of 7.5% and 8%
as of 1993 and 1992, respectively, and an assumed rate of increase in
compensation of 5.5%. Vitramon also sponsors a defined contribution
401(K) savings plan for its U.S. employees where company contributions
are based on a percentage of employee contributions. The cost of
these plans was $294,000 in 1993 and $287,000 in 1992.

Other pension costs, primarily for non-U.S. defined contribution plans
and plans of insignificant size, amounted to $243,000 in 1993 and
$178,000 in 1992.

Effective January 3, 1993, Vitramon adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than
Pensions." This Statement required changing from a cash to an accrual
basis in accounting for retiree health insurance costs. Vitramon is
recognizing the estimated liability for these benefits over the lives
of the individuals covered. This liability is not being funded. All
employees entitled to these benefits are retired. The total
accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at January 1, 1994 was
$312,000. The net periodic cost for 1993 was $50,000 and the accrued
postretirement benefit costs on the balance sheet at January 1, 1994
was $23,000.

The weighted average discount rate used in determining the accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation was 7.5%. An increase in the cost
of covered health care benefits of 12% was assumed for fiscal year
1993. 

This rate was assumed to decrease incrementally to 6.5% after fifteen
years and remain at that level thereafter. 

Prior to adoption of SFAS No. 106, postretirement health care and life
insurance benefits paid were $41,000 in 1992.

6. COMMITMENTS
Vitramon and its subsidiaries are parties to various leases relating
to plants, warehouses, office facilities, automobiles, and other
equipment, principally data processing equipment. All operating leases
are renewed annually, and all capital leases expire prior to 1997.
Real estate taxes, insurance, and maintenance expenses are normally
obligations of Vitramon. It is expected that in the normal course of
business the majority of the leases will be renewed or replaced by
other leases. Vitramon has capitalized leases principally for
machinery and equipment. At January 1, 1994 and January 2, 1993, net
property, plant and equipment included $236,000 and $228,000,
respectively, for capital leases.

Future minimum payments under capital leases consisted of the
following at January 1, 1994:

5.1 Organization, Standing and Qualification;

Business. (a) Seller, the Company and each Transferred

Subsidiary is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and

in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its

incorporation as set forth on Schedule 5.1(a). The Company and

leased or operated; and except as disclosed on Schedule 5.1(a),

standing as a foreign corporation authorized to do business in

the jurisdictions listed on Schedule 5.1(a), which are the only
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 12 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

jurisdictions where the nature of the activities conducted by it

or the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by

it require such qualification, licensing or domestication. The

Company has delivered to Purchaser true and complete copies of

its and each Transferred Subsidiary's certificate of

incorporation and all amendments thereto and the by-laws of the

Company and each Transferred Subsidiary as presently in effect,

certified as true, complete and correct by its Secretary, and

such by-laws are in full force and effect as of the date hereof. 

(b) Immediately after consummation of the transactions

contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and the Transferred

Subsidiaries will be able to conduct Seller's business involving

the design, manufacture and sale of multilayer ceramic chip

capacitors and certain types of filters (the "Business") in

substantially the same manner as the Company and the Transferred

Subsidiaries conducted the Business prior to the Closing, except

to the extent affected by the identity or legal or regulatory

status of Purchaser or its affiliates (as such term is understood

under U.S. securities law, "Affiliates").

(c) The books of account, minute books, stock certificate

books and stock transfer ledgers of the Company and the

Transferred Subsidiaries made available to Purchaser are complete

and correct, and there have been no transactions involving the

business of the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary which
<PAGE>

properly should have been set forth therein and which have not

been accurately so set forth.

5.2 Subsidiaries. (a) The Company has no subsidiaries

except those listed on Schedule 5.2 (with VL, the "Transferred

Subsidiaries"). The Company has no interest, direct or indirect,

and has no commitment to purchase any interest, direct or

indirect, in any other corporation or in any partnership, joint

venture or other business enterprise or entity other than as set

forth on Schedule 5.2. The Business has not been conducted

other than the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries.

Executive Investment Plan ("Seller's Deferred Compensation

employee benefit plan sponsored by Seller that his active

participation in such plan shall cease as of the Closing Date. 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 39 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

As of the Closing Date, with the exception of the plans listed

in the second preceding sentence, no Employee will be covered

under any employee benefit plan sponsored by Seller. Neither

Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller (other than the Company, the

Transferred Subsidiaries or Mr. Robert Paquette), participates

in a Benefit Plan sponsored by the Company or a Transferred

Subsidiary. On and after the Closing Date, neither the

Company, Transferred Subsidiaries nor Buyer will be under any

obligation to contribute to any employee benefit plan

maintained by Seller. Except for the Vitramon Incorporated

Retirement Trust ("Company's Defined Benefit Plan"), no Benefit

Plan sponsored by the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary

participates in a trust sponsored by any entity except the

Company or a Transferred Subsidiary.

(d) On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller

covenants and agrees to cause a trust to be established (the

"Vitramon Trust") to which the assets of the Company's Defined

Benefit Plan, currently held in the master trust established by

agreement between Seller and The Northern Trust Company

("Northern") dated June 1, 1982 (the "Master Trust"), shall be

transferred. Seller and Purchaser agree that they shall take

such actions as are appropriate in order for the transfer

described in the preceding sentence to be accomplished as

follows (subject to any modification to which the Seller and

Purchaser may mutually agree in writing):
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 40 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

(i) on the "Transfer Date", which shall be on or

before the Closing Date, cash equal to the value (as

determined by Northern as of June 30, 1994) of the

interest of the Company's Defined Benefit Plan in the

Master Trust (the "June Value") shall be transferred

from the Master Trust to the Vitramon Trust, and

(ii) as soon as practicable following July 31, 1994,

the amount by which the Final Transfer Amount (as

defined below) exceeds the June Value shall be

transferred from the Master Trust to the Vitramon

Trust or, if there is no such amount, the amount (if

any) by which the June Value exceeds the Final

Transfer Amount shall be transferred from the

Vitramon Trust to the Master Trust.

The Final Transfer Amount shall be:

(A) the June Value, appropriately adjusted for plan

distributions and administrative expenses, increased (or

decreased) by 

(B) the investment gain (or loss) experienced by the

Master Trust (as determined by Northern) for the month of

July 1994 multiplied by the product of (x) a fraction the

numerator of which is the number of days in July 1994 that

preceded the Transfer Date and the denominator of which is

31 and (y) a fraction the numerator of which is the June

Value and the denominator of which is the value of the
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 41 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

assets of the Master Trust as of June 30, 1994 (as

determined by Northern).

(e) Each Benefit Plan which is not a plan qualified

under section 401(a) of the Code, but which is intended to meet

the requirements for tax-favored treatment under section 79,

104, 105 or 106 of the Code, complies in all respects with the

requirements of such section.

(f) Each Benefit Plan which is intended to be

"qualified" within the meaning of section 401(a) of the Code

(and the exempt trust thereunder) has been determined by the

Internal Revenue Service to satisfy the qualification

requirements of sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code and each

such Benefit Plan (and related trust) complies with such

qualification requirements without being aggregated with any

other employee benefit plan.

(g) No "reportable event" within the meaning of

section 4043(b) of ERISA has occurred with respect to the

Company's Defined Benefit Plan. The Pension Benefit Guaranty

Corporation ("PBGC") has not instituted proceedings to

terminate the Company's Defined Benefit Plan. The Company's

Defined Benefit Plan has no accumulated or waived funding

deficiency within the meaning of section 412 of the Code nor

has any extension of any amortization period within the meaning

of section 412 of the Code or 302 of ERISA been applied for
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 42 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

with respect thereto. All applicable premiums required to be

paid to the PBGC prior to the Closing Date with respect to the

Company's Defined Benefit Plan have been paid. No facts exist

with respect to the Company's Defined Benefit Plan which would

give rise to a termination proceeding which would result in

liability under section 4068 of ERISA or a lien on the assets

of the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary under section 4068

of ERISA on or prior to the Closing Date.

(h) With respect to each Benefit Plan, no party in

interest or disqualified person (as defined in section 3(14) of

ERISA and section 4975 of the Code, respectively) has at any

time engaged in a transaction which could subject Seller, the

Company or any Transferred Subsidiary, directly or indirectly,

to a Tax, penalty or liability for prohibited transactions

imposed by section 406 of ERISA or section 4975 of the Code. 

No fiduciary (as defined in section 3(21) of ERISA) with

respect to any Benefit Plan has breached any of the

responsibilities or obligations imposed upon fiduciaries under

Title I of ERISA.

(i) During the seven-year period preceding the date

of this Agreement, neither Seller, the Company nor any

Transferred Subsidiary has ever contributed to, or withdrawn in

a complete or partial withdrawal from, any multiemployer plan

(within the meaning of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) or

incurred contingent liability under section 4204 of ERISA.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 43 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

(j) Except for the Vitramon, Incorporated Retiree

Medical Benefits Plan ("Retiree Medical Plan"), no Benefit Plan

sponsored by the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary, other

than the Company's Defined Benefit Plan, the Vitramon,

Incorporated Thrift Plan, and the Supplemental Retirement Plan

of Vitramon North America, provides for the payment of retiree

or post-termination benefits other than as required under the

Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as

amended, or any similar state law. The Retiree Medical Plan

was amended effective January 1, 1993 and under the terms of

the Plan, all Former Employees who were eligible to enroll in

the Plan have done so and no other individual is or will be

eligible to enroll in the Retiree Medical Plan.

(k) Except as disclosed on Schedule 5.18(k), since

April 3, 1994 neither Seller, the Company nor any Transferred

Subsidiary has adopted any increase in benefits under a Benefit

Plan or agreed to the creation of any new benefits or any

increase in benefits under any Benefit Plan or change in

employee coverage which would increase the expense of

maintaining any such Benefit Plan or proposed any such actions

under circumstances in which it would reasonably be expected

that such proposal would be implemented.

(l) Except as disclosed on Schedule 5.18(l), the

consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 44 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

will not result in an increase in the amount of compensation or

benefits or accelerate the vesting or timing of payment of any

benefits or compensation payable in respect of any employee.

(m) No employee or former employee of Seller, the

Company or any Transferred Subsidiary will be entitled to any

severance benefits under the terms of any Benefit Plan solely

by reason of the consummation of the transactions contemplated

by this Agreement.

(n) Each of Seller, the Company and the Transferred

Subsidiaries has complied with the notice and continuation

requirements of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation

Act of 1985, as amended, and the regulations thereunder,

applicable to it with respect to any Benefit Plan.

(o) During the seven-year period preceding the date

of this Agreement, no actual or contingent liability under

Title IV of ERISA, section 302 of ERISA or section 412 of the

Code to any person, including the PBGC (other than for

premiums), has been, and no such liability is reasonably

expected to be, incurred by Seller, the Company or any

Transferred Subsidiary with respect to any Benefit Plan, or

any other employee benefit plan (as defined in section 3(3) of

ERISA) currently or previously maintained or contributed to by

Seller, the Company, any Transferred Subsidiary or any "ERISA

Affiliate" (as hereinafter defined), as a result of, or arising
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 45 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

from, any events that have occurred prior to the date of this

Agreement or that will have occurred prior to or on the Closing

Date or by reason of the consummation of the transactions

contemplated by this Agreement. "ERISA Affiliate" means any

trade or business, whether or not incorporated, which together

with Seller, the Company or a Transferred Subsidiary, is

treated as a "single employer" within the meaning of section

414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or section 4001 of ERISA.

officers if so requested) and such information with

respect to the Business, the Company's Assets and the

affairs of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries as

Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request, except

existing test wells and examining all documents, and such

other non-destructive tests as Purchaser may deem

necessary to determine the environmental condition of the

Subsidiaries, but only to the extent that such access does

not unreasonably interfere with the business and
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 62 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

operations of the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary

and does not involve sampling without Seller's written

consent; such inspection rights shall include Purchaser's

right to request information from the appropriate

governmental agencies to determine whether the real

properties of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries

are in compliance with all applicable laws, rules,

regulations, orders, decrees, judgments, injunctions,

notices or demand letters.

(c) Subject to Section 14(c) hereof, neither the

furnishing of any information to Purchaser pursuant to

any certificate furnished or to be furnished by Seller to

Purchaser in connection herewith or pursuant hereto.

8.1.2 Directors Authorization. At or prior to the

Closing, Seller will deliver to Purchaser a true, correct

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 66 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

provided, however, that subject to Section 14(c) hereof,

neither the supplementing or amending of any Schedules by

Seller, nor the discovery of any matters by Purchaser in

the course of its investigations, shall be deemed to cure

any breach of any representation or warranty made in this

Agreement or such Schedules to have been disclosed as of

the date of this Agreement or to constitute any waiver by

Purchaser of any of its rights hereunder, and Purchaser

shall be entitled to rely on such representations or

warranties.

8.3.4 Title Insurance. (a) Purchaser has ordered

from Chicago Title Insurance Company (the "Title Company")

title insurance reports, certificates and/or commitments

(the "Title Commitment") for owner's title insurance

policies with respect to the real properties of the

Within five (5) days after the date hereof, Purchaser

shall give Seller notice of any Encumbrances disclosed by

such Title Commitment that are not:

(i) an Encumbrance set forth on Schedule 8.3.4,
true and complete copies (or if copies are
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 67 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

unavailable, descriptions) of which have been made
available to Purchaser;

(ii) an Encumbrance (including but not limited
to easements, quasi-easements, restrictions, rights
of way, land use ordinances and zoning plans) that
does not materially detract from the value of or
materially interfere with the use, operation or
enjoyment of the Fee Properties or Leased Properties
as a whole in substantially the same manner as same
were used, operated or enjoyed by the Company on
April 3, 1994;

(iii) an Encumbrance for Taxes and assessments
not yet due and payable or being contested in good
faith;

appear as a part of Chicago Title Insurance Company's
printed form of title insurance policy and that are
not customarily removed by the Company furnishing an
affidavit of title (except that the foregoing shall
be limited to matters that would not result in loss
or removal of any improvements on the Fee Properties
or the Leased Properties);

(vi) Encumbrances reflected on the Balance
Sheet; and

(vii) any Encumbrance which, at no additional
cost to Purchaser, the Title Company shall have
agreed either to (A) affirmatively insure Purchaser
by endorsement or otherwise against the adverse
effect thereof (including the collection of such
Encumbrance or forfeiture or impairment of any rights
of Purchaser with respect to the affected Property),
or (B) omit such Encumbrance as an exception to the
title policy.

The matters described in clauses (i) through (vii) above

are referred to hereafter as "Permitted Encumbrances." 

Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 68 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

eliminate any Encumbrance of which Purchaser has given

notice that is not a Permitted Encumbrance (collectively,

"Title Defects") on or before the Closing Date. The

failure by Purchaser to give such notice shall be deemed a

waiver by Purchaser of Purchaser's rights with respect

thereto.

8.3.5 Replacement Insurance. Seller will cooperate

with Purchaser in obtaining, at Purchaser's expense,

replacement insurance policies, effective as of the

Closing Date, affording coverage to the Company and the

of the parties will cooperate with each other, will

furnish such information and will take such further action

as may be required diligently to prosecute any such

required application and shall use its best efforts to

obtain any such consent, approval or authorization.

8.3.7 Cooperation and Records Retention. 

(a) Seller and Purchaser shall (i) each provide the other

with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by the

other in connection with the preparation of any Return,

audit or other examination by any tax authority or

judicial or administrative proceedings relating to

liability for Taxes, (ii) each retain and provide the

other with any records or other information which may be

relevant to such Return, audit or examination, proceeding

or determination, and (iii) each provide the other with

any final determination of any such audit or examination,

proceeding or determination that affects any amount

required to be shown on any Return of the other for any

period. Purchaser shall, with Seller's assistance as may

reasonably be required, make the filing with the State of

Connecticut described in Section 6.4.

(b) Purchaser shall retain, and shall cause Company

to retain, and Seller shall retain, until the applicable

statutes of limitations (including any extensions) have

expired, copies of all Returns, supporting work schedules and

other records or information that may be relevant for all Tax

periods or portions thereof ending before or including the

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 70 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

9. Taxes.

9.1 General. Seller shall, and shall cause the

Company to, prepare and timely file all Returns and amendments

thereto required to be filed by or for the Company and the

Transferred Subsidiaries for periods ending on or before the

Closing Date and timely pay all Taxes shown thereon as due and

payable. Purchaser will be given a reasonable opportunity to

review such Returns, and, at Seller's reasonable request, and

subject to Purchaser's review of such returns, Purchaser shall

cause the Company to sign such returns prepared by Seller for

pre-closing periods not due to be filed until after the Closing

Date to the extent the Company's signature is required by the

applicable law. Seller shall pay all Taxes of the Group

arising from or relating to the transactions contemplated by

this Agreement, including any Taxes resulting from the Section

338(h)(10) Election (as hereinafter defined). Any amount of

current domestic Taxes reserved for in the Base Balance Sheet

(including any additional current domestic Tax reserves accrued

between April 3, 1994 and the Closing Date) shall be paid by

the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries to Seller prior to

the Closing Date. To appropriately apportion any Taxes

relating to a period that includes (but that would not, but for

this section, close on) the Closing Date, the parties hereto

will treat for all purposes the Closing Date as the last day of

a taxable period of the Company and each Transferred
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 71 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

Subsidiary, and such period shall be treated as a "Pre-Closing

Short Period" for purposes of this Agreement. All Taxes

attributable to the periods prior to and including the Closing

Date, including Taxes for a Pre-Closing Short Period, shall be

treated as "Pre-Closing Taxes" for purposes of this Agreement

and shall be payable by Seller, provided that Seller shall pay

any foreign Pre-Closing Taxes only if, and to the extent that,

those Taxes exceed current Tax Reserves of the Company and the

Transferred Subsidiaries for foreign Taxes. Foreign Taxes

attributable to a Pre-Closing Short Period will be determined

in accordance with the past Business Practices (defined below)

of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries and in

accordance with the applicable Tax rates in effect on the

Closing Date. For purposes of this paragraph, "Business

Practices" shall mean the past dividend policies and Tax

elections of the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries. 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Seller

shall have no liability for underaccrual of Taxes payable or an

overaccrual of Taxes receivable by any Transferred Subsidiary

resulting from a change of the past Business Practices of the

Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries following the Closing

Date. Seller shall file all Pre-Closing Short Period Tax

Returns. Purchaser shall prepare and timely file all returns

and reports required to be filed with respect to any transfer

and sales taxes arising from or relating to the transaction

contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall have a reasonable
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 72 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

opportunity to review such returns or reports. Seller shall,

upon Purchaser's demand, reimburse Purchaser for one-half of

the amount of any such taxes. 

9.2 Tax Sharing Agreements. All tax-sharing

agreements or similar arrangements with respect to or involving

the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries shall be terminated

as to them prior to the Closing Date, and, after the Closing

Date, the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries shall not be

bound thereby or have any liability thereunder for amounts due

in respect of periods prior to the Closing Date.

9.3 Elections. No new elections with respect to

Taxes, or any changes in current elections with respect to

Taxes, of the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries which may

have an effect on the Company or the Transferred Subsidiaries

for periods ending after the Closing Date shall be made after

the date of this Agreement without the prior written consent of

Purchaser.

9.4 Tax Refunds. Seller shall be entitled to all

refunds with respect to Pre-Closing Taxes. If in any period

ending after the Closing Date the Company or any of the

Transferred Subsidiaries earns any credit or recognizes any

loss which cannot be applied against its tax liability for such

period, and is permitted by law to carry back such credit or

loss to a period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and if
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 73 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

the Group receives a tax refund (whether actually received or

applied in reduction of any Taxes) for the period to which such

credit or loss is properly carried back, the benefit of which

the Group would not have had but for the carryback from the

Company or any Transferred Subsidiary, then Seller shall

promptly remit to Purchaser the amount of such tax refund. In

the event a tax benefit realized by Seller under this section

9.4 is later reduced upon a final determination by a taxing

authority, Purchaser shall promptly remit to Seller the amount

of such reduction in tax benefit upon Seller's written request

therefor. In connection with this Section 9.4, Seller and

Purchaser agree that they will cooperate with each other in

causing their respective affiliates and representatives to

promptly and timely proceed in connection with (i) the

preparation and filing of, and (ii) any administrative or

judicial proceedings involving, any return of tax or

information filed or required to be filed by or for the Group,

the Company, any Transferred Subsidiary or Purchaser.

9.5 Post-Closing Matters.

(a) Purchaser and the Company agree to give

Seller prompt written notice of receipt of oral or written

notice of any tax examinations, claims, settlements, proposed

adjustments or related matters that may affect Pre-Closing

Taxes. Seller shall have the right to sole control regarding

any audit or examination by any taxing authority, initiating
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 74 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

any claim for refund, filing any amended return, and

contesting, resolving and defending against any assessment,

notice of deficiency or other adjustment or proposed adjustment

relating to any Pre-Closing Taxes, except that with respect to

any matter that may affect the Taxes of Purchaser, the Company

or any Transferred Subsidiary for any period ending after the

Closing Date, Purchaser and the Company shall participate with

Seller in control of such matters.

(b) Purchaser and the Company shall file and

control any Returns required to be filed by the Company and the

Transferred Subsidiaries for periods ending after the Closing

Date (including Returns in jurisdictions that do not accept

Pre-Closing Short Period Tax Returns to be filed by Seller

pursuant to Section 9.1 hereof). Seller agrees that it shall

provide, and shall cause its accountants and other

Representatives to provide, to Purchaser on a timely basis the

information, including but not limited to all work papers and

records relating to the Company and the Transferred

Subsidiaries, that it or the accountants or other

Representatives have within their control and that may be

reasonably necessary or related to (i) the preparation of any

and all Returns, information returns and reports required to be

filed by Purchaser or the Company and (ii) audits or other tax

determinations or proceedings by or before governmental

agencies, such information to be provided in the form in which
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 75 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

it has in the past been maintained by Seller, its accountants

or other representative.

(c) Seller shall timely take any and all actions

necessary to effect elections with respect to the Company under

Code section 338(h)(10) (and the Treasury Regulations

promulgated thereunder) and any comparable provisions of state,

local or foreign law (collectively and separately, the "Section

338(h)(10) Election"). Purchaser shall be responsible for, and

control, the preparation and filing of such election. The

allocation of Purchase Price among the assets of the Company

shall be made in accordance with Code section 338 and 1060 and

any comparable provisions of state, local or foreign law, as

appropriate. The Purchase Price shall be allocated

consistently with the allocations in Section 2 of this Stock

Purchase Agreement, and Seller and Purchaser shall file in all

respects and for all purposes consistently with such

allocation. Seller shall execute and deliver to Purchaser such

documents or forms as are required by applicable law for an

effective Section 338(h)(10) Election.

10. Conditions Precedent to Purchaser's Obligations. 

All obligations of Purchaser hereunder are subject, at the

option of Purchaser, to the fulfillment of each of the

significant negative impact on the passive electronics

of Closing.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 78 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

$19,000,000.

(b) Seller hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold

Purchaser harmless from, against and in respect of, and shall

reimburse Purchaser for one hundred percent (100%) of the Costs

suffered or incurred by Purchaser, the Company or any
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 81 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

Transferred Subsidiary relating to Environmental Laws, without

regard to the Basket with respect to:

(i) penalties, fines or other punitive
sanctions imposed upon Purchaser, the Company or any
Transferred Subsidiary by a governmental authority as
a result of non-compliance with Environmental Laws
prior to the Closing Date and up to the amount of
such fines that are allocable to the period prior to
the Closing Date to the extent that such penalties,
fines or other punitive sanctions are imposed with
respect to the operations of facilities owned by the
Company or any Transferred Subsidiary as of the
Closing Date; and 

(ii) any liability under Environmental Laws
that may arise at any time for the off-site Release

against the Company or any Transferred Subsidiary;
and 

(iii) all capitalized costs (other than the
Costs described in Section 12(b)) required to be
incurred by Purchaser, the Company or any Transferred

hereof, third-party claims relating to Hazardous Substances, or

assert) any such claims against Seller or any of its

Affiliates, whether at law or in equity, for such matter. 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 83 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this

Agreement, no amounts of indemnity shall be payable under

(i) Costs to comply with future Environmental
Laws or current Environmental Laws which are not yet
effective or applicable to the Company;

(ii) Costs with respect to Releases or Site
Conditions first occurring after the Closing Date,
provided, however that to the extent that a Release

Costs shall be indemnified as provided in Section

indemnified under Section 12(b) or 12(c) but for
which proper accounting reserves have been
established by the Company on or prior to April 3,
1994; and

(iv) ordinary or usual costs associated with
the ongoing operation of the Business and not
specifically arising due to non-compliance with

Environmental Permit, and the cost of disposal of
Hazardous Substances generated by the Company as a
result of ongoing operations). 

(e) Purchaser hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold

Seller harmless from, against and in respect of (and shall on

demand reimburse Seller for):

(i) any and all loss, liability or damage
suffered or incurred by Seller by reason of any
untrue representation, breach of warranty or
nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement by
Purchaser contained herein or in any Instrument
delivered to Seller pursuant hereto, as well as
by reason of the D&B Letter, solely as it
relates to the Company and any Transferred
Subsidiary; 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 84 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

(ii) Costs with respect to Releases and Site
Conditions occurring after the Closing Date,
including without limitation, those occurring in
connection with investigations, excavations or other
remediation activities addressing Releases or Site
Conditions that occurred or existed prior to the
Closing Date; and

amount of money that Purchaser shall be obligated to pay Seller

under this Section 12 shall not exceed $19,000,000.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

contained in this Agreement, neither party shall be liable to

the other party for any consequential damages resulting from

its misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure to perform

any of its obligations under this Agreement.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

contained in this Agreement, no amounts of indemnity shall be
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 85 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

payable as a result of any claim in respect of any Costs

arising under this Section 12:

(i) with respect to any claim for
indemnification hereunder, unless the Indemnified
Party has given the Indemnifying Party a Claim Notice
or Indemnity Notice, as applicable, with respect to
such claim, setting forth in reasonable detail the
specific facts and circumstances pertaining thereto,
(A) as soon as practical following the time at which
the Indemnified Party discovered such claim (except
to the extent the Indemnifying Party is not
prejudiced by any delay in the delivery of such
notice) and (B) in any event prior to the applicable
date as of which the indemnity with respect to such
claim expires under Section 14(b); 

(ii) with respect to any Costs that the
Indemnified Party had an opportunity, but failed, in
good faith to mitigate, including but not limited to
its failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to
recover under a policy of insurance or under a
contractual right of set-off or indemnity, to the
extent that failure to so mitigate would result in a
reduction in damages recoverable under applicable
principles of contract law; or

(iii) with respect to any Costs suffered,
incurred or sustained by Purchaser or to which it
becomes subject, to the extent such Costs arise from
or were caused by actions taken or failed to be taken
by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates after the
Closing.

(i) All claims for indemnification by any

Indemnified Party under Section 12 will be asserted and

resolved as follows:

(i) In the event any claim or demand in respect
of which an Indemnified Party might seek indemnity
under Section 12 is asserted against or sought to be
collected from such Indemnified Party by an
individual, corporation, partnership, organization,
association, governmental or regulatory authority or
trust (a "Person") other than by Seller, Purchaser or
any Affiliate of Seller or Purchaser (a "Third Party
Claim"), the Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 86 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

Notice with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying
Party. The Indemnifying Party will notify the
Indemnified Party as soon as practicable within the
Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party
disputes the liability to the Indemnified Party under
Section 12 and whether the Indemnifying Party
desires, at its sole cost and expense, except as
provided herein, to defend the Indemnified Party
against such Third Party Claim. 

(A) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period that
the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the
Indemnified Party with respect to the Third
Party Claim pursuant to this Section 12(i), then
the Indemnifying Party will have the right to
defend (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Indemnified Party), at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Party, except as
provided herein, such Third Party Claim by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings will
be vigorously and diligently prosecuted by the
Indemnifying Party to a final conclusion or will
be settled at the discretion of the Indemnifying
Party, provided the Indemnifying Party pays any
judgment or settlement that results therefrom or
obtains a general release in favor of Purchaser,
the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries or
otherwise with the consent of the Indemnified
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. The Indemnifying Party will have full
control of such defense and proceedings,
including any settlement thereof; provided,
however, that the Indemnified Party may, at the
sole cost and expense of the Indemnified Party,
except as provided herein, at any time prior to
the Indemnifying Party's delivery of the notice
referred to in the first sentence of this
Section 12(i)(A), file any motion, answer or
other pleadings or take any other action that
the Indemnified Party reasonably believes to be
necessary or appropriate to protect its
interests and not being materially prejudicial
to the Indemnifying Party (it being understood
and agreed that, except as provided in Section
12(i)(B) below, if an Indemnified Party takes
any such action that is materially prejudicial
and causes a final adjudication that is adverse
to the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying
Party will be relieved of its obligations
hereunder with respect to the portion of such
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 87 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

Third Party Claim prejudiced by the Indemnified
Party's action, in which case the Indemnified
Party and not the Indemnifying Party may
defend); and provided further, that if requested
by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party
will, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party except as provided herein,
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its
counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim that
the Indemnifying Party elects to contest, or, if
appropriate and related to the Third Party Claim
in question, in making any counterclaim against
the Person asserting the Third Party Claim, or
any cross-complaint against any Person (other
than the Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates). Notwithstanding the foregoing, and
subject to the next sentence, the Indemnified
Party may take over the control of the defense
or settlement of a Third Party Claim if it
irrevocably waives its right to indemnity under
Section 12 with respect to such Third Party
Claim. In the event, however, a Third Party
Claim is asserted that is reasonably likely to
materially adversely affect the continuing
operation of a material portion of the Company's
business, the Indemnified Party may notify the
Indemnifying Party within the Dispute Period
that the Indemnified Party elects to assume
joint control with the Indemnifying Party of the
defense or settlement of such Third Party Claim
(in which case the Indemnifying Party may not
have sole control and the Indemnifying Party and
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with each
other reasonably and in good faith in such
defense, prosecution and settlement), and the
right to indemnification under this Section 12
shall remain in effect. 

(B) If the Indemnifying Party fails to
notify the Indemnified Party within the Dispute
Period that the Indemnifying Party desires to
defend the Third Party Claim pursuant to this
Section 12(i), or if the Indemnifying Party
gives such notice but fails to prosecute
vigorously and diligently or settle the Third
Party Claim, of if the Indemnifying Party fails
to give any notice whatsoever within the Dispute
Period, then the Indemnified Party will have the
right to defend, at the sole cost and expense of
the Indemnifying Party, except as provided
herein, the Third Party Claim by all appropriate
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 88 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

proceedings, which proceedings will be
vigorously and diligently prosecuted by the
Indemnified Party to a final conclusion or will
be settled at the discretion of the Indemnified
Party (with the consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld). The Indemnified Party will have full
control of such defense and proceedings,
including (except as provided in Section
12(i)(A)) any settlement thereof; provided,
however, that if requested by the Indemnified
Party, the Indemnifying Party will, at the sole
cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party,
except as provided herein, cooperate with the
Indemnified Party and its counsel in contesting
any Third Party Claim which the Indemnified
Party is contesting, or if appropriate and
related to the Third Party Claim in question, in
making any counterclaim against the Person
asserting the Third Party Claim, or any cross-
complaint against any Person (other than the
Indemnifying Party or any of its Affiliates). 
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section 12(i)(B), if the Indemnifying Party has
notified the Indemnified Party within the
Dispute Period that the Indemnifying Party
disputes its liability hereunder to the
Indemnified Party with respect to such Third
Party Claim and if such dispute is resolved in
favor of the Indemnifying Party in the manner
provided in Section 12(i)(C) below, the
Indemnifying Party will not be required to bear
the costs and expenses of the Indemnified
Party's defense pursuant to this Section
12(i)(B) or of the Indemnifying Party's
participation therein at the Indemnified Party's
request, and the Indemnified Party will
reimburse the Indemnifying Party in full for all
reasonable costs incurred by the Indemnifying
Party in connection with such litigation. The
Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not
control, any defense or settlement controlled by
the Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section
12(i)(B), and the Indemnifying Party will bear
its own costs and expenses with respect to such
participation.

(C) If the Indemnifying Party notifies the
Indemnified Party that it does not dispute its
liability to the Indemnified Party with respect
to the Third Party Claim or fails to notify the
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 89 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period
whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its
liability to the Indemnified Party with respect
to such Third Party Claim, the Costs in the
amount specified in the Claim Notice will be
conclusively deemed a liability of the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall pay the amount of such Costs to the
Indemnified Party on demand to the extent
provided herein. If the Indemnifying Party has
timely disputed its liability with respect to
such claim, the Indemnifying Party and the
Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if
not resolved through negotiations within the
Resolution Period, such dispute shall be
resolved by arbitration in accordance with
subsection (i) of Section 20. Upon any final
determination that the Indemnifying Party is not
liable with respect to such claim, the
Indemnified Party may take over the control of
the defense or settlement of such claim if it
irrevocably waives its right to indemnity under
Section 12.

(ii) In the event any Indemnified Party has a
claim under this Section 12 against any Indemnifying
Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity Notice
with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party. 
If the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified
Party that it does not dispute the claim described in
such Indemnity Notice or fails to notify the
Indemnified Party within the Dispute Period whether
the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim described
in such Indemnity Notice, the Costs in the amount
specified in the Indemnity Notice will be
conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying
Party under this Section 12 and the Indemnifying
Party shall pay the amount of such Costs to the
Indemnified Party on demand to the extent provided
herein. If the Indemnifying Party has timely
disputed its liability with respect to such claim,
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of
such dispute, and if not resolved through
negotiations within the Resolution Period, such
dispute shall be resolved by arbitration in
accordance with subsection (i) of Section 20.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 90 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

(iii) In the event of any loss, liability or
damages resulting from a misrepresentation, breach of
warranty or nonfulfillment or failure to be performed
of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement or in any Instrument, as to which an
Indemnified Party would be entitled to a claim of
indemnity under this Section 12 but for the fact that
the Costs suffered or incurred by Purchaser, the
Company or any Transferred Subsidiary do not exceed
$3,500,000 in the aggregate, such Indemnified Party
may nevertheless deliver a written notice to the
Indemnifying Party containing the information that
would be required in a Claim Notice or an Indemnity
Notice, as applicable, with respect to such Costs. 
In the case of a Claim Notice, the provisions of
Section 12(i)(A) will be applicable. If the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
that it does not dispute the claim described therein
or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within the
Dispute Period whether the Indemnifying Party
disputes the claim described in such Claim Notice or
Indemnity Notice, as the case may be, the Costs
specified in the notice will be conclusively deemed
to have been incurred by the Indemnified Party for
purposes of making the determination as to whether
the $3,500,000 threshold referred to above has been
met. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed
the claim described in such Claim Notice or Indemnity
Notice, as the case may be, the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith
to negotiate a resolution of such dispute, and if not
resolved through negotiations within the Resolution
Period, such dispute shall be resolved by arbitration
in accordance with subsection (i) of Section 20.

(iv) In the event of any claim, counterclaim or
crossclaim for indemnity under this Section 12, each
party agrees to give to the other party and its
Representatives reasonable access to the relevant
books, documents and records, and to cause its
officers, employees, agents and other representatives
to cooperate fully, in connection with the
prosecution or defense of such claim, counterclaim or
crossclaim, to the extent such requesting party
reasonably deems necessary in connection with its
rights and obligations under this Section 12.

(j) In case any event shall occur which would

otherwise entitle either party to assert a claim for
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 91 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

indemnification hereunder, no Costs shall be deemed to have

been sustained by such party to the extent of (i) the then

present value of any actual tax savings realized by such party

with respect thereto or (ii) any proceeds received by such

party from any insurance policies with respect thereto.

(k) To the extent permitted by law, the indemnities

set forth in this Section 12 shall be the exclusive remedies of

Purchaser and Seller for any misrepresentation, breach of

warranty or nonfulfillment or failure to be performed of any

covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or any

Instrument delivered pursuant hereto, and, absent fraud, the

parties shall not be entitled to a rescission of this Agreement

or to any further indemnification rights or claims of any

nature whatsoever in respect thereof, all of which the parties

hereto hereby waive.

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

contained herein, the provisions of this Section 12 shall apply

only if the Closing takes place and the transactions

contemplated hereby are consummated.

(m) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

contained in this Agreement, Seller shall continue to control

and shall indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless from (and shall

on demand reimburse Purchaser for) all Costs suffered or

incurred by Purchaser, the Company or any Transferred
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 92 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

Subsidiary relating to the action entitled Jean Barilla and

George Barilla v. Vitramon, Inc. et al. (and any amendment

thereof or any claim relating thereto) and none of the other

rights of Purchaser or the limitations on Seller's obligation

to indemnify and to hold Purchaser harmless from, against and

in respect of all Costs contained in this Section 12,

including, without limitation, the Basket, the $19,000,000

limitation on liabilities and the period of survival described

in Section 14, shall apply to the provisions of this Section

12(m).

(n) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

contained in this Agreement, the Basket and the $19,000,000

limitation on liabilities shall not apply to any Costs suffered

or incurred by Purchaser, the Company or any Transferred

Subsidiary as a result of or arising out of a failure by Seller

to perform or fulfill each of its obligations to transfer money

or extinguish liabilities under Sections 5.18(d), 8.1.4 and

9.1.

(o) For purposes of this Section 12: 

"Claim Notice" means written notification

pursuant to Section 12(i) of a Third Party Claim as to which

indemnity under this Section 12 is sought by an Indemnified

Party, enclosing a copy of all papers served, if any, and

specifying the nature and basis for such Third Party Claim and
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 93 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

for the Indemnified Party's claim against the Indemnifying

Party under this Section 12, together with the amount or, if

not then reasonably ascertainable, the estimated amount,

determined in good faith, of such Third Party Claim.

"Cut-off Date" means, with respect to any

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in

this Agreement, the date on which such representation,

warranty, covenant or agreement ceases to survive as provided

in Section 14(b).

"Dispute Period" means the period ending 60 days

following receipt by the Indemnifying Party of either a Claim

Notice or an Indemnity Notice.

"Indemnified Party" means the party to this

Agreement claiming indemnification under any provision of this

Section 12.

"Indemnifying Party" means the party to this

Agreement against which a claim for indemnification is being

asserted under any provision of this Section 12.

"Indemnity Notice" means written notification

pursuant to Section 12(i)(ii) of a claim for indemnity under

this Section 12 by an Indemnified Party, specifying the nature

of and basis for such claim, together with the amount or, if
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 94 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

not then reasonably ascertainable, the estimated amount

determined in good faith, of such claim.

13. Termination. (a) This Agreement may be

terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby may be

abandoned prior to the Closing solely:

(i) by the mutual written consent of Purchaser and
Seller;

(ii) by Seller or Purchaser if the Closing Date
shall not have occurred on or before August 11, 1994;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this clause (ii) shall not be available to
any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under
this Agreement has been the cause of the failure of the
Closing Date to occur on or before such date; and

(iii) by Purchaser if on the Closing Date any of the
conditions provided for in Section 10 have not been met
and have not been waived by Purchaser, or by Seller if on
the Closing Date any of the conditions provided for in
Section 11 have not been met and have not been waived by
Seller.

(b) In the event of the termination and abandonment

of this Agreement pursuant to this Section 13, subject to

Section 13(c), this Agreement shall forthwith become void and

have no effect, without any liability on the part of any party

hereto or its Affiliates, directors, officers or stockholders

except the provisions with respect to expenses in Section 16

and confidentiality in Section 20 shall continue to apply

following any such termination.

(c) If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to

clauses (ii) or (iii) of Section 13(a) following a material
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 95 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

breach by Purchaser of the representations and warranties

contained in Section 6 taken as a whole, or a failure by

Purchaser to perform any material covenant or agreement in all

material respects, then Purchaser shall have 30 days from the

date of termination to provide conclusive evidence to Seller

that it is immediately able to cure the breach or perform the

covenant or agreement that gave rise to the termination. If

Purchaser is unable to give such conclusive evidence to Seller,

then Purchaser shall, within one business day after such

thirty-day period, pay to the Seller in cash a termination fee

of $7,500,000.

14. Nature and Survival of Representations and

Warranties. (a) Each representation, warranty, indemnity,

covenant and agreement made by Seller or Purchaser in this

Agreement or in any certificate delivered by or on behalf

Seller or Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed

the representation, warranty, indemnity, covenant and agreement

of Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be. 

(b) The representations and warranties of Seller

contained in Sections 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.9,

5.11(a), 5.12, 5.13 (excluding 5.13(b)), 5.14, 5.16, 5.17,

5.21, 5.22, and in Section 5.23 to the extent it relates to the

foregoing Sections, and of Purchaser contained in Article 6,

and the other covenants and agreements of the parties relating

thereto to be performed prior to Closing, shall survive the
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 96 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

Closing Date and shall expire on December 31, 1994 (except that

Seller's representation contained in Section 5.16 relating to

the D&B Letter shall expire three months following the Closing

Date). The representations and warranties of Seller contained

in Sections 5.10, 5.11(b), 5.15, 5.18, 5.19 and 5.20, and in

Section 5.23 to the extent it relates to the foregoing

Sections, and the other covenants and agreements of Seller

relating thereto to be performed prior to the Closing shall

survive the Closing Date and shall expire on the second

anniversary of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the

foregoing, Purchaser's right to claim indemnification for

Seller's obligations under Section 12(c) shall expire on the

second anniversary of the Closing Date and Purchaser's right to

claim indemnification for Seller's obligations under Section

12(b) shall expire on the seventh anniversary of the Closing

Date, whether or not such obligations arise out of a breach of

a representation or warranty contained in Section 5.20. The

representations and warranties of Seller contained in Section

5.8 and in Section 5.23 hereof to the extent it relates to

Section 5.8 hereof, and the other covenants and agreements of

Seller relating thereto to be performed prior to the Closing,

shall survive the Closing Date and shall expire thirty days

following the expiration of the relevant statute of limitation. 

The representations and warranties of Seller contained in

Section 5.13(b) shall not survive the Closing. Seller's right

to claim indemnification for Purchaser's obligations under
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 97 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

Section 12(e)(ii) and, to the extent it relates thereto,

Section 12(e)(iii), shall expire on the second anniversary of

the Closing Date.

(c) In the event that at or prior to Closing,

Purchaser obtains actual knowledge of a misrepresentation,

breach of warranty or nonfulfillment or failure to be performed

of a covenant or agreement by Seller (a "Breach"), then the

following procedures shall apply:

(i) If such Breach was disclosed by Seller to
Purchaser, such disclosure shall (A) set forth in
reasonable detail the specific facts and
circumstances relating to the Breach to the extent
known to Seller and (B) contain a representation and
warranty by Seller that such Breach would not result
in non-satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Sections 10(a) or (b) of this Agreement, as the case
may be.

(ii) If such Breach was disclosed by Purchaser
to Seller, such disclosure shall (A) set forth in
reasonable detail the specific facts and
circumstances relating to the Breach to the extent
known to Purchaser and (B) contain a demand that
Seller represent and warrant that (x) it did not have
actual knowledge of the Breach prior to signing this
Agreement and (y) such Breach would not result in
non-satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Sections 10(a) or (b) of this Agreement, as the case
may be.

(iii) If Seller does not provide all of the
representations and warranties specified in clauses
(i) or (ii) above, then Purchaser may elect either to
(A) terminate the Agreement pursuant to Section 13(a)
hereof or (B) proceed to Closing, in which case it
shall waive its right to seek indemnity from Seller
for any loss, liability or damage resulting from the
Breach following the Closing.

(iv) If Seller makes all the representations
and warranties specified in clauses (i) or (ii)
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 98 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

above, then Purchaser shall be required to proceed to
Closing, but shall retain all of its rights with
respect to obtaining indemnification from Seller for
any loss, liability or damage resulting from the
Breach.

(v) If Purchaser obtains actual knowledge of a
Breach and Seller does not have actual knowledge
thereof, then if Purchaser fails to notify Seller of
such Breach pursuant to clause (ii) above, Purchaser
shall be deemed to have waived such Breach.

(vi) The representations and warranties made by
Seller pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above shall
survive the Closing Date and shall expire six months
after the date of this Agreement; provided, however,
that this provision shall not otherwise affect
Purchaser's rights under Sections 12 and 14(b) of
this Agreement.

conclusively deemed to have been received upon receipt of

answerback confirmation.

16. Legal and Other Costs. (a) In the event that

any party (the "Defaulting Party") defaults in its obligations

under this Agreement and, as a result thereof, the other party
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 100 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

(the "Non-Defaulting Party") seeks to enforce its rights

hereunder against the Defaulting Party, then, in addition to

all damages and other remedies to which the Non-Defaulting

Party is entitled hereunder by reason of such default, the

Defaulting Party shall promptly pay to the Non-Defaulting Party

an amount equal to all reasonable costs and expenses (including

reasonable attorneys' fees) paid or incurred by the Non-

Defaulting Party in connection with such enforcement, subject

to the limitations of Section 12 hereof.

(b) In the event that the Non-Defaulting Party is

entitled to receive an amount of money by reason of the

Defaulting Party's default hereunder, then, in addition to such

amount of money, the Defaulting Party shall promptly pay to the

Non-Defaulting Party a sum equal to interest on such amount of

money accruing at the rate of 1.5% per month (but if such rate

is not permitted under the laws of the State of New York, then

at the highest rate which is permitted to be paid under the

laws of the State of New York) during the period between the

date such payment should have been made hereunder and the date

of the actual payment thereof.

(c) Except as provided in this Section 16 or

otherwise in this Agreement, each party hereto shall pay its

own legal, accounting and other expenses in connection with the

preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of this
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 101 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated

hereby.

17. Public Announcements. At all times at or before

the Closing, Seller and Purchaser will not issue or make any

reports, statements or releases to the public or generally to

the employees, customers, suppliers or other persons to whom

the Company and the Transferred Subsidiaries sell goods or

provide services or with whom the Company and the Transferred

Subsidiaries otherwise have significant business relationships

with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated

hereby without the consent of the other, which consent shall

not be unreasonably withheld. If either party is unable to

obtain the approval of its public report, statement or release

from the other party and such report, statement or release is,

in the opinion of legal counsel to such party, required by law

in order to discharge such party's disclosure obligations, then

such party may make or issue the legally required report,

statement or release and promptly furnish the other party with

a copy thereof. Seller and Purchaser will also obtain the

other party's prior approval, which approval shall not be

unreasonably withheld, of any press release to be issued

immediately following the execution of this Agreement or the

Closing hereunder with respect to the transactions contemplated

by this Agreement.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 102 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

18. Scope of Representations and Warranties. 

Neither party makes any representation and warranties

whatsoever, express or implied, except for those

representations and warranties (a) contained in this Agreement,

in the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and in the Closing

Certificates to be delivered pursuant to Sections 10(d) and

11(c) hereto or (b) explicitly identified by the person making

such representation, as a representation and warranty under

this Agreement in any other agreement, document, certificate or

instrument delivered in connection herewith (collectively,

"Instrument").

19. Non-Competition.

19.1 Covenant. (a) Seller hereby agrees that for

a period of five years following the Closing Date (the

"Restricted Period") neither the Seller nor any of its

subsidiaries, whether acting individually or through any joint 

venture or one or more third parties, shall:

(i) own, manage, operate, control, or engage in

the ownership, management, operation or control of or

have any interest in, as a stockholder, partner or

otherwise, any business, entity or enterprise that

engages in the Business within the Territory (as

hereinafter defined) during the Restricted Period; 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 103 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

(ii) interfere in any material respect with any

contractual relationship of the Business with any

customer or supplier of the Business; or

(iii) solicit the employment of any person who

at the time is, or at any time within the prior three

months shall have been, an employee of the Business

(other than one who resigns voluntarily prior to any

such solicitation or is terminated by the Business

after the Closing Date).

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary

contained herein, this agreement is not intended to and shall

not be construed as prohibiting Seller or any of its Affiliates

from:

(i) purchasing products of the Business

for such Person's own use;

(ii) acquiring the beneficial ownership of

less than 5% of the equity securities of any

publicly traded corporation; or

(iii) acquiring any business, entity or

enterprise which, as an incidental portion of

its business, engages in the Business, provided,

however, that Seller promptly divests itself of

such portion following the acquisition thereof.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 104 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, the "Territory"

shall mean any state or territory of the United States and any

foreign country or any foreign territory.

19.2 Confidentiality. Seller acknowledges that

certain information relating to the Business is confidential

and that such information is a special, valuable and major

asset of the Business, and that wrongful use or disclosure of

any such confidential information would cause Purchaser

immediate and irreparable harm. Seller hereby agrees that

during the Restricted Period, it will not, and will cause its

officers, employees, agents, representatives, subsidiaries and

other Affiliates not to disclose to others, directly or

indirectly, any confidential information relating to the

Business (including, without limitation, any confidential

information relating to programs, techniques or work products,

any trade secrets, any reports, recommendations or conclusions

or any information as to present or future business plans or

finances, or with respect to any products, services, suppliers,

customers or prospective customers relating to the Business)

without the prior written consent of the Purchaser (a) except

as may be necessary to comply with any applicable law,

governmental order or regulation (and in any such case only

after affording the Purchaser the opportunity to review the

text of such disclosure before it is made) and (b) except for
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 105 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

information which is or becomes publicly available other than

as a result of a breach by Seller of the provisions hereof.

19.3 Remedies. Seller hereby acknowledges,

represents and warrants to Purchaser that the provisions of

Sections 19.1 and 19.2 are reasonable in all respects and

necessary and appropriate to protect the legitimate business

interests of Purchaser in connection with the Business. The

parties acknowledge that any breach or violation, or threatened

breach or violation, of any provision of such Sections may

cause Purchaser immediate and irreparable harm that cannot be

adequately compensated by money damages. In any such event,

Purchaser shall, in addition to all other rights or remedies

available at law or in equity, be entitled to obtain any

injunctive relief without having to prove the inadequacy of the

available remedies at law or any actual damages to restrain any

breach or violation, or threatened breach or violation, of such

Sections by Seller. Any remedy sought or obtained by Purchaser

shall not be considered either exclusive or a waiver of the

rights of Purchaser or any other person to assert any other

remedies they have in law or equity. In any proceeding upon a

motion for any such injunctive relief, Seller's ability to

answer in damages shall not be a bar, or be interposed as a

defense, to the granting of such injunctive relief against

Seller.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 106 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

19.4 Non-Competition Severability. If any provision

of this Section 19 is determined to be invalid, unenforceable

or excessive in scope by any court or other body of competent

jurisdiction, such provision shall be ineffective only to the

most limited extent so as not to render the agreement not to

compete unenforceable, and the remaining provisions shall

remain in full force and effect as if this Section 19 had been

constructed with the invalid, unenforceable or excessive

provision so limited.

20. Miscellaneous. (a) This Agreement and the

letter agreement dated May 27, 1994 between Seller and

Purchaser (the "Confidentiality Agreement") constitute the

entire agreement of the parties with respect to the subject

matter hereof and thereof, supersede all prior understandings,

whether written or oral, with respect thereto and may not be

modified, amended or terminated except by a written agreement

specifically referring to this Agreement or the Confidentiality

Agreement, as the case may be, signed by all of the parties

hereto. Nothing herein expressed or implied is intended to or

shall be construed to confer upon or give any Person other than

the parties hereto, their successors or permitted assigns, any

rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

(b) No waiver of any provision hereof or of any

breach or default hereunder shall be considered valid unless in

a writing specifically identifying such provision, breach or
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 107 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

default and signed by the party giving such waiver, and no such

waiver shall be deemed a waiver of any other provision or any

subsequent breach or any other default of the same or similar

nature.

(c) Neither this Agreement nor any right, interest

or obligation hereunder may be assigned by either party without

the prior consent of the other, and any attempt to do so will

be void, except that Purchaser may assign its rights and

delegate the performance of its obligations hereunder to a

directly or indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary that agrees in

writing to be bound by all the terms hereof, but no such

assignment or delegation shall relieve Purchaser of its

obligations hereunder. 

(d) The section and paragraph headings contained

herein are for the purposes of convenience only and are not

intended to define or limit the contents of said sections or

paragraphs, or otherwise affect the meaning or interpretation

of this Agreement.

(e) Each party hereto shall cooperate, shall take

such further action and shall execute and deliver such further

documents as may be reasonably requested by any other party in

order to carry out the provisions and purposes of this

Agreement. 
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 108 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

(f) This Agreement may be executed in one or more

counterparts, all of which taken together shall be deemed one

original.

(g) This Agreement and all amendments thereof shall

be governed by and construed in accordance with the law of the

State of New York applicable to contracts made and to be

performed entirely therein.

(h) Should any provision of this Agreement be

determined to be invalid, it shall be severed from this

Agreement and the remaining provisions hereof shall remain in

full force and effect as if this Agreement had been executed

with the invalid portion eliminated.

(i) Any dispute or controversy arising with respect

to a claim of indemnification hereunder, including, without

limitation, any dispute concerning the scope of this

arbitration clause, shall be settled by arbitration in New York

City by a panel of three arbitrators in accordance with the

rules of the American Arbitration Association. Judgment upon

the award rendered by the arbitrators shall be final,

conclusive and binding on the parties and may be entered in and

enforced to the fullest extent of the law by any court having

jurisdiction thereof, and the parties hereby consent to the

jurisdiction of the New York courts for this purpose.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 109 -- Exhibit 2.1 (Stock Purchase Agreement)

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused

this Agreement to be duly executed as of the day and year first

above written.

(A) the Company shall accept Bid Lenders' conforming
Bid Offers only on the basis of ascending Absolute
Rates or Eurocurrency Bid Margins and shall not accept
any Bid Lender's conforming Bid Offer to make a Bid
Advance at a particular Absolute Rate or Eurocurrency
Bid Margin for a particular Interest Period if the
Company has decided to reject any other Bid Lender's
conforming Bid Offer to make a Bid Advance with the
same Interest Period at a lower Absolute Rate or
Eurocurrency Bid Margin, as the case may be;

(B) the aggregate principal amount of all Bid Offers
accepted by the Company shall not, after giving effect
to all reductions made pursuant to proviso (C) of this
Section 2.5 (d)(ii) below, exceed the principal amount
specified in the Bid Borrowing Request;

(C) if the Company shall accept any Bid Offer to
make a Bid Advance at a particular Absolute Rate or
Eurocurrency Bid Margin, as the case may be, for a
particular Interest Period, then the Company shall
accept all offers to make Bid Advances at such Absolute
Rate or Eurocurrency Bid Margin, as the case may be,
for the same Interest Period; provided, however, that,
if Bid Offers are made by two or more Bid Lenders at
the same Absolute Rates or Eurocurrency Bid Margins
(with respect to the related Interest Period(s)) as the
case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount
than the amount in respect of which such Bid Offers are
accepted for the related Interest Period, the principal
amount of Bid Advances in respect of which such Bid
Offers are accepted shall be allocated by the Agent
among such Bid Lenders as nearly as possible (and in
such multiples, not greater than One Million Dollars
($1,000,000), as the Agent may deem appropriate) in
proportion to the aggregate principal amounts of such
Bid Offers. Each Bid Lender acknowledges and agrees
that any Bid Offer submitted by such Bid Lender may be
modified in accordance with this clause (C), and no
such modification shall constitute a rejection of such
Bid Offer. Determinations by Agent of the amounts of
Bid Advances hereunder shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 46 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

Subject to the foregoing requirements, the Company may accept or
reject, at the Company's sole discretion, the offer to make Bid
Advances contained in any Bid Offer. Each notice given by the
Company pursuant to this Section 2.5(d) shall be irrevocable. 
Failure by the Company to accept a Bid Offer in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.5(d) shall constitute a rejection of
such Bid Offer.

(e) Acknowledgment of Bid Borrowings. Promptly after
acceptance of a Bid Offer by the Company pursuant to Section 2.5(d)
(ii) hereof:

(i) in any case no later than 11:30 a.m. (Detroit time)
on the date of such Bid Advance in the case of an Absolute
Rate Bid Advance and 1:00 p.m. (Detroit time) four (4)
Business Days prior to the date of such Bid Advance in the
case of a Eurocurrency Bid Advance, the Company shall deliver
by facsimile to the Agent a Bid Acknowledgment in
substantially the form of Exhibit "C-3" hereto ("Bid
Acknowledgment") confirming, with respect to each Bid Advance
to be made to the Company, the Interest Period, the amount of
the borrowing and the Absolute Rate or Eurocurrency Bid
Margin, as the case may be, therefor; and

(ii) in any case no later than noon (Detroit time) on
the date of the proposed Bid Borrowing in the case of an
Absolute Rate Bid Advance and 2:00 p.m. (Detroit time) four
(4) Business Days prior to the date of such Bid Advance in the
case of a Euro-currency Bid Advance, the Agent will give
telephonic notice to each Bid Lender of each Interest Period,
amount of the borrowing, and the Absolute Rate or Eurocurrency
Bid Margin, as the case may be, so accepted by the Company.

(f) Bid Advance Funding. At or before 2:00 p.m. (Detroit
time) on the Business Day specified for each Bid Advance in the
case of an Absolute Rate Bid Advance and noon (Detroit time) on the
Business Day of such Bid Advance in the case of a Eurocurrency Bid
Advance, each Bid Lender whose Bid Offer in respect thereof the
Company accepted pursuant to Section 2.5(d)(ii) hereof shall
deposit with the Agent same day funds in an amount equal to the
principal amount of such Bid Lender's Bid Advance. Such deposit
will be made to an account which the Agent shall from time to time
specify by notice to the Bid Lenders. To the extent same day funds
are received from such Bid Lenders, the Agent shall make such same
day funds available to the Company by wire transfer to the accounts
which Company shall have specified in its Bid Acknowledgment. No
Bid Lender's obligation to make any Bid Advance shall be affected
by any other Bid Lender's failure to make any Bid Advance.

Unless Agent shall have received notice from a Bid Lender
prior to the date of funding of such Bid Lender's Bid Advance
accepted by the Company that such Bid Lender will not make
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 47 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

available to the Agent such Bid Lender's share of such Bid Advance,
Agent may assume that such Bid Lender has made such share available
to Agent on the date of such Bid Advance in accordance with this
subparagraph (f) and Agent may (but under no circumstances shall be
required to do so), in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to Company on such date a corresponding amount. If and
to the extent that such Bid Lender shall not have so made such
share available to Agent in accordance with the terms hereof, such
Bid Lender and Company severally agree to repay to Agent forthwith
upon demand such corresponding amount, together with interest
thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available
to Company until the date such amount is repaid to Agent, at (i) in
the case of Company, a rate per annum equal to the Prime-based Rate
and (ii) in the case of such Bid Lender, the Federal Funds
Effective Rate. If such Bid Lender shall repay to Agent such
corresponding amount, such amount so repaid shall constitute such
Bid Lender's portion of the Bid Advance included in such Bid
Advance for purposes of this Agreement.

Promptly after each Bid Advance, and in any case no later than
the immediately succeeding Business Day, the Agent will deliver to
each of the Banks, a copy of the Bid Acknowledgment, specifying the
date and amount of such Bid Advance, the amounts of the Bid
Advances which comprise such borrowing and the Interest Period(s)
thereof and the Absolute Rate(s) or Eurocurrency Bid Margin(s) as
the case may be, accepted. Furthermore, upon the request of any
Bank from time to time hereunder, the Agent will provide summaries
to such Bank of all Bid Offers received in response to any Bid
Borrowing Request.

(g) Bid Notes. The Bid Advances of each Bid Lender shall
be evidenced by a promissory note in the form of Exhibit "C-4"
attached hereto ("Bid Notes"), with appropriate insertions and
shall be payable to the order of such Bid Lender, shall be dated as
of the date of this Agreement, shall set forth the maximum
principal amount of the aggregate Bid Advances which may be made by
such Bid Lender and shall mature, subject to the terms hereof, on
the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. Each Bid Lender shall record
in its records, or at its option on the schedule attached to its
Bid Note, the date and amount of each Bid Advance made by such Bid
Lender, the Applicable Interest Rate with respect to each Bid
Advance, each repayment thereof and the dates on which each
Interest Period for such Bid Advance shall begin and end. The
aggregate unpaid principal amount so recorded shall be conclusive
evidence of the principal amount owing and unpaid on such Bid Note,
absent manifest error. The failure to so record any such amount or
any error in so recording any such amount shall not, however, limit
or otherwise affect the obligations of the Company hereunder or
under any such Bid Note.

2.6 Prime-based Interest Payments. Interest on the unpaid
balance of all Prime-based Advances from time to time outstanding
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 48 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

shall accrue from the date of such Advance to the Revolving Credit
Maturity Date (and until paid), at a per annum interest rate equal
to the Prime-based Rate, and shall be payable in immediately
available funds quarterly commencing on September 30, 1994, and on
the last day of each calendar quarter thereafter. Interest accruing
at the Prime-based Rate shall be computed on the basis of a 360 day
year and assessed for the actual number of days elapsed, and in
such computation effect shall be given to any change in the
interest rate resulting from a change in the Prime-based Rate on
the date of such change in the Prime-based Rate.

2.7 Absolute Rate and Eurocurrency-based Interest Payments.
Interest on each Absolute Rate Advance and each 1 month, 2 month
and 3 month Eurocurrency-based Advance shall accrue at its
Applicable Interest Rate and shall be payable in immediately
available funds on the last day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto. Interest shall be payable on each 6 month Eurocurrency-
based Advance outstanding from time to time, at intervals of 3
months, as the case may be, after the first day of the applicable
Interest Period, and shall also be payable on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto. Interest accruing at the
Absolute Rate or the Eurocurrency-based Rate shall be computed on
the basis of a 360 day year and assessed for the actual number of
days elapsed from the first day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto to but not including the last day thereof. Interest due on
any Advance made in an Alternative Currency shall be paid in such
Alternative Currency.

2.8 Interest Payments on Conversions. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the preceding sections, all accrued and
unpaid interest on any Advance converted pursuant to Section 2.3
hereof shall be due and payable in full on the date such Advance is
converted.

2.9 Interest on Default. In the event and so long as any
Event of Default shall exist under this Agreement, interest shall
be payable daily on all Advances of the Revolving Credit and all
Bid Advances from time to time outstanding at a per annum rate
equal to the Applicable Interest Rate, plus three percent (3%) for
the remainder of the then existing Interest Period, if any, and at
all other such times, with respect to Domestic Advances from time
to time outstanding, at a per annum rate equal to the Prime-based
Rate plus three percent (3%), and, with respect to Eurocurrency-
based Advances from time to time outstanding, (i) at a per annum
rate calculated by the Agent, (or, in the case of a Eurocurrency
Bid Advance, by the applicable Bid Lender having funded such
Advance) whose determination shall be conclusive absent manifest
error, on a daily basis, equal to three percent (3%) above the
interest rate per annum at which one (1) day deposits (or, if such
amount due remains unpaid for more than three (3) Business Days,
then for such other period of time as the Agent (or the applicable
Bid Lender, as aforesaid) may elect which shall in no event be
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 49 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

longer than six (6) months) in the relevant eurocurrency in the
amount of such overdue payment due to the Agent (or the applicable
Bid Lender, as aforesaid) are offered by the Eurocurrency Lending
Office for the applicable period determined as provided above, or
(ii) if at any such time such deposits are not offered by the
Eurocurrency Lending Office, then at a rate per annum equal to
three percent (3%) above the rate determined by the Agent (or the
applicable Bid Lender, as aforesaid) to be its aggregate marginal
cost (including the cost of maintaining any required reserves or
deposit insurance) of carrying the amount of such Eurocurrency-
based Advance.

2.10 Determination, Denomination and Redenomination of
Alternative Currency Advances. Whenever, pursuant to any provision
of this Agreement:

(a) an Advance of the Revolving Credit is initially
funded, as opposed to any refunding or conversion thereof, in an
Alternative Currency, the amount to be advanced hereunder will be
the equivalent in such Alternative Currency of the Dollar Amount of
such Advance;

(b) an existing Advance of the Revolving Credit
denominated in an Alternative Currency is to be refunded, in whole
or in part, with an Advance denominated in the same Alternative
Currency, the amount of the new Advance shall be continued in the
amount of the Alternative Currency so refunded;

(c) an existing Advance of the Revolving Credit
denominated in an Alternative Currency is to be converted, in whole
or in part, to an Advance denominated in another Alternative
Currency, the amount of the new Advance shall be that amount of the
Alternative Currency of the new Advance which may be purchased,
using the most favorable spot exchange rate determined by Agent to
be available to it for the sale of Dollars for such other
Alternative Currency at approximately (11:00 a.m.) (Detroit time)
two (2) Business Days prior to the last day of the Eurocurrency
Interest Period applicable to the existing Advance, with the Dollar
Amount of the existing Advance, or portion thereof being converted;
and

(d) an existing Advance denominated in an
Alternative Currency is to be converted, in whole or in part, to an
Advance denominated in Dollars, the amount of the new Advance shall
be the Dollar Amount of the existing Advance, or portion thereof
being converted (determined as aforesaid).

2.11 Prepayment. Company or the applicable Permitted
Borrower may prepay all or part of the outstanding balance of any
Prime-based Advance(s) under the Revolving Credit Notes at any time
(subject to not less than one (1) Business Day's notice to Agent),
provided that the principal amount of any partial prepayment shall
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 50 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

be at least Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) and the
aggregate principal balance of Prime-based Advance(s) remaining
outstanding shall be at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000).
Company or the applicable Permitted Borrower (if applicable) may
prepay all or part of any Absolute Rate Bid Advance or
Eurocurrency-based Advance (subject to not less than three (3)
Business Day's notice to Agent) only on the last day of the
Interest Period therefor, provided that (i) in the case of Bid
Advances, there shall be no partial prepayment (such Advances to be
prepaid only in full) and (ii) in the case of Eurocurrency-based
Advances of the Revolving Credit, the amount of any such partial
prepayment shall be at least One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), or
the equivalent thereof in an Alternative Currency, and the unpaid
portion of such Advance which is refunded or converted under
Section 2.3 shall be at least Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) or
the equivalent thereof in an Alternative Currency. Any prepayment
made in accordance with this Section shall be without premium,
penalty or prejudice to the right to reborrow under the terms of
this Agreement. Any other prepayment of all or any portion of the
Revolving Credit or of any Bid Advance shall be subject to Section
11.1, hereof, but otherwise without premium, penalty or prejudice.

2.12 Prime-based Advance in Absence of Election or Upon
Default. If, as to any outstanding Eurocurrency-based Advance of
the Revolving Credit, Agent has not received payment on the last
day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, or does not receive
a timely Request for Advance meeting the requirements of Section
2.3 with respect to the refunding or conversion of an Advance of
the Revolving Credit, or, subject to Section 2.9, hereof, if on
such day a Default or an Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, the principal amount thereof which is not then
prepaid in the case of a Eurocurrency-based Advance shall be
converted automatically to a Prime-based Advance and the Agent
shall thereafter promptly notify Company of said action. If a
Eurocurrency-based Advance converted hereunder is payable in an
Alternative Currency, the Prime-based Advance shall be in an amount
equal to the Dollar Amount of such Eurocurrency-based Advance at
such time and the Agent (or, with respect to any Eurocurrency-based
Bid Advance in an Alternative Currency, the applicable Bid Lender)
shall use said Prime-based Advance to fund payment of the
Alternative Currency obligation, all subject to the provisions of
Section 2.15. The Company shall reimburse Agent and each of the
Banks on demand for any costs incurred by the Agent resulting from
the conversion pursuant to this Section 2.12 of Eurocurrency-based
Advances payable in an Alternative Currency to Prime-based
Advances.

2.13 Revolving Credit Facility Fee. From the date hereof to
the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, the Company shall pay to the
Agent, for distribution to the Banks pro rata, a Revolving Credit
Facility Fee consisting of the Applicable Fee Percentage per annum,
calculated on a daily basis, times the Revolving Credit Aggregate
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 51 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

Commitment then in effect hereunder, regardless of the aggregate
amount of Advances of the Revolving Credit or Bid Advances
outstanding from time to time.

The Revolving Credit Facility Fee shall be payable quarterly in
arrears commencing September 30, 1994, and on the last day of each
calendar quarter thereafter and at the Revolving Credit Maturity
Date, and shall be computed on the basis of a year of three hundred
sixty (360) days and assessed for the actual number of days
elapsed, giving immediate effect to any changes in the Applicable
Fee Percentage. Whenever any payment of the Revolving Credit
Facility Fee shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the
date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next Business
Day. Upon receipt of such payment, Agent shall make prompt payment
to each Bank of its share of the Revolving Credit Facility Fee
based upon its respective Percentage. The Revolving Credit Facility
Fee shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

2.14 Revolving Credit Commitment Fee. From the date hereof
to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, the Company shall pay to the
Agent, for distribution to the Banks (as set forth below), a
Revolving Credit Commitment Fee equal to the sum of

(a) .0625% per annum times the daily average amount
by which the Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment then in effect
hereunder exceeds the Dollar Amount of the principal amount
outstanding from time to time under the Revolving Credit, plus the
aggregate daily amount of Bid Advances outstanding from time to
time hereunder, determined, if any Advance in an Alternative
Currency is outstanding, as of the last day of each Interest Period
(but otherwise computed on a daily basis); and

(b) the Applicable Fee Percentage per annum, times
the Revolving Credit Designated Portion in effect under Section
2.17 hereof during such period, calculated on a daily basis.

The Revolving Credit Commitment Fee shall be payable quarterly in
arrears commencing on September 30, 1994, and on the last day of
each calendar quarter thereafter and at the Revolving Credit
Maturity Date, and shall be computed on the basis of a year of
three hundred sixty (360) days and assessed for the actual number
of days elapsed. Whenever any payment of the Revolving Credit
Commitment Fee shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day,
the date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next Business
Day. Upon receipt of such payment Agent shall make prompt payment
to each Bank of its share of the Revolving Credit Commitment Fee
based upon its respective Percentage. It is expressly understood
that the Revolving Credit Commitment Fee shall not be refundable
under any circumstances.

2.15 Currency Appreciation; Sublimits; Mandatory Reduction
of Indebtedness. (a) If at any time and for any reason, the
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 52 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

aggregate principal amount (tested in the manner set forth below)
of all Advances of the Revolving Credit hereunder to the Company
and to the Permitted Borrowers made in Dollars and the aggregate
Current Dollar Equivalent of all Advances hereunder to the Company
and to the Permitted Borrowers in any Alternative Currency as of
such time, plus the aggregate principal amount of Bid Advances
outstanding hereunder as of such time, exceeds the Revolving Credit
Aggregate Commitment, the Company and the Permitted Borrowers
shall:

(i) if otherwise entitled to do so under Section
2.18 hereof, activate a sufficient amount of
the Revolving Credit Designated Portion to
eliminate any such excess; and

(ii) if (and to the extent) necessary to eliminate
such excess, immediately repay that portion of
the Indebtedness then carried as a Prime-based
Advance, if any, by the Dollar amount of such
excess, and/or reduce any pending request for
an Advance in Dollars on such day by the
Dollar Amount of such excess, to the extent
thereof; and

(iii) if (and to the extent) necessary to eliminate
such excess, on the last day of each Interest
Period of any Absolute Rate Bid Advance or
Eurocurrency-based Advance outstanding as of
such time, until the necessary reductions of
Indebtedness under this Section 2.15(a) have
been fully made, repay the Indebtedness
carried in such Advances and/or reduce any
requests for refunding or conversion of such
Advances submitted (or to be submitted) by the
Company or any of the Permitted Borrowers in
respect of such Advances, by the Amount in
Dollars or the Applicable Alternative
Currency, as the case may be, of such excess,
to the extent thereof.

The Company's compliance with this Section 2.15(a) shall be tested
on a daily or other basis satisfactory to Agent in its sole
discretion, provided that at any time while the aggregate Advances
of the Revolving Credit available to be borrowed hereunder equal or
exceed Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000), the Company's compliance
with this Section 2.15(a) shall be tested as of the last day of
each calendar quarter.

(b) If at any time and for any reason the aggregate
principal amount (tested in the manner set forth below) of all
Advances of the Revolving Credit hereunder to a Permitted Borrower
made in Dollars and the aggregate Current Dollar Equivalent of all
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 53 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

Advances hereunder to such Permitted Borrower in any Alternative
Currency as of such time, exceeds the Sublimit applicable to such
Permitted Borrower, the Company or such Permitted Borrower shall
(i) immediately repay that portion of the Indebtedness outstanding
to such Permitted Borrower then carried as a Prime-based Advance,
if any, by the Dollar Amount of any such excess and/or reduce on
such day any pending request for an Advance in Dollars submitted by
such Permitted Borrower by the Dollar Amount of such excess, to the
extent thereof; and (ii) on the last day of each Interest Period of
any Eurocurrency-based Advance outstanding to such Permitted
Borrower as of such time, until the necessary reductions of
Indebtedness under this Section 2.15(b) have been fully made, repay
such Indebtedness carried in such Advances and/or reduce any
requests for refunding or conversion of such Advances submitted (or
to be submitted) by such Permitted Borrower in respect of such
Advances, by the Amount in Dollars or the applicable Alternative
Currency, as the case may be, of any remaining excess, to the
extent thereof. Each Permitted Borrower's compliance with this
Section 2.15(b) shall be tested on a daily or other basis
satisfactory to Agent in its sole discretion, provided that at any
time while the unused portion of the applicable Sublimit then in
effect exceeds Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000), compliance with
this Section 2.15(b) shall be tested as of the last day of each
calendar quarter.

2.16 Optional Reduction or Termination of Revolving Credit
Maximum Amount. Provided that no Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Company may upon not less than ten
(10) Business Days' prior written notice to the Agent, permanently
reduce the Revolving Credit Maximum Amount in whole at any time, or
in part from time to time, without premium or penalty, provided
that: (i) each partial reduction of the Revolving Credit Maximum
Amount shall be in an aggregate amount equal to Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000) or an integral multiple thereof; (ii) each
reduction shall be accompanied by the payment of the Revolving
Credit Commitment Fee, if any, accrued to the date of such
reduction; (iii) the Company shall prepay in accordance with the
terms hereof the amount, if any, by which the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of Revolving Credit Notes, plus the aggregate
principal amount of Bid Advances then outstanding, exceeds the
amount of the Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment then in effect
(taking into account any reductions thereof resulting from such
reductions in the Revolving Credit Maximum Amount), together with
interest thereon to the date of prepayment; and (iv) if the
termination or reduction of the Revolving Credit Maximum Amount
requires the prepayment of an Absolute Rate Bid Advance or a
Eurocurrency-based Advance, the termination or reduction may be
made only on the last Business Day of the then current Interest
Period applicable to such Absolute Rate Bid Advance or
Eurocurrency-based Advance Loan. Reductions of the Revolving Credit
Maximum Amount (and any accompanying prepayments of the Revolving
Credit Notes) shall reduce each Bank's portion thereof
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 54 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

proportionately, based upon the applicable percentage (and any
accompanying prepayments shall be distributed by Agent to each Bank
in accordance with such Bank's Percentage thereof), and shall be
permanent and irrevocable, and not available for reinstatement by
or readvance to the Company or the Permitted Borrowers. The amount
of any reductions of the Revolving Credit Maximum Amount under this
Section 2.16 shall first be applied to reduce the maximum amount of
the Revolving Credit Maximum Amount which may be designated as the
Revolving Credit Designated Portion hereunder, before being applied
to reduce the Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment then in effect.

2.17 Revolving Credit Designated Portion. The Company may at
any time and from time to time, upon at least five (5) Business
Days' prior written notice to the Agent, subject to any prior
activations of the Revolving Credit Designated Portion which shall
remain in effect for a period of not less than thirty (30)
consecutive days in accordance with Section 2.18 hereof, designate
a portion of the Revolving Credit Maximum Amount up to a maximum of
One Hundred Million Dollars ($100,000,000) at any time in the
aggregate so designated (subject to reduction under Section 2.16
hereof), as not presently available for borrowing hereunder,
provided that (i) each such designation shall be in an aggregate
amount equal to at least Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) or more,
in increments of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000); (ii) each such
designation shall be accompanied by the payment of the Revolving
Credit Commitment Fee, if any, accrued to the date of such
designation; (iii) the Company shall prepay in accordance with the
terms hereof the amount, if any, by which the aggregate unpaid
principal amount of Revolving Credit Notes, plus the aggregate
principal amount of Bid Advances outstanding hereunder, exceeds the
amount of the Revolving Credit Aggregate Commitment, taking into
account the aforesaid designation under this Section 2.17, together
with interest thereon to the date of prepayment; and (iv) if the
designation under this Section 2.17 requires the prepayment of an
Absolute Rate Bid Advance or a Eurocurrency-based Advance, such
designation may be effective only on the last Business Day of the
then current Interest Period(s) applicable to such Absolute Rate
Bid Advance or Eurocurrency-based Advance. The Revolving Credit
Aggregate Commitment shall be reduced by the aggregate amount so
designated under this Section 2.17 as the Revolving Credit
Designated Portion, upon the effective date of each such
designation.

2.18 Activation of Designated Portion. Provided that no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Company
may, upon not less than ten (10) Business Days' prior written
notice to the Agent, elect to activate all or any part of the
Revolving Credit Designated Portion, provided that each such
activation shall be in an aggregate amount equal to at least Ten
Million Dollars ($10,000,000), or more in increments of One Million
Dollars ($1,000,000) and provided further that, on or before the
requested date for activation, Company shall pay to the Agent, for
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 55 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

distribution to the Banks based on their respective Percentages,
the Activation Fee. Each activation of the Revolving Credit
Designated Portion shall remain in effect (and shall not be reduced
by a subsequent designation under Section 2.17 hereof) for a period
of not less than 30 consecutive days. Upon the effectiveness of any
activation of the Revolving Credit Designated Portion under this
Section 2.18, the Revolving Credit Designated Portion shall
decrease by the amount so activated and the Revolving Credit
Aggregate Commitment shall increase by the amount so activated.

2.19 Extension of Revolving Credit Maturity Date. Provided
that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
Company may, by written notice to Agent and each Bank (which notice
shall be irrevocable and which shall not be deemed effective unless
actually received by Agent and each Bank) prior to May 18th, but
not before April 18th, of each year, request that the Banks extend
the then applicable Revolving Credit Maturity Date to a date that
is one year later than the Revolving Credit Maturity Date then in
effect (each such request, a "Request"). Each Bank shall, not
later than thirty (30) calendar days following the date of its
receipt of the Request, give written notice to the Agent stating
whether such Bank is willing to extend the Revolving Credit
Maturity Date as requested. If Agent has received the aforesaid
written approvals of such Request from each of the Banks, then,
effective upon the date of Agent's receipt of all such written
approvals from the Banks, as aforesaid, the Revolving Credit
Maturity Date shall be so extended for an additional one year
period, the term Revolving Credit Maturity Date shall mean such
extended date and Agent shall promptly notify the Company that such
extension has occurred. If (i) any Bank gives the Agent written
notice that it is unwilling to extend the Revolving Credit Maturity
Date as requested or (ii) any Bank fails to provide written
approval to Agent of such a Request within thirty (30) calendar
days of the date of Agent's receipt of the Request, then (x) the
Banks shall be deemed to have declined to extend the Revolving
Credit Maturity Date, (y) the then-current Revolving Credit
Maturity Date shall remain in effect (with no further right on the
part of Company to request extensions thereof under this Section
2.19) and (z) the commitments of the Banks to make Advances of the
Revolving Credit hereunder shall terminate on the Revolving Credit
Maturity Date then in effect, and Agent shall promptly notify
Company thereof.

2.20 Revolving Credit as Renewal; Application of Advances
Thereafter. The Revolving Credit Notes issued by the Company and
the Permitted Borrowers shall constitute renewal and replacement
evidence of all present indebtedness of Company and the Permitted
Borrowers to the Prior Banks and to Agent outstanding as of the
date hereof under the Prior Loan Agreement, and the notes issued
pursuant thereto. Thereafter, Advances of the Revolving Credit, and
Bid Advances, shall be available, subject to the terms hereof, to
fund working capital needs or other general corporate purposes of
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 56 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

the Company and the Permitted Borrowers. Advances of the Revolving
Credit, and Bid Advances, shall not be available to fund, directly
or indirectly, the Target Company Acquisition or the payment of any
transfer taxes, stamp duties, brokerage fees transfer taxes or
other costs and expenses resulting directly or indirectly from such
acquisition.

3. TERM LOAN

3.1 Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Bank, severally and for itself alone, agrees to
advance to the Company, in a single Advance in Dollars concurrently
with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, sums not to
exceed in the aggregate such Bank's respective Percentage of the
Term Loan. Advances of the Term Loan shall be evidenced by Term
Notes executed and delivered by the Company to each of the Banks
concurrently herewith in the form attached hereto as Exhibit "D"
(with appropriate insertions acceptable to the Banks in form and
substance) and in the face amount of each Bank's respective
Percentage thereof.

3.2 Repayment of Principal Until Term Loan Maturity Date.
Until the Term Loan Maturity Date, when the entire unpaid principal
balance of the Term Loan and all accrued interest and other sums
outstanding thereon shall be paid in full (subject to the terms
hereof), the principal Indebtedness evidenced by the Term Notes
shall be repaid on the following dates and in the following amounts
(irrespective of and in addition to any principal payments
hereunder based on Excess Cash Flow, but taking into account any
optional prepayments hereunder):

(a) on December 31, 1994, the sum of Five Million
Dollars ($5,000,000);

(b) commencing on March 31, 1995, and on the last day
of each calendar quarter thereafter through December 31, 1996,
the sum of Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars
($2,500,000);

(c) commencing on March 31, 1997, and on the last day
of each calendar quarter thereafter through December 31, 1997,
the sum of Three Million Seven Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($3,750,000);

(d) commencing on March 31, 1998, and on the last day
of each calendar quarter thereafter through December 31, 1999,
the sum of Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000); and

(e) commencing on March 31, 2000, and on the last day

the sum of Five Million Six Hundred Twenty-Five Thousand
Dollars ($5,625,000);
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 57 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

There shall be no readvance or reborrowing of any principal
reductions of the Term Loan.

3.3 Excess Cash Flow Recapture. Until the Company's
election of the Fixed Rate in accordance with Section 3.11 hereof,
the Term Loan shall be subject to additional required principal
reductions in the Dollar Amount of fifty percent (50%) of Excess
Cash Flow, to be applied pro rata to the Term Notes issued by the
Company (based on the principal amounts outstanding under such
Notes at the time any such payments are made hereunder), payable in
respect of each calendar year (or portion thereof) from 1994
through 1999, on the earlier of (i) the respective dates of
Company's delivery of financial statements for such calendar years
under Section 7.3(b) hereof or (ii) May 31st of the succeeding
year, as applicable, commencing on May 31, 1995 and on each May
31st thereafter until the Term Loan Maturity Date.

Principal reductions based on Excess Cash Flow shall be in addition
to scheduled principal payments under Section 3.2 hereof, as the
case may be, or any optional prepayments made prior thereto, and
shall be applied against principal installments due hereunder in
the inverse order of their maturity. There shall be no readvance or
re-borrowing of any principal reductions of the Term Loan
hereunder. If the Applicable Interest Rate for the Term Loan then
in effect is the Fixed Rate, principal reductions based on Excess
Cash Flow otherwise required under this Section 3.3 shall be
applied first, against the Roederstein Term Loan and, next, against
the Non-amortizing Term Loan, but only to the extent of the
respective principal balances then outstanding thereunder, and
shall no longer be required to be applied to the Term Loan
hereunder.

3.4 Accrual of Interest. Each Advance of Indebtedness
evidenced by the Term Notes from time to time outstanding hereunder
shall, from and after the date of such Advance, bear interest at
its Applicable Interest Rate. The amount and date of each Advance,
its Applicable Interest Rate, its Interest Period, and the amount
and date of any repayment shall be noted on Agent's records, which
records will be conclusive evidence thereof, absent manifest error.

3.5 Prime-based Interest Payments. Interest on the unpaid
balance of Indebtedness evidenced by the Term Notes which is funded
or carried as a Prime-based Advance from time to time shall accrue
from the date of such Advance to the Term Loan Maturity Date (or
until refunded, converted or paid), at a per annum interest rate
equal to the Prime-based Rate, and shall be payable in immediately
available funds quarterly commencing on the last day of the
calendar quarter in which the Advance under the applicable Term
Notes is made, and continuing on the last day of each calendar
quarter thereafter until the Term Loan Maturity Date. Interest
accruing at the Prime-based Rate shall be computed on the basis of
a 360-day year and assessed for the actual number of days elapsed,
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 58 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

and in such computation effect shall be given to any change in the
interest rate resulting from a change in the Prime-based Rate on
the date of such change in the Prime-based Rate.

3.6 Eurocurrency-based Interest Payments. Interest on
Indebtedness evidenced by the Term Notes which is funded or carried
as a 1-month, 2-month and 3-month Eurocurrency-based Advance from
time to time shall accrue at its Applicable Interest Rate and shall
be payable in immediately available funds on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto. Interest on Indebtedness
evidenced by the Term Notes which is funded or carried as a 6-month
Eurocurrency-based Advance outstanding from time to time shall be
payable in immediately available funds at intervals of 3 months
after the first day of the applicable Interest Period, and on the
last day of the applicable Interest Period. Interest accruing at
the Eurocurrency-based Rate shall be computed on the basis of a
360-day year and assessed for the actual number of days elapsed
from the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to,
but not including, the last day thereof.

3.7 Interest Payments on Conversions. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the preceding Sections, all accrued and
unpaid interest on any Advance of the Term Loan converted pursuant
to Section 3.9 hereof shall be due and payable in full on the date
such Advance of the Term Loan is converted.

3.8 Interest on Default. In the event and so long as any
Event of Default shall exist under any Term Note or under this
Agreement, interest shall be payable daily on all Advances
evidenced by the Term Notes from time to time outstanding at a per
annum rate equal to the Applicable Interest Rate, plus three
percent (3%) for the remainder of the then existing Interest
Period, if any, and at all other such times, with respect to
Domestic Advances from time to time outstanding, at a per annum
rate equal to the Prime-based Rate plus three percent (3%), and,
with respect to Eurocurrency-based Advances from time to time
outstanding under the Term Notes, (i) at a per annum rate
calculated by the Agent, whose determination shall be conclusive
absent manifest error, on a daily basis, equal to three percent
(3%) above the interest rate per annum at which one (1) day
deposits (or, if such amount due remains unpaid for more than three
(3) Business Days, then for such other period of time as the Agent
may elect which shall in no event be longer than six (6) months) in
the relevant eurocurrency in the amount of such overdue payment due
to the Agent are offered by the Eurocurrency Lending Office for the
applicable period determined as provided above, or (ii) if at any
such time such deposits are not offered by the Eurocurrency Lending
Office, then at a rate per annum equal to three percent (3%) above
the rate determined by the Agent to be its aggregate marginal cost
(including the cost of maintaining any required reserves or deposit
insurance) of carrying the amount of such Eurocurrency Advance.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 61 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

3.10 Disbursement of Advances.

(a) Upon receiving any Request for Term Loan
Advance and Rate Request from Company in compliance with
Section 3.9 hereof, Agent shall promptly notify each Bank by
wire, telex or by telephone (confirmed by wire, telecopy or
telex) of the amount of such Advance to be made and the date
such Advance is to be made by said Bank pursuant to its
Percentage of the Advance. Unless such Bank's commitment to
make Advances hereunder shall have been suspended or
terminated in accordance with this Agreement, each Bank shall
make available to Agent the amount of its Percentage of the
Advance in immediately available funds, as follows:

(i) for Prime-based Advances, at the office of
Agent located at One Detroit Center, 500
Woodward Avenue, Detroit, Michigan 48226, not
later than 2:00 p.m. (Detroit time) on the
date of such Advance; and

(ii) for Eurocurrency-based Advances, at the
Agent's Correspondent for the account of the
Eurocurrency Lending Office of the Agent, not
later than 12 Noon (the time of the Agent's
Correspondent) on the date of such Advance.

(b) Subject to submission of an executed Request
for Term Loan Advance and Rate Request by Company without
exceptions noted in the compliance certification therein,
Agent shall make available to Company the aggregate of the
amounts, in Dollars, so received by it from the Banks in like
funds:

(i) for Prime-based Advances, not later than 4:00
p.m. (Detroit time) on the date of such
Advance by deposit to an account of the
Company maintained with Agent, or to such
other account or third party as Company may
reasonably direct;

(ii) for Eurocurrency-based Advances, not later
than 4:00 p.m. (the time of the Agent's
Correspondent) on the date of such Advance, by
deposit to an account of the Company
maintained with Agent's Correspondent, or to
such other account or third party as Company
may reasonably direct.

(c) Agent shall deliver the documents and papers
received by it for the account of each Bank to such Bank or
upon its order. Unless Agent shall have been notified by any
Bank prior to the date of any proposed Advance that such Bank
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 62 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

does not intend to make available to Agent such Bank's
Percentage of the Advance, Agent may assume that such Bank has
made such amount available to Agent on such date, as aforesaid
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to
Company a corresponding amount. If such amount is not in fact
made available to Agent by such Bank, as aforesaid, Agent
shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such
Bank. If such Bank does not pay such amount forthwith upon
Agent's demand therefor, the Agent shall promptly notify
Company and Company shall pay such amount to Agent. Agent
shall also be entitled to recover from such Bank or Company,
as the case may be, interest on such amount in respect of each
day from the date such amount was made available by Agent to
Company to the date such amount is recovered by Agent, at a
rate per annum equal to:

(i) in the case of such Bank, with respect to
Prime-based Advances, the Federal Funds
Effective Rate, and with respect to
Eurocurrency-based Advances, Agent's aggregate
marginal cost (including the cost of
maintaining any required reserves or deposit
insurance and of any fees, penalties,
overdraft charges or other costs or expenses
incurred by Agent as a result of such failure
to deliver funds hereunder) of carrying such
amount; and

(ii) in the case of Company, the rate of interest
then applicable to the Term Loan.

The obligation of any Bank to make any Advance hereunder shall
not be affected by the failure of any other Bank to make any
Advance hereunder, and no Bank shall have any liability to the
Company or its Subsidiaries, the Agent, any other Bank, or any
other party for another Bank's failure to make any loan or
Advance hereunder.

3.11 Fixed Rate Election. (a) The Fixed Rate Election shall
set forth the information required on the Fixed Rate Election form
attached hereto as Exhibit "F" and shall constitute Company's
certification that the conditions required under subparagraph (c),
below, have been satisfied and that Company is entitled to elect
the Fixed Rate hereunder;

(b) The Fixed Rate Election shall be delivered to Agent
by 11:00 a.m. (Detroit time) not less than five (5) nor
greater than ten (10) Business Days prior to the proposed
effective date of such election, and once delivered to Agent
by the Company, shall not be revocable by Company;
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 63 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

(c) In order for the Fixed Rate to become effective,
the following conditions shall be satisfied by the Company
(unless waived by the Banks) on or before the proposed
effective date of the Fixed Rate Election, and shall remain
satisfied on the actual effective date thereof:

(i) As of the proposed effective date of
the Fixed Rate Election, and as of the
actual effective date thereof, no
Eurocurrency-based Rate Advance of the
Term Loan shall be outstanding;

(ii) All accrued interest outstanding under
the Term Notes as of the effective date
of the Fixed Rate Election has been paid
and discharged in full;

(iii) both before and after the effective date
of such election, the obligations of
Company set forth in this Agreement are
valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of Company;

(iv) there is no Default or Event of Default
in existence, and none will exist upon
the effective date of such election;
and

(v) the execution of such election will not
violate the terms and conditions of any
material contract, agreement or other
borrowing of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries;

(d) Subject to the foregoing, the Fixed Rate Election
shall become effective (and the Fixed Rate shall become the
Applicable Interest Rate for the Term Loan) on the proposed
effective date of the Fixed Rate Election, as specified by the
Company, whereupon Agent will notify Company and the Banks
promptly of the Fixed Rate established by it hereunder. If a
Fixed Rate Election has been submitted by Company hereunder,
the Prime-base Rate shall be the only rate available to
Company for the refunding or conversion of outstanding
Advances of the Term Loan after such submission.

(e) Company shall be entitled to deliver only one
Fixed Rate Election for the Term Loan while this
Agreement is in effect, and once so elected, the Fixed
Rate shall, subject to the terms hereof, remain the
Applicable Interest Rate for the Term Loan so long as the
Term Loan is outstanding hereunder.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 64 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

(f) Interest accruing at the Fixed Rate shall be
payable in immediately available funds quarterly
commencing on the last day of the calendar quarter in
which the Fixed Rate Election shall have been made by the
Company, and continuing on the last day of each calendar
quarter thereafter until the Term Loan Maturity Date,
shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and
assessed for the actual number of days elapsed. In the
event and so long as any Event of Default shall exist
under any Term Note or under this Agreement or any of the
other Loan Documents, interest shall be payable daily on
the Indebtedness evidenced by the Term Notes from time to
time outstanding at a per annum rate equal to the Fixed
Rate, plus three percent (3%).

3.12 Prime-based Advance in Absence of Election or Upon
Default. If, as to any outstanding Eurocurrency-based Advance,
Agent has not received payment on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, or does not receive a timely Request for
Term Loan Advance and Rate Request meeting the requirements of
Section 3.9 with respect to the refunding or conversion of such
Advance, or if on such day a Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the principal amount thereof which is
not then prepaid in the case of a Eurocurrency-based Advance shall
be converted automatically to a Prime-based Advance and the Agent
shall thereafter promptly notify Company of said action.

3.13 Prepayment. (a) Company may prepay all or part of the
outstanding balance of any Prime-based Advance(s) under its Term
Notes at any time (subject to not less than one (1) Business Day's
notice to Agent), provided that the amount of any partial
prepayment by such party shall be at least One Million Dollars
($1,000,000) and the aggregate balance of Prime-based Advance(s)
remaining outstanding on such Notes shall be at least Five Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($500,000). Company may prepay all or part of any
Eurocurrency-based Advance (subject to not less than three (3)
Business Days' notice to Agent) only on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, provided that the amount of any
such partial prepayment by such party shall be at least One Million
Dollars ($1,000,000), and the unpaid portion of such Advance which
is refunded or converted by such party under Section 3.9 hereof
shall be at least Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000). Furthermore,
no such prepayment may be made using funds advanced, directly or
indirectly, by the Banks under this Agreement or the DM Loan
Agreement. Upon Agent's request in connection with any prepayment,
Company shall provide evidence satisfactory to the Majority Banks
that the source of funding for such prepayment consists of new
equity, surplus cash (not the result of any Advance under this
Agreement) or otherwise was not derived, directly or indirectly,
from any Advance hereunder. Any prepayment made in accordance with
this Section shall be applied against principal installments due
hereunder in the inverse order of their maturity, and shall be
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 65 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

without premium or penalty (subject to Section 10 hereof), but
there shall be no readvance or reborrowing of any principal
reductions of the Term Loan (whether or not such principal
reductions constitute prepayments).

(b) Once the Fixed Rate becomes the applicable Interest
Rate for the Term Loan hereunder, at its option and upon not less
than five (5) business days prior written notice to Agent, Company
may prepay the principal balance outstanding under the Term Loan in
whole or in part (in amounts of not less than Five Million Dollars
($5,000,000) only upon payment to the Agent, for distribution to
the Banks pro rata, of a Yield Maintenance Payment in an amount
calculated by Agent to make the Banks whole (to the extent of the
interest which would have been earned by the Banks but for the
occurrence of such prepayment) on the basis of the discounted net
present values of the interest payments that would otherwise be
payable on the principal amount of the Term Loan being prepaid,
after taking into account the amount of interest which would be
payable on each interest payment due date if the principal amount
being repaid were reinvested at the Current Market Rate (defined
below).

As used herein, "Current Market Rate" shall mean a per annum
interest rate equal to one-half percentage point (.5%) above the
rate reasonably determined by Agent (based on quotations from
established dealers) to be in effect two (2) days prior to the
repayment date in the secondary market for United States Treasury
Securities of a comparable amount and with a comparable term to
maturity as the principal amount being prepaid hereunder. For
purposes of computation, the discount rate for each computation
will be the Current Market Rate for the relevant principal
installment.

Upon any involuntary prepayment of the Term Loan hereunder, whether
by acceleration, or otherwise, the Company shall pay to Agent, for
distribution to the Banks pro rata, a Yield Maintenance Payment in
an amount equal to the Yield Maintenance Payment which would have
been due and payable hereunder if the Company had voluntarily
elected to prepay the Term Loan (in an amount equal to such
involuntary prepayment) on such date of involuntary prepayment. Any
partial prepayments hereunder shall be applied to payments due
under the Term Loan in the inverse order of their maturities.

3.14 Purpose. The Term Notes to be issued by Company
hereunder shall constitute renewal and replacement evidence of all
present Indebtedness of the Company for the Term Loan under the
Prior Loan Agreement.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 66 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

4. MARGIN ADJUSTMENTS; HLT DETERMINATION; SPECIAL
LIMITATION

4.1 Margin Adjustments. Adjustments to the Applicable
Margin, based on Schedule 4.1, shall be implemented as follows:

(i) Such Margin adjustments shall be given
prospective effect only, effective (A) as to all Prime-based
Advances outstanding hereunder, immediately upon required date of
delivery of the financial statements required to be delivered under
Section 7.3(b) and 7.3(c) hereof establishing applicability of the
appropriate adjustments, if any, or on the obtaining and/or any
change in the Rating Level then in effect, as applicable and (B) as
to each Eurocurrency-based Advance outstanding hereunder, effective
upon the expiration of the applicable Interest Period(s), if any,
in effect on (x) the required date of delivery of the latest of
such financial statements required to be delivered hereunder during
such Interest Period(s) or (y) the date of the obtaining and/or any
change in the Rating Level in effect hereunder, as applicable, in
each case with no retroactivity or claw-back.

(ii) With respect to Eurocurrency-based Advances
outstanding hereunder, an adjustment hereunder, after becoming
effective, shall remain in effect only through the end of the
applicable Interest Period(s) for such Eurocurrency-based Advances
if any; provided, however, that upon the delivery of quarterly
financial statements demonstrating any change in the Leverage Ratio
or the obtaining and/or change in the Rating Level then in effect,
as aforesaid, or the occurrence of any other event which under the
terms hereof causes such adjustment no longer to be applicable,
then any such subsequent adjustment or no adjustment, as the case
may be, shall be effective (and said pricing shall thereby be
adjusted up or down, as applicable) with the commencement of each
Interest Period following such change or event, all in accordance
with the preceding subparagraph.

4.2 HLT Determination. In the event at any time (whether
before or after the funding of the Acquisition Loans) of an HLT
Determination, the Agent, the Banks and the Company shall commence
negotiations in good faith to agree upon whether and, if so, the
extent to which fees, interest rates and/or margins hereunder
should be increased so as to reflect such HLT Determination and to
compensate the Banks and Agent for additional costs, expenses
and/or fees which result from or are associated with any such HLT
Determination, including without limitation any costs resulting
from any requirement that additional capital be allocated to the
Indebtedness, or any portion thereof. If Company and the Majority
Banks agree that fees, interest rates and/or margins should be
increased, and agree on the amount of such increase or increases,
this Agreement may be amended to give effect to such increase or
increases as provided in Section 13.11 hereof. If Company and
Majority Banks fail to agree on whether and, if so, the extent to
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 67 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

which fees, interest rates and/or margins hereunder should be
increased within 60 days after notice to Company of an HLT
Determination as herein provided, then (i) the Agent shall, if
requested by the Majority Banks, by written notice to the Company
terminate the commitments of the Banks to fund and/or maintain
Advances of the Revolving Credit and the DM Revolving Credit, and
if still outstanding, any commitment to fund Advances of the
Acquisition Loans, and such commitments shall thereupon terminate,
(ii) Company shall be obligated to repay all outstanding
Indebtedness at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto
and (iii) the Company may, at its option, on at least ten Business
Days' written notice to the Agent (which shall promptly notify the
Banks thereof) prepay all Indebtedness outstanding hereunder and
under the other Loan Agreements by paying the aggregate principal
amount thereof, together, with all accrued interest thereon to the
date of prepayment; provided that, if the Company prepays any Fixed
Rate Advance or Advances carried at the Eurocurrency-based Rate,
the Absolute Rate, or any comparable rate, pursuant to this Section
4.2, Company shall compensate the Banks for any resulting funding
losses as provided in Section 11.1 hereof. Subject to compliance
by Company and the Permitted Borrowers with this Section 4.2, the
Banks acknowledge that an HLT Determination shall not constitute a
Default or an Event of Default hereunder.

4.3 Special Limitation. In the event, as a result of
increases in the value of any of the Alternative Currencies against
the Dollar or for any other reason, the obligation of any of the
Banks to advance additional funds hereunder and under the other
Loan Agreements (taking into account the Dollar Amount of the
Indebtedness outstanding from time to time under the other Loan
Agreements, and any other Indebtedness required to be aggregated
under 12 USCA 84, as amended, the regulations promulgated
thereunder, or other, similar applicable law) is determined by such
Bank to exceed its then applicable legal lending limit under 12
USCA 84, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or
other, similar applicable laws, the amount of additional funds
which such Bank shall be obligated to advance hereunder and under
the other Loan Agreements shall immediately be reduced to the
maximum amount which such Bank may legally advance (as determined
by such Bank), the obligation of each of the remaining Banks
hereunder shall be proportionately reduced, based on the applicable
Percentages, and, to the extent necessary under such laws and
regulations (as determined by each of the Banks, with respect to
the applicability of such laws and regulations to itself), the
Company shall reduce, or cause to be reduced, complying to the
extent practicable with the remaining provisions hereof, the
Indebtedness outstanding hereunder or under the other Loan
Agreements by an amount sufficient to comply with such maximum
amounts. Upon any such reduction in the obligations of the Banks
under this Section 4.3, Company shall have the right, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement (but subsequent to
Company's compliance with its obligation to reduce the Indebtedness
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 68 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

outstanding hereunder), to add to the Banks providing financing
hereunder a bank reasonably acceptable to the Agent for the purpose
of restoring the shortfall created by the reduction in such
obligations of the Banks.

5. CONDITIONS. The obligations of Banks to make Advances
or loans pursuant to this Agreement are subject to the following
conditions, provided however that Section 5.1 through 5.11 below
shall only apply to the initial Advances or loans hereunder:

5.1 Execution of Notes, this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. The Company and each of the Permitted Borrowers, as
applicable, shall have executed and delivered to the Agent for the
account of each Bank, the Revolving Credit Notes, the Bid Notes and

schedules, exhibits, certificates, opinions, financial statements
and other documents to be delivered pursuant hereto) and the other
Loan Documents, and, as applicable, such Revolving Credit Notes,
Bid Notes, Term Notes, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
shall be in full force and effect.

5.2 Corporate Authority. Agent shall have received, with a
counterpart thereof for each Bank: (i) certified copies of

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 74 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

hereto and except for miscellaneous suits, actions and proceedings
which have a reasonable likelihood of being adversely determined,

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 75 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

party, the Stock Purchase Agreement, or any other documents or

authorizations, consents, approvals, licenses, qualifications,
exemptions, filings, declarations and registrations which have

other corporate restriction which materially adversely affects the
financial condition or operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

6.17 No Investment Company; No Margin Stock. Neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is engaged principally, or as

business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or

will be used by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries to purchase
or carry margin stock or will be made available by the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries in any manner to any other Person to enable
or assist such Person in, purchasing or carrying margin stock.
Terms for which meanings are provided in Regulation U of the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System or any regulations
substituted therefor, as from time to time in effect, are used in
this paragraph with such meanings. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is an "investment company" within the meaning of
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

6.18 ERISA. Neither a reportable event within the meaning of
Section 4043 of ERISA and the regulations thereunder which is
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole
(herein, a "Reportable Event") nor an Accumulated Funding
Deficiency (herein as defined in Section 412 of the Code or Section
302 of ERISA) has occurred during the five-year period prior to the
date on which this representation is made or deemed made with
respect to any Pension Plan. Each Pension Plan has complied in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the
Code and any applicable regulations thereof (and, if applicable,
any comparable foreign law provisions), except to the extent that
any noncompliance, individually or in the aggregate, would not have
a material adverse effect upon the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole. No termination of a Single Employer Plan has
occurred, and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Pension Plan has
arisen, during such five-year period. The present value of all
accrued benefits under each Single Employer Plan maintained by the
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 76 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

Company or any ERISA Affiliate did not, as of the last annual
valuation date prior to the date on which this representation is
made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets of such Pension
Plan allocable to such accrued benefits. Neither the Company nor
any ERISA Affiliate has had a complete or partial withdrawal from
any Multiemployer Plan within the five year period prior to the
date of this Agreement, nor does the Company or any ERISA Affiliate
presently intend to completely or partially withdraw from any
Multiemployer Plan, and neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate
would become subject to fines, penalties or any other liability
under ERISA if the Company or any ERISA Affiliate were to withdraw
completely from all Multiemployer Plans as of the valuation date
most closely preceding the date of this Agreement. To the best of
Company's knowledge, no such Multiemployer Plan is in bankruptcy or
reorganization or insolvent. There is no pending or, to the best
of Company's knowledge, threatened litigation or investigation
questioning the form or operation of any Pension Plan, nor is there
any basis for any such litigation or investigation which if
adversely determined could have a material adverse effect upon the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as of the valuation
date most closely preceding the date of this Agreement.

6.19 Environmental Matters and Safety Matters. (a) The
Company and each Subsidiary (excluding foreign subsidiaries of the
Target Company until the Revalidation Date) is in compliance with
all federal, state, provincial and local laws, ordinances and
regulations relating to safety and industrial hygiene or to the
environmental condition, including without limitation all
applicable Hazardous Materials Laws in jurisdictions in which the
Company or any such Subsidiary owns or operates, a facility or
site, or arranges for disposal or treatment of hazardous
substances, solid waste, or other wastes, accepts for transport any
hazardous substances, solid wastes or other wastes or holds any
interest in real property or otherwise, except for matters which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse
effect upon the financial condition or business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(b) All federal, state, provincial, local and
foreign permits, licenses and authorizations required for present
or (to the best of the Company's knowledge) past use of the
facilities and other properties or activities of the Company and
each Subsidiary (excluding foreign subsidiaries of the Target
Company until the Revalidation Date) have been obtained, are
presently in effect, and there is and has been full compliance with
all such permits, licenses or authorizations, except, in all cases,
where the failure to comply with the foregoing would not have a
material adverse effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole.

(c) No demand, claim, notice, suit (in law or
equity), action, administrative action, investigation or inquiry
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 77 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

(including, without limitation, the listing of any property by any
domestic or foreign governmental entity which identifies sites for
remedial, clean-up or investigatory action) whether brought by any
governmental authority, private person or entity or otherwise,
arising under, relating to or in connection with any applicable
Hazardous Materials Laws is pending or, to the best of the
Company's knowledge, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (excluding foreign subsidiaries of the Target Company
until the Revalidation Date), any real property in which the
Company or any such Subsidiary holds or, to the best of the
Company's knowledge, has held an interest or any present or, to the
best of the Company's knowledge, past operation of the Company or
any such Subsidiary, except for such matters which, individually or
in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse effect on the
financial condition or business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
(excluding foreign subsidiaries of the Target Company until the
Revalidation Date), whether with respect to present or, to the best
of the Company's knowledge, past operations or properties, (i) is,
to the best of the Company's knowledge, the subject of any federal
or state investigation evaluating whether any remedial action is
needed to respond to a release of any toxic substances, radioactive
materials, hazardous wastes or related materials into the
environment, (ii) has received any notice of any toxic substances,
radioactive materials, hazardous waste or related materials in, or
upon any of its properties in violation of any applicable Hazardous
Materials Laws, or (iii) knows of any basis for any such
investigation or notice, or for the existence of such a violation,
except for such matters which, individually or in the aggregate,
would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition
or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(e) No release, threatened release or disposal of
hazardous waste, solid waste or other wastes is occurring or has
occurred on, under or to any real property in which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (excluding foreign subsidiaries of the
Target Company until the Revalidation Date) holds any interest or
performs any of its operations, in violation of any applicable
Hazardous Materials Laws, except for any such matters which,
individually or in the aggregate, would not have a material adverse
effect on the financial condition or business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

6.20 Conditions Affecting Business or Properties. Neither
the respective businesses nor the properties of Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (excluding the foreign Subsidiaries of the Target
Company until the Revalidation Date) is affected by any fire,
explosion, accident, strike, lockout or other dispute, drought,
storm, hail, earthquake, embargo, Act of God or other casualty
(whether or not covered by insurance), which materially adversely
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 78 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

affects, or if such event or condition were to continue for more
than ten (10) additional days could be likely to materially
adversely affect, any such business or property of Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

6.21 Accuracy of Information. Each of the Company's audited
or unaudited financial statements previously furnished to Agents
and the Banks by the Company prior to the date of this Agreement,
is complete and correct in all material respects and fairly
presents the financial condition of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and the results of their operations
for the periods covered thereby; any projections of operations for
future years previously furnished by Company to Agents or the Banks
have been prepared as the Company's good faith estimate of such
future operations, taking into account all relevant facts and
matters known to Company; since December 31, 1993 there has been no
material adverse change in the financial condition of the Company
or its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; neither the Company, nor any
of its Subsidiaries (excluding the Foreign Subsidiaries of the
Target Company until the Revalidation Date) has any contingent
obligations (including any liability for taxes) not disclosed by or
reserved against in the December 31, 1993 balance sheet which is
likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

<PAGE> 95 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

including the Notes, immediately due and payable, without
presentment, notice or demand, all of which are hereby expressly
waived by Company and the Permitted Borrowers; (y) upon the
occurrence of any Event of Default specified in subsection 9.1 (j),
above, and notwithstanding the lack of any declaration by Agent
under preceding clauses (w) or (x), the entire unpaid principal
Indebtedness, including the Notes, shall become automatically due
and payable; and (z) the Agent shall, if directed to do so by the
Majority Banks or the Banks, as applicable (subject to the terms
hereof), exercise any remedy permitted by this Agreement, the Loan
Documents or law.

9.3 Rights Cumulative. No delay or failure of Agent and/or
Banks in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
affect such right, power or privilege, nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any further exercise thereof, or
the exercise of any other power, right or privilege. The rights of
Banks under this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any
right or remedies which Banks would otherwise have.

9.4 Waiver by Company of Certain Laws. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, Company and each of the Permitted
Borrowers hereby agree to waive, and do hereby absolutely and
irrevocably waive and relinquish the benefit and advantage of any

provision, might be applicable to any sale made under the judgment,
order or decree of any court, on any claim for interest on the
Notes, and further hereby irrevocably agrees to waive the right to
trial by jury with respect to any and all actions or proceedings in
which Agent or the Banks (or any of them), on one hand, and the
Company or any of the Permitted Borrowers, on the other hand, are
parties, whether or not such actions or proceedings arise out of

consequences thereof.

by the Banks except in a writing signed by an officer of the Agent
in accordance with Section 13.11 hereof. No single or partial
exercise' of any right, power or privilege hereunder, nor any delay
in the exercise thereof, shall preclude other or further exercise
of the Banks' rights by Agent. No waiver of any Default or Event of
Default shall extend to any other or further Default or Event of
Default. No forbearance on the part of the Agent or any Bank in
enforcing any of the Banks' rights shall constitute a waiver of any
of their rights. Company and each of the Permitted Borrowers
expressly agrees that this Section may not be waived or modified by
the Banks or Agent by course of performance, estoppel or otherwise.

9.6 Cross-Default. In addition to the other Events of

obligations, covenants and agreements required to be performed

extension of, or related to this Agreement or any of the Loan
Documents shall be an Event of Default under the provisions of this
Agreement entitling Agent, with the consent of the Majority Banks,
(without notice or any cure period except as expressly provided
herein or therein) to exercise any and all rights and remedies
provided hereby. Any Event of Default under this Agreement or under
any of the Loan Documents shall also constitute a default under all
other instruments securing this or any other present or future
borrowings, or any agreements in relation thereto, entitling Agent
and the Banks to exercise any and all rights and remedies provided
therein.

10. PAYMENTS, RECOVERIES AND COLLECTIONS.

10.1 Payment Procedure.

(a) All payments by Company and/or by any of the
Permitted Borrowers of principal of, or interest on, the
Revolving Credit Notes, the Term Notes or of any Fees, shall
be made without setoff or counterclaim on the date specified
for payment under this Agreement not later than 11:00 a.m.
(Detroit time) in Dollars in immediately available funds to
Agent, for the ratable account of the Banks, at Agent's office
located at One Detroit Center, Detroit, Michigan 48226, in
respect of Domestic Advances. Payments made in respect of any
Advance in any Alternative Currency shall be made in such
Alternative Currency in immediately available funds for the
account of Agent's Eurocurrency Lending Office, at the Agent's
Correspondent, for the ratable account of the Banks, not later
than 11:00 a.m. (the time of Agent's Correspondent). Upon
receipt of each such payment, the Agent shall make prompt
payment to each Bank, or, in respect of Eurocurrency-based
Advances, such Bank's Eurocurrency Lending Office, in like
funds and currencies, of all amounts received by it for the
account of such Bank.

(b) Unless the Agent shall have been notified by
the Company prior to the date on which any payment to be made
by the Company or the applicable Permitted Borrower is due
that the Company or the applicable Permitted Borrower does not
intend to remit such payment, the Agent may, in its
discretion, assume that the Company has remitted such payment
when so due and the Agent may, in reliance upon such
assumption, make available to each Bank on such payment date
an amount equal to such Bank's share of such assumed payment.
If the Company or the applicable Permitted Borrower has not in
fact remitted such payment to the Agent, each Bank shall
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 97 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

forthwith on demand repay to the Agent in the applicable
currency the amount of such assumed payment made available to
such Bank, together with the interest thereon, in respect of
each day from and including the date such amount was made
available by the Agent to such Bank to the date such amount is
repaid to the Agent at a rate per annum equal to (i) for
Domestic Advances, the Federal Funds Effective Rate (daily
average), as the same may vary from time to time, and (ii)
with respect to Eurocurrency-based Advances, Agent's aggregate
marginal cost (including the cost of maintaining any required
reserves or deposit insurance and of any fees, penalties,
overdraft charges or other costs or expenses incurred by
Agent) of carrying such amount.

(c) Whenever any payment to be made hereunder
(other than payments in respect of any Eurocurrency-based
Advance) shall otherwise be due on a day which is not a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next
succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be
included in computing interest, if any, in connection with
such payment. Whenever any payment of principal of, or
interest on, a Eurocurrency-based Advance shall be due on a
day which is not a Business Day the date of payment thereof
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless
as a result thereof it would fall in the next calendar month,
in which case it shall be shortened to the next preceding
Business Day and, in the case of a payment of principal,
interest thereon shall be payable for such extended or
shortened time, if any.

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement
or the other Loan Documents (and subject to the terms and
conditions thereof), all payments by the Company of principal
of, or interest on, the Bid Notes shall be made to the
applicable Bank in Dollars without setoff or counterclaim on
the dates and other terms provided in such Notes.

(e) All payments to be made by the Company or any
of the Permitted Borrowers under this Agreement or any of the
Notes (including without limitation payments under the Bid
Notes) shall be made without set-off or counterclaim, as
aforesaid, and without deduction for or on account of any
present or future withholding or other taxes of any nature
imposed by any governmental authority or of any political
subdivision thereof or any federation or organization of which
such governmental authority may at the time of payment be a
member, unless Company or any of the Permitted Borrowers, as
the case may be, is compelled by law to make payment subject
to such tax. In such event, Company and the applicable
Permitted Borrowers shall:
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 98 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

(i) pay to the Agent, or cause the applicable
Permitted Borrowers to pay to Agent, for
Agent's own account and/or, as the case may
be, for the account of the Banks (and, in the
case of Bid Advances, pay to the applicable
Bid Lender which funded such Advances) such
additional amounts as may be necessary to
ensure that the Agent and/or such Bank or
Banks receive a net amount in the applicable
Permitted Currency equal to the full amount
which would have been receivable had payment
not been made subject to such tax; and

(ii) remit such tax to the relevant taxing
authorities according to applicable law, and
send to the Agent or the applicable Bid
Lender, as the case may be, such certificates
or certified copy receipts as the Agent or
such Bid Lender shall reasonably require as
proof of the payment by the Company or the
applicable Permitted Borrower, of any such
taxes payable by the Company or any Permitted
Borrower.

As used herein, the terms "tax", "taxes" and "taxation"
include all existing taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees,
deductions and withholdings and any restrictions or conditions
resulting in a charge together with interest thereon and fines and
penalties with respect thereto which may be imposed by reason of
any violation or default with respect to the law regarding such
tax, assessed as a result of or in connection with the transactions
in any Alternative Currency hereunder, or the payment and or
receipt of funds in any Alternative Currency hereunder, or the
payment or delivery of funds into or out of any jurisdiction other
than the United States (whether assessed against Company, any of
the Permitted Borrowers, Agent or any of the Banks).

10.2 Application of Proceeds. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, any offsets or voluntary
payments by the Company, any of the Permitted Borrowers or others
and any other sums received or collected in respect of the
Indebtedness, shall be applied, first, to the Notes pro rata, based
on the aggregate Indebtedness then outstanding thereunder (or in
such other order and manner as determined by all of the Banks,
next, to any other Indebtedness on a pro rata basis (as aforesaid),
and then, if there is any excess, to the Company or the applicable
Permitted Borrower, as the case may be.

10.3 Pro-rata Recovery. If any Bank shall obtain any payment
or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application
of offset or otherwise) on account of principal of, or interest on,
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 99 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

any of the Revolving Credit Notes or Term Notes in excess of its
pro rata share of payments then or thereafter obtained by all Banks
upon principal of and interest on all such Revolving Credit Notes
or Term Notes, such Bank shall purchase from the other Banks such
participations in the Revolving Credit Notes and Term Notes held by
them as shall be necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to share
the excess payment or other recovery ratably in accordance with the
Percentage held by each of them in such Notes; provided, however,
that if all or any portion of the excess payment or other recovery
is thereafter recovered from such purchasing holder, the purchase
shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of
such recovery, but without interest.

10.4 Deposits and Accounts. In addition to and not in
limitation of any rights of any Bank or other holder of any of the
Notes under applicable law, each Bank and each other such holder
shall, upon acceleration of the Indebtedness under the Notes and
without notice or demand of any kind, have the right to appropriate
and apply to the payment of the Notes owing to it (whether or not
then due) any and all balances, credits, deposits, accounts or
moneys of Company or any of the Permitted Borrowers then or
thereafter with such Bank or other holder; provided, however, that
any such amount so applied by any Bank or other holder on any of
the Notes owing to it shall be subject to the provisions of Section
10.3, hereof.

11. CHANGES IN LAW OR CIRCUMSTANCES; INCREASED COSTS.

11.1 Reimbursement of Prepayment Costs. As to any Absolute
Rate Advance or Eurocurrency-based Advance, if any prepayment
thereof shall occur, whether by Company or any of the Permitted
Borrowers, on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period
(whether pursuant to this Agreement or by acceleration, or
otherwise), or if the rate applicable to such Advance shall be
changed during any Interest Period pursuant to this Agreement,
Company and the applicable Permitted Borrower shall reimburse each
of the Banks on demand for any costs incurred by such Banks as a
result of the timing thereof, including but not limited to any net
costs incurred in liquidating or employing deposits from third
parties. Each Bank demanding reimbursement under this Section 11.1
shall deliver to Company a certificate setting forth the basis for
determining such costs, which certificate shall be conclusively
presumed correct save for manifest error.

11.2 Eurocurrency Lending Office. For any Advance to which
the Eurocurrency-based Rate is applicable, if Agent or a Bank, as
applicable, shall designate a Eurocurrency Lending Office which
maintains books separate from those of the rest of Agent, Agent or
such Bank, as the case may be, shall have the option of maintaining
and carrying the relevant Advance on the books of such Eurocurrency
Lending Office.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 100 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

11.3 Availability of Alternative Currency. The Agent and the
Banks shall not be required to make any Advance requested to be
made in an Alternative Currency if, at any time prior to making
such Advance, the Agent or the Banks (after consultation with
Agent) shall determine, in its sole discretion, that (i) deposits
in the applicable Alternative Currency in the amounts and
maturities required to fund such Advance will not be available to
the Agent and the Banks; (ii) a fundamental change has occurred in
the foreign exchange or interbank markets with respect to the
applicable Alternative Currency (including, without limitation,
changes in national or international financial, political or
economic conditions or currency exchange rates or exchange
controls); or (iii) it has become otherwise materially impractical
for the Agent or the Banks, as applicable, to make such Advance in
the applicable Alternative Currency. The Agent or the applicable
Bank, as the case may be, shall promptly notify the Company and
Banks of any such determination.

11.4 Refunding Advances in Same Currency. If pursuant to any
provisions of this Agreement, the Company or any of the Permitted
Borrowers repays one or more Advances and on the same day borrows
an amount in the same currency, the Agent (or the applicable Bank,
in the case of a Bid Advance) shall apply the proceeds of such new
borrowing to repay the principal of the Advance or Advances being
repaid and only an amount equal to the difference (if any) between
the amount being borrowed and the amount being repaid shall be
remitted by the Agent to the Company or the Permitted Borrowers, or
by the Company or the Permitted Borrowers to the Agent, as the case
may be.

11.5 Circumstances Affecting Eurocurrency-based Rate
Availability. If with respect to any Interest Period Agent or the
Banks (after consultation with Agent) shall determine that, by
reason of circumstances affecting the foreign exchange and
interbank markets generally, deposits in Eurodollars or in any
applicable Alternative Currency, as the case may be, in the
applicable amounts are not being offered to the Agent for such
Interest Period, then Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to
the Company. Thereafter, until Agent notifies Company and the
Permitted Borrowers that such circumstances no longer exist, (i)
the obligation of Banks to make Eurocurrency-based Advances, as the
case may be (other than in any applicable Alternative Currency with
respect to which deposits are available, as required hereunder),
and the right of Company to convert an Advance to or refund an
Advance as a Eurocurrency-based Advance, as the case may be (other
than in any applicable Alternative Currency with respect to which
deposits are available, as required hereunder), shall be suspended,
and (ii) the Company shall repay in full (or cause to be repaid in
full) the then outstanding principal amount of each such
Eurocurrency-based Advance covered hereby in the applicable
Alternative Currency, together with accrued interest thereon, any
amounts payable under Section 11.8, hereof, and all other amounts
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 101 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

payable hereunder on the last day of the then current Interest
Period applicable to such Advance. Upon the date for repayment as
aforesaid and unless Company notifies Agent to the contrary within
two (2) Business Days after receiving a notice from Agent pursuant
to this Section, such outstanding principal amount shall be
converted to a Prime-based Advance as of the last day of such
Interest Period.

11.6 Laws Affecting Eurocurrency-based Advance Availability.
If, after the date hereof, the introduction of, or any change in,
any applicable law, rule or regulation or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority charged with
the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any
of the Banks (or any of their respective Eurocurrency Lending
Offices) with any request or directive (whether or not having the
force of law) of any such authority, shall make it unlawful or
impossible for any of the Banks (or any of their respective
Eurocurrency Lending Offices) to honor its obligations hereunder to
make or maintain any Advance with interest at the Eurocurrency-
based Rate, or in an Alternative Currency, such Bank shall
forthwith give notice thereof to Company and to Agent. Thereafter,
(a) the obligations of Banks to make Eurocurrency-based Advances or
Advances in any such Alternative Currency and the right of Company
to convert an Advance or refund an Advance as a Eurocurrency-based
Advance or as an Advance in any such Alternative Currency shall be
suspended and thereafter Company may select as Applicable Interest
Rates or as Alternative Currencies only those which remain
available and which are permitted to be selected hereunder, and (b)
if any of the Banks may not lawfully continue to maintain an
Advance to the end of the then current Interest Period applicable
thereto as a Eurocurrency-based Advance or in such Alternative
Currency, the applicable Advance shall immediately be converted to
a Prime-based Advance (in the Dollar Amount thereof) and the Prime-
based Rate shall be applicable thereto for the remainder of such
Interest Period. For purposes of this Section, a change in law,
rule, regulation, interpretation or administration shall include,
without limitation, any change made or which becomes effective on
the basis of a law, rule, regulation, interpretation or
administration presently in force, the effective date of which
change is delayed by the terms of such law, rule, regulation,
interpretation or administration.

11.7 Increased Cost of Eurocurrency-based Advances. If the
adoption after the date hereof, or any change after the date hereof
in, any applicable law, rule or regulation of any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by Agent or
any of the Banks (or any of their respective Eurocurrency Lending
Offices) with any request or directive (whether or not having the
force of law) made by any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency after the date hereof:
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 102 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

(a) shall subject any of the Banks (or any of their
respective Eurocurrency Lending Offices) to any tax, duty or
other charge with respect to any Advance or any Note or shall
change the basis of taxation of payments to any of the Banks
(or any of their respective Eurocurrency Lending Offices) of
the principal of or interest on any Advance or any Note or any
other amounts due under this Agreement in respect thereof
(except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net
income of any of the Banks or any of their respective
Eurocurrency Lending Offices imposed by the jurisdiction in
which such Bank's principal executive office or Eurocurrency
Lending Office is located); or

(b) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any
reserve (including, without limitation, any imposed by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), special
deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits
with or for the account of, or credit extended by any of the
Banks (or any of their respective Eurocurrency Lending
Offices) or shall impose on any of the Banks (or any of their
respective Eurocurrency Lending Offices) or the foreign
exchange and interbank markets any other condition affecting
any Advance or any of the Notes;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the costs to
any of the Banks of maintaining any part of the Indebtedness
hereunder as a Eurocurrency-based Advance or as an Advance in any
Alternative Currency or to reduce the amount of any sum received or
receivable by any of the Banks under this Agreement or under the
Notes in respect of a Eurocurrency-based Advance or any Advance in
an Alternative Currency, whether with respect to Advances to
Company or to any of the Permitted Borrowers, then such Bank shall
promptly notify Agent (or, in the case of a Bid Advance, shall
notify Company directly, with a copy of such notice to Agent), and
Agent (or such Bank, as aforesaid) shall promptly notify Company of
such fact and demand compensation therefor and, within fifteen (15)
days after such notice, Company agrees to pay to such Bank such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank or Banks
for such increased cost or reduction. Agent will promptly notify
Company of any event of which it has knowledge which will entitle
Banks to compensation pursuant to this Section, or which will cause
Company to incur additional liability under Section 10.1(e) hereof,
provided that Agent shall incur no liability whatsoever to the
Banks or Company in the event it fails to do so. A certificate of
Agent (or such Bank, if applicable) setting forth the basis for
determining such additional amount or amounts necessary to
compensate such Bank or Banks shall be conclusively presumed to be
correct save for manifest error. For purposes of this Section, a
change in law, rule, regulation, interpretation, administration,
request or directive shall include, without limitation, any change
made or which becomes effective on the basis of a law, rule,
regulation, interpretation, administration, request or directive
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 103 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

presently in force, the effective date of which change is delayed
by the terms of such law, rule, regulation, interpretation,
administration, request or directive.

11.8 Indemnity. The Company will indemnify Agent and each of
the Banks against any loss or expense which may arise or be
attributable to the Agent's and each Bank's obtaining, liquidating
or employing deposits or other funds acquired to effect, fund or
maintain the Advances (a) as a consequence of any failure by the
Company or any of the Permitted Borrowers to make any payment when
due of any amount due hereunder in connection with an Absolute Rate
Advance or a Eurocurrency-based Advance, (b) due to any failure of
the Company or any of the Permitted Borrowers to borrow on a date
specified therefor in a Request for Advance or Bid Acknowledgment
(c) due to any payment or prepayment of any Absolute Rate Bid
Advance or Eurocurrency-based Advance on a date other than the last
day of the Interest Period for such Advance. Such loss or expense
shall be calculated based upon the present value, as applicable, of
payments due from the Company or any of the Permitted Borrowers
with respect to a deposit obtained by the Agent or any of the Banks
in order to fund such Advance to the Company or to any of the
Permitted Borrowers. The Agent's and each Bank's, as applicable,
calculations of any such loss or expense shall be furnished to the
Company and shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

11.9 Judgment Currency. The obligation of the Company and of
the Permitted Borrowers to make payments of the principal of and
interest on the Notes and any other amounts payable hereunder in
the currency specified for such payment herein or in the Notes
shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender, or any recovery
pursuant to any judgment, which is expressed in or converted into
any other currency, except to the extent that such tender or
recovery shall result in the actual receipt by each of the Banks of
the full amount of the particular Permitted Currency expressed to
be payable herein or in the Notes. The Agent (or the applicable
Bank, in the case of a Bid Advance) shall, using all amounts
obtained or received from the Company and from Permitted Borrowers
pursuant to any such tender or recovery in payment of principal of
and interest on the Notes, promptly purchase the applicable
Permitted Currency at the most favorable spot exchange rate
determined by the Agent to be available to it. The obligation of
the Company and of the Permitted Borrowers to make payments in the
applicable Permitted Currency shall be enforceable as an
alternative or additional cause of action solely for the purpose of
recovering in the applicable Permitted Currency the amount, if any,
by which such actual receipt shall fall short of the full amount of
the Permitted Currency expressed to be payable herein or in the
Notes.

11.10 Other Increased Costs. In the event that at any time
after the date of this Agreement any change in law such as
described in Section 11.7 hereof, shall, in the opinion of the
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 104 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

Agent or any of the Banks (as certified to Agent in writing by such
Bank) require that the Revolving Credit or any other Indebtedness
or commitment under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Agreements be treated as an asset or otherwise be included for
purposes of calculating the appropriate amount of capital to be
maintained by each of the Banks or any corporation controlling such
Banks, as the case may be, the Agent shall notify the Company. The
Company and the Agent shall thereafter negotiate in good faith an
agreement to increase the Revolving Credit Commitment Fee or other
fees payable to the Agent, for the benefit of the Banks under this
Agreement, which in the opinion of the Agent, will adequately
compensate the Banks for the costs associated with such change in
law. If such increase is approved in writing by the Company within
thirty (30) days from the date of the notice to the Company from
the Agent, the Revolving Credit Commitment Fee or other fees (if
applicable) payable by the Company under this Agreement shall,
effective from the date of such agreement, include the amount of
such agreed increase. If the Company and the Agent are unable to
agree on such an increase within thirty (30) days from the date of
the notice to the Company, the Company shall have the option,
exercised by written notice to the Agent within forty-five (45)
days from the date of the aforesaid notice to the Company from the
Agent, to terminate the Revolving Credit or other commitments if
applicable, in which event, all sums then outstanding to Banks and
to Agent hereunder shall be due and payable in full. If (a) the
Company and the Agent fail to agree on an increase in the Revolving
Credit Commitment Fee or other fees (if applicable), or (b) the
Company fails to give timely notice that it has elected to exercise
its option to terminate the Revolving Credit or other commitments,
if applicable, as set forth above, then the Revolving Credit and
such other commitments shall automatically terminate as of the last
day of the aforesaid forty-five (45) day period, in which event all
sums then outstanding to Banks and to Agent hereunder shall be due
and payable in full.

12. AGENT

12.1 Appointment of Agent. Each Bank and the holder of each
Note appoints and authorizes Agent to act on behalf of such Bank or
holder under the Loan Documents and to exercise such powers
hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to or
required of Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with
such powers as may be reasonably incidental thereto. Each Bank
agrees (which agreement shall survive any termination of this
Agreement) to reimburse Agent for all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses (including in-house and outside attorneys' fees) incurred
by Agent hereunder or in connection herewith or with any Default or
Event of Default or in enforcing the obligations of Company or the
Permitted Borrowers under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents or any other instrument executed pursuant hereto, and for
which Agent is not reimbursed by Company, pro rata according to
such Bank's Percentage. Agent shall not be required to take any
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 105 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

action under the Loan Documents, or to prosecute or defend any suit
in respect of the Loan Documents, unless indemnified to its
satisfaction by the Banks against loss, costs, liability and
expense. If any indemnity furnished to Agent shall become impaired,
it may call for additional indemnity and cease to do the acts
indemnified against until such additional indemnity is given.

12.2 Deposit Account with Agent. Each of Company and the
Permitted Borrowers hereby authorizes Agent to charge its general
deposit account, if any, maintained with Agent for the amount of
any principal, interest, or other amounts or costs due under this
Agreement when the same becomes due and payable under the terms of
this Agreement or the Revolving Credit Notes or the Term Notes, or
any Bid Notes payable to Agent.

12.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Agent agrees to exercise its
rights and powers, and to perform its duties, as Agent hereunder
and under the Loan Documents in accordance with its usual customs
and practices in bank-agency transactions, but only upon and
subject to the express terms and conditions of Section 12, hereof
(and no implied covenants or other obligations shall be read into
this Agreement against the Agent); neither Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable to any
Bank for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them
under this Agreement or any document executed pursuant hereto, or
in connection herewith or therewith, except for its or their own
willful misconduct or gross negligence, nor be responsible for any
recitals or warranties herein or therein made by any other Person,
nor for the effectiveness, enforceability, validity or due
execution (other than its own due execution and delivery) of this
Agreement or any document executed pursuant hereto, or any security
thereunder, nor to make any inquiry respecting the performance by
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of the Permitted Borrowers
of its obligations hereunder or thereunder. Nor shall Agent have,
or be deemed to have, a fiduciary relationship with any Bank by
reason of this Agreement. Agent shall be entitled to rely upon
advice of counsel concerning legal matters and upon any notice,
consent, certificate, statement or writing which it believes to be
genuine and to have been presented by a proper person.

12.4 Successor Agents. Agent may resign as such at any time
upon at least 30 days prior notice to Company and all Banks. If
Agent at any time shall resign or if the office of Agent shall
become vacant for any other reason, Majority Banks shall, by
written instrument, appoint a successor Agent (satisfactory to such
Majority Banks) which shall thereupon become Agent hereunder and
shall be entitled to receive from the prior Agent such documents of
transfer and assignment as such successor Agent may reasonably
request. Such successor Agent shall succeed to all of the rights
and obligations of the retiring Agent as if originally named. The
retiring or removed Agent shall duly assign, transfer and deliver
to such successor Agent all moneys at the time held by the retiring
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 106 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

or removed Agent hereunder after deducting therefrom its expenses
for which it is entitled to be reimbursed. Upon such succession of
any such successor Agent, the retiring agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations hereunder, except for its gross
negligence or willful misconduct arising prior to its retirement
hereunder, and the provisions of this Section 12 shall continue in
effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by it while it was acting as Agent.

12.5 Loans by Agent. Agent shall have the same rights and
powers with respect to the credit extended by it and the Notes held
by it as any Bank and may exercise the same as if it were not
Agent, and the term "Bank" and, when appropriate, "holder" shall
include Agent in its individual capacity.

12.6 Credit Decisions. Each Bank acknowledges that it has,
independently of Agent and each other Bank and based on the
financial statements of Company and its Subsidiaries and such other
documents, information and investigations as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit decision to extend credit
hereunder from time to time. Each Bank also acknowledges that it
will, independently of Agent and each other Bank and based on such
other documents, information and investigations as it shall deem
appropriate at any time, continue to make its own credit decisions
as to exercising or not exercising from time to time any rights and
privileges available to it under this Agreement or any document
executed pursuant hereto.

12.7 Notices by Agent. Agent shall give prompt notice to
each Bank of its receipt of each notice or request required or
permitted to be given to Agent by Company pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement and shall promptly distribute to the Banks any
reports received from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
Permitted Borrowers under the terms hereof, or other material
information or documents received by Agent, in its capacity as
Agent, from the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Permitted
Borrowers.

12.8 Agent's Fees. Commencing on September 30, 1994, and on
each succeeding anniversary date thereof until the Indebtedness has
been repaid and no commitment to fund any loan hereunder is
outstanding, the Company shall pay to Agent an annual agency fee
set forth (or to be set forth from time to time) in a letter
agreement between Company and Agent. The Agent's Fees described in
this Section 12.8 shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

12.9 Nature of Agency. The appointment of Agent as agent is
for the convenience of Banks, Company and the Permitted Borrowers
in making Advances of the Revolving Credit, the Term Loan or any
other Indebtedness of Company or the Permitted Borrowers hereunder,
and collecting fees and principal and interest on the Indebtedness.
No Bank is purchasing any Indebtedness from Agent and this
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 107 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

Agreement is not intended to be a purchase or participation
agreement.

12.10 Actions; Confirmation of Agent's Authority to Act in
Event of Default. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and to the direction of the Majority Banks, Agent is
hereby expressly authorized to act in all litigation and in all
other respects as the representative of the Banks where Agent
considers it to be necessary or desirable in order to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or the Loan Documents. Without
necessarily accepting service of process or designating Agent to do
so in its stead, each Bank hereby agrees with each other Bank and
with Agent, without intending to confer or conferring any rights on
any other party, (a) that it shall be bound by any litigation
brought by or against Agent by the Company, any Subsidiary or any
other party in connection with the Indebtedness or any other
rights, duties or obligations arising hereunder or under this
Agreement or the Loan Documents and (b) that it now irrevocably
waives the defense of procedural impediment or failure to name or
join such Bank as an indispensable party; provided however that
each Bank reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to
intervene or otherwise appear in such litigation, and to retain its
own counsel in connection therewith. In conducting such litigation
hereunder on behalf of the Banks, Agent shall, subject to the terms
hereof, accept the direction of the Majority Banks or all Banks, as
the case may be and shall at all times be indemnified by the Banks
as provided in Sections 12.1 and 12.12 hereof. Agent shall
undertake to give each Bank prompt notice of any litigation
commenced against Agent and/or the Banks with respect to this
Agreement, the Loan Agreement or the Loan Documents or any matter
referred to herein or therein.

12.11 Authority of Agent to Enforce Notes and This Agreement.
Each Bank, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
(including without limitation Sections 12.10, 12.14 and 12.15
hereof), authorizes the Agent with full power and authority as
attorney-in-fact to institute and maintain actions, suits or
proceedings for the collection and enforcement of the Notes and to
file such proofs of debt or other documents as may be necessary to
have the claims of the Banks allowed in any proceeding relative to
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any of the Permitted
Borrowers or its creditors or affecting its properties, and to take
such other actions which Agent considers to be necessary or
desirable for the protection, collection and enforcement of the
Notes, this Agreement or the other Loan Documents.

12.12 Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify the Agent
in its capacity as such, to the extent not reimbursed by the
Company, pro rata according to their respective Percentages, from
and against any and all claims, liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 108 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in any way relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents or any action taken or omitted to be taken or suffered in
good faith by the Agent hereunder, provided that no Bank shall be
liable for any portion of any of the foregoing items resulting from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or any of
its officers, employees, directors or agents.

12.13 Knowledge of Default. It is expressly understood and
agreed that the Agent shall be entitled to assume that no Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, unless the
officers of the Agent immediately responsible for matters
concerning this Agreement shall have actual (rather than
constructive) knowledge of such occurrence or shall have been
notified in writing by a Bank that such Bank considers that a
Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and
specifying the nature thereof. Upon obtaining actual knowledge of
any Default or Event of Default as described above, the Agent shall
promptly, but in any event within three (3) Business Days after
obtaining knowledge thereof, notify each Bank of such Default or
Event of Default and the action, if any, the Agent proposes be
taken with respect thereto.

12.14 Agent's Authorization; Action by Banks. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, whenever the Agent is
authorized and empowered hereunder on behalf of the Banks to give
any approval or consent, or to make any request, or to take any
other action on behalf of the Banks (including without limitation
the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under the other
Loan Documents), the Agent shall be required to give such approval
or consent, or to make such request or to take such other action
only when so requested in writing by the Majority Banks or the
Banks, as applicable hereunder. Action that may be taken by
Majority Banks or all of the Banks, as the case may be (as provided
for hereunder) may be taken (i) pursuant to a vote at a meeting
(which may be held by telephone conference call) as to which all of
the Banks have been given reasonable advance notice, or (ii)
pursuant to the written consent of the requisite Percentages of the
Banks as required hereunder, provided that all of the Banks are
given reasonable advance notice of the requests for such consent.

12.15 Enforcement Actions by the Agent. Except as otherwise
expressly provided under this Agreement or in any of the other Loan
Documents and subject to the terms hereof, Agent will take such
action, assert such rights and pursue such remedies under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents as the Majority Banks or all
of the Banks, as the case may be (as provided for hereunder), shall
direct. Except as otherwise expressly provided in any of the Loan
Documents, Agent will not (and will not be obligated to) take any
action, assert any rights or pursue any remedies under this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in violation or
contravention of any express direction or instruction of the
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 109 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

Majority Banks or all of the Banks, as the case may be (as provided
for hereunder). Agent may refuse (and will not be obligated) to
take any action, assert any rights or pursue any remedies under
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in the absence of
the express written direction and instruction of the Majority Banks
or all of the Banks, as the case may be (as provided for
hereunder). In the event Agent fails, within a commercially
reasonable time, to take such action, assert such rights, or pursue
such remedies as the Majority Banks or all of the Banks, as the
case may be (as provided for hereunder), shall direct in conformity
with this Agreement, the Majority Banks or all of the Banks, as the
case may be (as provided for hereunder), shall have the right to
take such action, to assert such rights, or pursue such remedies on
behalf of all of the Banks unless the terms hereof otherwise
require the consent of all the Banks to the taking of such actions
(in which event all of the Banks must join in such action). Except
as expressly provided above or elsewhere in this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents, no Bank (other than the Agent, acting in its
capacity as Agent) shall be entitled to take any enforcement action
of any kind under any of the Loan Documents.

Co-Agent and Lead Managers. NationsBank has been
designated by the Company as "Co-Agent" and BHF and Signet have
been designated by the Company as "Lead Managers" under this
Agreement. Other than its rights and remedies as a Bank hereunder,
each such Co-Agent and Lead Manager shall have no administrative,
collateral or other rights or responsibilities, provided, however,
that each such Co-Agent and Lead Manager shall be entitled to the
benefits afforded to Agent under Sections 12.5 and 12.6 hereof.

13. MISCELLANEOUS

13.1 Accounting Principles. Where the character or amount of
any asset or liability or item of income or expense is required to
be determined or any consolidation or other accounting computation
is required to be made for the purposes of this Agreement, it shall
be done in accordance with GAAP.

13.2 Consent to Jurisdiction. The Company and each Permitted
Borrower hereby irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of any United States Federal or Michigan state court
sitting in Detroit in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents and the
Company and each Permitted Borrower hereby irrevocably agrees that
all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in any such United States Federal or Michigan state
court. Each of the Permitted Borrowers irrevocably appoints the
Company as its agent for service of process. The Company and each
Permitted Borrower irrevocably consents to the service of any and
all process in any such action or proceeding brought in any court
in or of the State of Michigan by the delivery of copies of such
process to the Company at its address specified on the signature
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 110 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

page hereto or by certified mail directed to such address. Nothing
in this Section shall affect the right of the Banks and the Agent
to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or limit the
right of the Banks or the Agent (or any of them) to bring any such
action or proceeding against the Company or any of the Permitted
Borrowers or any of its or their property in the courts of any
other jurisdiction. The Company and each Permitted Borrower hereby
irrevocably waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such
suit or proceeding in the above described courts.

13.3 Law of Michigan. This Agreement, the Notes and the
other Loan Documents executed have been delivered at Detroit,
Michigan, and shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan, except as and to
the extent expressed to the contrary in any of the Loan Documents.
Whenever possible each provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity,
without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the
remaining provisions of this Agreement.

13.4 Interest. In the event the obligation of the Company or
any of the Permitted Borrowers to pay interest on the principal
balance of the Notes is or becomes in excess of the maximum
interest rate which the Company is permitted by law to contract or
agree to pay, giving due consideration to the execution date of
this Agreement, then, in that event, the rate of interest
applicable with respect to such Bank's Percentage shall be deemed
to be immediately reduced to such maximum rate and all previous
payments in excess of the maximum rate shall be deemed to have been
payments in reduction of principal and not of interest.

13.5 Closing Costs; Other Costs. Company shall pay or
reimburse Agent for payment of, on demand (a) all closing costs and
expenses, including, by way of description and not limitation, in-
house and outside attorney fees and advances, appraisal and
accounting fees, title and lien search fees, and required travel
costs, incurred by Agent in connection with the commitment,
consummation and closing of the loans contemplated hereby, or in
connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the loans or
advances provided under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents,
or any amendment thereof requested by Company, or in connection
with the release of the Collateral under the Prior Loan Agreements
pursuant to Section 13.22 hereof; and (b) all stamp and other taxes
and fees payable or determined to be payable in connection with the
execution, delivery, filing or recording of this Agreement and the
Loan Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and any and all liabilities with respect to or
resulting from any delay in paying or omitting to pay such taxes or
fees, and in connection with any releases or discharges of the
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 111 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

Collateral under the Prior Loan Agreements pursuant to Section
13.22 hereof. Furthermore, all reasonable costs and expenses,
including without limitation attorney fees, and costs and expenses
to Environmental Auditors retained by Agent hereunder, incurred by
Agent in revising, preserving, protecting, exercising or enforcing
any of its or any of the Banks' rights against Company or any of
the Permitted Borrowers, or otherwise incurred by Agent and the
Banks (using a single law firm retained by Agent, with the approval
of the Majority Banks) in connection with any Event of Default or
the enforcement of the loans (whether incurred through
negotiations, legal proceedings or otherwise), including by way of
description and not limitation, such charges in any court or
bankruptcy proceedings or arising out of any claim or action by any
person against Agent or any Bank which would not have been asserted
were it not for Agent's or such Bank's relationship with Company
and the Permitted Borrowers hereunder or otherwise, shall also be
paid by Company and the Permitted Borrowers. All of said amounts
required to be paid by Company hereunder and not paid forthwith
upon demand, as aforesaid, shall bear interest, from the date
incurred to the date payment is received by Agent, at the Prime-
based Rate, plus three percent (3%).

13.6 Notices. Except as otherwise provided herein, all
notices or demand hereunder to the parties hereto shall be
sufficient if made in writing and delivered by messenger or
deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, certified mail, and
addressed to the parties as set forth on the signature pages of
this Agreement and to Permitted Borrowers at the Company's address.
Any notice or demand given to the Company hereunder shall be deemed
given to the Permitted Borrowers, whether or not said notice or
demand is addressed to or received by the Permitted Borrowers.

13.7 Further Action. Company, from time to time, upon
written request of Agent will make, execute, acknowledge and
deliver or cause to be made, executed, acknowledged and delivered,
all such further and additional instruments, and take all such
further action as may be required to carry out the intent and
purpose of this Agreement, and to provide for Advances under and
payment of the Notes, according to the intent and purpose herein
and therein expressed.

13.8 Successors and Assigns; Assignments and Participations.

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall
inure to the benefit of Company (and the Permitted Borrowers) and
the Banks and their respective successors and assigns.

(b) The foregoing shall not authorize any
assignment by Company, or any of the Permitted Borrowers, of its
rights or duties hereunder, and no such assignment shall be made
(or effective) without the prior written approval of the Banks.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 112 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

(c) The Company and Agent acknowledge that each of
the Banks may at any time and from time to time, subject to the
terms and conditions hereof, assign or grant participations in such
Bank's rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents to any commercial bank, savings and loan association,
insurance company, pension fund, mutual fund, commercial finance
company or other similar financial institution, the identity of
which institution is approved by Company and Agent, such approval
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, that
(i) the approval of Company shall not be required upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of a Default or Event of
Default and (ii) the approval of Company and Agent shall not be
required for any such sale, transfer, assignment or participation
to the Affiliate of an assigning Bank, any other Bank or any
Federal Reserve Bank; and provided further that the aggregate
assignments and participation interests sold by a Bank (other than
pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this Section 13.8(c)) do not
exceed fifty percent (50%) of its original interest therein. The
Company authorizes each Bank to disclose to any prospective
assignee or participant, once approved by Company and Agent, any
and all financial information in such Bank's possession concerning
the Company which has been delivered to such Bank pursuant to this
Agreement; provided that each such prospective participant shall
execute a confidentiality agreement consistent with the terms of
Section 13.13, hereof.

(d) Each assignment by a Bank of any portion of its
rights and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents
shall be made pursuant to an Assignment Agreement substantially (as
determined by Agent) in the form attached hereto as Exhibit "I"
(with appropriate insertions acceptable to Agent) and shall be
subject to the terms and conditions hereof, and to the following
restrictions:

(i) each assignment shall cover all of the Notes
issued by Company and its Subsidiaries
hereunder and the notes issued by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries under the other
Loan Agreements (and not any particular note
or notes), and shall be for a fixed and not
varying percentage thereof, with the same
percentage applicable to each such Note;

(ii) each assignment shall be in a minimum amount
of Ten Million Dollars ($10,000,000) or, as
applicable, the Alternative Currency
equivalent thereof;

(iii) no assignment shall violate any "blue sky" or
other securities law of any jurisdiction or
shall require the Company or any other Person
to file a registration statement or similar
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 113 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

application with the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission (or similar state
regulatory body) or to qualify under the "blue
sky" or other securities laws of any
jurisdiction; and

(iv) no assignment shall be effective unless Agent
has received from the assignee (or from the
assigning Bank) an assignment fee of $3,500
for each such assignment.

In connection with any assignment, Company and Agent shall be
entitled to continue to deal solely and directly with the assigning
Bank in connection with the interest so assigned until (x) the
Agent shall have received a notice of assignment duly executed by
the assigning Bank and an Assignment Agreement (with respect
thereto) duly executed by the assigning Bank and each assignee; and
(y) the assigning Bank shall have delivered to the Agent the
original of each Note held by the assigning Bank under the Loan
Agreements. From and after the date on which the Agent shall
notify Company and the assigning Bank that the foregoing conditions
shall have been satisfied and all consents (if any) required shall
have been given, the assignee thereunder shall be deemed to be a
party to this Agreement and the other Loan Agreements. To the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder shall have been
assigned to such assignee as provided in such notice of assignment
(and Assignment Agreement), such assignee shall have the rights and
obligations of a Bank under this Agreement (including without
limitation the right to receive fees payable hereunder in respect
of the period following such assignment). In addition, the
assigning Bank, to the extent that rights and obligations hereunder
shall have been assigned by it as provided in such notice of
assignment (and Assignment Agreement), but not otherwise, shall
relinquish its rights and be released from its obligations under
this Agreement.

Within five (5) business days following Company's receipt of notice
from the Agent that Agent has accepted and executed a notice of
assignment and the duly executed Assignment Agreement, Company and
the Permitted Borrowers shall, to the extent applicable, execute
and deliver to the Agent in exchange for any surrendered Note, new
Note(s) payable to the order of the assignee in an amount equal to
the amount assigned to it pursuant to such notice of assignment
(and Assignment Agreement), and with respect to the portion of the
Indebtedness retained by the assigning Bank, to the extent
applicable, a new Note payable to the order of the assigning Bank
in an amount equal to the amount retained by such Bank hereunder
shall be executed and delivered by the Company and the Permitted
Borrowers. Agent, the Banks and the Company (and the Permitted
Borrowers) acknowledge and agree that any such new Note(s) shall be
given in renewal and replacement of the surrendered Notes and shall
not effect or constitute a novation or discharge of the
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 114 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

Indebtedness evidenced by any surrendered Note, and each such new
Note shall contain a provision confirming such agreement. In
addition, promptly following receipt of such Notes, Agent shall
prepare and distribute to Company, the Permitted Borrowers and each
of the Banks a revised Exhibit G to this Agreement and a comparable
revised exhibit to each of the other Loan Agreements setting forth
the applicable new Percentages of the Banks (including the assignee
Bank), taking into account such assignment.

(e) Each Bank agrees that any participation
agreement permitted hereunder shall comply with all applicable laws
and shall be subject to the following restrictions (which shall be
set forth in the applicable Participation Agreement):

(i) such Bank shall remain the holder of its Notes
hereunder, notwithstanding any such
participation;

(ii) except as expressly set forth in this Section
13.8(e) with respect to rights of setoff and
the benefits of Section 11 hereof, a
participant shall have no direct rights or
remedies hereunder;

(iii) a participant shall not reassign or transfer,
or grant any sub-participations in its
participation interest hereunder or any part
thereof; and

(iv) such Bank shall retain the sole right and
responsibility to enforce the obligations of
the Company relating to the Notes and Loan
Documents, including, without limitation, the
right to proceed against any Guaranties, or
cause Agent to do so (subject to the terms and
conditions hereof), and the right to approve
any amendment, modification or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement without the
consent of the participant, except for those
matters covered by Section 13.11(a) through
(d) and (h) hereof (provided that a
participant may exercise approval rights over
such matters only on an indirect basis, acting
through such Bank, and Company, Agent and the
other Banks may continue to deal directly with
such Bank in connection with such Bank's
rights and duties hereunder), and shall
otherwise be in form satisfactory to Agent.

Company agrees that each participant shall be deemed to have the
right of setoff under Section 10.4 hereof (and under the comparable
terms of the other Loan Agreements), in respect of its
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 115 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

participation interest in amounts owing under this Agreement and
the Loan Documents to the same extent as if the Indebtedness were
owing directly to it as a Bank under this Agreement, shall be
subject to the pro rata recovery provisions of Section 10.3 hereof
(and under the comparable terms of the other Loan Agreements), and
that each participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section
11 hereof (and under the comparable terms of the other Loan
Agreements). The amount, terms and conditions of any participation
shall be as set forth in the participation agreement between the
issuing Bank and the Person purchasing such participation, and
none of the Company, the Agent and the other Banks shall have any
responsibility or obligation with respect thereto, or to any 
Person to whom any such participation may be issued. No such
participation shall relieve any issuing Bank of any of its
obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, and all actions hereunder shall be conducted as if no
such participation had been granted.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement, the Loan Documents
or the Notes, expressed or implied, is intended to or shall confer
on any Person other than the respective parties hereto and thereto
and their successors and assignees permitted hereunder and
thereunder any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or
other claim under this Agreement, the Notes or the other Loan
Documents. 

13.9 Indulgence. No delay or failure of Agent and the Banks
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall affect
such right, power or privilege nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any further exercise thereof, nor the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights of
Agent and the Banks hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive
of any rights or remedies which Agent and the Banks would otherwise
have.

13.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several

13.11 Amendment and Waiver. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or any Loan Document, nor consent to
any departure by the Company or any of the Permitted Borrowers

all the Banks, do any of the following: (a) increase any commitment
of the Banks hereunder or subject the Banks to any additional

13.12 Taxes and Fees. Should any tax (other than a tax based
upon the net income of any Bank or Agent), recording or filing fee
become payable in respect of this Agreement or any of the Loan
Documents or any amendment, modification or supplement hereof or
thereof, the Company agrees to pay the same together with any
interest or penalties thereon and agrees to hold the Agent and the
Banks harmless with respect thereto.

13.13 Confidentiality. Each Bank agrees that it will not
disclose without the prior consent of the Company (other than to
its employees, to another Bank or to its auditors or counsel) any
confidential information with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries which is furnished pursuant to this Agreement or any
of the Loan Documents; provided that any Bank may disclose any such
information (a) as has become generally available to the public or
has been lawfully obtained by such Bank from any third party not
known by such Bank to be under any duty of confidentiality to the
Company, (b) as may be required or appropriate in any report,
statement or testimony submitted to, or in respect to any inquiry,
by, any municipal, state or federal regulatory body having or
claiming to have jurisdiction over such Bank, including the Board
of Governors of the Federal Reserve System of the United States or
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or similar organizations
(whether in the United States or elsewhere) or their successors,
(c) as may be required or appropriate in respect to any summons or
subpoena or in connection with any litigation, (d) in order to

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 117 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

Bank, and (e) to any permitted transferee or assignee or to any
approved participant of, or with respect to, the Notes, as
aforesaid.

13.14 Withholding Taxes. If any Bank is not incorporated
under the laws of the United States or a state thereof, such Bank
shall promptly deliver to the Agent two executed copies of (i)
Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 specifying the applicable tax
treaty between the United States and the jurisdiction of such
Bank's domicile which provides for the exemption from withholding
on interest payments to such Bank, (ii) Internal Revenue Service
Form 4224 evidencing that the income to be received by such Bank
hereunder is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or
business in the United States or (iii) other evidence satisfactory
to the Agent that such Bank is exempt from United States income tax
withholding with respect to such income. Such Bank shall amend or
supplement any such form or evidence as required to insure that it
is accurate, complete and non-misleading at all times. Promptly
upon notice from the Agent of any determination by the Internal
Revenue Service that any payments previously made to such Bank
hereunder were subject to United States income tax withholding when
made, such Bank shall pay to the Agent the excess of the aggregate
amount required to be withheld from such payments over the
aggregate amount actually withheld by the Agent. In addition, from
time to time upon the reasonable request and at the sole expense of
the Company or any Permitted Borrower, each Bank and the Agent
shall (to the extent it is able to do so based upon applicable
facts and circumstances), complete and provide the Company or any
Permitted Borrower with such forms, certificates or other documents
as may be reasonably necessary to allow the Company or any
Permitted Borrower, as applicable, to make any payment under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents without any withholding for
or on the account of any tax under Section 10.1(e) hereof (or with
such withholding at a reduced rate), provided that the execution
and delivery of such forms, certificates or other documents does
not adversely affect or otherwise restrict the right and benefits
(including without limitation economic benefits) available to such
Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any
of the other Loan Documents, or under or in connection with any
transactions not related to the transactions contemplated hereby.

13.15 Effective Upon Execution. This Agreement shall become
effective upon the execution hereof by Banks, Agent and the Company
and the issuance by the Company and the Permitted Borrowers, as
applicable, of the Revolving Credit Notes, and the Term Notes
hereunder, and shall remain effective until the Indebtedness has
been repaid and discharged in full and no commitment to extend any
credit hereunder or under any of the other Loan Agreements remains
outstanding.

13.16 Severability. In case any one or more of the
obligations of the Company or any of the Permitted Borrowers under
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 118 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

this Agreement, the Notes or any of the other Loan Documents shall
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining obligations
of the Company or any of the Permitted Borrowers shall not in any
way be affected or impaired thereby, and such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability in one jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity, legality or enforceability of the obligations of the
Company or any of the Permitted Borrowers under this Agreement, the
Notes or any of the other Loan Documents in any other jurisdiction.

13.17 Table of Contents and Headings. The table of contents
and the headings of the various subdivisions hereof are for
convenience of reference only and shall in no way modify or affect
any of the terms or provisions hereof.

13.18 Construction of Certain Provisions. If any provision of
this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents refers to any action to
be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from
taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action is
taken directly or indirectly by such Person, whether or not
expressly specified in such provision.

13.19 Independence of Covenants. Each covenant hereunder
shall be given independent effect (subject to any exceptions stated
in such covenant) so that if a particular action or condition is
not permitted by any such covenant (taking into account any such
stated exception), the fact that it would be permitted by an
exception to, or would be otherwise within the limitations of,
another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an
Event of Default if such action is taken or such condition exists.

13.20 Reliance on and Survival of Various Provisions. All
terms, covenants, agreements, representations and warranties of the
Company or any party to any of the Loan Documents made herein or in
any of the Loan Documents or in any certificate, report, financial
statement or other document furnished by or on behalf of the
Company, any such party in connection with this Agreement or any of
the Loan Documents shall be deemed to have been relied upon by the
Banks, notwithstanding any investigation heretofore or hereafter
made by any Bank or on such Bank's behalf, and those covenants and
agreements of the Company and the Permitted Borrowers set forth in
Section 11.8 hereof (together with any other indemnities of the
Company or the Permitted Borrowers contained elsewhere in this
Agreement or in any of the Loan Documents) and of Banks set forth
in Section 13.13 hereof shall survive the repayment in full of the
Indebtedness and the termination of any commitments to make
Advances hereunder.

13.21 Release of Guaranties. Upon the prior written request
of Company to Agent following the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in this Section 13.21, Banks and the Agent agree, if
Company obtains an S&P Rating of BBB- (or higher quality) or a
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 119 -- Exhibit 10.1 ($302,000,000 Loan Agreement)

Moody's Rating of Baa3 (or higher quality) and such rating is then
in effect, to release the Domestic Guaranty and the Permitted
Borrowers Guaranty, and the Guarantors' obligations thereunder;
provided, however, that:

(a) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing on the date of Company's request
hereunder, and as of the effective date of such
release; and

(b) concurrently with the release of such guaranties by
Banks and Agent, the Company has irrevocably paid and
discharged in full all Indebtedness outstanding under
the Acquisition Loans on such date and has irrevocably
cancelled any and all further commitments of Agent or
the Banks to make further Advances thereof.

13.22 Release of Collateral under Prior Loan Agreements.
Agent and the Prior Banks acknowledge and agree that the Collateral
obtained by them from Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable,
under the Prior Loan Agreements shall be released and discharged
(at Company's sole expense) as soon as reasonably practicable
following the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

13.23 Complete Agreement. This Agreement, the Notes, any
Requests for Advance hereunder, the other Loan Documents and any
agreements, certificates, or other documents given to secure the
Indebtedness and the Commitment Letter, contain the entire
agreement of the parties hereto (provided that in the event of any
inconsistency between this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
on one hand, and the Commitment Letter, on the other hand, this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall control), and none of
the parties hereto shall be bound by anything not expressed in
writing.

pay to the order of ( insert bank ) ("Bank") at Detroit,
Michigan, care of Agent, for the account of Bank's Eurocurrency Lending
Office with respect to any Eurocurrency-based Advances hereunder, in lawful
money of the United States of America or in such Alternative Currencies
applicable to particular Advances which may, from time to time, be
outstanding hereunder, the Indebtedness or so much of the sum of (
insert amount derived from Percentages ) Dollars ($ ______________) (or
the foreign currency equivalent thereof then outstanding in any one or more
of the Alternative Currencies if applicable), as may from time to time have
been advanced and then be outstanding hereunder pursuant to the Amended and
Restated Vishay Intertechnology, Inc. $302,500,000 Revolving Credit and Term
Loan Agreement dated as of July ____, 1994 (the "Agreement"), made by and
among the Company, certain banks, including the Bank, and Comerica Bank, a
Michigan banking corporation, as Agent for such banks, together with interest
thereon as hereinafter set forth.

Each of the Advances made hereunder shall bear interest at the
Eurocurrency-based Rate or the Prime-based Rate as elected by Company or as
otherwise determined under the Agreement.

Interest on the unpaid balance of all Prime-based Advances shall be
payable in United States Dollars quarterly commencing on September 30, 1994
and on the last day of each calendar quarter thereafter. Interest accruing at
the Prime-based Rate shall be computed on the basis of a 360 day year and
assessed for the actual number of days elapsed, and in such computation
effect shall be given to changes in the Prime-based Rate on the date of such
change in the Prime-based Rate.

Interest on each 1 month, 2 month and 3 month Eurocurrency-based Advance
shall be payable in United States Dollars or in the Alternative Currency
applicable to such Advance, as the case may be, on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto. Interest on each 6 month
Eurocurrency-based Advance outstanding from time to time shall be payable in
United States Dollars or in the Alternative Currency applicable to such
Advance, as the case may be, at intervals of 3 months after the first day of
the applicable Interest Period and on the last day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto. Interest accruing at the Eurocurrency-based Rate shall be
computed on the basis of a 360 day year and assessed for the

actual number of days elapsed from the first day of the Interest Period appli-
cable thereto, to, but not including, the last day thereof. Interest due on an
Eurocurrency-based Advance made in an Alternative Currency shall be paid in
such Alternative Currency.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding paragraph,
interest shall be payable, in the currency applicable to such Advance, on
every type of Advance on the date that any Advance is converted to another
type of Advance.

In the event and so long as any default or Event of Default shall exist
hereunder or under the Agreement, interest shall be payable daily on all
Advances from time to time outstanding hereunder at a per annum rate equal to
the Applicable Interest Rate plus three percent (3%) for the remainder of the
then existing Interest Period, if any, and at all other times, with respect
to Domestic Advances from time to time outstanding, at a per annum rate equal
to the Prime-based Rate plus three percent (3%), and with respect to
Eurocurrency-based Advances from time to time outstanding, (i) at a per annum
rate calculated by the Agent, whose determination shall be conclusive absent
manifest error, on a daily basis, equal to three percent (3%) above the
interest rate per annum at which one (1) day deposits (or, if such amount due
remains unpaid for more than three (3) Business Days, then for such other
period of time as the Agent may elect which shall in no event be longer than
six (6) months) in the relevant Eurocurrency in the amount of such overdue
payment are offered by the Agent's Eurocurrency Lending Office for the
applicable period so determined, or (ii) if at any such time such deposits
are not offered by the Eurocurrency Lending Office, then at a rate per annum
equal to three percent (3%) above the rate determined by the Agent to be its
aggregate marginal cost (including the cost of maintaining any required
reserves or deposit insurance) of carrying the amount of such
Eurocurrency-based Advance.

be made from time to time, but only in accordance with, the terms and

shall be determined under the laws of, and enforceable in, the State of
Michigan.

Company hereby waives presentment for payment, demand, protest and
notice of dishonor and nonpayment of this Note and agrees that no obligation
hereunder shall be discharged by reason of any extension, indulgence,
release, or forbearance granted by any holder of this Note to any party now
or hereafter liable hereon or any present or subsequent owner of any

each Bank by wire, telex or by telephone (confirmed by wire,
telecopy or telex) of the amount of such Advance to be made
and the date such Advance is to be made by said Bank pursuant
to its Percentage of the Advance. Unless such Bank's
commitment to make Advances hereunder shall have been
suspended or terminated in accordance with this Agreement,
each Bank shall make available the amount of its Percentage of
the Advance in immediately available funds in Deutsche Marks

recovered by Agent, at a rate per annum equal to:

(i) in the case of a Bank, Agent's aggregate
marginal cost (including the cost of
maintaining any required reserves or deposit
insurance and of any fees penalties, overdraft
charges or other costs or expenses incurred by
Agent as a result of such failure to deliver
funds hereunder) of carrying such amount; and

(ii) in the case of Company, the rate of interest

due and payable by the Company, on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, provided, that no Bid Advance may mature
or be payable on a day later than the Revolving Credit Maturity
Date. In no event whatsoever shall any outstanding Bid Advance be
deemed to reduce, modify or affect any Bank's commitment to make
Advances of the Revolving Credit, based upon its Percentage. All

Bid Lenders, or any lesser number thereof (including any Bid Lender

(b) Bid Requests. Company may request from all Bid Lenders

with respect to such Bid Advance;

(B) in the event the Company requests an Absolute
Rate Bid Advance, the rate of interest per annum

such Absolute Rate Bid Advance; and

(C) in the event the Company requests a DM Bid
Advance, the margin offered by such Bid Lender in its
sole discretion with respect to such Bid Advance above
or below the DM Adjusted Rate expressed as a percentage

Margin") to be added to or subtracted from the
applicable DM Adjusted Rate for the Interest Period for
each such DM Bid Advance.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Bid Offers submitted by Agent
in its capacity as a Bank may be submitted, and may only be
submitted, if the Agent notifies Company of the terms of such
Bid Offer (and the content thereof) not later than 30 minutes
prior to the deadline for the other Bid Lenders, in the case
of a DM Bid Advance. Agent agrees to use good faith diligent
efforts in formulating any such Bid Offers hereunder, not to

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 26 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

(E) not have been delivered to the Agent in
accordance with the time periods specified
herein; or

(F) be otherwise inconsistent with the provisions
hereof,

the Agent will reject the offer made by such Bid Offer and give

and in any case, no later than 11:00 a.m. (Detroit time) four (4)
Business Days prior to the date of the proposed Bid Advance, the
Agent will give telephonic notice (confirmed by facsimile) to the
Company of all conforming Bid Offers and the terms thereof.

(d) Acceptance by the Company of Bid Offers. The Company

(i) irrevocably cancel the Bid Borrowing Request
that requested such Bid Advance by giving the Agent telephonic
notice confirmed promptly thereafter by facsimile) to that
effect; or

(ii) irrevocably accept one or more of the Bid
Offers by giving telephonic notice to the Agent of the amount
of the Bid Advance to be made on such date, specifying (A) the
amount of each Bid Advance to be made by each Bid Lender as
part of such Bid Advance, which amount shall not be greater
than the amount offered by such Bid Lender in its Bid Offer,
(B) the Interest Period with respect thereto, and (C) the
Absolute Rate with respect to each Absolute Rate Bid Advance
and the DM Bid Margin with respect to each DM Bid Advance;

provided, however, that:

(A) the Company shall accept Bid Lenders' conforming
Bid Offers only on the basis of ascending Absolute
Rates or DM Bid Margins and shall not accept any Bid
Lender's conforming Bid Offer to make a Bid Advance at
a particular Absolute Rate or DM Bid Margin for a
particular Interest Period if the Company has decided
to reject any other Bid Lender's conforming Bid Offer
to make a Bid Advance with the same Interest Period at
a lower Absolute Rate or DM Bid Margin, as the case may
be;

(B) the aggregate principal amount of all Bid Offers
accepted by the Company shall not, after giving effect

Section 2.5 (d)(ii) below, exceed the principal amount
specified in the Bid Borrowing Request;

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 27 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

(C) if the Company shall accept any Bid Offer to
make a Bid Advance at a particular Absolute Rate or DM
Bid Margin, as the case may be, for a particular
Interest Period, then the Company shall accept all
offers to make Bid Advances at such Absolute Rate or DM
Bid Margin, as the case may be, for the same Interest
Period; provided, however, that, if Bid Offers are made
by two or more Bid Lenders at the same Absolute Rates
or DM Bid Margins (with respect to the related Interest
Period(s)) as the case may be, for a greater aggregate
principal amount than the amount in respect of which
such Bid Offers are accepted for the related Interest
Period, the principal amount of Bid Advances in respect
of which such Bid Offers are accepted shall be
allocated by the Agent among such Bid Lenders as nearly
as possible (and in such multiples, not greater than
One Million Five Hundred Thousand Deutsche Marks (DM
1,500,000), as the Agent may deem appropriate) in
proportion to the aggregate principal amounts of such
Bid Offers. Each Bid Lender acknowledges and agrees
that any Bid Offer submitted by such Bid Lender may be
modified in accordance with this clause (C), and no
such modification shall constitute a rejection of such
Bid Offer. Determinations by Agent of the amounts of
Bid Advances hereunder shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error.

Subject to the foregoing requirements, the Company may accept or
reject, at the Company's sole discretion, the offer to make Bid
Advances contained in any Bid Offer. Each notice given by the
Company pursuant to this Section 2.5(d) shall be irrevocable. 
Failure by the Company to accept a Bid Offer in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.5(d) shall constitute a rejection of
such Bid Offer.

(e) Acknowledgment of Bid Borrowings. Promptly after
acceptance of a Bid Offer by the Company pursuant to Section 2.5(d)
(ii) hereof:

(i) in any case no later than 1:00 p.m. (Detroit time)
four (4) Business Days prior to the date of such Bid Advance
in the case of a DM Bid Advance, the Company shall deliver by
facsimile to the Agent a Bid Acknowledgment in substantially
the form of Exhibit C-3 hereto ("Bid Acknowledgment")
confirming, with respect to each Bid Advance to be made to the
Company, the Interest Period, the amount of the borrowing and
the Absolute Rate or DM Bid Margin, as the case may be,
therefor; and

(ii) in any case no later than 2:00 p.m. (Detroit time)
four (4) Business Days prior to the date of such Bid Advance
the Agent will give telephonic notice to each Bid Lender of
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 28 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

each Interest Period, amount of the borrowing, and the
Absolute Rate or DM Bid Margin, as the case may be, so
accepted by the Company.

(f) Bid Advance Funding. At or before noon (Detroit time)
on the Business Day of such Bid Advance each Bid Lender whose Bid
Offer in respect thereof the Company accepted pursuant to Section
2.5(d)(ii) hereof shall deposit with the Agent same day funds in an
amount equal to the principal amount of such Bid Lender's Bid
Advance. Such deposit will be made to an account which the Agent
shall from time to time specify by notice to the Bid Lenders. To
the extent same day funds are received from such Bid Lenders, the
Agent shall make such same day funds available to the Company by
wire transfer to the accounts which Company shall have specified in
its Bid Acknowledgment. No Bid Lender's obligation to make any Bid
Advance shall be affected by any other Bid Lender's failure to make
any Bid Advance.

Unless Agent shall have received notice from a Bid Lender
prior to the date of funding of such Bid Lender's Bid Advance
accepted by the Company that such Bid Lender will not make
available to the Agent such Bid Lender's share of such Bid Advance,
Agent may assume that such Bid Lender has made such share available
to Agent on the date of such Bid Advance in accordance with this
subparagraph (f) and Agent may (but under no circumstances shall be
required to do so), in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to Company on such date a corresponding amount. If and
to the extent that such Bid Lender shall not have so made such
share available to Agent in accordance with the terms hereof, such
Bid Lender and Company severally agree to repay to Agent forthwith
upon demand such corresponding amount, together with interest
thereon, for each day from the date such amount is made available
to Company until the date such amount is repaid to Agent, at a rate
per annum equal to:

(i) in the case of a Bid Lender, Agent's aggregate
marginal cost (including the cost of
maintaining any required reserves or deposit
insurance and of any fees penalties, overdraft
charges or other costs or expenses incurred by
Agent as a result of such failure to deliver
funds hereunder) of carrying such amount; and

(ii) so long as the Bid Advance is denominated in
Deutsche Marks hereunder, (x) at a per annum
rate calculated by the Agent, whose
determination shall be conclusive absent
manifest error, on a daily basis, equal to
three percent (3%) above the interest rate per
annum at which one (1) day (or, if such amount
due remains unpaid for more than three (3)
Business Days, then for such other period of
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 29 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

time as the Agent may elect which shall in no
event be longer than six (6) months) deposits
in Deutsche Marks, in the amount of such
overdue payment due to the Agent are offered
by the Agent's Eurocurrency Lending Office for
the applicable period determined as provided
above, or (y) if at any such time such
deposits are not offered by the Agent's
Eurocurrency Lending Office, then at a rate
per annum equal to three percent (3%) above
the rate determined by the Agent to be its
aggregate marginal cost (including the cost of
maintaining any required reserves or deposit
insurance) of carrying the amount of the
Indebtedness then outstanding; provided that,
if the applicable Bid Advance has been
converted to Dollars hereunder is then in
effect, at a per annum rate equal to the
Prime-based Rate, plus three percent (3%).

If such Bid Lender shall repay to Agent such corresponding amount,
such amount so repaid shall constitute such Bid Lender's portion of
the Bid Advance included in such Bid Advance for purposes of this
Agreement.

Promptly after each Bid Advance, and in any case no later than
the immediately succeeding Business Day, the Agent will deliver to
each of the Banks, a copy of the Bid Acknowledgment, specifying the
date and amount of such Bid Advance, the amounts of the Bid
Advances which comprise such borrowing and the Interest Period(s)
thereof and the Absolute Rate(s) or DM Bid Margin(s) as the case
may be, accepted. Furthermore, upon the request of any Bank from
time to time hereunder, the Agent will provide summaries to such
Bid Lender of all Bid Offers received in response thereto.

(g) Bid Notes. The Bid Advances of each Bid Lender shall
be evidenced by a promissory note in the form of Exhibit C-4
attached hereto ("Bid Notes"), with appropriate insertions and
shall be payable to the order of such Bid Lender, shall be dated as
of the date of this Agreement, shall set forth the maximum
principal amount of the aggregate Bid Advances which may be made by
such Bid Lender and shall mature, subject to the terms hereof, on
the Revolving Credit Maturity Date. Each Bid Lender shall record
in its records, or at its option on the schedule attached to its
Bid Note, the date and amount of each Bid Advance made by such Bid
Lender, the Applicable Interest Rate with respect to each Bid
Advance, each repayment thereof and the dates on which each
Interest Period for such Bid Advance shall begin and end. The
aggregate unpaid principal amount so recorded shall be conclusive
evidence of the principal amount owing and unpaid on such Bid Note,
absent manifest error. The failure to so record any such amount or
any error in so recording any such amount shall not, however, limit
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 30 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

or otherwise affect the obligations of the Company hereunder or
under any such Bid Note.

2.6 No Dollar Advance Availability. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no additional
Advances of the Revolving Credit shall be available to Company from
the date of any notification by Agent that, pursuant to Section 4.5
hereof, the outstanding Indebtedness is to be converted to Dollars,
unless and until Agent shall notify Company, pursuant to Section
4.6 hereof, that the outstanding Indebtedness is to be reconverted
to Deutsche Marks in accordance with the terms hereof.

2.7 Revolving Credit Facility Fee. From the date hereof to
the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, the Company shall pay to the
Agent, for distribution to the Banks pro rata, a Revolving Credit
Facility Fee consisting of the Applicable Fee Percentage per annum,
calculated on a daily basis, times the Revolving Credit Maximum
Amount then in effect hereunder, regardless of the aggregate amount
of Advances of the Revolving Credit outstanding from time to time.

The Revolving Credit Facility Fee shall be payable quarterly in
arrears commencing September 30, 1994, and on the last day of each
calendar quarter thereafter and at the Revolving Credit Maturity
Date, and shall be computed on the basis of a year of three hundred
sixty (360) days and assessed for the actual number of days
elapsed, giving immediate effect to any changes in the Applicable
Fee Percentage. Whenever any payment of the Revolving Credit
Facility Fee shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the
date for payment thereof shall be extended to the next Business
Day. Upon receipt of such payment, Agent shall make prompt payment
to each Bank of its share of the Revolving Credit Facility Fee
based upon its respective Percentage. The Revolving Credit Facility
Fee shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

2.8 Revolving Credit Commitment Fee. From the date hereof
to the Revolving Credit Maturity Date, the Company shall pay to the
Agent, for distribution to the Banks as set forth below, in the
currency in which the Indebtedness is then being carried, or, if no
Indebtedness is then outstanding hereunder, in the currency in
which the Indebtedness hereunder would be required to be carried if
it were outstanding, a Revolving Credit Commitment Fee equal to
.0625% per annum on the daily average amount by which the Revolving
Credit Maximum Amount exceeds the principal amount outstanding from
time to time under the Revolving Credit, plus the aggregate daily
amount of Bid Advances outstanding from time to time hereunder
determined in each case as of the last day of each Interest Period
so long as, and during all times when the Indebtedness is carried
in Deutsche Marks (but otherwise computed on a daily basis). The
Revolving Credit Commitment Fee shall be payable quarterly in
arrears commencing September 30, 1994 and on the last day of each
December, March, June and September thereafter, and shall be
computed on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty (360) days
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 31 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

and assessed for the actual number of days elapsed. Whenever any
payment of the Revolving Credit Commitment Fee shall be due on a
day which is not a Business Day, the date for payment thereof shall
be extended to the next Business Day. Upon receipt of such payment
Agent shall make prompt payment to each Bank of its share of the
Revolving Credit Commitment Fee based upon its respective
Percentage. It is expressly understood that the commitment fees
described in this Section are not refundable under any
circumstances.

2.9 Optional Reduction or Termination of Revolving Credit
Maximum Amount. Provided that no Event of Default, or event which
with the giving of notice or the passage of time, or both, would
constitute an Event of Default, is in existence, the Company may
upon at least five (5) Business Days' prior written notice to the
Agent, permanently reduce the Revolving Credit Maximum Amount in
whole at any time, or in part from time to time, without premium or
penalty, provided that: (i) each partial reduction of the Revolving
Credit Maximum Amount shall be in made in integral multiples of Two
Million Deutsche Marks (DM 2,000,000) if the Deutsche Mark-based
Rate is then in effect, or One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) if the
Prime-based Rate is then in effect; (ii) each reduction shall be
accompanied by the payment of the Revolving Credit Commitment Fee,
if any, accrued to the date of such reduction; (iii) the Company
shall prepay in accordance with the terms hereof the amount, if
any, by which the aggregate unpaid principal amount of Revolving
Credit Notes, plus the aggregate principal amount of Bid Advances
then outstanding, exceeds the amount of the Revolving Credit
Maximum Amount as so reduced, together with interest thereon to the
date of prepayment; and (iv) if the termination or reduction of the
Revolving Credit Maximum Amount requires the prepayment of an
Absolute Rate Bid Advance or a DM-based Advance, the termination or
reduction may be made only on the last day of the then current
Interest Period applicable to such Advance. Reductions of the
Revolving Credit Maximum Amount and any accompanying prepayments of
the Revolving Credit Notes shall be distributed to each Bank in
accordance with such Bank's Percentage thereof, shall be permanent
and irrevocable and will not be available for reinstatement by or
readvance to the Company.

2.10 Extension of Revolving Credit Maturity Date. Provided
that no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
Company may, by written notice to Agent and each Bank (which notice
shall be irrevocable and which shall not be deemed effective unless
actually received by Agent and each Bank) prior to May 18, 1994,
but not before April 18, 1994, of each year, request that the Banks
extend the then applicable Revolving Credit Maturity Date to a date
that is one year later than the Revolving Credit Maturity Date then
in effect (each such request, a "Request"). Each Bank shall, not
later than thirty (30) calendar days following the date of its
receipt of the Request, give written notice to the Agent stating
whether such Bank is willing to extend the Revolving Credit
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 32 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

Maturity Date as requested. If Agent has received the aforesaid
written approvals of such Request from each of the Banks, then,
effective upon the date of Agent's receipt of all such written
approvals from the Banks, as aforesaid, the Revolving Credit
Maturity Date shall be so extended for an additional one year
period, the term Revolving Credit Maturity Date shall mean such
extended date and Agent shall promptly notify the Company that such
extension has occurred. If (i) any Bank gives the Agent written
notice that it is unwilling to extend the Revolving Credit Maturity
Date as requested or (ii) any Bank fails to provide written
approval to Agent of such a Request within thirty (30) calendar
days of the date of Agent's receipt of the Request, then (x) the
Banks shall be deemed to have declined to extend the Revolving
Credit Maturity Date, (y) the then-current Revolving Credit
Maturity Date shall remain in effect (with no further right on the
part of Company to request extensions thereof under this Section
2.10) and (z) the commitments of the Banks to make Advances of the
Revolving Credit hereunder shall terminate on the Revolving Credit
Maturity Date then in effect, and Agent shall promptly notify
Company thereof.

2.11 Revolving Credit as Renewal; Application of Advances.
The Revolving Credit Notes issued by Company shall constitute
renewal and replacement evidence of all present indebtedness of
Company for the Revolving Credit outstanding under the Prior DM
Loan Agreement as of the date hereof. Thereafter, Advances of the
Revolving Credit shall be available, subject to the terms hereof,
to fund working capital needs or other general corporate purposes
of Company. Advances of the Revolving Credit shall not be available
to fund, directly or indirectly, the Target Company Acquisition or
the payment of any transfer taxes, stamp duties, brokerage fees or
other costs and expenses resulting directly or indirectly from such
acquisition.

3. TERM LOAN

3.1 Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each Bank, severally and for itself alone, agrees to
loan to Company, and Company agrees to borrow from each Bank, in a
single advance of Deutsche Marks, concurrently with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, an amount equal to each Bank's
respective Percentage of the Term Loan. Concurrently with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, Company agrees to issue
a separate Term Note to each Bank, with appropriate insertions
(acceptable to Banks in form and substance) as evidence of the
Indebtedness under this Section 3.1.

3.2 Repayment of Term Loan. The principal indebtedness
represented by the Term Notes shall be repaid, in Deutsche Marks
(unless the Term Loan has been converted to Dollars pursuant to
Section 4.5, hereof, and the Prime-based Rate is then in effect, in
which event, said Indebtedness shall be paid in Dollars) in
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 33 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

quarterly principal installments of Four Million Seven Hundred
Fifty Three Thousand Deutsche Marks (DM 4,753,000), provided that,
during any period in which the Indebtedness under the Term Notes is
carried in Dollars in accordance with Section 4.5 hereof, the
Dollar Amount of each scheduled payment of principal and interest
on the Term Notes shall be adjusted to provide for full
amortization of the outstanding principal balance over the
remaining term of the Term Loan. Such payments shall commence on
September 30, 1994, and shall continue on the last day of each
calendar quarter thereafter until the Term Loan Maturity Date, when
the entire unpaid principal balance of such Indebtedness and
accrued interest thereon shall be paid in full.

3.3 Accrual of Interest. Subject to Sections 4.6 and 4.8
hereof, the unpaid principal Indebtedness from time to time
outstanding under the Term Notes shall, from the date of the
issuance of the Term Notes (until paid), bear interest at the
Deutsche Mark-based Rate. The amount and date of the extension of
the Term Loan, Advances thereof, the amount of interest accruing
thereon and Interest Periods for Advances, and the amount and date
of any repayments, shall be noted on Agent's records, which records
shall be conclusive evidence thereof, absent manifest error.

3.4 Deutsche Mark-Based Interest Payments. Interest on
Indebtedness evidenced by the Term Notes which is funded or carried
as a Deutsche Mark-based Advance from time to time shall be payable
in immediately available funds on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, or as otherwise set forth in Section 4.1
hereof.

3.5 Term Loan Rate Requests and Refundings. So long as the
Deutsche Mark-based Rate is in effect hereunder, Company may refund
any Advance of the Indebtedness outstanding under the Term Notes as
a Deutsche Mark-based Advance with a like Interest Period, or
convert such Indebtedness to a Deutsche Mark-based Advance with
another Interest Period only after delivery to Agent of a Term Loan
Rate Request executed by an authorized officer of Company, subject
to the following and to the other provisions hereof:

(a) each such Term Loan Rate Request shall set
forth the information required on the Term Loan Rate Request
form annexed hereto as Exhibit "E", including without
limitation the proposed date of Advance, which must be the day
following the last day of the then ending Interest Period and
the Interest Period applicable to the requested Advance;

(b) each such Term Loan Rate Request shall be
delivered to Agent by 12 noon (Detroit time) four (4) Business
Days prior to the proposed date of the refunding or
conversion;

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 34 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

(c) Company shall not be entitled to request any
Advance with an Interest Period ending after the Term Loan
Maturity Date;

(d) the principal amount of such Advance, plus the
amount of any other outstanding Indebtedness evidenced by the
Term Notes to be then combined therewith having the same
Interest Period, if any, shall be not less than Five Million
Deutsche Marks (DM 5,000,000), unless the balance remaining
outstanding on the Term Loan is less than such amount, then
such lesser amount shall govern and, at any one time, the
Company shall not have more than two (2) Interest Periods in
effect with respect to the Term Loan; and

(e) a Term Loan Rate Request, once delivered to
Agent, shall not be revocable by Company.

3.6 Prime-based Rate Applicability and Interest Payments.
In the event that, pursuant to Section 4.5 hereof, or any other
applicable provision of this Agreement, the Indebtedness
outstanding under the Term Notes shall be converted to an Advance
of Dollars as a Prime-based Advance, thereafter interest on the
unpaid balance of Indebtedness evidenced by the Term Notes shall
accrue from the date of such Advance to the Term Loan Maturity Date
(or until paid, or refunded or reconverted to a Deutsche Mark-based
Advance in accordance with Section 4.6 hereof), at a per annum
interest rate equal to the Prime-based Rate, and shall be payable
in immediately available funds quarterly commencing on the due date
for the next principal installment required to be paid on the Term
Loan pursuant to Section 3.2 hereof, and on the due date of each
succeeding principal payment thereon.

3.7 Term Loan as Renewal. The Term Notes issued by Company
shall constitute renewal and replacement evidence of all present
indebtedness of Company for the Term Loan outstanding under the
Prior DM Loan Agreement as of the date hereof.

4. INTEREST PAYMENTS AND PERIODS: REVOLVING CREDIT, BID
ADVANCES AND TERM CREDIT

4.1 Interest Payments. All accrued and unpaid interest on
the Indebtedness from time to time outstanding under the Revolving
Credit or the Term Loan, or as Bid Advances, shall be due and
payable in full, in immediately available funds, (a) whenever the
Deutsche Mark-based Rate shall be then in effect, (i) on the last
day of each Interest Period and, (ii) if such Interest Period is
longer than 3 months, at intervals of 3 months after the first day
of the Interest Period, and (b) whenever the Prime-based Rate shall
be then in effect, quarterly on a calendar year basis until the
Revolving Credit Maturity Date or the Term Loan Maturity Date, as
applicable, when the entire Indebtedness, including all accrued
interest, shall be due and payable in full.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 35 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

4.2 Interest Calculation. Interest accruing under the Notes
at the Deutsche Mark-based Rate shall be computed on the basis of
a 360 day year and assessed for the actual number of days elapsed
from the first day of the Interest Period applicable thereto to but
not including the last day thereof. Interest accruing at the Prime-
based Rate shall be computed on the basis of a 360 day year and
assessed for the actual number of days elapsed, and in such
computation effect shall be given to any change in the interest
rate resulting from a change in the Prime-based Rate on the date of
such change in the Prime-based Rate. Interest accruing under the
Notes shall be repaid in Deutsche Marks, unless the Applicable
Interest Rate in effect is the Prime-based Rate, in which event
said interest shall be repaid in Dollars.

4.3 Interest Period Selection. So long as the Deutsche
Mark-based Rate is in effect hereunder, Company shall have the
option of selecting, subject to the provisions hereof, among one
(1), two (2), three (3) or six (6) months as the term of each
Interest Period available hereunder for the Revolving Credit or the
Term Loan. The Revolving Credit shall, subject to the terms hereof,
be carried in a single Interest Period for the balance outstanding
from time to time hereunder. The Company may have in effect at any
one time no more than two (2) Interest Periods for the balance
outstanding under the Term Notes. Notwithstanding any provision
hereof to the contrary, Company shall be required to select
Interest Periods for a sufficient portion of the Term Loan so that
at least one (1) Interest Period shall end on the last day of each
calendar quarter while the Term Loan is outstanding (including
without limitation, the scheduled maturity date of the Term Loan),
thereby permitting the Company to make its required principal
payments under Section 3.2 hereof. In the event Company shall fail
to timely exercise its option in accordance with this Section 4.3,
the next Interest Period shall be fixed by the Agent for the same
period as the Interest Period then ending, or for the period to the
next principal installment due date, or, if applicable, the
Revolving Credit Maturity Date, whichever is the shorter period,
provided that Company will indemnify Agent and each of the Banks
against any loss or expense incurred by them (or any of them)
pursuant to Section 5, hereof. Each selection of an Interest Period
for the Revolving Credit or the Term Loan, and the amount and date
of any repayment shall be noted on Agent's records, which records
will be conclusive evidence thereof, absent manifest error.

4.4 Limited Availability. Notwithstanding the Company's
selection of an Interest Period under Section 4.3 hereof, if prior
to the last day of any Interest Period, Agent or the Banks (after
consultation with Agent) shall determine that deposits of Deutsche
Marks will not be available to Agent or the Banks in the amounts
and for the terms necessary to carry the outstanding principal
indebtedness of the Advance subject to such Interest Period for the
next applicable Interest Period, then Agent shall so notify Company
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 36 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

and Company shall immediately select another Interest Period to be
applicable as the next Interest Period.

4.5 Unavailability. If prior to the last day of any
Interest Period, Agent or the Banks (after consultation with Agent)
shall determine that by reason of circumstances affecting the
foreign exchange and interbank markets, generally, or for any of
the reasons set forth in Sections 5.3 or 5.4 hereof, deposits of
Deutsche Marks will not be available to Agent and the Banks as of
the last day of an applicable Interest Period in the amounts
necessary to carry the outstanding principal of the Advances
subject to such ending Interest Period in Deutsche Marks for any
Interest Period, Agent (or, in the case of a DM Bid Advance, the
applicable Bid Lender) shall notify the Company and the Advances
shall then be automatically converted to and carried in Dollars, in
the Dollar Amount of the Indebtedness then outstanding at the
Prime-based Rate, until the first day of the next Interest Period,
if any, selected pursuant to Section 4.6 hereof.

4.6 Reconversion to Deutsche Mark-based Rate on Re-
availability. In the event that, after a conversion of Indebtedness
to Dollars pursuant to Section 4.5 hereof, Agent determines that
Deposits of Deutsche Marks are again available to Agent and/or the
Banks in the amounts necessary to carry the principal Indebtedness
under the Notes in Deutsche Marks for any Interest Period, Agent
(or, in the case of any DM Bid Advance, the applicable Bid Lender)
shall notify Company of the Interest Period(s) for which such
deposits in Deutsche Marks are available and Company shall
immediately select the next Interest Period from among such
available Interest Periods, in accordance with Section 4.3 hereof.

4.7 Repayment or Reconversion. In the event that the
currency in which the Indebtedness is being carried is required to
be changed from Dollars to Deutsche Marks under Section 4.6, as
aforesaid, and if the Deutsche Mark Equivalent of the principal
amount of the Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit and/or the
Term Loan outstanding upon such reconversion shall exceed the
Deutsche Mark Principal Limit, then concurrently with such
reconversion, Company shall pay to Agent in immediately available
funds, for the ratable benefit of the Banks, an amount in Deutsche
Marks sufficient to reduce the then outstanding principal amount of
the Revolving Credit, the aggregate Bid Advances, and/or the Term
Loan to an amount not greater than the applicable Deutsche Mark
Principal Limit for the Revolving Credit and for the Term Loan.

4.8 Interest Payments on Conversions and Reconversions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding Sections,
all accrued and unpaid interest on any Indebtedness converted or
reconverted pursuant to Section 4.5 or 4.6 hereof, or otherwise,
shall be due and payable in full on the date of such conversion or
reconversion.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 37 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

4.9 Interest on Default. In the event and so long as any
Event of Default shall exist under any Note or any Event of Default
shall exist under this Agreement, interest shall be payable daily
on the principal balance of the Indebtedness then outstanding (a)
if the Deutsche Mark-based Rate is then in effect, at a per annum
rate equal to the Applicable Interest Rate plus three percent (3%)
for the remainder of the then-existing Interest Period, if any, and
at all other times (i) at a per annum rate calculated by the Agent,
or, in the case of any Bid Advance, the applicable Bid Lender,
whose determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error, on
a daily basis, equal to three percent (3%) above the interest rate
per annum at which one (1) day (or, if such amount due remains
unpaid for more than three (3) Business Days, then for such other
period of time as the Agent or such Bid Lender, as applicable, may
elect which shall in no event be longer than six (6) months)
deposits in Deutsche Marks in the amount of such overdue payment
due to the Agent are offered by the Agent's or such Bid Lender
Eurocurrency Lending Office for the applicable period determined as
provided above, or (ii) if at any such time such deposits are not
offered by the Agent's or such Bid Lender's Eurocurrency Lending
Office, then at a rate per annum equal to three percent (3%) above
the rate determined by the Agent to be its aggregate marginal cost
(including the cost of maintaining any required reserves or deposit
insurance) of carrying the amount of the Indebtedness then
outstanding, and (b) if the Prime-based Rate is then in effect, at
a per annum rate equal to the Prime-based Rate plus three percent
(3%).

4.10 Prepayment.

(a) Company may, upon four (4) Business Days prior
written notice to Agent, prepay all or any part of the
outstanding balance of the Revolving Credit or the Term Loan
and the entire outstanding balance (but no partial prepayment)
of any Bid Advance without premium or penalty, provided that
(i) if the Deutsche Mark-based Rate is then in effect, any
such prepayment shall be made only on the last day of any
Interest Period, (ii) the amount of any partial prepayment
shall be at least One Million Deutsche Marks (DM 1,000,000),
if the Deutsche Mark-based Rate is then in effect and One
Million Dollars ($1,000,000) if the Prime-based Rate is then
in effect, and (iii) if any such prepayment would otherwise
reduce the principal balance of the Revolving Credit or the
Term Loan, as applicable, to an amount less than Five Million
Deutsche Marks (DM 5,000,000), if the Deutsche Mark-based Rate
is then in effect or One Million Dollars ($1,000,000), if the
Prime-based Rate is then in effect, such prepayment shall
cover the entire remaining balance of the Revolving Credit or
the Term Loan, as applicable.

(b) Any prepayments made in accordance with this
Section on Indebtedness evidenced by the Revolving Credit
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 38 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

Notes or the Bid Notes shall be without prejudice to the right
to reborrow under the Revolving Credit Notes, except that, as
set forth in Section 2.5 hereof, Company shall not be entitled
to any reborrowings of the Revolving Credit during any period
which the Revolving Credit is carried in Dollars and except to
the extent that such payment is made in connection with a
reduction of the Revolving Credit Maximum Amount pursuant to
Section 2.9 hereof.

(c) Any prepayments made in accordance with this
Section on Indebtedness evidenced by the Term Notes (i) shall
be without premium or penalty, but there shall be no
reborrowing of such prepaid amounts and (ii) shall be applied
to the principal installments under the Terms Notes in the
inverse order of their maturities, and shall not affect the
periodic payments of principal required thereunder.

4.11 Special Limitation. In the event, as a result of
increases in the value of Deutsche Marks and/or any of the
Alternative Currencies against the Dollar (taking into account the
Current Dollar Equivalent of the Indebtedness outstanding from time
to time under the Vishay Loan Agreement and the Roederstein Loan
Agreement and any Indebtedness required to be aggregated under 12
USCA 84, as amended, the regulations promulgated thereunder, or
other, similar applicable law) or for any other reason, the
obligation of any of the Banks to advance additional funds
hereunder or under any of the other Loan Agreements is determined
by such Bank to exceed its then applicable legal lending limit
under 12 USCA 84, as amended, and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, or other, similar applicable laws, the amount of
additional funds which such Bank shall be obligated to advance
hereunder shall immediately be reduced to the maximum amount which
such Bank may legally advance (as determined by such Bank) the
obligation of each of the remaining Banks hereunder shall be
proportionately reduced, based on the applicable Percentages, and,
to the extent necessary under such laws and regulations (as
determined by each of the Banks, with respect to the applicability
of such laws and regulations to itself), the Company shall reduce,
or cause to be reduced, complying to the extent practicable with
the remaining provisions hereof, the Indebtedness outstanding
hereunder or under any of the other Loan Agreements by an amount
sufficient to comply with such maximum amounts. Upon any such
reduction in the obligations of the Banks under this Section 4.11,
Company shall have the right, subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement (but subsequent to Company's compliance with its
obligation to reduce the Indebtedness outstanding hereunder), to
add to the Banks providing financing hereunder a bank reasonably
acceptable to the Agent for the purpose of restoring the shortfall
created by the reduction in such obligations of the Banks.

5. CHANGES IN LAW OR CIRCUMSTANCES; INCREASED COSTS;
MARGIN ADJUSTMENTS

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 39 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

5.1 Reimbursement of Prepayment Costs. If any prepayment of
the Indebtedness shall occur on any day other than the last day of
an Interest Period (whether pursuant to this Agreement or by
acceleration, or otherwise), or if an Applicable Interest Rate
shall be changed during any Interest Period pursuant to this
Agreement, or if, after requesting an Advance or the conversion of
outstanding Indebtedness hereunder, but prior to the Advance or
conversion thereof, as the case may be, the Company is no longer
entitled to the Advance or conversion requested hereunder, Company
shall reimburse Banks on demand for any costs incurred by Banks as
a result of the timing thereof, including but not limited to any
net costs incurred in liquidating or employing deposits from third
parties. Each Bank demanding reimbursement under this Section 5.1
shall deliver to Company a certificate setting forth the basis for
determining such costs, which certificate shall be conclusively
presumed correct save for manifest error.

5.2 Agent's Eurocurrency Lending Office. Agent and each of
the Banks shall have the option of maintaining and carrying the
Indebtedness on the books of its applicable Eurocurrency Lending
Office.

5.3 Availability. The Agent and the Banks shall not be
required to fund any Advance in Deutsche Marks if, at any time
prior to the Advance or funding, the Agent or the Banks (after
consultation with the Agent) shall determine, in their sole
discretion, that (i) deposits in Deutsche Marks, in the amounts and
maturities required to fund such Advances will not be available to
the Agent and the Banks; (ii) a fundamental change has occurred in
the foreign exchange or interbank markets with respect to Deutsche
Marks (including, without limitation, changes in national or
international financial, political or economic conditions or
currency exchange rates or exchange controls); or (iii) it has
become otherwise materially impractical for the Agent to make such
advance in Deutsche Marks. The Agent shall promptly notify the
Company and Banks of any such determination.

5.4 Laws Affecting Availability. If, after the date hereof,
the introduction of, or any change in, any applicable law, rule or
regulation or in the interpretation or administration thereof by
any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any of the Banks (or any
of their respective Eurocurrency Lending Offices) with any request
or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any of the
Banks (or any of their respective Eurocurrency Lending Offices) to
maintain the Indebtedness or any portion thereof with interest at
the Deutsche Mark-based Rate or in Deutsche Marks, such Bank shall
forthwith give notice thereof to Company and to Agent. Thereafter,
if any of the Banks may not lawfully continue to maintain the
Indebtedness hereunder or any portion thereof to the end of the
then current Interest Period applicable thereto at the Deutsche
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 40 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

Mark based-Rate or in Deutsche Marks, the Indebtedness outstanding
shall immediately be converted in the manner set forth under
Section 4.5 hereof. For purposes of this Section, a change in law,
rule, regulation, interpretation or administration shall include,
without limitation, any change made or which becomes effective on
the basis of a law, rule, regulation, interpretation or
administration presently in force, the effective date of which
change is delayed by the terms of such law, rule, regulation,
interpretation or administration.

5.5 Increased Cost of Deutsche Marks. If the adoption after
the date hereof, or any change after the date hereof in, any
applicable law, rule or regulation of any governmental authority,
central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation
or administration thereof, or compliance by Agent or any of the
Banks (or any of their respective Eurocurrency Lending Offices)
with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) made by any such authority, central bank or comparable agency
after the date hereof:

(a) shall subject any of the Banks (or any of their
respective Eurocurrency Lending Offices) to any tax, duty or other
charge with respect to the Indebtedness hereunder, or any portion
thereof, or shall change the basis of taxation of payments to any
of the Banks (or any of their respective Eurocurrency Lending
Offices) of the principal of or interest on the Indebtedness
hereunder, or any portion thereof, or any other amounts due under
this Agreement in respect thereof (except for changes in the rate
of tax on the overall net income of any of the Banks or any of
their respective Eurocurrency Lending Offices imposed by the
jurisdiction in which such Bank's principal executive office or
Eurocurrency Lending Office is located); or

(b) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any
reserve (including, without limitation, any imposed by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System), special deposit or
similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the
account of, or credit extended by any of the Banks (or any of their
respective Eurocurrency Lending Offices) or shall impose on any of
the Banks (or any of their respective Eurocurrency Lending Offices)
or the foreign exchange and interbank markets any other condition
affecting the Indebtedness hereunder, or any portion thereof;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the costs to
any of the Banks of maintaining any part of the Indebtedness
hereunder at the Deutsche Mark-based Rate or in Deutsche Marks or
to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by any of
the Banks under this Agreement, then such Bank shall promptly
notify Agent (or in the case of a Bid Advance, shall notify Company
directly, with a copy of such notice to Agent), and Agent (or such
Bank, as aforesaid) shall promptly notify Company of such fact and
demand compensation therefor and, within fifteen (15) days after
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 41 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

such notice by Agent, Company agrees to pay to such Bank such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank or Banks
for such increased cost or reduction. Agent will promptly notify
Company of any event of which it has knowledge which will entitle
Banks to compensation pursuant to this Section, or which will cause
the Company to incur additional liability under Section 6.1(e)
hereof, provided that Agent shall incur no liability whatsoever to
the Banks or Company in the event it fails to do so. A certificate
of Agent (or such Bank, if applicable) setting forth the basis for
determining such additional amount or amounts necessary to
compensate such Bank or Banks shall be conclusively presumed to be
correct save for manifest error. For purposes of this Section, a
change in law, rule, regulation, interpretation, administration,
request or directive shall include, without limitation, any change
made or which becomes effective on the basis of a law, rule,
regulation, interpretation, administration, request or directive
presently in force, the effective date of which change is delayed
by the terms of such law, rule, regulation, interpretation,
administration, request or directive.

5.6 Indemnity. The Company will indemnify Agent and each of
the Banks against any loss or expense which may arise or be
attributable to the Agent's and each Bank's obtaining, liquidating
or employing deposits or other funds acquired to effect, fund or
maintain the Indebtedness hereunder, or any portion thereof, (a) as
a consequence of any failure by the Company to make any payment
when due of any amount due hereunder, (b) due to any failure of the
Company to specify an Interest Period or (c) due to any payment or
prepayment of the Indebtedness or any portion thereof (unless the
Prime-based rate is then in effect) on a date other than the last
day of the Interest Period. Such loss or expense shall be
calculated based upon the present value, as applicable, of payments
due from the Company with respect to the deposits obtained by the
Agent or any of the Banks in order to fund the Indebtedness or any
portion thereof. The Agent's and each Bank's (as applicable)
calculations of any such loss or expense shall be furnished to the
Company and shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

5.7 Judgment Currency. The obligation of the Company to
make payments of the principal of and interest on the Notes and any
other amounts payable hereunder in the currency specified for such
payment herein or in the Notes shall not be discharged or satisfied
by any tender, or any recovery pursuant to any judgment, which is
expressed in or converted into any other currency, except to the
extent that such tender or recovery shall result in the actual
receipt by each of the Banks of the full amount of such currency
expressed to be payable herein or in the Notes. The Agent (or the
applicable Bank, in the case of a Bid Advance) shall, using all
amounts obtained or received from the Company pursuant to such
tender or recovery in payment of principal of and interest on the
Notes, promptly purchase the specified currency, as aforesaid, at
the most favorable spot exchange rate determined by the Agent to be
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 42 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

available to it. The obligation of the Company to make payments in
the specified currency shall be enforceable as an alternative or
additional cause of action solely for the purpose of recovering the
amount, if any, by which such actual receipt shall fall short of
the full amount of the currency expressed to be payable herein or
in the Notes.

5.8 Other Increased Costs. In the event that at any time
after the date of this Agreement any change in law such as
described in Section 5.5 hereof, shall, in the opinion of the Agent
or any of the Banks (as certified to Agent in writing by such Bank)
require that the Revolving Credit or any other Indebtedness or
commitment under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Agreements
be treated as an asset or otherwise be included for purposes of
calculating the appropriate amount of capital to be maintained by
each of the Banks or any corporation controlling such Banks, as the
case may be, the Agent shall notify the Company. The Company and
the Agent shall thereafter negotiate in good faith an agreement to
increase the Revolving Credit Commitment Fee or other fees payable
to the Agent, for the benefit of the Banks under this Agreement,
which in the opinion of the Agent, will adequately compensate the
Banks for the costs associated with such change in law. If such
increase is approved in writing by the Company within thirty (30)
days from the date of the notice to the Company from the Agent, the
Revolving Credit Commitment Fee or other fees (if applicable)
payable by the Company under this Agreement shall, effective from
the date of such agreement, include the amount of such agreed
increase. If the Company and the Agent are unable to agree on such
an increase within thirty (30) days from the date of the notice to
the Company, the Company shall have the option, exercised by
written notice to the Agent within forty-five (45) days from the
date of the aforesaid notice to the Company from the Agent, to
terminate the Revolving Credit or other commitments if applicable,
in which event, all sums then outstanding to Banks and to Agent
hereunder shall be due and payable in full. If (a) the Company and
the Agent fail to agree on an increase in the Revolving Credit
Commitment Fee or other fees (if applicable), or (b) the Company
fails to give timely notice that it has elected to exercise its
option to terminate the Revolving Credit or other commitments, if
applicable, as set forth above, then the Revolving Credit and such
other commitments hereunder shall automatically terminate as of the
last day of the aforesaid forty-five (45) day period, in which
event all sums then outstanding to Banks and to Agent hereunder
shall be due and payable in full.

5.9 Margin Adjustments. Adjustments to the Applicable
Margin, based on Schedule 5.9, shall be implemented as follows:

(i) Such margin adjustments shall be given
prospective effect only, effective (A) as to all Prime-based
Advances outstanding hereunder, immediately upon required date
of delivery of the financial statements required to be
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 43 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

delivered under Section 7.3(b) and 7.3(c) of the Vishay Loan
Agreement establishing applicability of the appropriate
adjustments, if any, or on the obtaining and/or any change in
the Rating Level then in effect, as applicable and (B) as to
each DM-based Advance outstanding hereunder, effective upon
the expiration of the applicable Interest Period(s), if any,
in effect on (x) the required date of delivery of the latest
of such financial statements required to be delivered
hereunder during such Interest Period(s) or (y) the date of
the obtaining and/or any change in the Rating Level in effect
hereunder, as applicable, in each case with no retroactivity
or claw-back.

(ii) With respect to DM-based Advances outstanding
hereunder, an adjustment hereunder, after becoming effective,
shall remain in effect only through the end of the applicable
Interest Period(s) for such DM-based Advances if any;
provided, however, that upon the delivery of quarterly
financial statements demonstrating any change in the Leverage
Ratio or the obtaining and/or change in the Rating Level then
in effect, as aforesaid, or the occurrence of any other event
which under the terms hereof causes such adjustment no longer
to be applicable, then any such subsequent adjustment or no
adjustment, as the case may be, shall be effective (and said
pricing shall thereby be adjusted up or down, as applicable),
with the commencement of each Interest Period following such
change or event, all in accordance with the preceding
subparagraph.

5.10 HLT Determination. In the event at any time (whether
before or after the funding of the Acquisition Loans) of an HLT
Determination, the Agent, the Banks and the Company shall commence
negotiations in good faith to agree upon whether and, if so, the
extent to which fees, interest rates and/or margins hereunder
should be increased so as to reflect such HLT Determination and to
compensate the Banks and Agent for additional costs, expenses
and/or fees which result from or are associated with any such HLT
Determination, including without limitation any costs resulting
from any requirement that additional capital be allocated to the
Indebtedness, or any portion thereof. If Company and the Majority
Banks agree that fees, interest rates and/or margins should be
increased, and agree on the amount of such increase or increases,
this Agreement may be amended to give effect to such increase or
increases as provided in Section 13.11 hereof. If Company and
Majority Banks fail to agree on whether and, if so, the extent to
which fees, interest rates and/or margins hereunder should be
increased within 60 days after notice to Company of an HLT
Determination as herein provided, then (i) the Agent shall, if
requested by the Majority Banks, by written notice to the Company
terminate the commitments of the Banks to fund and/or maintain
Advances of the Revolving Credit hereunder and under the Vishay
Loan Agreement, and if still outstanding, any commitment to fund
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 44 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

Advances of the Acquisition Loans, and such commitments shall
thereupon terminate, (ii) Company shall be obligated to repay all
outstanding Indebtedness at the end of the Interest Period
applicable thereto and (iii) the Company may, at its option, on at
least ten Business Days' written notice to the Agent (which shall
promptly notify the Banks thereof) prepay all Indebtedness
outstanding hereunder and under the other Loan Agreements by paying
the aggregate principal amount thereof, together, with all accrued
interest thereon to the date of prepayment; provided that, if the
Company prepays any fixed rate loans or Advances carried at the
Absolute Rate or the Deutsche Mark-based Rate, or any comparable
rate, pursuant to this Section 5.10, Company shall compensate the
Banks for any resulting funding losses as provided in Section 5.1
hereof. Subject to compliance by Company with this Section 5.10,
the Banks acknowledge that an HLT Determination shall not
constitute a Default or an Event of Default hereunder.

6. PAYMENTS, RECOVERIES AND COLLECTIONS

6.1 Payment Procedure.

(a) All payments by Company of principal of, or
interest on, the Revolving Credit Notes, the Term Notes, or of
any fees or other amount due hereunder, shall be made without
setoff or counterclaim on the date specified for payment under
this Agreement and shall be made in Deutsche Marks in
immediately available funds for the account of Agent's
Eurocurrency Lending Office, at the Agent's Correspondent, for
the ratable account of the Banks, not later than 11:00 a.m.
(local time of the Agent's Correspondent); provided however
that subsequent to any conversion of the Indebtedness
hereunder from Deutsche Marks to Dollars pursuant to Section
4.5 hereof, such payments shall be made not later than 11:00
a.m. (Detroit time) in Dollars in immediately available funds
to Agent, for the ratable account of the Banks, at Agent's
office located at 100 Renaissance Center, Detroit, Michigan
48243 until reconversion of the Indebtedness hereunder from
Dollar to Deutsche Marks pursuant to Section 4.6 hereof. Upon
receipt of each such payment, the Agent shall make prompt
payment to each Bank, or such Bank's Eurocurrency Lending
Office (as directed by such Bank), in like funds and
currencies, of all amounts received by it for the account of
such Bank.

(b) Unless the Agent shall have been notified by
the Company prior to the date on which any payment to be made
by the Company is due that the Company does not intend to
remit such payment, the Agent may, in its discretion, assume
that the Company has remitted such payment when so due and the
Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to
each Bank on such payment date an amount equal to such Bank's
share of such assumed payment. If the Company has not in fact
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 45 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

remitted such payment to the Agent, each Bank shall forthwith
on demand repay to the Agent in the applicable currency the
amount of such assumed payment made available to such Bank,
together with the interest thereon, in respect of each day
from and including the date such amount was made available by
the Agent to such Bank to the date such amount is repaid to
the Agent at a rate per annum equal to Agent's aggregate
marginal cost (including the cost of maintaining any required
reserves or deposit insurance and of any fees penalties,
overdraft charges or other costs or expenses incurred by
Agent) of carrying such amount, unless the Indebtedness has
been converted to Dollars hereunder, in which case said rate
shall be the federal funds rate (daily average), as the same
may vary from time to time.

(c) Whenever any payment of principal of, or
interest on, the Indebtedness hereunder shall be due on a day
which is not a Business Day the date of payment thereof shall
be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, unless as a
result thereof it would fall in the next calendar month, in
which case it shall be shortened to the next preceding
Business Day and, in the case of a payment of principal,
interest thereon shall be payable for such extended or
shortened time, if any, provided that if the Indebtedness
hereunder is then being carried in Dollars, whenever any
payment to be made hereunder shall otherwise be due on a day
which is not a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the
next succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall
be included in computing interest, if any, in connection with
such payment.

(d) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement
or the other Loan Documents (and subject to the terms and
conditions thereof), all payment by Company of principal of or
interest on the Bid Notes shall be made to the applicable Bid
Lender in Deutsche Marks (unless the Prime-based Rate is then
in effect, in which case payments shall be made in Dollars)
without setoff or counterclaim on the dates and other terms
provided in such Notes.

(e) All payments to be made by the Company under
this Agreement or any of the Notes (including without
limitation, payments under the Bid Notes) shall be made
without set-off or counterclaim, as aforesaid, and without
deduction for or on account of any present or future
withholding or other taxes of any nature imposed by any
governmental authority or of any political subdivision thereof
or any federation or organization of which such governmental
authority may at the time of payment be a member, unless
Company is compelled by law to make payment subject to such
tax. In such event the Company shall:

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 46 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

(i) pay to the Agent for Agent's own account
and/or for the account of the Banks (and in
the case of Bid Advances, pay to the
applicable Bank which funded such Advances)
such additional amounts as may be necessary to
ensure that the Agent and/or such Bank or
Banks receive a net amount in Deutsche Marks
or Dollars, as the case may be, equal to the
full amount which would have been receivable
had payment not been made subject to such tax;
and

(ii) remit such tax to the relevant taxing
authorities according to applicable law, and
send to the Agent or the applicable Bid
Lender, as the case may be, such certificates
or certified copy receipts as the Agent or
such Bid Lender shall reasonably require as
proof of the payment by the Company of any
such taxes payable by the Company.

As used herein, the terms "tax", "taxes" and "taxation"
include all existing taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees,
deductions and withholdings and any restrictions or conditions
resulting in a charge together with interest thereon and fines and
penalties with respect thereto which may be imposed by reason of
any violation or default with respect to the law regarding such
tax, assessed as a result of or in connection with the transactions
in Deutsche Marks hereunder, or the payment and or receipt of funds
in Deutsche Marks or the payment or delivery of funds into or out
of any jurisdiction other than the United States (whether assessed
against Company, Agent or any of the Banks).

6.2 Application of Proceeds. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance an Event of Default, any offsets or voluntary payments
by the Company, or others and any other sums received or collected
in respect of the Indebtedness, shall be applied, first, to the
Notes pro rata, based on the aggregate Indebtedness then
outstanding thereunder (or in such other order and manner as
determined by all of the Banks), next, to any other Indebtedness on
a pro rata basis (as aforesaid), and then, if there is any excess,
to the Company.

6.3 Pro-rata Recovery. If any Bank shall obtain any payment
or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application
of offset or otherwise) on account of principal of, or interest on,
any of the Revolving Credit Notes or Term Notes in excess of its
pro rata share of payments then or thereafter obtained by all Banks
upon principal of and interest on all such Notes, such Bank shall
purchase from the other Banks such participations in the Revolving
Credit Notes and Term Notes held by them as shall be necessary to
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 47 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess payment or other
recovery ratably in accordance with the Percentage with each of
them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of the excess
payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from such
purchasing holder, the purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase
price restored to the extent of such recovery, but without
interest.

6.4 Deposits and Accounts. In addition to and not in
limitation of any rights of any Bank or other holder of any Note
under applicable law, each Bank and each other such holder shall,
upon acceleration of the Indebtedness under the Notes and without
notice or demand of any kind, have the right to appropriate and
apply to the payment of the Notes owing to it (whether or not then
due) any and all balances, credits, deposits, accounts or moneys of
Company then or thereafter with such Bank or other holder;
provided, however, that any such amount so applied by any Bank or
other holder on any of the Notes owing to it shall be subject to
the provisions of Section 6.3.

commitments to lend hereunder immediately and automatically
terminated; (x) the Agent shall, at the direction of the Majority
Banks, declare the entire unpaid principal Indebtedness, including
the Notes, immediately due and payable, without presentment, notice
or demand, all of which are hereby expressly waived by Company; (y)
upon occurrence of any Event of Default specified in subsection
11.1(h), above, and notwithstanding the lack of any declaration by

principal Indebtedness, including the Notes, shall become
automatically due and payable unless such acceleration is delayed
or waived by the Agent at the direction of the Banks; and (z) the
Agent shall, if directed to do so by the Majority Banks or the
Banks, as applicable (subject to the terms hereof), exercise any
remedy permitted by this Agreement, the Loan Documents or law.

11.3 Rights Cumulative. No delay or failure of Agent and/or
Banks in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
affect such right, power or privilege, nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any further exercise thereof, or
the exercise of any other power, right or privilege. The rights of
Banks under this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive of any
right or remedies which Banks would otherwise have.

11.4 Waiver by Company of Certain Laws. To the extent
permitted by applicable law, Company hereby agrees to waive, and
does hereby absolutely and irrevocably waive and relinquish the
benefit and advantage of any marshalling, valuation, stay,
appraisement, extension or redemption laws now existing or which
may hereafter exist, which, but for this provision, might be
applicable to any sale made under the judgment, order or decree of
any court, on any claim for interest on the Notes, and further
hereby irrevocably agrees to waive the right to trial by jury with
respect to any and all actions or proceedings in which Agent or the
Banks (or any of them), on one hand, and the Company or any of the
Permitted Borrowers, on the other hand, are parties, whether or not
such actions or proceedings arise out of this Agreement or the Loan
Documents, or otherwise. These waivers have been voluntarily given,
with full knowledge of the consequences thereof.

11.5 Waiver of Defaults. No Event of Default shall be waived
by the Banks except in a writing signed by an officer of the Agent
in accordance with Section 13.11 hereof. No single or partial
exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder, nor any delay
in the exercise thereof, shall preclude other or further exercise
of the Banks' rights by Agent. No waiver of any Default or Event of
Default shall extend to any other or further Default or Event of
Default. No forbearance on the part of the Agent or any Bank in
enforcing any of the Banks' rights shall constitute a waiver of any
of their rights. Company expressly agrees that this Section may not
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 52 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

be waived or modified by the Banks or Agent by course of
performance, estoppel or otherwise.

11.6 Cross-Default. In addition to the other Events of
Default specified herein, any failure to perform and discharge when
due, after allowance for any applicable cure period, any of the
obligations, covenants and agreements required to be performed
under the provisions of any instruments evidencing or securing any
other present and future borrowings of Company from the Banks (or
from Agent) in renewal or extension of, or related to this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, shall be an Event of
Default under the provisions of this Agreement entitling Agent,
with the consent of the Majority Banks, (without notice or any cure
period except as expressly provided herein or therein) to exercise
any and all rights and remedies provided hereby. Any Event of
Default under this Agreement or under any of the other Loan
Documents shall also constitute a default under all other
instruments securing this or any other present or future
borrowings, or any agreements in relation thereto, entitling Agent
and the Banks to exercise any and all rights and remedies provided
therein.

12. AGENT

12.1 Appointment of Agent. Each Bank and the holder of each
Note appoints and authorizes Agent to act on behalf of such Bank or
holder under the Loan Documents and to exercise such powers
hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to or
required of Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with
such powers as may be reasonably incidental thereto. Each Bank
agrees (which agreement shall survive any termination of this
Agreement) to reimburse Agent for all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses (including in-house and outside attorneys' fees) incurred
by Agent hereunder or in connection herewith or with any Default or
Event of Default or in enforcing the obligations of Company under
this Agreement or the Loan Documents or any other instrument
executed pursuant hereto, and for which Agent is not reimbursed by
Company, pro rata according to such Bank's Percentage. Agent shall
not be required to take any action under the Loan Documents, or to
prosecute or defend any suit in respect of the Loan Documents,
unless indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against loss,
costs, liability and expense. If any indemnity furnished to Agent
shall become impaired, it may call for additional indemnity and
cease to do the acts indemnified against until such additional
indemnity is given.

12.2 Deposit Account with Agent. Company hereby authorizes
Agent to charge its general deposit account, if any, maintained
with Agent for the amount of any principal, interest, or other
amounts or costs due under this Agreement when the same becomes due
and payable under the terms of this Agreement the Revolving Credit
Notes or Term Notes, or any Bid Notes payable to Agent.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 53 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

12.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Agent agrees to exercise its
rights and powers, and to perform its duties, as Agent hereunder
and under the Loan Documents in accordance with its usual customs
and practices in bank-agency transactions, but only upon and
subject to the express terms and conditions of Section 12, hereof,
(and no implied covenants or other obligations shall be read into
this Agreement against the Agent); neither Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable to any
Bank for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them
under this Agreement or any document executed pursuant hereto, or
in connection herewith or therewith, except for its or their own
willful misconduct or gross negligence, nor be responsible to any
Bank for any recitals or warranties herein or therein made by any
other Person, nor for the effectiveness, enforceability, validity
or due execution (other than its own due execution and delivery) of
this Agreement or any document executed pursuant hereto, or any
security thereunder, nor to make any inquiry respecting the
performance by Company or any of its Subsidiaries of its
obligations hereunder or thereunder. Nor shall Agent have, or be
deemed to have, a fiduciary relationship with any Bank by reason of
this Agreement. Agent shall be entitled to rely upon advice of
counsel concerning legal matters and upon any notice, consent,
certificate, statement or writing which it believes to be genuine
and to have been presented by a proper person.

12.4 Successor Agents. Agent may resign as such at any time
upon at least thirty (30) days prior notice to Company and all
Banks. If Agent at any time shall resign or if the office of Agent
shall become vacant for any other reason, Majority Banks shall, by
written instrument, appoint a successor Agent (satisfactory to such
Majority Banks) which shall thereupon become Agent hereunder and
shall be entitled to receive from the prior Agent such documents of
transfer and assignment as such successor Agent may reasonably
request. Such successor Agent shall succeed to all of the rights
and obligations of the retiring Agent as if originally named. The
retiring or removed Agent shall duly assign, transfer and deliver
to such successor Agent all moneys at the time held by the retiring
or removed Agent hereunder after deducting therefrom its expenses
for which it is entitled to be reimbursed. Upon such succession of
any such successor Agent, the retiring agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations hereunder, except for its gross
negligence or willful misconduct arising prior to its retirement
hereunder, and the provisions of this Section 12 shall continue in
effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by it while it was acting as Agent.

12.5 Loans by Agent. Agent shall have the same rights and
powers with respect to the credit extended by it and the Notes held
by it as any Bank and may exercise the same as if it were not
Agent, and the term "Bank" and, when appropriate, "holder" shall
include Agent in its individual capacity.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 54 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

12.6 Credit Decisions. Each Bank acknowledges that it has,
independently of Agent and each other Bank and based on financial
statements and such other documents, information and investigations
as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit decision to
extend credit hereunder from time to time. Each Bank also
acknowledges that it will, independently of Agent and each other
Bank and based on such other documents, information and
investigations as it shall deem appropriate at any time, continue
to make its own credit decisions as to exercising or not exercising
from time to time any rights and privileges available to it under
this Agreement or any document executed pursuant hereto.

12.7 Notices by Agent. Agent shall give prompt notice to
each Bank of its receipt of each notice or request required or
permitted to be given to Agent by Company pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement and shall promptly distribute to the Banks and
reports required from the Company or its Subsidiaries under the
terms hereof received by Agent, in its capacity as Agent.

12.8 Agent's Fees. Commencing on September 30, 1994, and on
each succeeding anniversary date thereof until the Indebtedness has
been repaid, the Company shall cause Vishay to pay to Agent, in
Dollars, an annual agency fee set forth (or to be set forth from
time to time) in a letter agreement between Vishay and Agent. The
Agent's Fees described in this Section are not refundable under any
circumstances.

12.9 Nature of Agency. The appointment of Agent as agent is
for the convenience of Banks and Company in making advances of the
Revolving Credit or the Term Loan and other Indebtedness hereunder,
and collecting fees and principal and interest on the Indebtedness
hereunder. No Bank is purchasing any Indebtedness from Agent and
this Agreement is not intended to be a purchase or participation
agreement.

12.10 Actions; Confirmation of Agent's Authority to Act in
Event of Default. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and to the
direction of the Majority Banks, Agent is hereby expressly
authorized to act in all litigation and in all other respects as
the representative of the Banks where Agent considers it to be
necessary or desirable in order to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or the Loan Documents. Without necessarily accepting
service of process or designating Agent to do so in its stead, each
Bank hereby agrees with each other Bank and with Agent, without
intending to confer or conferring any rights on any other party,
(i) that it shall be bound by any litigation brought by or against
Agent by the Company, any Subsidiary or any other party in
connection with the Indebtedness hereunder or any other rights,
duties or obligations arising hereunder or under this Agreement or
the Loan Documents and (ii) that it now irrevocably waives the
defense of procedural impediment or failure to name or join such
Bank as an indispensable party; provided however that each Bank
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 55 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to intervene or
otherwise appear in such litigation, and to retain its own counsel
in connection therewith. In conducting such litigation hereunder on
behalf of the Banks, Agent shall, subject to the terms hereof,
accept the direction of the Majority Banks or all of the Banks, as
the case may be, and shall at all times be indemnified by the Banks
as provided in Sections 12.1 and 12.12 hereof. Agent shall
undertake to give each Bank prompt notice of any litigation
commenced against Agent and/or the Banks with respect to this
Agreement, the Loan Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any
matter referred to herein or therein.

12.11 Authority of Agent to Enforce Notes and This Agreement.
Each Bank, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
including without limitation Sections 12.10, 12.14 and 12.15
hereof, authorizes the Agent with full power and authority as
attorney-in-fact to institute and maintain actions, suits or
proceedings for the collection and enforcement of the Notes and to
file such proofs of debt or other documents as may be necessary to
have the claims of the Banks allowed in any proceeding relative to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or its creditors or
affecting its properties, and to take such other actions which
Agent considers to be necessary or desirable for the protection,
collection and enforcement of the Notes, this Agreement or the Loan
Documents. 

12.12 Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify the Agent
in its capacity as such, to the extent not reimbursed by the
Company, pro rata according to their respective Percentages, from
and against any and all claims, liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in any way relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents or any action taken or omitted to be taken or suffered in
good faith by the Agent hereunder, provided that no Bank shall be
liable for any portion of any of the foregoing items resulting from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or any of
its officers, employees, directors or agents.

12.13 Knowledge of Default. It is expressly understood and
agreed that the Agent shall be entitled to assume that no default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, unless the
officers of the Agent immediately responsible for matters
concerning this Agreement shall have actual (rather than
constructive) knowledge of such occurrence or shall have been
notified in writing by a Bank that such Bank considers that a
default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and
specifying the nature thereof. Upon obtaining actual knowledge of
any default or Event of Default as described above, the Agent shall
promptly, but in any event within three (3) Business Days after
obtaining knowledge thereof, notify each Bank of such default or
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 56 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

Event of Default and the action, if any, the Agent proposes be
taken with respect thereto.

12.14 Agent's Authorization; Action by Banks. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, whenever the Agent is
authorized and empowered hereunder on behalf of the Banks to give
any approval or consent, or to make any request, or to take any
other action on behalf of the Banks (including without limitation
the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under the other
Loan Documents), the Agent shall be required (but only to the
extent otherwise required hereunder) to give such approval or
consent, or to make such request or to take such other action only
when so requested in writing by the Majority Banks or the Banks, as
applicable hereunder. Action that may be taken by Majority Banks or
all of the Banks, as the case may be (as provided for hereunder)
may be taken (i) pursuant to a vote at a meeting (which may be held
by telephone conference call) as to which all of the Banks have
been given reasonable advance notice, or (ii) pursuant to the
written consent of the requisite Percentages of the Banks as
required hereunder, provided that all of the Banks are given
reasonable advance notice of the requests for such consent.

12.15 Enforcement Actions by the Agent. Except as otherwise
expressly provided under this Agreement or in any of the other Loan
Documents and subject to the terms hereof, Agent will take such
action, assert such rights and pursue such remedies under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents as the Majority Banks or all
of the Banks, as the case may be (as provided for hereunder), shall
direct. Except as otherwise expressly provided in any of the Loan
Documents, Agent will not (and will not be obligated to) take any
action, assert any rights or pursue any remedies under this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in violation or
contravention of any express direction or instruction of the
Majority Banks or all of the Banks, as the case may be (as provided
for hereunder). Agent may refuse (and will not be obligated) to
take any action, assert any rights or pursue any remedies under
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in the absence of
the express written direction and instruction of the Majority Banks
or all of the Banks, as the case may be (as provided for
hereunder). In the event Agent fails, within a commercially
reasonable time, to take such action, assert such rights, or pursue
such remedies as the Majority Banks or all of the Banks, as the
case may be (as provided for hereunder), shall direct in conformity
with this Agreement, the Majority Banks or all of the Banks, as the
case may be (as provided for hereunder), shall have the right to
take such action, to assert such rights, or pursue such remedies on
behalf of all of the Banks unless the terms hereof otherwise
require the consent of all the Banks to the taking of such actions
(in which event all of the Banks must join in such action). Except
as expressly provided above or elsewhere in this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents, no Bank (other than the Agent, acting in its
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 57 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

capacity as Agent) shall be entitled to take any enforcement action
of any kind under any of the Loan Documents.

12.16 Co-Agents and Lead Managers. NationsBank has been
designated by the Company as "Co-Agent" and BHF and Signet have
been designated by the Company as "Lead Managers" under this
Agreement. Other than its rights and remedies as a Bank hereunder,
each such Co-Agent and Lead Manager shall have no administrative,
collateral or other rights or responsibilities, provided, however,
that each such Co-Agent and Lead Manager shall be entitled to the
benefits afforded to Agent under Sections 12.5 and 12.6 hereof.

13. MISCELLANEOUS

13.1 Accounting Principles. Where the character or amount of
any asset or liability or item of income or expense is required to
be determined or any consolidation or other accounting computation
is required to be made for the purposes of this Agreement, it shall
be done in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied.

13.2 Consent to Jurisdiction. Company hereby irrevocably
submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any United States
Federal or Michigan state court sitting in Detroit in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of
the Loan Documents and Company hereby irrevocably agrees that all
claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in any such United States Federal or Michigan state
court. Company irrevocably consents to the service of any and all
process in any such action or proceeding brought in any court in or
of the state of Michigan by the delivery of copies of such process
to Company at its address specified on the signature page hereto or
by certified mail directed to such address. Nothing in this Section
shall affect the right of the Banks and the Agent to serve process
in any other manner permitted by law or limit the right of the
Banks or the Agent (or any of them) to bring any such action or
proceeding against the Company or any of its or their property in
the courts of any other jurisdiction. The Company hereby
irrevocably waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such
suit or proceeding in the above described courts.

13.3 Law of Michigan. This Agreement, and the other Loan
Documents have been delivered at Detroit, Michigan, U.S.A., and
shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with
the laws of the State of Michigan, except as and to the extent
expressed to the contrary in any of the Loan Documents. Whenever
possible each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in
such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but
if any provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 58 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining
provisions of this Agreement.

13.4 Interest. In the event the obligation of the Company to
pay interest on the principal balance of the Notes is or becomes in
excess of the maximum interest rate which the Company is permitted
by law to contract or agree to pay, giving due consideration to the
execution date of this Agreement, then, in that event, the rate of
interest applicable with respect to such Bank's Percentage shall be
deemed to be immediately reduced to such maximum rate and all
previous payments in excess of the maximum rate shall be deemed to
have been payments in reduction of principal and not of interest.

13.5 Closing Costs; Other Costs and Expenses. Company shall
pay or reimburse Agent for payment of, on demand (a) all closing
costs and expenses, including, by way of description and not
limitation, house and outside attorney fees and advances, appraisal
and accounting fees, title and lien search fees, and required
travel costs, incurred by Agent in connection with the commitment,
consummation and closing of the loans contemplated hereby, or in
connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the loans or
advances provided under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents,
or any amendment thereof requested by Company; and (b) all stamp
and other taxes and fees payable or determined to be payable in
connection with the execution, delivery, filing or recording of
this Agreement and the Loan Documents and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and any and all liabilities with
respect to or resulting from any delay in paying or omitting to pay
such taxes or fees. Furthermore, all reasonable costs and expenses,
including without limitation attorney fees, and costs and expenses
to Environmental Auditors retained by Agent hereunder, incurred by
Agent in revising, preserving, protecting, exercising or enforcing
any of its or any of the Banks' rights against Company, or
otherwise incurred by Agent and the Banks (using a single law firm
retained by Agent, with the approval of the Majority Banks) in
connection with any Event of Default or the enforcement of the
loans (whether incurred through negotiations, legal proceedings or
otherwise), including by way of description and not limitation,
such charges in any court or bankruptcy proceedings or arising out
of any claim or action by any person against Agent or any Bank
which would not have been asserted were it not for Agent's or such
Bank's relationship with Company hereunder or otherwise, shall also
be paid by Company. All of said amounts required to be paid by
Company hereunder and not paid forthwith upon demand, as aforesaid,
shall bear interest, from the date incurred to the date payment is
received by Agent, at the Prime-based Rate, plus three percent
(3%).

13.6 Notices. Except as otherwise provided herein, all
notices or demand hereunder to the parties hereto shall be
sufficient if made in writing and delivered by messenger or
deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, certified mail, and
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 59 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

addressed to the parties as set forth on the signature pages of
this Agreement.

13.7 Further Action. Company, from time to time, upon
written request of Agent will make, execute, acknowledge and
deliver or cause to be made, executed, acknowledged and delivered,
all such further and additional instruments, and take all such
further action as may be required to carry out the intent and
purpose of this Agreement, and to provide for the Advances under
and payment of the Notes, according to the intent and purpose
herein and therein expressed.

13.8 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of Company and the Banks and
their respective successors and assigns. The foregoing shall not
authorize any assignment by Company of its rights or duties
hereunder, and no such assignment shall be made (or effective)
without the prior written approval of the Banks. Nor may any Bank
sell, assign, transfer, grant participations in, or otherwise
dispose of all or any portion of their respective Notes, or of its
right, title and interest therein or thereto or in or to this
Agreement, except in accordance with and subject to the
requirements set forth in Section 13.8 of the Vishay Loan
Agreement.

13.9 Indulgence. No delay or failure of Agent and the Banks
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall affect
such right, power or privilege nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any further exercise thereof, nor the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights of
Agent and the Banks hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive
of any rights or remedies which Agent and the Banks would otherwise
have.

13.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, and each executed copy shall constitute an original
instrument, but such counterparts shall together constitute but one
and the same instrument.

13.11 Amendment and Waiver. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or any Loan Document, nor consent to
any departure by the Company therefrom, shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the
Majority Banks, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for
which given; provided, however, that no amendment, waiver or
consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the Banks, do
any of the following: (a) increase any commitment of the Banks
hereunder or subject the Banks to any additional obligations, (b)
reduce or forgive the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or
any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (c) postpone any date
fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 60 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (d) waive any Event of
Default specified in Sections 11.1(a) or (b) hereof (provided that
if, at the relevant time, only Bid Advances are outstanding
hereunder or under the Vishay Loan Agreement, the prior written
approval of all Banks shall be required to waive, whether by
consent, waiver or amendment, any Event of Default under this
Agreement), (e) release or defer the granting or perfecting of a
lien or security interest in any collateral or release any guaranty
or similar undertaking provided by any Person, except in each case
as shall be otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any
Loan Document, (f) take any action which requires the signing of
all Banks pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any Loan
Document, (g) change the definition of "Majority Banks" or
"Interest Periods" (h) change the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of the Notes which shall be required for the Banks or any of them
to take any action under this Agreement or any Loan Document, (i)
except for conversions from Deutsche Marks to Dollars under Section
4.5 hereof or reconversions from Dollars to Deutsche Marks under
Section 4.6 hereof, as the case may be, change the currency in
which any Indebtedness hereunder is denominated or (j) change this
Section 13.11, and provided further, however, that no amendment,
waiver, or consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Agent
in addition to all the Banks, affect the rights or duties of the
Agent under this Agreement or any Loan Document.

13.12 Taxes and Fees. Should any tax (other than a tax based
upon the net income of any Bank), recording or filing fee become
payable in respect of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents'
or any amendment, modification or supplement hereof or thereof, the
Company agrees to pay the same together with any interest or
penalties thereon and agrees to hold the Agent and the Banks
harmless with respect thereto.

13.13 Confidentiality. Each Bank agrees that it will not
disclose without the prior consent of the Company, (other than to
its employees, to another Bank or to its auditors or counsel) any
confidential information with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries which is furnished pursuant to this Agreement or any
of the Loan Documents; provided that any Bank may disclose any such
information (a) as has become generally available to the public or
has been lawfully obtained by such Bank from any third party under
no duty of confidentiality to the Company, (b) as may be required
or appropriate in any report, statement or testimony submitted to,
or in respect to any inquiry, by, any municipal, state or federal
regulatory body having or claiming to have jurisdiction over such
Bank, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System of the United States or the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation or similar organizations (whether in the United States
or elsewhere) or their successors, (c) as may be required or
appropriate in respect to any summons or subpoena or in connection
with any litigation, (d) in order to comply with any law, order,
regulation or ruling applicable to such Bank, and (e) to any
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 61 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

permitted transferror or assignee or any approved participant of,
or with respect to, the Notes, as aforesaid.

13.14 Withholding Taxes. If any Bank is not incorporated
under the laws of the United States or a state thereof, such Bank
shall promptly deliver to the Agent two executed copies of (i)
Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 specifying the applicable tax
treaty between the United States and the jurisdiction of such
Bank's domicile which provides for the exemption from withholding
on interest payments to such Bank, (ii) Internal Revenue Service
Form 4224 evidencing that the income to be received by such Bank
hereunder is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or
business in the United States or (iii) other evidence satisfactory
to the Agent that such Bank is exempt from United States income tax
withholding with respect to such income. Such Bank shall amend or
supplement any such form or evidence as required to insure that it
is accurate, complete and non-misleading at all times. Promptly
upon notice from the Agent of any determination by the Internal
Revenue Service that any payments previously made to such Bank
hereunder were subject to United States income tax withholding when
made, such Bank shall pay to the Agent the excess of the aggregate
amount required to be withheld from such payments over the
aggregate amount actually withheld by the Agent. In addition, from
time to time upon the reasonable request and at the sole expense of
the Company, each Bank and the Agent shall (to the extent it is
able to do so based upon applicable facts and circumstances),
complete and provide the Company with such forms, certificates or
other documents as may be reasonably necessary to allow the Company
to make any payment under this Agreement or the other Loan
Documents without any withholding for or on the account of any tax
under Section 6.1(e) hereof (or with such withholding at a reduced
rate), provided that the execution and delivery of such forms,
certificates or other documents does not adversely affect or
otherwise restrict the right and benefits (including without
limitation economic benefits) available to such Bank or the Agent,
as the case may be, under this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, or under or in connection with any transactions not
related to the transactions contemplated hereby.

13.15 Effective Upon Execution. This Agreement shall become
effective upon the execution hereof by Banks, Agent, and Company
and shall remain effective until the Indebtedness has been repaid
and discharged in full and no commitment to make Advances hereunder
or under the Vishay Loan Agreement, the Roederstein Loan Agreement
or the Target Company Loan Agreement remains outstanding.

13.16 Severability. In case any one or more of the
obligations of the Company under this Agreement, the Notes or any
of the other Loan Documents shall be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining obligations of the Company shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and such
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 62 --Exibit 10.2 ( Revolving Credit + Term Loan )

invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in one jurisdiction
shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of the
obligations of the Company under this Agreement, the Notes or any
of the other Loan Documents in any other jurisdiction.

13.17 Table of Contents and Headings. The table of contents
and the headings of the various subdivisions hereof are for
convenience of reference only and shall in no way modify or affect
any of the terms or provisions hereof.

13.18 Construction of Certain Provisions. If any provision of
this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents refers to any action to
be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from
taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action is
taken directly or indirectly by such Person, whether or not
expressly specified in such provision.

13.19 Independence of Covenants. Each covenant hereunder
shall be given independent effect (subject to any exceptions stated
in such covenant) so that if a particular action or condition is
not permitted by any such covenant (taking into account any such
stated exception), the fact that it would be permitted by an
exception to, or would be otherwise within the limitations of,
another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an
Event of Default if such action is taken or such condition exists.

13.20 Reliance on and Survival of Various Provisions. All
terms, covenants, agreements, representations and warranties of the
Company or any party to any of the Loan Documents made herein or in
any of the Loan Documents or in any certificate, report, financial
statement or other document furnished by or on behalf of the
Company, any such party in connection with this Agreement or any of
the Loan Documents shall be deemed to have been relied upon by the
Banks, notwithstanding any investigation heretofore or hereafter
made by any Bank or on such Bank's behalf, and those covenants and
agreements of the Company set forth in Section 5.6 hereof (together
with any other indemnities of the Company contained elsewhere in
this Agreement or in any of the Loan Documents) and of Banks set
forth in Section 13.13 hereof shall survive the repayment in full
of the Indebtedness and the termination of any commitments to make
Advances hereunder.

13.21 Complete Agreement. This Agreement, the Notes, the
other Loan Documents and any agreements, certificates, or other
documents given to evidence or secure the Indebtedness and the
Commitment Letter, contain the entire agreement of the parties
hereto (provided that in the event of any inconsistency between
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, on one hand, and the
Commitment Letter on the other hand, this Agreement and other Loan
Documents shall control), and none of the parties shall be bound by
anything not expressed in writing.

Notes at a Deutsche Mark-based Rate shall be computed on the basis
of a 360 day year and assessed for the actual number of days
elapsed from the first day of the Interest Period applicable
thereto, to, but not including the last day thereof. Interest
accruing at the Prime-based Rate shall be computed on the basis of

Advance of Dollars as a Prime-based Advance, in which event said
interest shall be repaid in Dollars.

principal Indebtedness hereunder denominated in Dollars, at a per

denominated in Deutsche Marks, (a) at a per annum rate calculated
by the Agent, whose determination shall be conclusive absent
manifest error, on a daily basis, equal to three percent (3%) above
the interest rate per annum at which one (1) day (or, if such
amount due remains unpaid for more than three (3) Business Days,
then for such other period of time as the Agent may elect which
shall in no event be longer than six (6) months) deposits in
Deutsche Marks in the amount of such overdue payment due to the
Agent are offered by the Agent's Eurocurrency Lending Office for
the applicable period determined as provided above, or (b) if at
any such time such deposits are not offered by the Agent's
Eurocurrency Lending Office, then at a rate per annum equal to

required reserves or deposit insurance) of carrying the amount (in

of the Term Loan to an amount less than Five Million Deutsche
Marks (DM 5,000,000) (if then denominated in Deutsche Marks)
or Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) (if the Term Loan is then

Section 2.9 (i) shall be without premium or penalty, but there
shall be no reborrowing of such prepaid amounts and (ii) shall
be applied to the principal installments then outstanding
under this Agreement in the inverse order of their maturities,
and shall not affect the periodic or other payments of
principal required hereunder.

under the Term Loan as a Deutsche Mark-based Advance with a like

of Company or Vishay, as applicable, subject to the following and
to the other provisions of this Agreement:

(a) each such Term Loan Rate Request shall set
forth the information required on the Term Loan Rate Request
form annexed hereto as Exhibit "B", including, without

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 20 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

(b) each such Term Loan Rate Request shall be
delivered to Agent by 12 noon (Detroit time) four (4) Business
Days prior to the proposed date of the refunding or
conversion;

(c) No Advance may be requested with an Interest
Period ending after the Term Loan Maturity Date;

(d) the principal amount of such Advance, plus the
amount of any other outstanding Indebtedness evidenced by the
Term Notes to be then combined therewith having the same
Applicable Interest Rate and Interest Period, if any, shall be
not less than Five Million Deutsche Marks (DM 5,000,000) or
Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000), as applicable, unless the
balance remaining outstanding on the Term Loan is less than
such amount, then such lesser amount shall govern;

(e) at any one time, there shall not be in effect
more than one (1) Applicable Interest Rate and, if applicable,
two (2) Interest Periods for the Term Loan; and

(f) a Term Loan Rate Request, once delivered to
Agent, shall not be revocable by Company.

3.2 Interest Period Selection. Company shall have the
option of selecting, subject to the provisions hereof, among one
(1), two (2), three (3) or six (6) months as the term of each
Deutsche Mark Interest Period. There may be in effect at any one
time no more than one (1) Applicable Interest Rate and, if
applicable, two (2) Interest Periods for the balance outstanding
under the Term Loan. Notwithstanding any provision hereof to the
contrary, Company shall be required to select Interest Periods for
a sufficient amount of the Term Loan, so that at least one (1)
Interest Period shall end on the date of each scheduled principal
payment due thereon while the Term Loan is outstanding (including
without limitation, the scheduled maturity date of the Term Loan),
or, in the case of any Advance funded in Dollars, outstanding as a
Prime-based Advance, thereby permitting the Company to make the
required principal payments under Section 2.2 hereof. In the event
the Company shall fail with respect to any Advance to timely
exercise its option to refund or convert such Advance in accordance
with this Section 3.2 (and Agent has not received payment in full
on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto), or,
subject to Section 2.9 hereof, if on last day of an applicable
Interest Period an Event of Default or event which with the giving
of notice or the passage of time, or both, would constitute an
Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
principal amount of such Advance which has not been prepaid shall:

(a) in the case of any Advance denominated in
Dollars, be automatically converted to a Prime-based Advance;
and

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 21 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

(b) in the case of any Advance denominated in
Deutsche Marks, the next Interest Period shall be fixed by the
Agent for the same period as the Interest Period then in
effect, or, if applicable, the Term Loan Maturity Date,
whichever is the shorter period, provided that Company will
indemnify Agent and each of the Banks against any loss or
expense incurred by them (or any of them) pursuant to Section
4 hereof.

Each selection of an Interest Period, and the amount and date of
any repayment shall be noted on Agent's records, which records will
be conclusive evidence thereof, absent manifest error.

3.3 Limited Availability. Notwithstanding the selection of
an Interest Period under Sections 3.1 and 3.2 hereof, if prior to
the last day of any Interest Period, Agent or the Banks (after
consultation with Agent) shall determine that deposits of Deutsche
Marks will not be available to Agent or the Banks in the amounts
and for the terms necessary to carry the outstanding principal
indebtedness of the Advance subject to such Interest Period for the
next applicable Interest Period, then Agent shall so notify Company
and, subject to the terms hereof, Company shall immediately select
another Interest Period to be applicable as the next Interest
Period.

3.4 Unavailability. If, prior to the last day of any
Interest Period, Agent or the Banks (after consultation with Agent)
shall determine that by reason of circumstances affecting the
foreign exchange and interbank markets, generally, or for any of
the reasons set forth in Sections 4.3 or 4.4 hereof, deposits of
Deutsche Marks will not be available to Agent and the Banks as of
the last day of an applicable Interest Period in the amounts
necessary to carry the outstanding principal of the Advances
subject to such ending Interest Period in Deutsche Marks for any
Interest Period, Agent shall notify the Company and such Advances
shall then be automatically converted to and carried in Dollars, in
the Dollar Amount of the Indebtedness then outstanding, and shall
bear interest at the Prime-based Rate, until the first day of the
next Interest Period, if any, selected pursuant to Section 3.5
hereof.

3.5 Reconversion to Deutsche Mark-based Rate on Re-
availability. In the event that, after a conversion of Indebtedness
to Dollars pursuant to Section 3.4 hereof, Agent determines that
deposits of Deutsche Marks are again available to Agent and the
Banks in the amounts necessary to carry the principal Indebtedness
under the Term Loan in Deutsche Marks for any Interest Period,
Agent shall notify Company of the Interest Period(s) for which such
deposits in Deutsche Marks are available and Company shall
immediately select the next Interest Period from among such
available Interest Periods, in accordance with Sections 3.1 and 3.2
hereof, and the Indebtedness previously converted from Deutsche

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 22 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

Marks to Dollars under Section 3.4 hereof shall be reconverted to
Deutsche Marks (in the amount of the Deutsche Mark Equivalent of
such Indebtedness), all in accordance with and subject to Section
3.6 hereof, below.

3.6 Repayment on Reconversion. In the event that the
currency in which Indebtedness is being carried is required to be
changed from Dollars to Deutsche Marks under Section 3.5 hereof, as
aforesaid, and if the Deutsche Mark Equivalent of the principal
amount of the Indebtedness under the Term Loan outstanding upon
such reconversion shall exceed the Deutsche Mark Principal Limit,
then concurrently with such reconversion, Company shall pay to
Agent in immediately available funds, for the ratable benefit of
the Banks, an amount in Deutsche Marks sufficient to reduce the
then outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan to an amount not
greater than the Deutsche Mark Principal Limit.

3.7 Interest Payments on Conversions and Reconversions.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding Sections,
all accrued and unpaid interest on any Indebtedness converted or
reconverted pursuant to the foregoing Sections or otherwise, shall
be due and payable in full on the date of such conversion or
reconversion.

4. CHANGES IN LAW OR CIRCUMSTANCES; INCREASED COSTS;
MARGIN ADJUSTMENTS; SPECIAL LIMITATION

4.1 Reimbursement of Prepayment Costs. As to any Deutsche
Mark-based Advance, if any prepayment thereof shall occur on any
day other than the last day of an Interest Period, whether pursuant
to this Agreement or by acceleration, or otherwise, or if the rate
applicable to such Advance shall be changed during any Interest
Period pursuant to this Agreement, or if, after requesting the
refunding or conversion of outstanding Indebtedness hereunder, but
prior to the refunding or conversion thereof, Company is no longer
entitled to the refunding or conversion requested hereunder,
Company shall reimburse Banks on demand for any costs incurred by
Banks as a result of the timing thereof, including but not limited
to any net costs incurred in liquidating or employing deposits from
third parties. Each Bank demanding reimbursement under this Section
4.1 shall deliver to Company a certificate setting forth the basis
for determining such costs, which certificate shall be conclusively
presumed correct save for manifest error.

4.2 Agent's Eurocurrency Lending Office. For any Advance to
which a Deutsche Mark-based Rate is applicable, Agent (if Agent
shall designate a Eurocurrency Lending Office which maintains books
separate from those of the rest of Agent), and each of the Banks
shall have the option of maintaining and carrying such Advance on
the books of its applicable Eurocurrency Lending Office.

Banks (after consultation with Agent) shall determine that, by
reason of circumstances affecting the foreign exchange and
interbank markets generally, deposits in Eurodollars or in Deutsche
Marks, as the case may be, in the applicable amounts are not being
offered to the Agent for such Interest Period, (a) the obligation
of Banks to make the applicable Deutsche Mark-based Advances, and
the right of Company to convert an Advance to or refund an Advance
as a Deutsche Mark-based Advance, shall be suspended, and (b) the
Company, shall, to the extent it is able to do so hereunder,
convert said Advance to another type of Advance, or, if unable to
do so, shall repay in full (or cause to be repaid in full) the then
outstanding principal amount of each such Deutsche Mark-based
Advance covered hereby in Deutsche Marks, together with accrued
interest thereon, together with any amounts payable under Section
4.6, hereof, and all other amounts payable hereunder on the last
day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Advance.

4.4 Laws Affecting Deutsche Mark-based Advance
Availability. If, after the date hereof, the introduction of, or
any change in, any applicable law, rule or regulation or in the
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental
authority charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by any of the Banks (or any of their
respective Eurocurrency Lending Offices) with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such
authority, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any of the
Banks (or any of their respective Eurocurrency Lending Offices) to
honor its obligations hereunder to make or maintain any Advance
with interest at the Deutsche Mark-based Rate, or in Deutsche
Marks, such Bank shall forthwith give notice thereof to Company and
to Agent. Thereafter, the obligations of Banks to make Deutsche
Mark-based Advances or Advances in Deutsche Marks and the right of
Company to convert an Advance or refund an Advance as a Deutsche
Mark-based Advance or as an Advance carried in Deutsche Marks,
shall be suspended and Advances at the Deutsche Mark based-Rate or
carried in Deutsche Marks shall immediately be converted in the
manner set forth under Section 3.4 hereof. If any of the Banks may
not lawfully continue to maintain an Advance to the end of the then
current Interest Period applicable thereto as an Advance in
Deutsche Marks or at the Deutsche Mark-based Rate, the applicable
Advance shall immediately be converted to a Prime-based Advance (in
the Dollar Amount thereof) in the manner set forth under Section
3.5 hereof and the Prime-based Rate shall be applicable thereto for
the remainder of such Interest Period. For purposes of this
Section, a change in law, rule, regulation, interpretation or
administration shall include, without limitation, any change made
or which becomes effective on the basis of a law, rule, regulation,
interpretation or administration presently in force, the effective
date of which change is delayed by the terms of such law, rule,
regulation, interpretation or administration.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 24 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

4.5 Increased Cost of Deutsche Mark-based Advances. If the
adoption after the date hereof, or any change after the date hereof
in, any applicable law, rule or regulation of any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by Agent or
any of the Banks (or any of their respective Eurocurrency Lending
Offices) with any request or directive (whether or not having the
force of law) made by any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency after the date hereof:

(a) shall subject any of the Banks (or any of their
respective Eurocurrency Lending Offices) to any tax, duty or
other charge with respect to the Indebtedness hereunder, or
any portion thereof, or shall change the basis of taxation of
payments to any of the Banks (or any of their respective
Eurocurrency Lending Offices) of the principal of or interest
on the Indebtedness hereunder, or any portion thereof, or any
other amounts due under this Agreement in respect thereof
(except for changes in the rate of tax on, or measured by, the
overall net income of any of the Banks or any of their
respective Eurocurrency Lending Offices imposed by the
jurisdiction in which such Bank's principal executive office
or Eurocurrency Lending Office is located); or

(b) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any
reserve (including, without limitation, any imposed by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), special
deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits
with or for the account of, or credit extended by any of the
Banks (or any of their respective Eurocurrency Lending
Offices) or shall impose on any of the Banks (or any of their
respective Eurocurrency Lending Offices) or the foreign
exchange and interbank markets any other condition affecting
the Indebtedness hereunder, or any portion thereof;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the costs to
any of the Banks of maintaining any part of the Indebtedness
hereunder as an Advance in Deutsche Marks or to reduce the amount
of any sum received or receivable by any of the Banks under this
Agreement, then such Bank shall promptly notify Agent, and Agent
shall promptly notify Company of such fact and demand compensation
therefor and, within fifteen (15) days after such notice by Agent
and/or Company, as applicable, agree to pay to such Bank such
additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Bank or Banks
for such increased cost or reduction. Agent will promptly notify
Company of any event of which it has knowledge which will entitle
Banks to compensation pursuant to this Section, or which will cause
the Company to incur additional liability under Section 5.1(d)
hereof, provided that Agent shall incur no liability whatsoever to
the Banks or Company in the event it fails to do so. A certificate
of Agent setting forth the basis for determining such additional
amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Bank or Banks shall

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 25 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

be conclusively presumed to be correct save for manifest error. For
purposes of this Section, a change in law, rule, regulation,
interpretation, administration, request or directive shall include,
without limitation, any change made or which becomes effective on
the basis of a law, rule, regulation, interpretation,
administration, request or directive presently in force, the
effective date of which change is delayed by the terms of such law,
rule, regulation, interpretation, administration, request or
directive.

4.6 Indemnity. The Company will indemnify Agent and each of
the Banks against any loss or expense which may arise or be
attributable to the Agent's and each Bank's obtaining, liquidating
or employing deposits or other funds acquired to effect, fund or
maintain the Indebtedness hereunder, or any portion thereof, (a) as
a consequence of any failure by the Company to make any payment
when due of any amount due hereunder, (b) due to any failure of the
Company to specify an Interest Period or (c) due to any payment or
prepayment of the Indebtedness or any portion thereof (unless the
Prime-based rate is then in effect) on a date other than the last
day of the Interest Period. Such loss or expense shall be
calculated based upon the present value, as applicable, of payments
due from the Company with respect to the deposits obtained by the
Agent or any of the Banks in order to fund the Indebtedness or any
portion thereof. The Agent's and each Bank's (as applicable)
calculations of any such loss or expense shall be furnished to the
Company and shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.

4.7 Judgment Currency. The obligation of the Company to
make payments of the principal of and interest on the Term Notes
and any other amounts payable hereunder in the currency specified
for such payment herein or in the Term Notes shall not be
discharged or satisfied by any tender, or any recovery pursuant to
any judgment, which is expressed in or converted into any other
currency, except to the extent that such tender or recovery shall
result in the actual receipt by the Bank of the full amount of such
currency expressed to be payable herein or in the Term Notes. The
Agent shall, using all amounts obtained or received from the
Company pursuant to such tender or recovery in payment of principal
of and interest on the Term Notes, promptly purchase the specified
currency, as aforesaid, at the most favorable spot exchange rate
determined by the Agent to be available to it. The respective
obligations of the Company to make payments in the specified
currency shall be enforceable as an alternative or additional cause
of action solely for the purpose of recovering the amount, if any,
by which such actual receipt shall fall short of the full amount of
the currency expressed to be payable herein or in the Term Notes.

4.8 Margin Adjustments. Adjustments to the Applicable
Margin, based on Schedule 4.8, shall be implemented on a quarterly
basis as follows:
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 26 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

(a) Such margin adjustments shall be given
prospective effect only, effective (A) as to all Prime-based
Advances outstanding hereunder, immediately upon required date
of delivery of the financial statements required to be
delivered under Section 7.3(b) and 7.3(c) of the Vishay Loan
Agreement establishing applicability of the appropriate
adjustments, if any, or on the obtaining and/or any change in
the Rating Level then in effect, as applicable and (B) as to
each DM-based Advance outstanding hereunder, effective upon
the expiration of the applicable Interest Period(s), if any,
in effect on (x) the required date of delivery of the latest
of such financial statements required to be delivered
hereunder during such Interest Period(s) or (y) the date of
the obtaining and/or any change in the Rating Level in effect
hereunder, as applicable, in each case with no retroactivity
or claw-back.

(ii) With respect to DM-based Advances outstanding
hereunder, an adjustment hereunder, after becoming effective,
shall remain in effect only through the end of the applicable
Interest Period(s) for such DM-based Advances if any;
provided, however, that upon the delivery of quarterly
financial statements demonstrating any change in the Leverage
Ratio or the obtaining and/or change in the Rating Level then
in effect, as aforesaid, or the occurrence of any other event
which under the terms hereof causes such adjustment no longer
to be applicable, then any such subsequent adjustment or no
adjustment, as the case may be, shall be effective (and said
pricing shall thereby be adjusted up or down, as applicable),
with the commencement of each Interest Period following such
change or event, all in accordance with the preceding
subparagraph.

4.9 HLT Determination. In the event at any time (whether
before or after the funding of the Acquisition Loans) of an HLT
Determination, the Agent, the Banks and the Company shall commence
negotiations in good faith to agree upon whether and, if so, the
extent to which fees, interest rates and/or margins hereunder
should be increased so as to reflect such HLT Determination and to
compensate the Banks and Agent for additional costs, expenses
and/or fees which result from or are associated with any such HLT
Determination, including without limitation any costs resulting
from any requirement that additional capital be allocated to the
Indebtedness, or any portion thereof. If Company and the Majority
Banks agree that fees, interest rates and/or margins should be
increased, and agree on the amount of such increase or increases,
this Agreement may be amended to give effect to such increase or
increases as provided in Section 12.11 hereof. If Company and
Majority Banks fail to agree on whether and, if so, the extent to
which fees, interest rates and/or margins hereunder should be
increased within 60 days after notice to Company of an HLT
Determination as herein provided, then (i) the Agent shall, if

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 27 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

requested by the Majority Banks, by written notice to the Company
terminate the commitments of the Banks to fund and/or maintain
Advances of the Revolving Credit under the DM Loan Agreement and
under the Vishay Loan Agreement, and if still outstanding, any
commitment to fund Advances of the Acquisition Loans, and such
commitments shall thereupon terminate, (ii) Company shall be
obligated to repay all outstanding Indebtedness at the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto and (iii) the Company may, at
its option, on at least ten Business Days' written notice to the
Agent (which shall promptly notify the Banks thereof) prepay all
Indebtedness outstanding hereunder and under the other Loan
Agreements by paying the aggregate principal amount thereof,
together, with all accrued interest thereon to the date of
prepayment; provided that, if the Company prepays any fixed rate
loans or Advances carried at the Deutsche Mark-based Rate, or any
comparable rate, pursuant to this Section 4.9, Company shall
compensate the Banks for any resulting funding losses as provided
in Section 4.1 hereof. Subject to compliance by Company with this
Section 4.9, the Banks acknowledge that an HLT Determination shall
not constitute a Default or an Event of Default hereunder.

4.10 Special Limitation. In the event, as a result of
increases in the value of Deutsche Marks and/or any of the
Alternative Currencies against the Dollar (taking into account the
Current Dollar Equivalent of the Indebtedness outstanding from time
to time under the Vishay Loan Agreement, the DM Loan Agreement and
any Indebtedness required to be aggregated under 12 USCA 84, as
amended, the regulations promulgated thereunder, or other, similar
applicable law) or for any other reason, the obligation of any of
the Banks to advance additional funds hereunder or under any of the
other Loan Agreements is determined by such Bank to exceed its then
applicable legal lending limit under 12 USCA 84, as amended, and
the regulations promulgated thereunder, or other, similar
applicable laws, the amount of additional funds which such Bank
shall be obligated to advance hereunder shall immediately be
reduced to the maximum amount which such Bank may legally advance
(as determined by such Bank) and the obligation of each of the
remaining Banks hereunder shall be proportionately reduced, based
on the applicable Percentages, and, to the extent necessary under
such laws and regulations (as determined by each of the Banks, with
respect to the applicability of such laws and regulations to
itself), the Company shall reduce, or cause to be reduced,
complying to the extent practicable with the remaining provisions
hereof, the Indebtedness outstanding hereunder or under any of the
other Loan Agreements by an amount sufficient to comply with such
maximum amounts. Upon any such reduction in the obligations of the
Banks under this Section 4.10, Company shall have the right,
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (but
subsequent to Company's compliance with its obligation to reduce
the Indebtedness outstanding hereunder), to add to the Banks
providing financing hereunder a bank reasonably acceptable to the

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 28 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

Agent for the purpose of restoring the shortfall created by the
reduction in such obligations of the Banks.

5. PAYMENTS, RECOVERIES AND COLLECTIONS

5.1 Payment Procedure.

(a) All payments by the Company of principal of, or
interest on, the Term Notes, or of any other amount due
hereunder, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim on the
date specified for payment under this Agreement and, (if the
Term Loan is then denominated in Deutsche Marks), shall be
made by the Company in Deutsche Marks in immediately available
funds for the account of Agent's Eurocurrency Lending Office,
at the Agent's Correspondent, for the ratable account of the
Banks, not later than 11:00 a.m. (local time of the Agent's
Correspondent); provided, however, that subsequent to any
conversion of the Indebtedness hereunder from Deutsche Marks
to Dollars pursuant to Section 3.4 hereof, such payments shall
be made not later than 11:00 a.m. (Detroit time) in Dollars in
immediately available funds to Agent, for the ratable account
of the Banks, at Agent's office located at Comerica Bank
Building, One Detroit Center, 500 Woodward Avenue, Detroit,
Michigan 48275 until reconversion of the Indebtedness
hereunder from Dollar to Deutsche Marks pursuant to Section
3.5 hereof. Upon receipt of each such payment, the Agent shall
make prompt payment to each Bank, or such Bank's Eurocurrency
Lending Office (as directed by such Bank), in like funds and
currencies, of all amounts received by it for the account of
such Bank.

(b) Unless the Agent shall have been notified by
the Company prior to the date on which any payment to be made
pursuant to the terms hereof is due that the Company does not
intend to remit such payment, the Agent may, in its
discretion, assume that such payment has been remitted when so
due and the Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to each Bank on such payment date an amount equal to
such Bank's share of such assumed payment. If the Company has
not in fact remitted such payment to the Agent, each Bank
shall forthwith on demand repay to the Agent in the applicable
currency the amount of such assumed payment made available to
such Bank, together with the interest thereon, in respect of
each day from and including the date such amount was made
available by the Agent to such Bank to the date such amount is
repaid to the Agent at a rate per annum equal to (i) with
respect to Deutsche Mark-based Advances, Agent's aggregate
marginal cost (including the cost of maintaining any required
reserves or deposit insurance and of any fees, penalties,
overdraft charges or other costs or expenses incurred by
Agent) of carrying such amount, and (ii) with respect to
Indebtedness which has been converted to a Prime-based Advance

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 29 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

pursuant to Section 3.4 hereof, the federal funds rate (daily
average), as the same may vary from time to time.

(c) Whenever any payment of principal of, or
interest on, a Deutsche Mark-based Advance shall be due on a
day which is not a Business Day the date of payment thereof
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, unless
as a result thereof it would fall in the next calendar month,
in which case it shall be shortened to the next preceding
Business Day and, in the case of a payment of principal,
interest thereon shall be payable for such extended or
shortened time, if any. Whenever any payment to be made
hereunder of principal of, or interest on, a Prime-based
Advance shall otherwise be due on a day which is not a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next
succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be
included in computing interest, if any, in connection with
such payment.

(d) All payments to be made by the Company under
this Agreement shall be made without set-off or counterclaim,
as aforesaid, and without deduction for or on account of any
present or future withholding or other taxes of any nature
imposed by any governmental authority or of any political
subdivision thereof or any federation or organization of which
such governmental authority may at the time of payment be a
member, unless the Company is compelled by law to make payment
subject to such tax. In such event, the Company shall:

(i) pay to the Agent for Agent's own account
and/or (as the case may be) for the account of
the Banks such additional amounts as may be
necessary to ensure that the Agent and/or such
Banks receive a net amount in Deutsche Marks
or Dollars, as the case may be, equal to the
full amount which would have been receivable
had payment not been made subject to such tax;
and

(ii) remit such tax to the relevant taxing
authorities according to applicable law and
send to the Agent such certificates or
certified copy receipts as the Agent shall
reasonably require as proof of the payment by
Vishay or the Company of any such taxes
payable by Vishay or the Company.

As used herein, the terms "tax", "taxes" and "taxation"
include all existing taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees,
deductions and withholdings and any restrictions or conditions
resulting in a charge together with interest thereon and fines and
penalties with respect thereto which may be imposed by reason of

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 30 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

any violation or default with respect to the law regarding such
tax, assessed as a result of or in connection with the transactions
in Deutsche Marks hereunder, or the payment and or receipt of funds
in Deutsche Marks or the payment or delivery of funds into or out
of any jurisdiction other than the United States (whether assessed
against Vishay, Company, Agent or any of the Banks).

5.2 Application of Proceeds of Collateral. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, any offsets or
voluntary payments by the Company, or others and any other sums
received or collected in respect of the Indebtedness, shall be
applied, first, to the Notes pro rata, based on the aggregate
Indebtedness then outstanding thereunder (or in such other order
and manner as determined by all of the Banks), next, to any other
Indebtedness on a pro rata basis (as aforesaid), and then, if there
is any excess, to Company.

5.3 Pro rata Recovery. If any Bank shall obtain any payment
or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application
of offset or otherwise) on account of principal of, or interest on,
any of the Term Notes in excess of its pro rata share of payments
then or thereafter obtained by all Banks upon principal of and
interest on all Term Notes, such Bank shall purchase from the other
Banks such participation in the Term Notes held by them as shall be
necessary to cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess payment
or other recovery ratably in accordance with the Percentage with
each of them; provided, however, that if all or any portion of the
excess payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered from such
purchasing holder, the purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase
price restored to the extent of such recovery, but without
interest.

5.4 Deposits and Accounts. In addition to and not in
limitation of any rights of any Bank or other holder of any Term
Note under applicable law, each Bank and each other such holder
shall, upon acceleration of the Indebtedness under the Term Notes
and without notice or demand of any kind, have the right to
appropriate and apply to the payment of the Term Notes owing to it
(whether or not then due) any and all balances, credits, deposits,
accounts or moneys of Vishay or Company then or thereafter with
such Bank or other holder; provided, however, that any such amount
so applied by any Bank or other holder on any of the Term Notes
owing to it shall be subject to the provisions of Section 5.3.

6. CONDITIONS.

The obligations of Banks to make Advances of the Term Loan
pursuant to this Agreement are subject to the following conditions:

6.1 Vishay Loan Agreement. All of the conditions required

right or remedies which Banks would otherwise have.

10.4 Waiver by Vishay and Company of Certain Laws. To the
extent permitted by applicable law, Vishay and Company hereby agree
to waive, and do hereby absolutely and irrevocably waive and
relinquish the benefit and advantage of any marshalling, valuation,
stay, appraisement, extension or redemption laws now existing or
which may hereafter exist, which, but for this provision, might be
applicable to any sale made under the judgment, order or decree of
any court, on any claim for interest on the Term Notes, and further
hereby irrevocably agree to waive the right to trial by jury with
respect to any and all actions or proceedings in which Agent or the
Banks (or any of them), on one hand, and Vishay, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are parties,
whether or not such actions or proceedings arise out of this
Agreement or the Loan Documents, or otherwise. These waivers have
been voluntarily given, with full knowledge of the consequences
thereof.

10.5 Waiver of Defaults. No Event of Default shall be waived
by the Banks except in a writing signed by an officer of the Agent
in accordance with Section 12.11 hereof. No single or partial

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 35 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder, nor any delay
in the exercise thereof, shall preclude other or further exercise
of the Banks' rights by Agent. No waiver of any Default or Event of
Default shall extend to any other or further Default or Event of
Default. No forbearance on the part of the Agent or any Bank in
enforcing any of the Banks' rights shall constitute a waiver of any
of their rights. Company expressly agrees that this Section may not
be waived or modified by the Banks or Agent by course of
performance, estoppel or otherwise.

10.6 Cross-Default. In addition to the other Events of
Default specified herein, any failure to perform and discharge when
due, after allowance for any applicable cure period, any of the
obligations, covenants and agreements required to be performed
under the provisions of any instruments evidencing or securing any
other present and future borrowings of Company from the Banks (or
from Agent) in renewal or extension of, or related to this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, shall be an Event of
Default under the provisions of this Agreement entitling Agent,
with the consent of the Majority Banks (without notice or any cure
period except as expressly provided herein or therein), to exercise
any and all rights and remedies provided hereby. Any Event of
Default under this Agreement or under any of the Loan Documents
shall also constitute a default under all other instruments
securing this or any other present or future borrowings, or any
agreements in relation thereto, entitling Agent and the Banks to
exercise any and all rights and remedies provided therein.

11. AGENT

11.1 Appointment of Agent. Each Bank and the holder of each
Term Note appoints and authorizes Agent to act on behalf of such
Bank or holder under the Loan Documents and to exercise such powers
hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to or
required of Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with
such powers as may be reasonably incidental thereto. Each Bank
agrees (which agreement shall survive any termination of this
Agreement) to reimburse Agent for all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses (including in-house and outside attorneys' fees) incurred
by Agent hereunder or in connection herewith or with any Default or
Event of Default or in enforcing the obligations of Company under
this Agreement or the Loan Documents or any other instrument
executed pursuant hereto, and for which Agent is not reimbursed by
Company, pro rata according to such Bank's Percentage. Agent shall
not be required to take any action under the Loan Documents, or to
prosecute or defend any suit in respect of the Loan Documents,
unless indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against loss,
costs, liability and expense. If any indemnity furnished to Agent
shall become impaired, it may call for additional indemnity and
cease to do the acts indemnified against until such additional
indemnity is given.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 36 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

11.2 Deposit Account with Agent. Company hereby authorizes
Agent to charge its general deposit accounts, if any, maintained
with Agent for the amount of any principal, interest, or other
amounts or costs due under this Agreement when the same becomes due
and payable under the terms of this Agreement or the Term Notes.

11.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Agent agrees to exercise its
rights and powers, and to perform its duties, as Agent hereunder
and under the Loan Documents in accordance with its usual customs
and practices in bank-agency transactions, but only upon and
subject to the express terms and conditions of Section 11, hereof
(and no implied covenants or other obligations shall be read into
this Agreement against the Agent); neither Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable to any
Bank for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them
under this Agreement or any document executed pursuant hereto, or
in connection herewith or therewith, except for its or their own
willful misconduct or gross negligence, nor be responsible to any
Bank for any recitals or warranties herein or therein made by any
Person, nor for the effectiveness, enforceability, validity or due
execution (other than its own execution and delivery) of this
Agreement or any document executed pursuant hereto, or any security
thereunder, nor to make any inquiry respecting the performance by
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of its obligations hereunder or
thereunder. Nor shall Agent have, or be deemed to have, a fiduciary
relationship with any Bank by reason of this Agreement. Agent shall
be entitled to rely upon advice of counsel concerning legal matters
and upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement or writing
which it believes to be genuine and to have been presented by a
proper person.

11.4 Successor Agents. Agent may resign as such at any time
upon at least thirty (30) days prior notice to Company and all
Banks. If Agent at any time shall resign or if the office of Agent
shall become vacant for any other reason, Majority Banks shall, by
written instrument, appoint a successor Agent (satisfactory to such
Majority Banks) which shall thereupon become Agent hereunder and
shall be entitled to receive from the prior Agent such documents of
transfer and assignment as such successor Agent may reasonably
request. Such successor Agent shall succeed to all of the rights
and obligations of the retiring Agent as if originally named. The
retiring or removed Agent shall duly assign, transfer and deliver
to such successor Agent all moneys at the time held by the retiring
or removed Agent hereunder after deducting therefrom its expenses
for which it is entitled to be reimbursed. Upon such succession of
any such successor Agent, the retiring agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations hereunder, except for its gross
negligence or willful misconduct arising prior to its retirement
hereunder, and the provisions of this Section 11 shall continue in
effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by it while it was acting as Agent.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 37 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

11.5 Loans by Agent. Agent shall have the same rights and
powers with respect to the credit extended by it and the Term Notes
held by it as any Bank and may exercise the same as if it were not
Agent, and the term "Bank" and, when appropriate, "holder" shall
include Agent in its individual capacity.

11.6 Credit Decisions. Each Bank acknowledges that it has,
independently of Agent and each other Bank and based on financial
statements and such other documents, information and investigations
as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit decision to
extend credit hereunder from time to time. Each Bank also
acknowledges that it will, independently of Agent and each other
Bank and based on such other documents, information and
investigations as it shall deem appropriate at any time, continue
to make its own credit decisions as to exercising or not exercising
from time to time any rights and privileges available to it under
this Agreement or any document executed pursuant hereto.

11.7 Notices by Agent. Agent shall give prompt notice to
each Bank of its receipt of each notice or request required or
permitted to be given to Agent by Vishay and/or Company pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement and shall promptly distribute to the
Banks and reports required from Vishay and/or the Company or its
Subsidiaries under the terms hereof received by Agent, in its
capacity as Agent.

11.8 Agent's Fees. Commencing on September 30, 1994, and on
each succeeding anniversary date thereof until the Indebtedness has
been repaid, Company shall cause Vishay to pay to Agent, in
Dollars, an annual agency fee set forth (or to be set forth from
time to time) in a letter agreement between Vishay and Agent. The
Agent's Fees described in this Section are not refundable under any
circumstances.

11.9 Nature of Agency. The appointment of Agent as agent is
for the convenience of Banks, Vishay and Company in making Advances
of the Term Loan, collecting fees and principal and interest on the
Term Loan and dealing with the Collateral. No Bank is purchasing
the Term Loan from Agent and this Agreement is not intended to be
a purchase or participation agreement.

11.10 Actions; Confirmation of Agent's Authority to Act in
Event of Default. Subject to the terms of this Agreement and to the
direction of the Majority Banks, Agent is hereby expressly
authorized to act in all litigation and in all other respects as
the representative of the Banks where Agent considers it to be
necessary or desirable in order to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement or the Loan Documents. Without necessarily accepting
service of process or designating Agent to do so in its stead, each
Bank hereby agrees with each other Bank and with Agent, without
intending to confer or conferring any rights on any other party,
(a) that it shall be bound by any litigation brought by or against

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 38 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

Agent by the Company, any Subsidiary or any other party in
connection with the Term Loan and Indebtedness or any other rights,
duties or obligations arising hereunder or under this Agreement or
the Loan Documents and (b) that it now irrevocably waives the
defense of procedural impediment or failure to name or join such
Bank as an indispensable party; provided however that each Bank
reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to intervene or
otherwise appear in such litigation, and to retain its own counsel
in connection therewith. In conducting such litigation hereunder on
behalf of the Banks, Agent shall, subject to the terms hereof,
accept the direction of the Majority Banks or all of the Banks, as
the case may be, and shall at all times be indemnified by the Banks
as provided in Sections 11.1 and 11.12 hereof. Agent shall
undertake to give each Bank prompt notice of any litigation
commenced against Agent and/or the Banks with respect to this
Agreement, the Loan Agreement or the Loan Documents or any matter
referred to herein or therein.

11.11 Authority of Agent to Enforce Term Notes and This
Agreement. Each Bank, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement including without limitation Sections 12.10, 12.14 and
12.15 hereof, authorizes the Agent with full power and authority as
attorney-in-fact to institute and maintain actions, suits or
proceedings for the collection and enforcement of the Term Notes
and to file such proofs of debt or other documents as may be
necessary to have the claims of the Banks allowed in any proceeding
relative to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or their
creditors or affecting their properties, and to take such other
actions which Agent considers to be necessary or desirable for the
protection, collection and enforcement of the Term Notes, this
Agreement or the Loan Documents. 

11.12 Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify the Agent
in its capacity as such, to the extent not reimbursed by the
Company, pro rata according to their respective Percentages, from
and against any and all claims, liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in any way relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents or any action taken or omitted to be taken or suffered in
good faith by the Agent hereunder, provided that no Bank shall be
liable for any portion of any of the foregoing items resulting from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or any of
its officers, employees, directors or agents.

11.13 Knowledge of Default. It is expressly understood and
agreed that the Agent shall be entitled to assume that no default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, unless the
officers of the Agent immediately responsible for matters
concerning this Agreement shall have actual (rather than
constructive) knowledge of such occurrence or shall have been

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 39 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

notified in writing by a Bank that such Bank considers that a
default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and
specifying the nature thereof. Upon obtaining actual knowledge of
any default or Event of Default as described above, the Agent shall
promptly, but in any event within three (3) Business Days after
obtaining knowledge thereof, notify each Bank of such default or
Event of Default and the action, if any, the Agent proposes be
taken with respect thereto.

11.14 Agent's Authorization; Action by Banks. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, whenever the Agent is
authorized and empowered hereunder on behalf of the Banks to give
any approval or consent, or to make any request, or to take any
other action on behalf of the Banks (including without limitation
the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under the other
Loan Documents), the Agent shall be required (but only to the
extent otherwise required hereunder) to give such approval or
consent, or to make such request or to take such other action only
when so requested in writing by the Majority Banks or the Banks, as
applicable hereunder. Action that may be taken by Majority Banks or
all of the Banks, as the case may be (as provided for hereunder)
may be taken (a) pursuant to a vote at a meeting (which may be held
by telephone conference call) as to which all of the Banks have
been given reasonable advance notice, or (b) pursuant to the
written consent of the requisite Percentages of the Banks as
required hereunder, provided that all of the Banks are given
reasonable advance notice of the requests for such consent.

11.15 Enforcement Actions by the Agent. Except as otherwise
expressly provided under this Agreement or in any of the other Loan
Documents and subject to the terms hereof, Agent will take such
action, assert such rights and pursue such remedies under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents as the Majority Banks or all
of the Banks, as the case may be (as provided for hereunder), shall
direct. Except as otherwise expressly provided in any of the Loan
Documents, Agent will not (and will not be obligated to) take any
action, assert any rights or pursue any remedies under this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in violation or
contravention of any express direction or instruction of the
Majority Banks or all of the Banks, as the case may be (as provided
for hereunder). Agent may refuse (and will not be obligated) to
take any action, assert any rights or pursue any remedies under
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in the absence of
the express written direction and instruction of the Majority Banks
or all of the Banks, as the case may be (as provided for
hereunder). In the event Agent fails, within a commercially
reasonable time, to take such action, assert such rights, or pursue
such remedies as the Majority Banks or all of the Banks, as the
case may be (as provided for hereunder), shall direct in conformity
with this Agreement, the Majority Banks or all of the Banks, as the
case may be (as provided for hereunder), shall have the right to
take such action, to assert such rights, or pursue such remedies on

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 40 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

behalf of all of the Banks unless the terms hereof otherwise
require the consent of all the Banks to the taking of such actions
(in which event all of the Banks must join in such action). Except
as expressly provided above or elsewhere in this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents, no Bank (other than the Agent, acting in its
capacity as Agent) shall be entitled to take any enforcement action
of any kind under any of the Loan Documents.

11.16 Co-Agents and Lead Managers. NationsBank has been
designated by the Company as "Co-Agent" and BHF and Signet have
been designated by the Company as "Lead Managers" under this
Agreement. Other than its rights and remedies as a Bank hereunder,
each such Co-Agent and Lead Manager shall have no administrative,
collateral or other rights or responsibilities, provided, however,
that each such Co-Agent and Lead Manager shall be entitled to the
benefits afforded to Agent under Sections 12.5 and 12.6 hereof.

12. MISCELLANEOUS

12.1 Accounting Principles. Where the character or amount of
any asset or liability or item of income or expense is required to
be determined or any consolidation or other accounting computation
is required to be made for the purposes of this Agreement, it shall
be done in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied.

12.2 Consent to Jurisdiction. Company hereby irrevocably
submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any United States
Federal or Michigan state court sitting in Detroit in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of
the Loan Documents and Company hereby irrevocably agrees that all
claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in any such United States Federal or Michigan state
court. Company irrevocably consents to the service of any and all
process in any such action or proceeding brought in any court in or
of the State of Michigan by the delivery of copies of such process
to Company at its address specified on the signature page hereto or
by certified mail directed to such address. Nothing in this Section
shall affect the right of the Banks and the Agent to serve process
in any other manner permitted by law or limit the right of the
Banks or the Agent (or any of them) to bring any such action or
proceeding against the Company or any of its or their property in
the courts of any other jurisdiction. The Company hereby
irrevocably waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such
suit or proceeding in the above described courts.

12.3 Law of Michigan. This Agreement and the Term Notes have
been delivered at Detroit, Michigan, U.S.A., and shall be governed
by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the
State of Michigan except as and to the extent expressed to the
contrary in any of the Loan Documents. Whenever possible each
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 41 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any
provision of this Agreement shall be prohibited by or invalid under
applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent
of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the
remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of this
Agreement.

12.4 Interest. In the event the obligation of Vishay and/or
the Company to pay interest on the principal balance of the Term
Notes is or becomes in excess of the maximum interest rate which
Vishay and/or the Company is permitted by law to contract or agree
to pay, giving due consideration to the execution date of this
Agreement, then, in that event, the rate of interest applicable
with respect to such Bank's Percentage shall be deemed to be
immediately reduced to such maximum rate and all previous payments
in excess of the maximum rate shall be deemed to have been payments
in reduction of principal and not of interest.

12.5 Closing Costs; Other Costs and Expenses. Company shall
pay or reimburse Agent for payment of, on demand (a) all closing
costs and expenses, including, by way of description and not
limitation, house and outside attorney fees and advances, appraisal
and accounting fees, title and lien search fees, and required
travel costs, incurred by Agent in connection with the commitment,
consummation and closing of the loans contemplated hereby, or in
connection with any refinancing or restructuring of the loans or
advances provided under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents,
or any amendment thereof requested by Company; and (b) all stamp
and other taxes and fees payable or determined to be payable in
connection with the execution, delivery, filing or recording of
this Agreement and the Loan Documents and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and any and all liabilities with
respect to or resulting from any delay in paying or omitting to pay
such taxes or fees. Furthermore, all reasonable costs and expenses,
including without limitation attorney fees, and costs and expenses
to Environmental Auditors retained by Agent hereunder, incurred by
Agent in revising, preserving, protecting, exercising or enforcing
any of its or any of the Banks' rights against Company, or
otherwise incurred by Agent and the Banks (using a single law firm
retained by Agent, with the approval of the Majority Banks) in
connection with any Event of Default or the enforcement of the
loans (whether incurred through negotiations, legal proceedings or
otherwise), including by way of description and not limitation,
such charges in any court or bankruptcy proceedings or arising out
of any claim or action by any person against Agent or any Bank
which would not have been asserted were it not for Agent's or such
Bank's relationship with Company hereunder or otherwise, shall also
be paid by Company. All of said amounts required to be paid by
Company hereunder and not paid forthwith upon demand, as aforesaid,
shall bear interest, from the date incurred to the date payment is
received by Agent, at the Prime-based Rate, plus three percent
(3%).

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 42 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

12.6 Notices. Except as otherwise provided herein, all
notices or demands hereunder to the parties hereto shall be
sufficient if made in writing and delivered by messenger or

this Agreement.

12.7 Further Action. Company, from time to time upon written
request of Agent, will make, execute, acknowledge and deliver or
cause to be made, executed, acknowledged and delivered, all such
further and additional instruments, and take all such further
action as may be required to carry out the intent and purpose of
this Agreement, and to provide for the Advances under and payment
of the Term Notes, according to the intent and purpose herein and
therein expressed.

12.8 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of Company and the Banks and
their respective successors and assigns. The foregoing shall not
authorize any assignment by Company of its rights or duties
hereunder, and no such assignment shall be made (or effective)
without the prior written approval of the Banks. Nor may any Bank
sell, assign, transfer, grant participation in, or otherwise
dispose of all or any portion of their respective Term Notes, or of
its right, title and interest therein or thereto or in or to this
Agreement, except in accordance with and subject to the
requirements set forth in Section 13.8 of the Vishay Loan
Agreement, which shall be deemed incorporated by reference herein.

12.9 Indulgence. No delay or failure of Agent and the Banks
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall affect
such right, power or privilege nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any further exercise thereof, nor the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights of
Agent and the Banks hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive
of any rights or remedies which Agent and the Banks would otherwise
have.

12.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, and each executed copy shall constitute an original
instrument, but such counterparts shall together constitute but one
and the same instrument.

12.11 Amendment and Waiver. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or any Loan Document, nor consent to
any departure by the Company therefrom, shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the
Majority Banks, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for
which given; provided, however, that no amendment, waiver or
consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the Banks, do
any of the following: (a) increase any commitment of the Banks

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 43 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

hereunder or subject the Banks to any additional obligations, (b)

or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (c) postpone any
date fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the
Term Notes or any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (d)
waive any Event of Default specified in Sections 10.1(a) or (b)
hereof (provided that if, at the relevant time, only Bid Advances
are outstanding under the DM Loan Agreement or the Vishay Loan
agreement, the prior written approval of all Banks shall be
required to waive, whether consent, waiver or amendment, any Event
of Default under this Agreement), (e) release or defer the granting
or perfecting of a lien or security interest or release any
guaranty or similar undertaking by any Person, except in each case
as shall be otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any
Loan Document, (f) take any action which requires the signing of
all Banks pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any Loan
Document, (g) change the definitions of "Majority Banks" or
"Interest Periods" (h) change the aggregate unpaid principal amount
of the Term Notes which shall be required for the Banks or any of
them to take any action under this Agreement or any Loan Document,

Section 3.5 hereof or reconversions from Dollars to Deutsche Marks
under Section 3.6 hereof, as the case may be, change the currency
in which the Term Loan is denominated or (j) change this Section
12.11, and provided further, however, that no amendment, waiver, or
consent shall, unless in writing and signed by the Agent in
addition to all the Banks, affect the rights or duties of the Agent
under this Agreement or any Loan Document.

12.12 Taxes and Fees. Should any tax (other than a tax based
upon the net income of any Bank), recording or filing fee become
payable in respect of this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents
or any amendment, modification or supplement hereof or thereof,
Vishay agrees to pay or cause Company to pay the same together with
any interest or penalties thereon, and Company and Vishay agree to
hold the Agent and the Banks harmless with respect thereto.

12.13 Confidentiality. Each Bank agrees that it will not
disclose without the prior consent of the Company (other than to
its employees, to another Bank or to its auditors or counsel), any
confidential information with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries which is furnished pursuant to this Agreement or any
of the Loan Documents; provided that any Bank may disclose any such
information (a) as has become generally available to the public or
has been lawfully obtained by such Bank from any third party under
no duty of confidentiality to the Company, (b) as may be required
or appropriate in any report, statement or testimony submitted to,
or in respect to any inquiry, by, any municipal, state or federal
regulatory body having or claiming to have jurisdiction over such
Bank, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System of the United States or the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation or similar organizations (whether in the United States

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 44 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

or elsewhere) or their successors, (c) as may be required or
appropriate in respect to any summons or subpoena or in connection
with any litigation, (d) in order to comply with any law, order,
regulation or ruling applicable to such Bank, and (e) to any
permitted transferror or assignee or any approved participant of,
or with respect to, the Term Notes, as aforesaid.

12.14 Withholding Taxes. If any Bank is not incorporated
under the laws of the United States or a state thereof, such Bank
shall promptly deliver to the Agent two executed copies of (i)
Internal Revenue Service Form 1001 specifying the applicable tax
treaty between the United States and the jurisdiction of such
Bank's domicile which provides for the exemption from withholding
on interest payments to such Bank, (ii) Internal Revenue Service
Form 4224 evidencing that the income to be received by such Bank
hereunder is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or
business in the United States or (iii) other evidence satisfactory
to the Agent that such Bank is exempt from United States income tax
withholding with respect to such income. Such Bank shall amend or
supplement any such form or evidence as required to insure that it
is accurate, complete and non-misleading at all times. Promptly
upon notice from the Agent of any determination by the Internal
Revenue Service that any payments previously made to such Bank
hereunder were subject to United States income tax withholding when
made, such Bank shall pay to the Agent the excess of the aggregate
amount required to be withheld from such payments over the
aggregate amount actually withheld by the Agent. In addition, from
time to time upon the reasonable request and at the sole expense of
the Company or any Permitted Borrower, each Bank and the Agent
shall (to the extent it is able to do so based upon applicable
facts and circumstances), complete and provide the Company or any
Permitted Borrower with such forms, certificates or other documents
as may be reasonably necessary to allow the Company or any
Permitted Borrower, as applicable, to make any payment under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents without any withholding for
or on the account of any tax under Section 5.1(d) hereof (or with
such withholding at a reduced rate), provided that the execution
and delivery of such forms, certificates or other documents does
not adversely affect or otherwise restrict the right and benefits
(including without limitation economic benefits) available to such
Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any
of the other Loan Documents, or under or in connection with any
transactions not related to the transactions contemplated hereby.

12.15 Effective Upon Execution. This Agreement shall become
effective upon the execution hereof by Banks, Agent, Vishay and
Company and shall remain effective until the Indebtedness has been
repaid and discharged in full and no commitment to make Advances
hereunder, under the Vishay Loan Agreement or under the DM Loan
Agreement remains outstanding.

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 45 -- EXHIBIT 10.3 (DM 104,315,990.20 TERM LOAN AGREEMENT)

12.16 Severability. In case any one or more of the
obligations of the Company under this Agreement, the Notes or any
of the other Loan Documents shall be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining obligations of the Company shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in one jurisdiction
shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of the
obligations of the Company under this Agreement, the Notes or any
of the other Loan Documents in any other jurisdiction.

12.17 Table of Contents and Headings. The table of contents
and the headings of the various subdivisions hereof are for
convenience of reference only and shall in no way modify or affect
any of the terms or provisions hereof.

12.18 Construction of Certain Provisions. If any provision of
this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents refers to any action to
be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from
taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action is
taken directly or indirectly by such Person, whether or not
expressly specified in such provision.

12.19 Independence of Covenants. Each covenant hereunder
shall be given independent effect (subject to any exceptions stated
in such covenant) so that if a particular action or condition is
not permitted by any such covenant (taking into account any such
stated exception), the fact that it would be permitted by an
exception to, or would be otherwise within the limitations of,
another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an
Event of Default if such action is taken or such condition exists.

12.20 Reliance on and Survival of Various Provisions. All
terms, covenants, agreements, representations and warranties of the

(a) on or before December 31, 1994, (Bank's percentage

or, if applicable from time to time under the Agreement, the
Prime-based Rate.

All accrued and unpaid interest on the Indebtedness
outstanding under this Note from time to time shall be due and
payable in full, in immediately available funds, (a) whenever the
Deutsche Mark-based Rate shall be in effect, (i) on the last day
of each Interest Period, and, (ii) if such Interest Period is
longer than 3 months, at intervals of 3 months after the first
day of the applicable Interest Period, and (b) whenever the

provided in the Agreement), commencing on the last day of the
calendar quarter coinciding with or next following the date of
such conversion and on the last day of each calendar quarter
thereafter, and on the date of any reconversion to a Deutsche

accrued interest, shall be due and payable in full.

In the event and so long as any default or Event of Default

three (3) Business Days, then for such other period of time as
the Agent may elect which shall in no event be longer than six
(6) months) deposits in Deutsche Marks in the amount of such
overdue payment due to the Agent are offered by the Agent's
Eurocurrency Lending Office for the applicable period determined
as provided above, or (b) if at any such time such deposits are
not offered by the Agent's Eurocurrency Lending Office, then at a
rate per annum equal to three percent (3%) above the rate
determined by the Agent to be its aggregate marginal cost
(including the cost of maintaining any required reserves or
deposit insurance) of carrying the amount (in Deutsche Marks) of
the Indebtedness then outstanding.

Interest accruing under this Note at the Deutsche Mark-based
Rate shall be computed on a basis of a 360 day year and assessed
for the actual number of days elapsed from the first day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, to, but not including the
last day thereof. Interest accruing at the Prime-based Rate shall

applicable thereto, in which event said interest shall be repaid
in Dollars.

Prime-based Advances, the Federal Funds
Effective Rate, and with respect to
Eurocurrency-based Advances, Agent's aggregate
marginal cost (including the cost of
maintaining any required reserves or deposit
insurance and of any fees, penalties,
overdraft charges or other costs or expenses
incurred by Agent as a result of such failure
to deliver funds hereunder) of carrying such
amount; and

(ii) in the case of Company, the rate of interest
then applicable to the Term Loan.

The obligation of any Bank to make any Advance hereunder shall
not be affected by the failure of any other Bank to make any
Advance hereunder, and no Bank shall have any liability to the
Company or its Subsidiaries, the Agent, any other Bank, or any
other party for another Bank's failure to make any loan or
Advance hereunder.

2.11 Fixed Rate Election. (a) The Fixed Rate Election shall
set forth the information required on the Fixed Rate Election form

greater than ten (10) Business Days prior to the proposed
effective date of such election, and once delivered to Agent
by the Company, shall not be revocable by Company;

(c) In order for the Fixed Rate to become effective,
the following conditions shall be satisfied by the Company
(unless waived by the Banks) on or before the proposed
effective date of the Fixed Rate Election, and shall remain
satisfied on the actual effective date thereof:

(i) As of the proposed effective date of
the Fixed Rate Election, and as of the
<PAGE>

actual effective date thereof, no 
Eurocurrency-based Advance of the Term 
Loan shall be outstanding;

(ii) All accrued interest outstanding under
the Term Notes as of the effective date
of the Fixed Rate Election has been paid
and discharged in full;

(iii) both before and after the effective date
of such election, the obligations of
Company set forth in this Agreement are
valid, binding and enforceable
obligations of Company;

(iv) there is no Default or Event of Default
in existence, and none will exist upon

and

(v) the execution of such election will not

Subsidiaries;

(d) Subject to the foregoing, the Fixed Rate Election
shall become effective (and the Fixed Rate shall become the
Applicable Interest Rate for the Term Loan) on the proposed
effective date of the Fixed Rate Election, as specified by the
Company, whereupon Agent will notify Company and the Banks
promptly of the Fixed Rate established by it hereunder. If a
Fixed Rate Election has been submitted by Company hereunder,
the Prime-base Rate shall be the only rate available to
Company for the refunding or conversion of outstanding
Advances of the Term Loan after such submission.

(e) Company shall be entitled to deliver only one
Fixed Rate Election for the Term Loan while this
Agreement is in effect, and once so elected, the Fixed
Rate shall, subject to the terms hereof, remain the
Applicable Interest Rate for the Term Loan so long as the
Term Loan is outstanding hereunder.

(f) Interest accruing at the Fixed Rate shall be
payable in immediately available funds quarterly
commencing on the last day of the calendar quarter in
which the Fixed Rate Election shall have been made by the
Company, and continuing on the last day of each calendar
quarter thereafter until the Term Loan Maturity Date,
shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and
assessed for the actual number of days elapsed. In the
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 28 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

event and so long as any Event of Default shall exist
under any Term Note or under the Vishay Loan Agreement or 
any of the other Loan Documents, interest shall be 
payable daily on the Indebtedness evidenced by the Term 
Notes from time to time outstanding at a per annum rate 
equal to the Fixed Rate, plus three percent (3%).

2.12 Prime-based Advance in Absence of Election or Upon
Default. If, as to any outstanding Eurocurrency-based Advance,
Agent has not received payment on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, or does not receive a timely Request for
Term Loan Advance and Rate Request meeting the requirements of
Section 2.9 with respect to the refunding or conversion of such
Advance, or if on such day a Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the principal amount thereof which is
not then prepaid in the case of a Eurocurrency-based Advance shall
be converted automatically to a Prime-based Advance and the Agent
shall thereafter promptly notify Company of said action.

2.13 Prepayment. (a) Company may prepay all or part of the
outstanding balance of any Prime-based Advance(s) under its Term
Notes at any time (subject to not less than one (1) Business Day's
notice to Agent), provided that the amount of any partial
prepayment by such party shall be at least One Million Dollars
($1,000,000) and the aggregate balance of Prime-based Advance(s)
remaining outstanding on such Notes shall be at least One Million
Dollars ($1,000,000). Company may prepay all or part of any
Eurocurrency-based Advance (subject to not less than three (3)
Business Days' notice to Agent) only on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, provided that the amount of any
such partial prepayment by such party shall be at least One Million
Dollars ($1,000,000), and the unpaid portion of such Advance which
is refunded or converted by such party under Section 2.9 hereof
shall be at least Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000). Furthermore,
no such prepayment may be made using funds advanced, directly or
indirectly, by the Banks under this Agreement or the DM Loan
Agreement. Upon Agent's request in connection with any prepayment,
Company shall provide evidence satisfactory to the Majority Banks
that the source of funding for such prepayment consists of new
equity, surplus cash (not the result of any Advance under this
Agreement) or otherwise was not derived, directly or indirectly,
from any Advance hereunder. Any prepayment made in accordance with
this Section shall be without premium or penalty (subject to
Section 10 hereof), but there shall be no readvance or reborrowing
of any principal reductions of the Term Loan (whether or not such
principal reductions constitute prepayments).

(b) Once the Fixed Rate becomes the applicable Interest
Rate for the Term Loan hereunder, at its option and upon not less
than five (5) business days prior written notice to Agent, Company
may prepay the principal balance outstanding under the Term Loan in
whole or in part (in amounts of not less than Five Million Dollars
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 29 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

($5,000,000) only upon payment to the Agent, for distribution to
the Banks pro rata, of a Yield Maintenance Payment in an amount
calculated by Agent to make the Banks whole (to the extent of the
interest which would have been earned by the Banks but for the
occurrence of such prepayment) on the basis of the discounted net
present values of the interest payments that would otherwise be
payable on the principal amount of the Term Loan being prepaid,
after taking into account the amount of interest which would be
payable on each interest payment due date if the principal amount
being repaid were reinvested at the Current Market Rate (defined
below).

As used herein, "Current Market Rate" shall mean a per annum
interest rate equal to one-half percentage point (.5%) above the
rate reasonably determined by Agent (based on quotations from
established dealers) to be in effect two (2) days prior to the
repayment date in the secondary market for United States Treasury
Securities of a comparable amount and with a comparable term to
maturity as the principal amount being prepaid hereunder. For
purposes of computation, the discount rate for each computation
will be the Current Market Rate for the relevant principal
installment.

Upon any involuntary prepayment of the Term Loan hereunder, whether
by acceleration, or otherwise, the Company shall pay to Agent, for
distribution to the Banks pro rata, a Yield Maintenance Payment in
an amount equal to the Yield Maintenance Payment which would have
been due and payable hereunder if the Company had voluntarily
elected to prepay the Term Loan (in an amount equal to such
involuntary prepayment) on such date of involuntary prepayment.

2.14 Use of Term Loan Proceeds. The proceeds of the Term
Loan shall be used by the Company solely for the purpose of funding
amounts required to be paid by it for or in connection with the
Target Company Acquisition, including without limitation provision
for transfer taxes, stamp duties and brokerage fees resulting
directly from such Acquisition.

3. BRIDGE LOAN

3.1 Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement (including without limitation those conditions specified
or incorporated by reference in Section 6 hereof) and subject to

under Section 2 hereof, each Bank, severally and for itself alone,
agrees to advance to the Company, in a single Advance in Dollars on
or before Agent's close of business on the Funding Expiration Date,
sums not to exceed in the aggregate such Bank's respective
Percentage of the Bridge Loan. Advances of the Bridge Loan shall be
evidenced by Bridge Notes executed and delivered by the Company to
each of the Banks concurrently herewith in the form attached hereto

<PAGE>
<PAGE> 30 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

in form and substance) and in the face amount of each Bank's
respective Percentage thereof. The commitment of the Banks to fund

(subject to Section 3.3 hereof), after which date the Company shall
no longer be entitled to the Advance of the Bridge Loan.

3.2 Repayment of Principal. The Bridge Notes, and all
principal, interest and other sums outstanding thereunder, shall
mature and become due and payable in full on the Bridge Loan

installments of principal shall be required under the Bridge Notes.
There shall be no readvance or reborrowing of any principal
reductions of the Bridge Loan.

3.3 Extension of Funding Expiration Date. So long as no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing on the
date of its request therefor (or upon the effective date of any
such extension), the Company may extend the initial Funding
Expiration Date, or any succeeding Funding Expiration Date as
extended hereunder, upon written notice to Agent prior to the
Funding Expiration Date then in effect, as follows:

(d) From July 18, 1995 to July 18, 1996, provided
that Installment 4 of the Bridge Loan Extension Fee has been
paid or is paid concurrently with such request.

3.4 Accrual of Interest. Each Advance of Indebtedness
evidenced by the Bridge Notes from time to time outstanding
hereunder shall, from and after the date of such Advance, bear
interest at its Applicable Interest Rate. The amount and date of
each Advance, its Applicable Interest Rate, its Interest Period,
and the amount and date of any repayment shall be noted on Agent's
records, which records will be conclusive evidence thereof, absent
manifest error.

3.5 Prime-based Interest Payments. Interest on the unpaid
balance of Indebtedness evidenced by the Bridge Notes which is
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 31 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

funded or carried as a Prime-based Advance from time to time shall
accrue from the date of such Advance to the Bridge Loan Maturity
Date (or until refunded, converted or paid), at a per annum
interest rate equal to the Prime-based Rate, and shall be payable
in immediately available funds quarterly commencing on the last day
of the calendar quarter in which the Advance under the applicable
Bridge Notes is made, and continuing on the last day of each
calendar quarter thereafter until the Bridge Loan Maturity Date.
Interest accruing at the Prime-based Rate shall be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year and assessed for the actual number of days
elapsed, and in such computation effect shall be given to any
change in the interest rate resulting from a change in the Prime-
based Rate on the date of such change in the Prime-based Rate.

3.6 Eurocurrency-based Interest Payments. Interest on
Indebtedness evidenced by the Bridge Notes which is funded or
carried as a 1-month, 2-month and 3-month Eurocurrency-based
Advance from time to time shall accrue at its Applicable Interest
Rate and shall be payable in immediately available funds on the
last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto. Interest on
Indebtedness evidenced by the Bridge Notes which is funded or
carried as a 6-month Eurocurrency-based Advance outstanding from
time to time shall be payable in immediately available funds at
intervals of 3 months after the first day of the applicable
Interest Period, and on the last day of the applicable Interest
Period. Interest accruing at the Eurocurrency-based Rate shall be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year and assessed for the actual
number of days elapsed from the first day of the Interest Period
applicable thereto to, but not including, the last day thereof.

3.7 Interest Payments on Conversions. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the preceding Sections, all accrued and
unpaid interest on any Advance of the Bridge Loan converted
pursuant to Section 3.9 hereof shall be due and payable in full on
the date such Advance of the Bridge Loan is converted.

3.8 Interest on Default. In the event and so long as any
Event of Default shall exist under any Bridge Note or under this
Agreement, interest shall be payable daily on all Advances
evidenced by the Bridge Notes from time to time outstanding at a
per annum rate equal to the Applicable Interest Rate, plus three
percent (3%) for the remainder of the then existing Interest
Period, if any, and at all other such times, with respect to
Domestic Advances from time to time outstanding, at a per annum
rate equal to the Prime-based Rate plus three percent (3%), and,
with respect to Eurocurrency-based Advances from time to time
outstanding under the Bridge Notes, (i) at a per annum rate
calculated by the Agent, whose determination shall be conclusive
absent manifest error, on a daily basis, equal to three percent
(3%) above the interest rate per annum at which one (1) day
deposits (or, if such amount due remains unpaid for more than three
(3) Business Days, then for such other period of time as the Agent
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 32 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

to the Agent are offered by the Eurocurrency Lending Office for the
applicable period determined as provided above, or (ii) if at any
such time such deposits are not offered by the Eurocurrency Lending
Office, then at a rate per annum equal to three percent (3%) above
the rate determined by the Agent to be its aggregate marginal cost
(including the cost of maintaining any required reserves or deposit
insurance) of carrying the amount of such Eurocurrency Advance.

3.9 Request for and Refundings and Conversions of Advances.
Company may request the Advance of the Bridge Loan, refund any
Advance of the Bridge Loan in the same type of Advance or convert

3.10 Disbursement of Advances.
------------------------

(a) Upon receiving any Request for Bridge Loan
Advance and Rate Request from Company in compliance with
Section 3.9 hereof, Agent shall promptly notify each Bank by
wire, telex or by telephone (confirmed by wire, telecopy or
telex) of the amount of such Advance to be made and the date
such Advance is to be made by said Bank pursuant to its
Percentage of the Advance. Unless such Bank's commitment to
make Advances hereunder shall have been suspended or
terminated in accordance with this Agreement, each Bank shall
make available to Agent the amount of its Percentage of the
Advance in immediately available funds, as follows:

(i) for Prime-based Advances, at the office of
Agent located at One Detroit Center, 500
Woodward Avenue, Detroit, Michigan 48226, not
later than 2:00 p.m. (Detroit time) on the
date of such Advance; and

(ii) for Eurocurrency-based Advances, at the
Agent's Correspondent for the account of the
Eurocurrency Lending Office of the Agent, not
later than 12 Noon (the time of the Agent's
Correspondent) on the date of such Advance.

(b) Subject to submission of an executed Request
for Bridge Loan Advance and Rate Request by Company without
exceptions noted in the compliance certification therein,
Agent shall make available to Company the aggregate of the
amounts, in Dollars, so received by it from the Banks in like
funds:

(i) for Prime-based Advances, not later than 4:00
p.m. (Detroit time) on the date of such
Advance by deposit to an account of the
Company maintained with Agent, or to such
other account or third party as Company may

(ii) for Eurocurrency-based Advances, not later
than 4:00 p.m. (the time of the Agent's

deposit to an account of the Company
maintained with Agent's Correspondent, or to
such other account or third party as Company
may reasonably direct.

(c) Agent shall deliver the documents and papers
received by it for the account of each Bank to such Bank or
upon its order. Unless Agent shall have been notified by any
Bank prior to the date of any proposed Advance that such Bank
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 35 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

does not intend to make available to Agent such Bank's 
Percentage of the Advance, Agent may assume that such Bank has 
made such amount available to Agent on such date, as aforesaid 
and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to 
Company a corresponding amount. If such amount is not in fact 
made available to Agent by such Bank, as aforesaid, Agent 
shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such 
Bank. If such Bank does not pay such amount forthwith upon 
Agent's demand therefor, the Agent shall promptly notify 
Company and Company shall pay such amount to Agent. Agent 
shall also be entitled to recover from such Bank or Company, 
as the case may be, interest on such amount in respect of each 
day from the date such amount was made available by Agent to
Company to the date such amount is recovered by Agent, at a 
rate per annum equal to:

(i) in the case of such Bank, with respect to
Prime-based Advances, the Federal Funds
Effective Rate, and with respect to
Eurocurrency-based Advances, Agent's aggregate
marginal cost (including the cost of
maintaining any required reserves or deposit
insurance and of any fees, penalties,
overdraft charges or other costs or expenses
incurred by Agent as a result of such failure
to deliver funds hereunder) of carrying such
amount; and

(ii) in the case of Company, the rate of interest
then applicable to the Bridge Loan.

The obligation of any Bank to make any Advance hereunder shall
not be affected by the failure of any other Bank to make any
Advance hereunder, and no Bank shall have any liability to the
Company or its Subsidiaries, the Agent, any other Bank, or any
other party for another Bank's failure to make any loan or
Advance hereunder.

3.11 Prime-based Advance in Absence of Election or Upon
Default. If, as to any outstanding Eurocurrency-based Advance,
Agent has not received payment on the last day of the Interest
Period applicable thereto, or does not receive a timely Request for
Term Loan Advance and Rate Request meeting the requirements of
Section 3.9 with respect to the refunding or conversion of such
Advance, or if on such day a Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing, the principal amount thereof which is
not then prepaid in the case of a Eurocurrency-based Advance shall
be converted automatically to a Prime-based Advance and the Agent
shall thereafter promptly notify Company of said action.

3.12 Prepayment. Company may prepay all or part of the
outstanding balance of any Prime-based Advance(s) under its Bridge
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 36 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

Notes at any time (subject to not less than one (1) Business Day's
notice to Agent), provided that the amount of any partial
prepayment by such party shall be at least One Million Dollars
($1,000,000) and the aggregate balance of Prime-based Advance(s)
remaining outstanding on such Notes shall be at least One Million
Dollars ($1,000,000). Company may prepay all or part of any
Eurocurrency-based Advance (subject to not less than three (3)
Business Days' notice to Agent) only on the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, provided that the amount of any
such partial prepayment by such party shall be at least One Million
Dollars ($1,000,000), and the unpaid portion of such Advance which
is refunded or converted by such party under Section 3.9 hereof
shall be at least Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000). Furthermore,
no such prepayment may be made using funds advanced, directly or
indirectly, by the Banks under this Agreement or the DM Loan
Agreement. Upon Agent's request in connection with any prepayment,
Company shall provide evidence satisfactory to the Majority Banks
that the source of funding for such prepayment consists of new
equity, surplus cash (not the result of any Advance under this
Agreement) or otherwise was not derived, directly or indirectly,
from any Advance hereunder. Any prepayment made in accordance with
this Section shall be without premium or penalty (subject to
Section 10 hereof), but there shall be no readvance or reborrowing
of any principal reductions of the Bridge Loan (whether or not such
principal reductions constitute prepayments).

3.13 Bridge Loan Extension Fee. From the date hereof to the
Bridge Loan Maturity Date, (i) unless (if the Bridge Loan has not
been funded prior thereto) the Banks' commitment to fund the Bridge
Loan has been cancelled by written notice to Agent prior thereto or
(ii) unless (if the Bridge Loan has been funded prior thereto) the
Bridge Loan has been paid and discharged in full prior thereto, as
the case may be, the Company shall pay to the Banks a Bridge Loan
Extension Fee as follows:

(a) on or before October 18, 1994, the sum of Fifty

Thousand Dollars ($50,000) ("Installment 2");

(c) on or before April 18, 1995, the sum of Fifty Thousand
Dollars ($50,000) ("Installment 3"); and

(d) on or before July 18, 1995, the sum of Two Hundred
Thousand Dollars ($200,000) ("Installment 4").

Whenever any payment of the Bridge Loan Extension Fee shall be due
and payable on a day which is not a Business Day, the date for
payment thereof shall be extended to the next Business Day. Upon
receipt of each payment of the Bridge Loan Extension Fee, Agent
shall make prompt payment to each Bank of its share of the Bridge
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 37 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

Loan Extension Fee based on the respective percentages of the
Banks. The Bridge Loan Extension Fee shall not be refundable under
any circumstances.

3.14 Bridge Loan Commitment Fee. From and after the date
hereof to (but not including) the date of funding of the Bridge
Loan by the Banks hereunder, the Company shall pay to the Agent,
for distribution to the Banks based on their respective
percentages, a Bridge Loan Commitment Fee equal to the Applicable
Fee Percentage per annum times One Hundred Million Dollars
($100,000,000), calculated on a daily basis. The Bridge Loan
Commitment Fee shall be payable quarterly in arrears commencing on
September 30, 1994 and on the last day of each calendar quarter
thereafter and, unless funded concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, on the date of funding of the Bridge
Loan, and shall be computed on the basis of a year of three hundred
sixty (360) days and assessed for the actual number of days
elapsed. Whenever any payment of the Bridge Loan Commitment Fee
shall be due and payable on a day which is not a Business Day, the
date for payment shall be extended to the next Business Day. Upon
receipt of each such payment of the Bridge Loan Commitment Fee,
Agent shall make prompt payment to each Bank of its share of the
Bridge Loan Commitment Fee based upon the respective percentages of
the Banks. It is expressly understood that the Bridge Loan
Commitment Fee shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

3.15 Use of Bridge Loan Proceeds. The proceeds of the Bridge
Loan shall be used by the Company solely for the purpose of funding
amounts (in addition to the proceeds of the Term Loan) required to
be paid by it for or in connection with the Target Company
Acquisition, including without limitation provision for transfer
taxes, stamp duties and brokerage fees resulting directly from such
Acquisition.

4. MARGIN ADJUSTMENTS; HLT DETERMINATION; SPECIAL
LIMITATION

4.1 Margin Adjustments. Adjustments to the Applicable
Margin, based on Schedule 4.1, shall be implemented on a quarterly
basis as follows:

(i) Such Margin adjustments shall be given
prospective effect only, effective (A) as to all Prime-based
Advances outstanding hereunder, immediately upon required date of
delivery of the financial statements required to be delivered under
Section 7.3(b) and 7.3(c) of the Vishay Loan Agreement establishing
applicability of the appropriate adjustments, if any, or on the
obtaining and/or any change in the Rating Level then in effect, as
applicable and (B) as to each Eurocurrency-based Advance
outstanding hereunder, effective upon the expiration of the
applicable Interest Period(s), if any, in effect on (x) the
required date of delivery of the latest of such financial
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 38 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

statements required to be delivered hereunder during such Interest
Period(s) or (y) the date of the obtaining and/or any change in the
Rating Level in effect hereunder, as applicable, in each case with
no retroactivity or claw-back.

(ii) With respect to Eurocurrency-based Advances
outstanding hereunder, an adjustment hereunder, after becoming
effective, shall remain in effect only through the end of the
applicable Interest Period(s) for such Eurocurrency-based Advances
if any; provided, however, that upon the delivery of quarterly
financial statements demonstrating any change in the Leverage Ratio
or the obtaining and/or change in the Rating Level then in effect,
as aforesaid, or the occurrence of any other event which under the
terms hereof causes such adjustment no longer to be applicable,
then any such subsequent adjustment or no adjustment, as the case
may be, shall be effective (and said pricing shall thereby be
adjusted up or down, as applicable), with the commencement of each
Interest Period following such change or event, all in accordance
with the preceding subparagraph.

4.2 HLT Determination. In the event at any time (whether
before or after the funding of the Acquisition Loans) of an HLT
Determination, the Agent, the Banks and the Company shall commence
negotiations in good faith to agree upon whether and, if so, the
extent to which fees, interest rates and/or margins hereunder
should be increased so as to reflect such HLT Determination and to
compensate the Banks and Agent for additional costs, expenses
and/or fees which result from or are associated with any such HLT
Determination, including without limitation any costs resulting
from any requirement that additional capital be allocated to the
Indebtedness, or any portion thereof. If Company and the Majority
Banks agree that fees, interest rates and/or margins should be
increased, and agree on the amount of such increase or increases,
this Agreement may be amended to give effect to such increase or
increases as provided in Section 13.11 hereof. If Company and
Majority Banks fail to agree on whether and, if so, the extent to
which fees, interest rates and/or margins hereunder should be
increased within 60 days after notice to Company of an HLT
Determination as herein provided, then (i) the Agent shall, if
requested by the Majority Banks, by written notice to the Company
terminate the commitments of the Banks to fund and/or maintain
Advances of the Revolving Credit under the Vishay Loan Agreement
and the DM Revolving Credit, and if still outstanding, any
commitment to fund Advances of the Acquisition Loans, and such
commitments shall thereupon terminate, (ii) Company shall be
obligated to repay all outstanding Indebtedness at the end of the
Interest Period applicable thereto and (iii) the Company may, at
its option, on at least ten Business Days' written notice to the
Agent (which shall promptly notify the Banks thereof) prepay all
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 39 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

Indebtedness outstanding hereunder and under the other Loan
Agreements by paying the aggregate principal amount thereof,
together, with all accrued interest thereon to the date of
prepayment; provided that, if the Company prepays any fixed rate
loans or Advances carried at the Eurocurrency-based Rate or any
comparable rate, pursuant to this Section 4.2, Company shall
compensate the Banks for any resulting funding losses as provided
in Section 11.1 hereof. Subject to compliance by Company with this
Section 4.2, the Banks acknowledge that an HLT Determination shall
not constitute a Default or an Event of Default hereunder.

4.3 Special Limitation. In the event, as a result of
increases in the value of any of the Alternative Currencies against
the Dollar or for any other reason, the obligation of any of the
Banks to advance additional funds hereunder and under the other
Loan Agreements (taking into account the Dollar Amount of the
Indebtedness outstanding from time to time under the other Loan
Agreements, and any other Indebtedness required to be aggregated
under 12 USCA 84, as amended, the regulations promulgated
thereunder, or other, similar applicable law) is determined by such
Bank to exceed its then applicable legal lending limit under 12
USCA 84, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder, or
other, similar applicable laws, the amount of additional funds
which such Bank shall be obligated to advance hereunder and under
the other Loan Agreements shall immediately be reduced to the
maximum amount which such Bank may legally advance (as determined
by such Bank), the obligation of each of the remaining Banks
hereunder shall be proportionately reduced, based on the applicable
Percentages, and, to the extent necessary under such laws and
regulations (as determined by each of the Banks, with respect to
the applicability of such laws and regulations to itself), the
Company shall reduce, or cause to be reduced, complying to the
extent practicable with the remaining provisions hereof, the
Indebtedness outstanding hereunder or under the other Loan
Agreements by an amount sufficient to comply with such maximum
amounts. Upon any such reduction in the obligations of the Banks
under this Section 4.3, Company shall have the right, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement (but subsequent to
Company's compliance with its obligation to reduce the Indebtedness
outstanding hereunder), to add to the Banks providing financing
hereunder a bank reasonably acceptable to the Agent for the purpose
of restoring the shortfall created by the reduction in such
obligations of the Banks.

10. PAYMENTS, RECOVERIES AND COLLECTIONS.

10.1 Payment Procedure.

(a) All payments by Company of principal of, or
interest on, the Term Notes or the Bridge Notes or of any
Fees, shall be made without setoff or counterclaim on the date
specified for payment under this Agreement not later than
11:00 a.m. (Detroit time) in Dollars in immediately available
funds to Agent, for the ratable account of the Banks, at
Agent's office located at One Detroit Center, Detroit,
Michigan 48226, in respect of Domestic Advances. Upon receipt
of each such payment, the Agent shall make prompt payment to
each Bank, or, in respect of Eurocurrency-based Advances, such
Bank's Eurocurrency Lending Office, in like funds and
currencies, of all amounts received by it for the account of
such Bank.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 47 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

(b) Unless the Agent shall have been notified by
the Company prior to the date on which any payment to be made
by the Company is due that the Company does not intend to
remit such payment, the Agent may, in its discretion, assume
that the Company has remitted such payment when so due and the
Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to 
each Bank on such payment date an amount equal to such Bank's 
share of such assumed payment. If the Company has not in fact 
remitted such payment to the Agent, each Bank shall forthwith 
on demand repay to the Agent in the applicable currency the 
amount of such assumed payment made available to such Bank, 
together with the interest thereon, in respect of each day 
from and including the date such amount was made available by 
the Agent to such Bank to the date such amount is repaid to 
the Agent at a rate per annum equal to (i) for Domestic 
Advances, the Federal Funds Effective Rate (daily average), as 
the same may vary from time to time, and (ii) with respect to 
Eurocurrency-based Advances, Agent's aggregate marginal cost 
(including the cost of maintaining any required reserves or
deposit insurance and of any fees, penalties, overdraft 
charges or other costs or expenses incurred by Agent) of 
carrying such amount.

(c) Whenever any payment to be made hereunder
(other than payments in respect of any Eurocurrency-based
Advance) shall otherwise be due on a day which is not a
Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next
succeeding Business Day and such extension of time shall be
included in computing interest, if any, in connection with
such payment. Whenever any payment of principal of, or
interest on, a Eurocurrency-based Advance shall be due on a
day which is not a Business Day the date of payment thereof
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless
as a result thereof it would fall in the next calendar month,
in which case it shall be shortened to the next preceding
Business Day and, in the case of a payment of principal,
interest thereon shall be payable for such extended or
shortened time, if any.

(d) All payments to be made by the Company under
this Agreement or any of the Notes shall be made without set-
off or counterclaim, as aforesaid, and without deduction for
or on account of any present or future withholding or other
taxes of any nature imposed by any governmental authority or
of any political subdivision thereof or any federation or
organization of which such governmental authority may at the
time of payment be a member, unless Company is compelled by
law to make payment subject to such tax. In such event,
Company shall:

(i) pay to the Agent, for Agent's own account
and/or, as the case may be, for the account of
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 48 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

the Banks such additional amounts as may be
necessary to ensure that the Agent and/or such
Banks receive a net amount in the applicable
currency equal to the full amount which would
have been receivable had payment not been made
subject to such tax; and

(ii) remit such tax to the relevant taxing
authorities according to applicable law, and
send to the Agent such certificates or
certified copy receipts as the Agent shall
reasonably require as proof of the payment by
the Company or the applicable Permitted
Borrower, of any such taxes payable by the
Company or any Permitted Borrower.

As used herein, the terms "tax", "taxes" and "taxation"
include all existing taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees,
deductions and withholdings and any restrictions or conditions
resulting in a charge together with interest thereon and fines and
penalties with respect thereto which may be imposed by reason of
any violation or default with respect to the law regarding such
tax, assessed as a result of or in connection with the transactions
in any Alternative Currency hereunder, or the payment and or
receipt of funds in any Alternative Currency hereunder, or the
payment or delivery of funds into or out of any jurisdiction other
than the United States (whether assessed against Company, Agent or
any of the Banks).

10.2 Application of Proceeds. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of any Event of Default, any offsets or voluntary
payments by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or others and any
other sums received or collected in respect of the Indebtedness,
shall be applied, first, to the Notes pro rata, based on the
aggregate Indebtedness then outstanding thereunder (or in such
other order and manner as determined by all of the Banks), next, to
any other Indebtedness on a pro rata basis, and then, if there is
any excess, to the Company.

10.3 Pro-rata Recovery. If any Bank shall obtain any payment
or other recovery (whether voluntary, involuntary, by application
of offset or otherwise) on account of principal of, or interest on,
any of the Term Notes or the Bridge Notes in excess of its pro rata
share of payments then or thereafter obtained by all Banks upon
principal of and interest on all such Notes or Bridge Notes, such
Bank shall purchase from the other Banks such participations in the
Term Notes and Bridge Notes held by them as shall be necessary to
cause such purchasing Bank to share the excess payment or other
recovery ratably in accordance with the Percentage held by each of
them in such Notes; provided, however, that if all or any portion
of the excess payment or other recovery is thereafter recovered
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 49 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

from such purchasing holder, the purchase shall be rescinded and
the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, but
without interest.

10.4 Deposits and Accounts. In addition to and not in
limitation of any rights of any Bank or other holder of any of the
Notes under applicable law, each Bank and each other such holder
shall, upon acceleration of the Indebtedness under the Notes and
without notice or demand of any kind, have the right to appropriate
and apply to the payment of the Notes owing to it (whether or not
then due) any and all balances, credits, deposits, accounts or
moneys of Company then or thereafter with such Bank or other
holder; provided, however, that any such amount so applied by any
Bank or other holder on any of the Notes owing to it shall be
subject to the provisions of Section 10.3, hereof.

11. CHANGES IN LAW OR CIRCUMSTANCES; INCREASED COSTS.

11.1 Reimbursement of Prepayment Costs. As to any
Eurocurrency-based Advance, if any prepayment thereof shall occur
on any day other than the last day of an Interest Period (whether
pursuant to this Agreement or by acceleration, or otherwise), or if
the rate applicable to such Advance shall be changed during any
Interest Period pursuant to this Agreement, Company shall reimburse
each of the Banks on demand for any costs incurred by such Banks as
a result of the timing thereof, including but not limited to any
net costs incurred in liquidating or employing deposits from third
parties, to each Bank which shall have delivered to Company a
certificate setting forth the basis for determining such costs,
which certificate shall be conclusively presumed correct save for
manifest error.

11.2 Eurocurrency Lending Office. For any Advance to which
the Eurocurrency-based Rate is applicable, if Agent or a Bank, as
applicable, shall designate a Eurocurrency Lending Office which
maintains books separate from those of the rest of Agent, Agent or
such Bank, as the case may be, shall have the option of maintaining
and carrying the relevant Advance on the books of such Eurocurrency
Lending Office.

11.3 Circumstances Affecting Eurocurrency-based Rate
Availability. If with respect to any Interest Period Agent or the
Banks (after consultation with Agent) shall determine that, by
reason of circumstances affecting the foreign exchange and
interbank markets generally, deposits in Eurodollars in the
applicable amounts are not being offered to the Agent for such
Interest Period, then Agent shall forthwith give notice thereof to
the Company. Thereafter, until Agent notifies Company that such
circumstances no longer exist, (i) the obligation of Banks to make
Eurocurrency-based Advances, and the right of Company to convert an
Advance to or refund an Advance as a Eurocurrency-based Advance, as
the case may be, shall be suspended, and (ii) the Company shall
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 50 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

repay in full (or cause to be repaid in full) the then outstanding
principal amount of each such Eurocurrency-based Advance covered
hereby, together with accrued interest thereon, any amounts payable
under Section 11.6, hereof, and all other amounts payable hereunder
on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to
such Advance. Upon the date for repayment as aforesaid and unless
Company notifies Agent to the contrary within two (2) Business Days
after receiving a notice from Agent pursuant to this Section, such
outstanding principal amount shall be converted to a Prime-based
Advance as of the last day of such Interest Period.

11.4 Laws Affecting Eurocurrency-based Advance Availability.
If, after the date hereof, the introduction of, or any change in,
any applicable law, rule or regulation or in the interpretation or
administration thereof by any governmental authority charged with
the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any
of the Banks (or any of their respective Eurocurrency Lending
Offices) with any request or directive (whether or not having the
force of law) of any such authority, shall make it unlawful or
impossible for any of the Banks (or any of their respective
Eurocurrency Lending Offices) to honor its obligations hereunder to
make or maintain any Advance with interest at the Eurocurrency-
based Rate, such Bank shall forthwith give notice thereof to
Company and to Agent. Thereafter, (a) the obligations of Banks to
make Eurocurrency-based Advances and the right of Company to
convert an Advance or refund an Advance as a Eurocurrency-based
Advance shall be suspended and thereafter Company may select as
Applicable Interest Rates only those which remain available and
which are permitted to be selected hereunder, and (b) if any of the
Banks may not lawfully continue to maintain an Advance to the end
of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto as a
Eurocurrency-based Advance, the applicable Advance shall
immediately be converted to a Prime-based Advance (in the Dollar
Amount thereof) and the Prime-based Rate shall be applicable
thereto for the remainder of such Interest Period. For purposes of
this Section, a change in law, rule, regulation, interpretation or
administration shall include, without limitation, any change made
or which becomes effective on the basis of a law, rule, regulation,
interpretation or administration presently in force, the effective
date of which change is delayed by the terms of such law, rule,
regulation, interpretation or administration.

11.5 Increased Cost of Eurocurrency-based Advances. If the
adoption after the date hereof, or any change after the date hereof
in, any applicable law, rule or regulation of any governmental
authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the
interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by Agent or
any of the Banks (or any of their respective Eurocurrency Lending
Offices) with any request or directive (whether or not having the
force of law) made by any such authority, central bank or
comparable agency after the date hereof:
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 51 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

(a) shall subject any of the Banks (or any of their
respective Eurocurrency Lending Offices) to any tax, duty or
other charge with respect to any Advance or any Note or shall
change the basis of taxation of payments to any of the Banks
(or any of their respective Eurocurrency Lending Offices) of
the principal of or interest on any Advance or any Note or any
other amounts due under this Agreement in respect thereof
(except for changes in the rate of tax on the overall net 
income of any of the Banks or any of their respective 
Eurocurrency Lending Offices imposed by the jurisdiction in 
which such Bank's principal executive office or Eurocurrency 
Lending Office is located); or

(b) shall impose, modify or deem applicable any
reserve (including, without limitation, any imposed by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), special
deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits
with or for the account of, or credit extended by any of the
Banks (or any of their respective Eurocurrency Lending
Offices) or shall impose on any of the Banks (or any of their
respective Eurocurrency Lending Offices) or the foreign
exchange and interbank markets any other condition affecting
any Advance or any of the Notes;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the costs to
any of the Banks of maintaining any part of the Indebtedness
hereunder as a Eurocurrency-based Advance or to reduce the amount
of any sum received or receivable by any of the Banks under this
Agreement or under the Notes in respect of a Eurocurrency-based
Advance, then such Bank shall promptly notify Agent, and Agent
shall promptly notify Company of such fact and demand compensation
therefor and, within fifteen (15) days after such notice, Company
agrees to pay to such Bank such additional amount or amounts as
will compensate such Bank or Banks for such increased cost or
reduction. Agent will promptly notify Company of any event of which
it has knowledge which will entitle Banks to compensation pursuant
to this Section, or which will cause Company to incur additional
liability under Section 10.1(d) hereof, provided that Agent shall
incur no liability whatsoever to the Banks or Company in the event
it fails to do so. A certificate of Agent (or such Bank, if
applicable) setting forth the basis for determining such additional
amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Bank or Banks shall
be conclusively presumed to be correct save for manifest error. For
purposes of this Section, a change in law, rule, regulation,
interpretation, administration, request or directive shall include,
without limitation, any change made or which becomes effective on
the basis of a law, rule, regulation, interpretation,
administration, request or directive presently in force, the
effective date of which change is delayed by the terms of such law,
rule, regulation, interpretation, administration, request or
directive.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 52 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

11.6 Indemnity. The Company will indemnify Agent and each of
the Banks against any loss or expense which may arise or be
attributable to the Agent's and each Bank's obtaining, liquidating
or employing deposits or other funds acquired to effect, fund or
maintain the Advances (a) as a consequence of any failure by the
Company to make any payment when due of any amount due hereunder in
connection with a Eurocurrency-based Advance, (b) due to any
failure of the Company to borrow on a date specified therefor in a
request for advance or rate request (c) due to any payment or
prepayment of any Eurocurrency-based Advance on a date other than
the last day of the Interest Period for such Advance. Such loss or
expense shall be calculated based upon the present value, as
applicable, of payments due from the Company with respect to a
deposit obtained by the Agent or any of the Banks in order to fund
such Advance to the Company. The Agent's and each Bank's, as
applicable, calculations of any such loss or expense shall be
furnished to the Company and shall be conclusive, absent manifest
error.

11.7 Judgment Currency. The obligation of the Company to
make payments of the principal of and interest on the Notes and any
other amounts payable hereunder in the currency specified for such
payment herein or in the Notes shall not be discharged or satisfied
by any tender, or any recovery pursuant to any judgment, which is
expressed in or converted into any other currency, except to the
extent that such tender or recovery shall result in the actual
receipt by each of the Banks of the full amount of the particular
Permitted Currency expressed to be payable herein or in the Notes.
The Agent shall, using all amounts obtained or received from the
Company pursuant to any such tender or recovery in payment of
principal of and interest on the Notes, promptly purchase the
applicable Permitted Currency at the most favorable spot exchange
rate determined by the Agent to be available to it. The obligation
of the Company to make payments in the applicable Permitted
Currency shall be enforceable as an alternative or additional cause
of action solely for the purpose of recovering in the applicable
Permitted Currency the amount, if any, by which such actual receipt
shall fall short of the full amount of the Permitted Currency
expressed to be payable herein or in the Notes.

11.8 Other Increased Costs. In the event that at any time
after the date of this Agreement any change in law such as
described in Section 11.5 hereof, shall, in the opinion of the
Agent or any of the Banks (as certified to Agent in writing by such
Bank) require that any Indebtedness or commitment under this
Agreement or the other Loan Agreements be treated as an asset or
otherwise be included for purposes of calculating the appropriate
amount of capital to be maintained by each of the Banks or any
corporation controlling such Banks, as the case may be, the Agent
shall notify the Company. The Company and the Agent shall
thereafter negotiate in good faith an agreement to increase the
Fees or other fees payable to the Agent, for the benefit of the
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 53 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

Banks under this Agreement, which in the opinion of the Agent, will
adequately compensate the Banks for the costs associated with such
change in law. If such increase is approved in writing by the
Company within thirty (30) days from the date of the notice to the
Company from the Agent, the Fees or other fees (if applicable)
payable by the Company under this Agreement shall, effective from
the date of such agreement, include the amount of such agreed
increase. If the Company and the Agent are unable to agree on such
an increase within thirty (30) days from the date of the notice to
the Company, the Company shall have the option, exercised by
written notice to the Agent within forty-five (45) days from the
date of the aforesaid notice to the Company from the Agent, to
terminate the Revolving Credit, the DM Revolving Credit, the Banks'
commitments to fund the Acquisition Loans hereunder or other
commitments, if applicable, in which event, all sums then
outstanding to Banks and to Agent hereunder shall be due and
payable in full. If (a) the Company and the Agent fail to agree on
an increase in the Fees or other fees (if applicable), or (b) the
Company fails to give timely notice that it has elected to exercise
its option to terminate the Revolving Credit, the DM Revolving
Credit, the Banks' commitments to fund the Acquisition Loans
hereunder or such other commitments, if applicable, as set forth
above, then the Revolving Credit and other commitments hereunder
shall automatically terminate as of the last day of the aforesaid
forty-five (45) day period, in which event all sums then
outstanding to Banks and to Agent hereunder shall be due and
payable in full.

12. AGENT

12.1 Appointment of Agent. Each Bank and the holder of each
Note appoints and authorizes Agent to act on behalf of such Bank or
holder under the Loan Documents and to exercise such powers
hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to or
required of Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with
such powers as may be reasonably incidental thereto. Each Bank
agrees (which agreement shall survive any termination of this
Agreement) to reimburse Agent for all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses (including in-house and outside attorneys' fees) incurred
by Agent hereunder or in connection herewith or with any Default or
Event of Default or in enforcing the obligations of Company under
this Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any other instrument
executed pursuant hereto, and for which Agent is not reimbursed by
Company, pro rata according to such Bank's Percentage. Agent shall
not be required to take any action under the Loan Documents, or to
prosecute or defend any suit in respect of the Loan Documents,
unless indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against loss,
costs, liability and expense. If any indemnity furnished to Agent
shall become impaired, it may call for additional indemnity and
cease to do the acts indemnified against until such additional
indemnity is given.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 54 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

12.2 Deposit Account with Agent. Company hereby authorizes
Agent to charge its general deposit account, if any, maintained
with Agent for the amount of any principal, interest, or other
amounts or costs due under this Agreement when the same becomes due
and payable under the terms of this Agreement or the Term Notes.

12.3 Exculpatory Provisions. Agent agrees to exercise its
rights and powers, and to perform its duties, as Agent hereunder
and under the Loan Documents in accordance with its usual customs
and practices in bank-agency transactions, but only upon and
subject to the express terms and conditions of Section 12, hereof
(and no implied covenants or other obligations shall be read into
this Agreement against the Agent); neither Agent nor any of its
directors, officers, employees or agents shall be liable to any
Bank for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them
under this Agreement or any document executed pursuant hereto, or
in connection herewith or therewith, except for its or their own
willful misconduct or gross negligence, nor be responsible for any
recitals or warranties herein or therein made by any Person, nor
for the effectiveness, enforceability, validity or due execution
(other than its own due execution and delivery) of this Agreement
or any document executed pursuant hereto, or any security
thereunder, nor to make any inquiry respecting the performance by
Company or any of its Subsidiaries of its obligations hereunder or
thereunder. Nor shall Agent have, or be deemed to have, a fiduciary
relationship with any Bank by reason of this Agreement. Agent shall
be entitled to rely upon advice of counsel concerning legal matters
and upon any notice, consent, certificate, statement or writing
which it believes to be genuine and to have been presented by a
proper person.

12.4 Successor Agents. Agent may resign as such at any time
upon at least 30 days prior notice to Company and all Banks. If
Agent at any time shall resign or if the office of Agent shall
become vacant for any other reason, Majority Banks shall, by
written instrument, appoint a successor Agent (satisfactory to such
Majority Banks) which shall thereupon become Agent hereunder and
shall be entitled to receive from the prior Agent such documents of
transfer and assignment as such successor Agent may reasonably
request. Such successor Agent shall succeed to all of the rights
and obligations of the retiring Agent as if originally named. The
retiring or removed Agent shall duly assign, transfer and deliver
to such successor Agent all moneys at the time held by the retiring
or removed Agent hereunder after deducting therefrom its expenses
for which it is entitled to be reimbursed. Upon such succession of
any such successor Agent, the retiring agent shall be discharged
from its duties and obligations hereunder, except for its gross
negligence or willful misconduct arising prior to its retirement
hereunder, and the provisions of this Section 12 shall continue in
effect for its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by it while it was acting as Agent.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 55 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

12.5 Loans by Agent. Agent shall have the same rights and
powers with respect to the credit extended by it and the Notes held
by it as any Bank and may exercise the same as if it were not
Agent, and the term "Bank" and, when appropriate, "holder" shall
include Agent in its individual capacity.

12.6 Credit Decisions. Each Bank acknowledges that it has,
independently of Agent and each other Bank and based on the
financial statements of Company and its Subsidiaries and such other
documents, information and investigations as it has deemed
appropriate, made its own credit decision to extend credit
hereunder from time to time. Each Bank also acknowledges that it
will, independently of Agent and each other Bank and based on such
other documents, information and investigations as it shall deem
appropriate at any time, continue to make its own credit decisions
as to exercising or not exercising from time to time any rights and
privileges available to it under this Agreement or any document
executed pursuant hereto.

12.7 Notices by Agent. Agent shall give prompt notice to
each Bank of its receipt of each notice or request required or
permitted to be given to Agent by Company pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement and shall promptly distribute to the Banks any
reports received from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under
the terms hereof, or other material information or documents
received by Agent, in its capacity as Agent, from the Company, or
its Subsidiaries.

12.8 Agent's Fees. Commencing on September 30, 1994, and on
each succeeding anniversary date thereof until the Indebtedness has
been repaid and no commitment to fund any loan hereunder is
outstanding, the Company shall pay to Agent an annual agency fee
set forth (or to be set forth from time to time) in a letter
agreement between Company and Agent. The Agent's Fees described in
this Section 12.8 shall not be refundable under any circumstances.

12.9 Nature of Agency. The appointment of Agent as agent is
for the convenience of Banks and the Company in making Advances of
the Term Loan, the Bridge Loan or any other Indebtedness of Company
hereunder, and collecting fees and principal and interest on the
Indebtedness. No Bank is purchasing any Indebtedness from Agent and
this Agreement is not intended to be a purchase or participation
agreement.

12.10 Actions; Confirmation of Agent's Authority to Act in
Event of Default. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and to the direction of the Majority Banks, Agent is
hereby expressly authorized to act in all litigation and in all
other respects as the representative of the Banks where Agent
considers it to be necessary or desirable in order to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement or the Loan Documents. Without
necessarily accepting service of process or designating Agent to do
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 56 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

so in its stead, each Bank hereby agrees with each other Bank and
with Agent, without intending to confer or conferring any rights on
any other party, (a) that it shall be bound by any litigation
brought by or against Agent by the Company, any Subsidiary or any
other party in connection with the Indebtedness or any other
rights, duties or obligations arising hereunder or under this
Agreement or the Loan Documents and (b) that it now irrevocably
waives the defense of procedural impediment or failure to name or
join such Bank as an indispensable party; provided however that
each Bank reserves the right, subject to applicable law, to
intervene or otherwise appear in such litigation, and to retain its
own counsel in connection therewith. In conducting such litigation
hereunder on behalf of the Banks, Agent shall, subject to the terms
hereof, accept the direction of the Majority Banks or all of the
Banks, as the case may be, and shall at all times be indemnified by
the Banks as provided in Sections 12.1 and 12.12 hereof. Agent
shall undertake to give each Bank prompt notice of any litigation
commenced against Agent and/or the Banks with respect to this
Agreement, the Loan Agreement or the Loan Documents or any matter
referred to herein or therein.

12.11 Authority of Agent to Enforce Notes and This Agreement.
Each Bank, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
(including without limitation Sections 12.10, 12.14 and 12.15
hereof), authorizes the Agent with full power and authority as
attorney-in-fact to institute and maintain actions, suits or
proceedings for the collection and enforcement of the Notes and to
file such proofs of debt or other documents as may be necessary to
have the claims of the Banks allowed in any proceeding relative to
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or its creditors or affecting
its properties, and to take such other actions which Agent
considers to be necessary or desirable for the protection,
collection and enforcement of the Notes, this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents.

12.12 Indemnification. The Banks agree to indemnify the Agent
in its capacity as such, to the extent not reimbursed by the
Company, pro rata according to their respective Percentages, from
and against any and all claims, liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may be imposed
on, incurred by, or asserted against the Agent in any way relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents or any action taken or omitted to be taken or suffered in
good faith by the Agent hereunder, provided that no Bank shall be
liable for any portion of any of the foregoing items resulting from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent or any of
its officers, employees, directors or agents.

12.13 Knowledge of Default. It is expressly understood and
agreed that the Agent shall be entitled to assume that no Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, unless the
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 57 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

officers of the Agent immediately responsible for matters
concerning this Agreement shall have actual (rather than
constructive) knowledge of such occurrence or shall have been
notified in writing by a Bank that such Bank considers that a
Default or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and
specifying the nature thereof. Upon obtaining actual knowledge of
any Default or Event of Default as described above, the Agent shall
promptly, but in any event within three (3) Business Days after
obtaining knowledge thereof, notify each Bank of such Default or
Event of Default and the action, if any, the Agent proposes be
taken with respect thereto.

12.14 Agent's Authorization; Action by Banks. Except as
otherwise expressly provided herein, whenever the Agent is
authorized and empowered hereunder on behalf of the Banks to give
any approval or consent, or to make any request, or to take any
other action on behalf of the Banks (including without limitation
the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder or under the other
Loan Documents), the Agent shall be required to give such approval
or consent, or to make such request or to take such other action
only when so requested in writing by the Majority Banks or the
Banks, as applicable hereunder. Action that may be taken by
Majority Banks or all of the Banks, as the case may be (as provided
for hereunder) may be taken (i) pursuant to a vote at a meeting
(which may be held by telephone conference call) as to which all of
the Banks have been given reasonable advance notice, or (ii)
pursuant to the written consent of the requisite Percentages of the
Banks as required hereunder, provided that all of the Banks are
given reasonable advance notice of the requests for such consent.

12.15 Enforcement Actions by the Agent. Except as otherwise
expressly provided under this Agreement or in any of the other Loan
Documents and subject to the terms hereof, Agent will take such
action, assert such rights and pursue such remedies under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents as the Majority Banks or all
of the Banks, as the case may be (as provided for hereunder), shall
direct. Except as otherwise expressly provided in any of the Loan
Documents, Agent will not (and will not be obligated to) take any
action, assert any rights or pursue any remedies under this
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in violation or
contravention of any express direction or instruction of the
Majority Banks or all of the Banks, as the case may be (as provided
for hereunder). Agent may refuse (and will not be obligated) to
take any action, assert any rights or pursue any remedies under
this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in the absence of
the express written direction and instruction of the Majority Banks
or all of the Banks, as the case may be (as provided for
hereunder). In the event Agent fails, within a commercially
reasonable time, to take such action, assert such rights, or pursue
such remedies as the Majority Banks or all of the Banks, as the
case may be (as provided for hereunder), shall direct in conformity
with this Agreement, the Majority Banks or all of the Banks, as the
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 58 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

case may be (as provided for hereunder), shall have the right to
take such action, to assert such rights, or pursue such remedies on
behalf of all of the Banks unless the terms hereof otherwise
require the consent of all the Banks to the taking of such actions
(in which event all of the Banks must join in such action). Except
as expressly provided above or elsewhere in this Agreement or the
other Loan Documents, no Bank (other than the Agent, acting in its
capacity as Agent) shall be entitled to take any enforcement action
of any kind under any of the Loan Documents.

12.16 Co-Agent and Lead Managers. NationsBank has been
designated by the Company as "Co-Agent" and BHF and Signet have
been designated by the Company as "Lead Managers" under this
Agreement. Other than its rights and remedies as a Bank hereunder,
each such Co-Agent and Lead Manager shall have no administrative,
collateral or other rights or responsibilities, provided, however,
that each such Co-Agent and Lead Manager shall be entitled to the
benefits afforded to Agent under Sections 12.5 and 12.6 hereof.

13. MISCELLANEOUS

13.1 Accounting Principles. Where the character or amount of
any asset or liability or item of income or expense is required to
be determined or any consolidation or other accounting computation
is required to be made for the purposes of this Agreement, it shall
be done in accordance with GAAP.

13.2 Consent to Jurisdiction. The Company hereby irrevocably
submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any United States
Federal or Michigan state court sitting in Detroit in any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of
the Loan Documents and the Company hereby irrevocably agrees that
all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and
determined in any such United States Federal or Michigan state
court. The Company irrevocably consents to the service of any and
all process in any such action or proceeding brought in any court
in or of the State of Michigan by the delivery of copies of such
process to the Company at its address specified on the signature
page hereto or by certified mail directed to such address. Nothing
in this Section shall affect the right of the Banks and the Agent
to serve process in any other manner permitted by law or limit the
right of the Banks or the Agent (or any of them) to bring any such
action or proceeding against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in the courts of any other jurisdiction. The Company hereby
irrevocably waives any objection to the laying of venue of any such
suit or proceeding in the above described courts.

13.3 Law of Michigan. This Agreement, the Notes and the
other Loan Documents executed have been delivered at Detroit,
Michigan, and shall be governed by and construed and enforced in
accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan, except as and to
the extent expressed to the contrary in any of the Loan Documents.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 59 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

Whenever possible each provision of this Agreement shall be
interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be
prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity,
without invalidating the remainder of such provision or the
remaining provisions of this Agreement.

13.4 Interest. In the event the obligation of the Company to
pay interest on the principal balance of the Notes is or becomes in
excess of the maximum interest rate which the Company is permitted
by law to contract or agree to pay, giving due consideration to the
execution date of this Agreement, then, in that event, the rate of
interest applicable with respect to such Bank's Percentage shall be
deemed to be immediately reduced to such maximum rate and all
previous payments in excess of the maximum rate shall be deemed to
have been payments in reduction of principal and not of interest.

13.5 Closing Costs. Company shall pay or reimburse Agent for
payment of, on demand (a) all closing costs and expenses,
including, by way of description and not limitation, house and
outside attorney fees and advances, appraisal and accounting fees,
title and lien search fees, and required travel costs, incurred by
Agent in connection with the commitment, consummation and closing
of the loans contemplated hereby, or in connection with any
refinancing or restructuring of the loans or advances provided
under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or any amendment
thereof requested by Company; and (b) all stamp and other taxes and
fees payable or determined to be payable in connection with the
execution, delivery, filing or recording of this Agreement and the
Loan Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and any and all liabilities with respect to or
resulting from any delay in paying or omitting to pay such taxes or
fees. Furthermore, all reasonable costs and expenses, including
without limitation attorney fees, and costs and expenses to
Environmental Auditors retained by Agent hereunder, incurred by
Agent in revising, preserving, protecting, exercising or enforcing
any of its or any of the Banks' rights against Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or otherwise incurred by Agent and the Banks
(using a single law firm retained by Agent, with the approval of
the Majority Banks) in connection with any Event of Default or the
enforcement of the loans (whether incurred through negotiations,
legal proceedings or otherwise), including by way of description
and not limitation, such charges in any court or bankruptcy
proceedings or arising out of any claim or action by any person
against Agent or any Bank which would not have been asserted were
it not for Agent's or such Bank's relationship with Company
hereunder or otherwise, shall also be paid by Company. All of said
amounts required to be paid by Company hereunder and not paid
forthwith upon demand, as aforesaid, shall bear interest, from the
date incurred to the date payment is received by Agent, at the
Prime-based Rate, plus three percent (3%).
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 60 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

13.6 Notices. Except as otherwise provided herein, all
notices or demand hereunder to the parties hereto shall be
sufficient if made in writing and delivered by messenger or
deposited in the mail, postage prepaid, certified mail, and
addressed to the parties as set forth on the signature pages of
this Agreement.

13.7 Further Action. Company, from time to time, upon
written request of Agent will make, execute, acknowledge and
deliver or cause to be made, executed, acknowledged and delivered,
all such further and additional instruments, and take all such
further action as may be required to carry out the intent and
purpose of this Agreement, and to provide for Advances under and
payment of the Notes, according to the intent and purpose herein
and therein expressed.

13.8 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and shall inure to the benefit of Company and the Banks and
their respective successors and assigns. The foregoing shall not
authorize any assignment by Company of its rights or duties
hereunder, and no such assignment shall be made (or effective)
without the prior written approval of the Banks. Nor may any Bank
sell, assign, transfer, grant participation in, or otherwise
dispose of all or any portion of their respective Notes, or of its
right, title and interest therein or thereto or in or to this
Agreement, except in accordance with and subject to the
requirements set forth in Section 13.8 of the Vishay Loan
Agreement, which shall be deemed incorporated by reference herein.

13.9 Indulgence. No delay or failure of Agent and the Banks
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall affect
such right, power or privilege nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any further exercise thereof, nor the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights of
Agent and the Banks hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive
of any rights or remedies which Agent and the Banks would otherwise
have.

13.10 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, and each executed copy shall constitute an original
instrument, but such counterparts shall together constitute but one
and the same instrument.

13.11 Amendment and Waiver. No amendment or waiver of any
provision of this Agreement or any Loan Document, nor consent to
any departure by the Company therefrom, shall in any event be
effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the
Majority Banks, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for
which given; provided, however, that no amendment, waiver or
consent shall, unless in writing and signed by all the Banks, do
any of the following: (a) increase any commitment of the Banks
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 61 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

hereunder or subject the Banks to any additional obligations, (b)
reduce or forgive the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or
any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (c) postpone any date
fixed for any payment of principal of, or interest on, the Notes or
any fees or other amounts payable hereunder, (d) waive any Event of
Default specified in Sections 9.1(a) or (b) hereof (provided that
if, at the relevant time, only Bid Advances are outstanding under
the Vishay Loan Agreement or the DM Loan Agreement, the prior
written approval of all Banks shall be required to waive, whether
by consent, waiver or amendment, any Event of Default under this
Agreement), (e) release or defer the granting or perfecting of a
lien or security interest in any collateral, or release any
guaranty or similar undertaking of any Person except, in each case,
as shall be otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any
Loan Document, (f) take any action which requires the signing of
all Banks pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or any Loan
Document, (g) change the definitions of "Majority Banks" or

treaty between the United States and the jurisdiction of such
Bank's domicile which provides for the exemption from withholding
on interest payments to such Bank, (ii) Internal Revenue Service
Form 4224 evidencing that the income to be received by such Bank
hereunder is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or
business in the United States or (iii) other evidence satisfactory

the Company or any Permitted Borrower, each Bank and the Agent
shall (to the extent it is able to do so based upon applicable
facts and circumstances), complete and provide the Company or any
Permitted Borrower with such forms, certificates or other documents
as may be reasonably necessary to allow the Company or any
Permitted Borrower, as applicable, to make any payment under this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents without any withholding for
or on the account of any tax under Section 10.1(d) hereof (or with
such withholding at a reduced rate), provided that the execution
and delivery of such forms, certificates or other documents does
not adversely affect or otherwise restrict the right and benefits
(including without limitation economic benefits) available to such
Bank or the Agent, as the case may be, under this Agreement or any
of the other Loan Documents, or under or in connection with any
transactions not related to the transactions contemplated hereby.

13.15 Effective Upon Execution. This Agreement shall become
effective upon the execution hereof by Banks, Agent and the Company
and the issuance by the Company of the Notes hereunder, and shall
remain effective until the Indebtedness has been repaid and
discharged in full and no commitment to extend any credit hereunder
or under any of the other Loan Agreements remains outstanding.

13.16 Severability. In case any one or more of the
obligations of the Company under this Agreement, the Notes or any
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 63 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

of the other Loan Documents shall be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining obligations of the Company shall
not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in one jurisdiction
shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of the
obligations of the Company under this Agreement, the Notes or any
of the other Loan Documents in any other jurisdiction.

13.17 Table of Contents and Headings. The table of contents
and the headings of the various subdivisions hereof are for
convenience of reference only and shall in no way modify or affect
any of the terms or provisions hereof.

13.18 Construction of Certain Provisions. If any provision of
this Agreement or any of the Loan Documents refers to any action to
be taken by any Person, or which such Person is prohibited from
taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such action is
taken directly or indirectly by such Person, whether or not
expressly specified in such provision.

13.19 Independence of Covenants. Each covenant hereunder
shall be given independent effect (subject to any exceptions stated
in such covenant) so that if a particular action or condition is
not permitted by any such covenant (taking into account any such
stated exception), the fact that it would be permitted by an
exception to, or would be otherwise within the limitations of,
another covenant shall not avoid the occurrence of a Default or an
Event of Default if such action is taken or such condition exists.

13.20 Reliance on and Survival of Various Provisions. All
terms, covenants, agreements, representations and warranties of the
Company or any party to any of the Loan Documents made herein or in
any of the Loan Documents or in any certificate, report, financial
statement or other document furnished by or on behalf of the
Company, any such party in connection with this Agreement or any of
the Loan Documents shall be deemed to have been relied upon by the
Banks, notwithstanding any investigation heretofore or hereafter
made by any Bank or on such Bank's behalf, and those covenants and
agreements of the Company set forth in Section 11.6 hereof
(together with any other indemnities of the Company contained
elsewhere in this Agreement or in any of the Loan Documents) and of
Banks set forth in Section 13.13 hereof shall survive the repayment
in full of the Indebtedness and the termination of any commitments
to make Advances hereunder.

13.21 Complete Agreement. This Agreement, the Notes, any
Requests for Advance hereunder, the other Loan Documents and any
agreements, certificates, or other documents given to secure the
Indebtedness and the Commitment Letter, contain the entire
agreement of the parties hereto (provided that in the event of any
inconsistency between this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 64 -- Exhibit 10.4 ($200,000,000 Acquisition Loan Agreement)

on one hand, and the Commitment Letter, on the other hand, this

with the terms of the DM Notes, the DM Loan Agreement, the

including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may be incurred by
Agent in enforcing such covenant, representation or warranty of
any Permitted Borrower (including Debtor), as the case may be,
and in enforcing the covenants and agreements of this Guaranty.

3. Unconditional Character of Guaranty. The obligations of
Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be absolute and
unconditional, and shall be a guaranty of payment and not of
collection, irrespective of the validity, regularity or
enforceability of the Revolving Credit Notes, the Vishay Loan
Agreement, the DM Notes, the DM Loan Agreement, the Roederstein
Term Notes, the Roederstein Loan Agreement, or any of the other
Loan Documents (including, without limitation, the Domestic
Guaranty, the Permitted Borrowers Guaranty, and the Roederstein
Loan Documents), or any provision thereof, the absence of any
action to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to
any provision thereof, the recovery of any judgment against any
Person or action to enforce the same, any failure or delay in the
enforcement of the obligations of the Permitted Borrowers under
the Revolving Credit Notes and the Vishay Loan Agreement, of the
Debtor under the DM Notes and the DM Loan Agreement, or of Debtor
under the Roederstein Term Notes and the Roederstein Loan
Agreement, or any of the other Loan Documents, any failure by
Guarantor to have countersigned any request for advance by any of
the Permitted Borrowers under the Vishay Loan Agreement, or any
setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation, defense or
termination. Guarantor hereby waives diligence, demand for
payment, filing of claims with any court, any proceeding to
enforce any provision of the Revolving Credit Notes executed by
the Permitted Borrowers, the Vishay Loan Agreement, the DM Notes
and the DM Loan Agreement, or the Roederstein Term Notes, the
Roederstein Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents,
any right to require a proceeding first against any of the
Permitted Borrowers (including Debtor), or against any other
guarantor or other party providing collateral, or to exhaust any
security for the performance of the obligations of any of the
Permitted Borrowers (including Debtor), any protest, presentment,
notice or demand whatsoever, and Guarantor hereby covenants that
this Guaranty shall not be terminated, discharged or released
except, subject to Section 6.8 hereof, upon payment in full of
all amounts due and to become due from the Permitted Borrowers
(including Debtor) as and to the extent described above, and only
to the extent of any such payment, performance and discharge.
Guarantor further covenants that no security now or subsequently
held by the Agent or the Banks for the payment of the
Indebtedness evidenced by the Revolving Credit Notes made by the
Permitted Borrowers under the Vishay Loan Agreement, for the
payment of the Indebtedness evidenced by the DM Notes made by
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 4 -- Exhibit 10.5 (Vishay Guaranty)

Debtor under the DM Loan Agreement or for the payment of the
Indebtedness evidenced by the Roederstein Term Notes made by
Debtor under the Roederstein Loan Agreement, or otherwise
evidenced or incurred (including, without limitation, the
Domestic Guaranty and the Permitted Borrowers Guaranty and any
security for any of the foregoing), whether in the nature of a
security interest, pledge, lien, assignment, setoff, suretyship,
guaranty, indemnity, insurance or otherwise, and no act, omission
or other conduct of Agent or the Banks in respect of such
security, shall affect in any manner whatsoever the unconditional
obligation of this Guaranty, and that the Agent and each of the
Banks, in their respective sole discretion and without notice to
Guarantor, may release, exchange, enforce, apply the proceeds of
and otherwise deal with any such security without affecting in
any manner the unconditional obligation of this Guaranty.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such
obligations, and the rights of the Agent to enforce the same, on
behalf of the Banks, by proceedings, whether by action at law,
suit in equity or otherwise, shall not be in any way affected by
(i) any insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization,
readjustment, composition, dissolution, winding up or other
proceeding involving or affecting any or all of the Permitted
Borrowers, Debtor or others or (ii) any change in the ownership
of any of the capital stock of any or all of the Permitted
Borrowers, or the Debtor, or any other party providing collateral
for any indebtedness covered by Guaranty, or any of their
respective Affiliates.

Guarantor hereby waives to the full extent possible under
applicable law:

(a) any defense based upon the doctrine of marshalling
of assets or upon an election of remedies by Agent or the Banks,
including, without limitation, an election to proceed by non-
judicial rather than judicial foreclosure, which destroys or
otherwise impairs the subrogation rights of the Guarantor or the
right of the Guarantor to proceed against the Permitted
Borrowers, or any of them, or the Debtor, for reimbursement, or
both;

(b) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law
which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither
larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that
of the principal;

(c) any duty on the part of Agent or the Banks to
disclose to the Guarantor any facts Agent or the Banks may now or
hereafter know about any of the Permitted Borrowers or the
Debtor, regardless of whether Agent or any Bank has reason to
believe that any such facts materially increase the risk beyond
that which the Guarantor intends to assume or has reason to
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 5 -- Exhibit 10.5 (Vishay Guaranty)

believe that such facts are unknown to the Guarantor or has a
reasonable opportunity to communicate such facts to the
Guarantor, since the Guarantor acknowledges that it is fully
responsible for being and keeping informed of the financial
condition of each of the Permitted Borrowers and the Debtor and
of all circumstances bearing on the risk of non-payment of any
Indebtedness (defined as applicable) hereby guaranteed;

(d) any defense arising because of Agent's or the
Banks' election, in any proceeding instituted under the Federal
Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the
Federal Bankruptcy Code;

(e) any claim for reimbursement, contribution,
indemnity or subrogation which such Guarantor may have or obtain
against the Permitted Borrowers, Debtor, or any of them by reason
of the payment by Guarantor of any Indebtedness; and

(f) any other event or action (excluding Guarantor's
compliance with the provisions hereof) that would result in the
discharge by operation of law or otherwise of the Guarantor from
the performance or observance of any obligation, covenant or
agreement contained in this Guaranty.

The Agent and each of the Banks may deal with the Permitted
Borrowers, or any of them, and the Debtor and any security held
by them for the obligations of the Permitted Borrowers, or any of
them, and the Debtor (as aforesaid) in the same manner and as
freely as if this Guaranty did not exist and the Agent shall be
entitled, on behalf of Banks, without notice to Guarantor, among
other things, to grant to the Permitted Borrowers, or any of
them, and/or the Debtor, such extension or extensions of time to
perform any act or acts as may seem advisable to the Agent (on
behalf of the Banks) at any time and from time to time, and to
permit the Permitted Borrowers, or any of them, and/or the
Debtor, to incur additional indebtedness to Agent, the Banks, or
any of them, without terminating, affecting or impairing the
validity or enforceability of this Guaranty or the obligations of
Guarantor hereunder.

The Agent may proceed, either in its own name (on behalf of
the Banks) or in the name of the Guarantor, or otherwise, to
protect and enforce any or all of its rights under this Guaranty
by suit in equity, action at law or by other appropriate
proceedings, or to take any action authorized or permitted under
applicable law, and shall be entitled to require and enforce the
performance of all acts and things required to be performed
hereunder by the Guarantor. Each and every remedy of the Agent
and of the Banks shall, to the extent permitted by law, be
cumulative and shall be in addition to any other remedy given
hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 6 -- Exhibit 10.5 (Vishay Guaranty)

No waiver or release shall be deemed to have been made by
the Agent or any of the Banks of any of its rights hereunder
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by or on behalf of
the Banks, and any such waiver shall be a waiver or release only
with respect to the specific matter involved and shall in no way
impair the rights of the Agent or any of the Banks or the
obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty in any other respect
at any other time.

At the option of the Agent, Guarantor may be joined in any
action or proceeding commenced by the Agent against the Permitted
Borrowers, or any of them, and/or the Debtor or any of the other
parties providing collateral for any indebtedness covered by this
Guaranty in connection with or based upon the Revolving Credit
Notes made by the Permitted Borrowers, the Vishay Loan Agreement,
the DM Notes, the DM Loan Agreement, the Roederstein Term Notes,
the Roederstein Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents
or other Indebtedness (defined as applicable, as aforesaid), or
any provision thereof, and recovery may be had against Guarantor
in such action or proceeding or in any independent action or
proceeding against Guarantor, without any requirement that the
Agent or the Banks first assert, prosecute or exhaust any remedy
or claim against the Permitted Borrowers, or any of them, the
Debtor and/or any of the other parties providing collateral for
any Indebtedness covered by this Guaranty.

4. Continuing Obligation for DM Term Notes. Guarantor
acknowledges that, by virtue of this Guaranty (and prior
guaranties amended and restated hereby), Guarantor has continued
as an obligor on the Indebtedness evidenced by the DM Term Notes
without any interruption whatsoever in such status as obligor,
Guarantor having previously been obligated on such Indebtedness
as primary obligor.

5. Release of Collateral for Guaranty. Concurrently
herewith, Comerica Bank, as agent under the Prior Loan
Agreements, and the Prior Banks, have undertaken to release the
Collateral delivered to secure the Prior Guaranty (as hereafter
defined).

6. Miscellaneous.

6.1 Governing Law. This Guaranty has been delivered in
Michigan and shall be interpreted and the rights of the parties
hereunder shall be determined under the laws of, and be
enforceable in, the State of Michigan, Guarantor hereby
consenting to the jurisdiction of state and all federal courts
sitting in such state.

6.2 Severability. If any term or provision of this Guaranty
or the application thereof to any circumstance shall, to any
extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 7 -- Exhibit 10.5 (Vishay Guaranty)

Guaranty, or the application of such term or provision to
circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or
unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each term and
provision of this Guaranty shall be valid and enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by law.

6.3 Notice. All notices and other communications to be made
or given pursuant to this Guaranty shall be sufficient if made or
given in writing and delivered by messenger or deposited in the
U.S. mails, registered or certified first class mail, and
addressed as provided under the Vishay Loan Agreement, or at such
other addresses as directed by any of such parties to the others,
as applicable, in compliance with this paragraph.

6.4 Right of Offset. Guarantor acknowledges the rights of
the Agent and of each of the Banks to offset against the
Indebtedness of Guarantor to the Banks under this Guaranty, any
amount owing by the Agent or the Banks, or either or any of them
to the Guarantor, whether represented by any deposit of Guarantor
with the Agent or any of the Banks or otherwise.

6.5 Right to Cure. Guarantor shall have the right to cure
any Event of Default under the Vishay Loan Agreement (with
respect to obligations of the Permitted Borrowers), the DM Loan
Agreements (with respect to Debtor), the Roederstein Loan
Agreement (with respect to Debtor) or the Loan Documents;
provided that such cure is effected within the applicable grace
period or period for cure, if any; and provided further that such
cure can be effected in compliance with the Vishay Loan Agreement
(with respect to the obligations of any of the Permitted
Borrowers), DM Loan Agreement (with respect to the obligations of
Debtor), or Roederstein Loan Agreement (with respect to the
obligations of Debtor) and other Loan Documents (including
without limitation the Vishay Loan Agreement). Except to the
extent of payments of principal and/or interest on the Revolving
Credit Notes made by the Permitted Borrowers, the DM Notes or the
Roederstein Term Notes actually received by the Agent (or the
Banks) pursuant to such cure, the exercise of such right to cure
by Guarantor shall not reduce or otherwise affect the liability
of Guarantor under this Guaranty.

6.6 Financial Statements. The Guarantor shall provide Agent
(with a copy for each of the Banks), commencing as of the date of
this Guaranty, with quarterly and annual financial statements
substantially in accordance with the requirements set forth in
the Vishay Loan Agreement.

6.7 Amendments. The terms of this Guaranty may not be
waived, altered, modified, amended, supplemented or terminated in
any manner whatsoever except as provided herein and in accordance
with the Vishay Loan Agreement, the DM Loan Agreement and the
Roederstein Loan Agreement.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 8 -- Exhibit 10.5 (Vishay Guaranty)

6.8 Release. Upon the satisfaction by Guarantor of its
obligations hereunder and its direct obligations under the Vishay
Loan Agreement and Roederstein Loan Agreement and its Notes
executed pursuant thereto, and when Guarantor is no longer
subject to any obligation hereunder or thereunder, the Agent
shall deliver to Guarantor, upon written request therefor, (i) a
written release of this Guaranty and (ii) appropriate discharges
of any Collateral provided by Guarantor for this Guaranty;
provided however that, the effectiveness of this Guaranty shall
continue or be reinstated, as the case may be, in the event: (x)
that any payment received or credit given by the Agent or the
Banks, or any of them, is returned, disgorged, rescinded or
required to be recontributed to any party as an avoidable
preference, impermissible setoff, fraudulent conveyance,
restoration of capital or otherwise under any applicable state,
federal or national law of any jurisdiction, including laws
pertaining to bankruptcy or insolvency, and this Guaranty shall
thereafter be enforceable against Guarantor as if such returned,
disgorged, recontributed or rescinded payment or credit has not
been received or given by the Agent or the Banks, and whether or
not the Agent or any Bank relied upon such payment or credit or
changed its position as a consequence thereof or (y) that any
liability is imposed, or sought to be imposed against the Agent
or the Banks, or any of them, relating to the environmental
condition of any property mortgaged or pledged to Agent on behalf
of the Banks by Guarantor, any Permitted Borrower or Debtor or
any other party as collateral (in whole or part) for any
indebtedness or obligation evidenced or secured by this Guaranty,
whether such condition is known or unknown, now exists or
subsequently arises (excluding only conditions which arise after
acquisition by Agent or any Bank of any such property, in lieu of
foreclosure or otherwise, due to the wrongful act or omission of
Agent or such Bank) in which event this Guaranty shall thereafter
be enforceable against Guarantor to the extent of all
liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by Agent or Banks as the direct or indirect result
of any such environmental condition. For purposes of this
Guaranty "environmental condition" includes, without limitation,
conditions existing with respect to the surface or ground water,
drinking water supply, land surface or subsurface strata and the
ambient air.

6.9 Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.
Guarantor hereby irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of any United States Federal or Michigan state court
sitting in Detroit in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Guaranty or any of the Loan Documents and
Guarantor hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of
such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such
United States Federal or Michigan state court. Guarantor
irrevocably consents to the service of any and all process in any
such action or proceeding brought in any court in or of the State
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 9 -- Exhibit 10.5 (Vishay Guaranty)

of Michigan by the delivery of copies of such process to
Guarantor at its address specified in Section 6.3 hereof or by
certified mail direct to such address. This Guaranty is subject
to the waiver of jury trial contained in Section 9.4 of the
Vishay Loan Agreement.

6.10 Amendment and Restatement. This Guaranty is given in
substitution for and amends and restates and replaces in its

3. Unconditional Character of Guaranty. The obligations of

Agreement, the Roederstein Term Notes, the Roederstein Loan
Agreement, or the Acquisition Loan Agreement (and any Term Notes
and Bridge Notes issued under the Acquisition Loan Agreement) or
any of the other Loan Documents (including, without limitation,
the Vishay Guaranty, the Permitted Borrowers Guaranty, the
Roederstein Loan Documents and Acquisition Loan Documents), or
any provision thereof, the absence of any action to enforce the
same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision
thereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person or
action to enforce the same, any failure or delay in the
enforcement of the obligations of Company or the Permitted
Borrowers under the Revolving Credit Notes, the Bid Notes, the
Term Notes, or under the Vishay Loan Agreement or the Acquisition
Loan Agreement, the Term Notes and Bridge Notes issued under the
Acquisition Loan Agreement, of the Debtor under the DM Notes and
the DM Loan Agreement, or of the Company or Debtor under the

Borrowers under the Vishay Loan Agreement, or any setoff,
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 4 -- Exhibit 10.6 (Domestic Guaranty)

counterclaim, recoupment, limitation, defense or termination.
Each of the Guarantors hereby waives diligence, demand for
payment, filing of claims with any court, any proceeding to
enforce any provision of the Revolving Credit Notes, the Bid
Notes, the Term Notes, the Vishay Loan Agreement, the DM Notes
and the DM Loan Agreement, the Roederstein Term Notes, the
Roederstein Loan Agreement, or the Acquisition Loan Agreement,
the Term Notes and Bridge Notes issued under the Acquisition Loan
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, any right to
require a proceeding first against Company, any of the Permitted
Borrowers or Debtor, or against any other guarantor or other
party providing collateral, or to exhaust any security for the
performance of the obligations of Company, any of the Permitted
Borrowers or Debtor, any protest, presentment, notice or demand
whatsoever, and each Guarantor hereby covenants that this
Guaranty shall not be terminated, discharged or released except,
subject to Section 6.8 hereof, upon payment in full of all
amounts due and to become due from Company, the Permitted
Borrowers, and the Debtor as and to the extent described above,
and only to the extent of any such payment, performance and
discharge. Each Guarantor hereby further covenants that no
security now or subsequently held by the Agent or the Banks for
the payment of the Indebtedness evidenced by the Revolving Credit
Notes made by Company and the Permitted Borrowers under the
Vishay Loan Agreement or the Bid Notes or Term Notes made or to
be made by Company under the Vishay Loan Agreement, or the Term
Notes and Bridge Notes made or to be made by Company under the
Acquisition Loan Agreement, or for the payment of the
Indebtedness evidenced by the DM Notes made by Debtor under the
DM Loan Agreement, or for the payment of the Indebtedness
evidenced by the Roederstein Term Notes made or to be made by
Debtor under the Roederstein Loan Agreement, or otherwise
evidenced or incurred (including, without limitation, the Vishay
Guaranty, the Permitted Borrowers Guaranty, and any security for
any of the foregoing), whether in the nature of a security
interest, pledge, lien, assignment, setoff, suretyship, guaranty,
indemnity, insurance or otherwise, and no act, omission or other
conduct of Agent or the Banks in respect of such security, shall
affect in any manner whatsoever the unconditional obligations of
this Guaranty, and that the Agent and each of the Banks, in their
respective sole discretion and without notice to any of the
Guarantors, may release, exchange, enforce, apply the proceeds of
and otherwise deal with any such security without affecting in
any manner the unconditional obligations of this Guaranty.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such
obligations, and the rights of the Agent to enforce the same, on
behalf of the Banks, by proceedings, whether by action at law,
suit in equity or otherwise, shall not be in any way affected by
(i) any insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization,
readjustment, composition, dissolution, winding up or other
proceeding involving or affecting the Company, any or all of the
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 5 -- Exhibit 10.6 (Domestic Guaranty)

Permitted Borrowers, Debtor, any or all of Guarantors or others
or (ii) any change in the ownership of any of the capital stock
of any or all of the Permitted Borrowers, Company, the Debtor, or
any or all of the Guarantors, or any other party providing
collateral for any indebtedness covered by Guaranty, or any of
their respective Affiliates.

Each of the Guarantors hereby waives to the full extent
possible under applicable law:

(a) any defense based upon the doctrine of marshalling
of assets or upon an election of remedies by Agent or the Banks,
including, without limitation, an election to proceed by non-
judicial rather than judicial foreclosure, which destroys or
otherwise impairs the subrogation rights of any of the Guarantors
or the rights of any of the Guarantors to proceed against the
Company, the Permitted Borrowers or any of them, or the Debtor,
or any or all of the other Guarantors, for reimbursement, or
both;

(b) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law
which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither
larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that
of the principal;

(c) any duty on the part of Agent or the Banks to
disclose to any of the Guarantors any facts Agent or the Banks
may now or hereafter know about the Company, any of the Permitted
Borrowers or the Debtor, regardless of whether Agent or any Bank
has reason to believe that any such facts materially increase the
risk beyond that which any of the Guarantors intend to assume or
has reason to believe that such facts are unknown to any of the
Guarantors or has a reasonable opportunity to communicate such
facts to the Guarantors, since each of the Guarantors
acknowledges that it is fully responsible for being and keeping
informed of the financial condition of the Company, each of the
Permitted Borrowers and the Debtor and of all circumstances
bearing on the risk of non-payment of any Indebtedness hereby
guaranteed;

(d) any defense arising because of Agent's or the
Banks' election, in any proceeding instituted under the Federal
Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section 1111(b) (2) of the
Federal Bankruptcy Code;

(e) any claim for reimbursement, contribution,
indemnity or subrogation which such Guarantor may have or obtain
against Company, the Permitted Borrowers, Debtor, or any of them
by reason of the payment by such Guarantor of any Indebtedness;
and
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 6 -- Exhibit 10.6 (Domestic Guaranty)

(f) any other event or action (excluding compliance by
the Guarantors with the provisions hereof) that would result in
the discharge by operation of law or otherwise of the Guarantors,
or any of them, from the performance or observance of any
obligation, covenant or agreement contained in this Guaranty.

The Agent and each of the Banks may deal with the Company,
the Permitted Borrowers, or any of them, and the Debtor and any
security held by them for the obligations of the Company, the
Permitted Borrowers, or any of them, and the Debtor (as
aforesaid) in the same manner and as freely as if this Guaranty
did not exist and the Agent shall be entitled, on behalf of
Banks, without notice to any of the Guarantors, among other
things, to grant to the Company, the Permitted Borrowers, or any
of them, and/or the Debtor such extension or extensions of time
to perform any act or acts as may seem advisable to the Agent (on
behalf of the Banks) at any time and from time to time, and to
permit the Company, the Permitted Borrowers, or any of them,
and/or the Debtor to incur additional indebtedness to Agent, the
Banks, or any of them, without terminating, affecting or
impairing the validity or enforceability of this Guaranty or the
obligations of the Guarantors hereunder.

The Agent may proceed, either in its own name (on behalf of
the Banks) or in the name of each or any of the Guarantors, or
otherwise, to protect and enforce any or all of its rights under
this Guaranty by suit in equity, action at law or by other
appropriate proceedings, or to take any action authorized or
permitted under applicable law, and shall be entitled to require
and enforce the performance of all acts and things required to be
performed hereunder by the Guarantors. Each and every remedy of
the Agent and of the Banks shall, to the extent permitted by law,
be cumulative and shall be in addition to any other remedy given
hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity.

No waiver or release shall be deemed to have been made by
the Agent or any of the Banks of any of its rights hereunder
unless the same shall be in writing and signed by or on behalf of
the Banks, and any such waiver shall be a waiver or release only
with respect to the specific matter and Guarantor or Guarantors
involved, and shall in no way impair the rights of the Agent or
any of the Banks or the obligations of the Guarantors under this
Guaranty in any other respect at any other time.

At the option of the Agent, any number of, or all of the
Guarantors may be joined in any action or proceeding commenced by
the Agent against the Company, the Permitted Borrowers, or any of
them, and/or the Debtor or any of the other parties providing
collateral for any indebtedness covered by this Guaranty in
connection with or based upon the Revolving Credit Notes made by
the Company and the Permitted Borrowers, the Bid Notes or Term
Notes made or to be made by the Company under the Vishay Loan
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 7 -- Exhibit 10.6 (Domestic Guaranty)

Agreement, the Vishay Loan Agreement, the Acquisition Loan
Agreement (and the Term Notes and Bridge Notes issued
thereunder), the DM Notes made or to be made by Debtor, the DM
Loan Agreement, the Roederstein Term Notes made or to be made by
Company and Debtor, the Roederstein Loan Agreement, or any of the
other Loan Documents or other Indebtedness (defined as
applicable, as aforesaid), or any provision thereof, and recovery
may be had against any or all of the Guarantors in such action or
proceeding or in any independent action or proceeding against any
of them, without any requirement that the Agent or the Banks
first assert, prosecute or exhaust any remedy or claim against
the Company, the Permitted Borrowers, or any of them, the Debtor
and/or any of the other parties providing collateral for any
Indebtedness covered by this Guaranty.

4. Representations and Warranties. Each of the Guarantors
(i) ratifies, confirms and, by reference thereto (as fully as
though such matters were expressly set forth herein), represents

Sections 6.1, 6.3, through 6.8, inclusive, 6.10, 6.12 and 6.14
through 6.21, inclusive, of the Vishay Loan Agreement, and such
representations and warranties shall be deemed to be continuing
representations and warranties true and correct in all material
respects so long as this Guaranty shall be in effect; and (ii)
agrees not to engage in any action or inaction, the result of
which would cause a violation of any term or condition of the
Vishay Loan Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, it is

subject to avoidance or recovery by operation of applicable law
governing bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment of
debts, relief of debtors, dissolution, insolvency, fraudulent
transfers or conveyances or other similar laws (collectively,
"Applicable Insolvency Laws"). To that end, but only in the
event and to the extent that the Guarantors' respective
obligations hereunder or any payment made pursuant thereto would,
but for the operation of the foregoing proviso, be subject to
avoidance or recovery under Applicable Insolvency Laws, the
amount of the Guarantors' respective obligations hereunder shall
be limited to the largest amount which, after giving effect
thereto, would not, under Applicable Insolvency Laws, render the
Guarantor's respective obligations hereunder unenforceable or
avoidable or subject to recovery under Applicable Insolvency
Laws. To the extent any payment actually made hereunder exceeds
the limitation contained in this Section 6.11, then the amount of
such excess shall, from and after the time of payment by the
Guarantors (or any of them), be reimbursed by the Banks upon
demand by such Guarantors. The foregoing proviso is intended
solely to preserve the rights of the Agent and the Banks
hereunder against the Guarantors to the maximum extent permitted
by Applicable Insolvency Laws and neither Vishay nor any
Guarantor nor any other Person shall have any right or claim
under this Section 6.11 that would not otherwise be available
under Applicable Insolvency Laws.

or substitutions therefor, all payable with interest thereon
and otherwise in accordance with the terms of such DM
Revolving Notes, the Bid Notes and the DM Loan Agreement;

(d) Each of the Guarantors, excepting only VBG (which is
directly obligated under the Roederstein Term Notes referred
to below), hereby guarantees to the Banks the due and punctual
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 3 -- Exhibit 10.7 (Permitted Borrowers Guaranty)

payment to the Banks when due, whether by acceleration or
otherwise, of all amounts due and owing by VBG under those
certain Roederstein Term Notes ("Roederstein Term Notes") made
or to be made by VBG to the order of the Banks pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the Roederstein Loan Agreement, and
all extensions, renewals, and amendments of or to such notes
or such other Indebtedness (as defined in the Roederstein Loan
Agreement) or any replacements or substitutions therefor, all
payable with interest thereon and otherwise in accordance with
the terms of the Roederstein Term Notes and the Roederstein
Loan Agreement;

and each of the Guarantors hereby jointly and severally agrees that
if any Permitted Borrower or any other Person who is or becomes
primarily liable therefor shall fail to pay any of such amounts
when and as the same shall be due and payable, or shall fail to
perform and discharge any covenant, representation or warranty in
accordance with the terms of the Revolving Credit Notes, Vishay
Loan Agreement, DM Notes, DM Loan Agreement, Roederstein Term
Notes, Roederstein Loan Agreement or any of the other Loan
Documents, the Guarantors, to the extent of their respective
obligations as set forth herein, shall each be obligated forthwith
to pay to Agent on behalf of the Banks an amount equal to any such
amount or cause any other Person then primarily liable therefor to
perform and discharge any such covenant, representation or
warranty, as the case may be, and will pay any and all damages that
may be incurred or suffered in consequence thereof by Agent and all
reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, that may
be incurred by Agent in enforcing such covenant, representation or
warranty of any of the Guarantors, as applicable, and in enforcing
the covenants and agreements of this Guaranty.

3. Unconditional Character of Guaranty. The obligations of
each of the Guarantors under this Guaranty, to the full extent of
their respective guarantees of Indebtedness hereunder, shall be
absolute and unconditional, and shall be a guaranty of payment and
not of collection, irrespective of the validity, regularity or
enforceability of the Revolving Credit Notes, the Vishay Loan
Agreement, the DM Notes, the DM Loan Agreement, the Roederstein
Term Notes, the Roederstein Loan Agreement, or any of the other
Loan Documents (including, without limitation, the Vishay Guaranty,
the Domestic Guaranty, or the Roederstein Loan Documents), or any
provision thereof, the absence of any action to enforce the same,
any waiver or consent with respect to any provision thereof, the
recovery of any judgment against any Person or action to enforce
the same, any failure or delay in the enforcement of the direct
obligations of any of the Permitted Borrowers under the Revolving
Credit Notes, of any of the Permitted Borrowers under the Vishay
Loan Agreement, of VBG under the DM Notes or the DM Loan Agreement,
or of VBG under the Roederstein Term Notes or the Roederstein Loan
Agreement, or of any of them under any of the other Loan Documents,
or failure by Vishay to have countersigned any request for an
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 4 -- Exhibit 10.7 (Permitted Borrowers Guaranty)

advance by any Permitted Borrower under the Vishay Loan Agreement,
or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation, defense or
termination. Each of the Guarantors hereby waives diligence, demand
for payment, filing of claims with any court, any proceeding to
enforce any provision of the Revolving Credit Notes, the Vishay
Loan Agreement, the DM Notes, the DM Loan Agreement, the
Roederstein Term Notes, the Roederstein Loan Agreement, or any of
the other Loan Documents, any right to require a proceeding first
against any other Person who is or becomes principally obligated
under such Revolving Credit Notes, such DM Notes or Vishay under
the Revolving Credit Notes or Draloric under the DM Notes or the
Roederstein Term Notes, or any other guarantor or surety, or to
exhaust any security for the performance of the obligations of the
Person who is principally obligated under such Revolving Credit
Notes, DM Notes or Roederstein Term Notes, any protest,
presentment, notice or demand whatsoever, and the Guarantors each
hereby covenant that this Guaranty shall not be terminated,
discharged or released except, subject to Section 6.8 hereof, upon
payment in full of all amounts due and to become due from each of
them, as and to the extent described above, and only to the extent
of any such payment, performance and discharge. Each Guarantor
further covenants that no security now or subsequently held by the
Agent or the Banks for the payment of the Indebtedness evidenced by
the Revolving Credit Notes, the DM Notes or the Roederstein Term
Notes or incurred under the Vishay Loan Agreement, the DM Loan
Agreement or the Roederstein Loan Agreement, or otherwise evidenced
or incurred, whether in the nature of a security interest, pledge,
lien, assignment, setoff, suretyship, guaranty, indemnity,
insurance or otherwise, and no act, omission or other conduct of
Agent or the Banks in respect of such security, shall affect in any
manner whatsoever the unconditional obligation of this Guaranty,
and that the Agent and each of the Banks, in their respective sole
discretion and without notice to any of the Guarantors, may
release, exchange, enforce, apply the proceeds of and otherwise
deal with any such security without affecting in any manner the
unconditional obligation of this Guaranty.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such
obligations, and the rights of the Agent on behalf of the Banks to
enforce the same by proceedings, whether by action at law, suit in
equity or otherwise, shall not be in any way affected, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, by (i) any insolvency,
bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization, readjustment, composition,
dissolution, winding up or other proceeding involving or affecting
Vishay, VBG, Draloric, any other Subsidiary, or any or all of the
Guarantors or any other Person or (ii) any change in the ownership
of any of the capital stock of Vishay, VBG, Draloric, any other
Subsidiary, any or all of the Guarantors or any other party
providing collateral for indebtedness covered by this Guaranty, or
any of their respective Affiliates.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 5 -- Exhibit 10.7 (Permitted Borrowers Guaranty)

Each of the Guarantors hereby waives, to the full extent
possible under applicable law:

(a) any defense based upon the doctrine of marshalling
of assets or upon an election of remedies by the Agent or the
Banks, including, without limitation, an election to proceed by
non-judicial rather than judicial foreclosure, which destroys or
otherwise impairs the subrogation rights of any of the Guarantors
or the right of the Guarantors, or any of them, to proceed against
Vishay, VBG, Draloric or any or all of the other Guarantors for
reimbursement, or both;

(b) any defense based upon any statute or rule of law
which provides that the obligation of a surety must be neither
larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of
the principal;

(c) any duty on the part of Agent or the Banks to
disclose to any of the Guarantors any facts Agent or the Banks may
now or hereafter know about Vishay, VBG, Draloric or any of the
other Guarantors, regardless of whether the Agent or any Bank has
reason to believe that any such facts materially increase the risk
beyond that which such undersigned intends to assume, or has reason
to believe that such facts are unknown to any or all of the
undersigned, or has a reasonable opportunity to communicate such
facts to the undersigned since each of the undersigned acknowledges
that it is fully responsible for being and keeping informed of the
financial condition of Vishay, VBG, Draloric and each of the other
Guarantors and of all circumstances bearing on the risk of non-
payment of any Indebtedness hereby guaranteed;

(d) any defense arising because of the Agent's or the
Banks' election, in any proceeding instituted under the Federal
Bankruptcy Code, of the application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the
Federal Bankruptcy Code or any similar laws, rules or decisions of
any jurisdiction which affect creditor's rights generally and which
may be or become applicable to the obligations of any of the
Guarantors under this Guaranty;

(e) any claim for reimbursement, contribution, indemnity
or subrogation which such Guarantor may have or obtain against VBG,
Draloric, or any Guarantor or any of them by reason of the payment
by such Guarantor of any Indebtedness; and

(f) any other event or action (excluding compliance by
the Guarantors with the provisions hereof) that would result in the
discharge by operation of law or otherwise of the Guarantors, or
any of them, from the performance or observance of any obligation,
covenant or agreement contained in this Guaranty.

The Agent and each of the Banks may deal with each of the
Guarantors and any security held by Agent or the Banks, or any of
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 6 -- Exhibit 10.7 (Permitted Borrowers Guaranty)

them, for the obligations of the Guarantors (as aforesaid) in the
same manner and as freely as if this Guaranty did not exist and the
Agent on behalf of the Banks shall be entitled without notice to
any of the Guarantors, among other things, to grant to Vishay, VBG,
Draloric and any or all of the Subsidiaries or Guarantors such
extension or extensions of time to perform any act or acts as may
seem advisable to the Agent on behalf of the Banks at any time and
from time to time, and to permit Vishay, VBG, Draloric and any or
all of the Subsidiaries or Guarantors to incur additional
indebtedness to Agent, the Banks, or either or any of them, without
terminating, affecting or impairing the validity or enforceability
of this Guaranty or the obligations of the Guarantors hereunder.

The Agent may proceed, either in its own name (on behalf of
the Banks) or in the name of each or any of the Guarantors, or
otherwise, to protect and enforce any or all of its rights under
this Guaranty by suit in equity, action at law or by other
appropriate proceedings, or to take any action authorized or
permitted under applicable law, and shall be entitled to require
and enforce the performance of all acts and things required to be
performed hereunder by the Guarantors. Each and every remedy of the
Agent on behalf of the Banks shall, to the extent permitted by law,
be cumulative and shall be in addition to any other remedy given
hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity.

No waiver or release shall be deemed to have been made by the
Agent or the Banks of any of its rights hereunder unless the same
shall be in writing and signed by or on behalf of the Banks, and
any such waiver shall be a waiver or release only with respect to
the specific matter involved and shall in no way impair the rights
of the Agent or the Banks or the obligations of the Guarantors
under this Guaranty in any other respect at any other time.

At the option of the Agent, any number of, or all of the
undersigned may be joined in any action or proceeding commenced by
the Agent against Vishay, VBG, Draloric, any Subsidiary or any of
the other Guarantors, or any of the other parties providing
collateral for any indebtedness covered by this Guaranty in
connection with or based upon the Revolving Credit Notes, the
Vishay Loan Agreement, the DM Notes, the DM Loan Agreement, the
Roederstein Term Notes, the Roederstein Loan Agreement, or any of
the other Loan Documents or other Indebtedness, or any provision
thereof, and recovery may be had against each Guarantor in such
action or proceeding or in any independent action or proceeding
against any or all Guarantors, without any requirement that the
Agent or the Banks first assert, prosecute or exhaust any remedy or
claim against the Person principally obligated for such
Indebtedness, or any of the other party providing collateral for
any Indebtedness covered by this Guaranty.

4. Representations and Warranties. Each of the Guarantors
(i) ratifies, confirms and, by reference thereto (as fully as
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 7 -- Exhibit 10.7 (Permitted Borrowers Guaranty)

though such matters were expressly set forth herein), represents
and warrants with respect to itself those matters set forth in
Sections 6.1, 6.3 through 6.8, inclusive, 6.10, 6.12 and 6.14
through 6.21, inclusive, of the Vishay Loan Agreement, and such
representations and warranties shall be deemed to be continuing
representations and warranties true and correct in all material
respects so long as this Guaranty shall be in effect; and (ii)
agrees not to engage in any action or inaction, the result of which
would cause a violation of any term or condition of the Vishay Loan
Agreement.

5. Release of Collateral for Guaranty. Concurrently
herewith, Comerica Bank, as agent under the Prior Loan agreements,
and the Prior Banks, have undertaken to release the Collateral
delivered to secure the Prior Guaranty (as hereafter defined).

6. Miscellaneous.

6.1 Governing Law. This Guaranty shall be deemed
delivered in Michigan and shall be interpreted and the rights of
the parties hereunder shall be determined under the laws of, and be
enforceable in, the State of Michigan.

6.2 Severability. If any term or provision of this
Guaranty or the application thereof to any circumstances shall, to
any extent, be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Guaranty, or the application of such term or provision to
circumstances other than those as to which it is held invalid or
unenforceable, shall not be affected thereby, and each term and
provision of this Guaranty shall be valid and enforceable to the
fullest extent permitted by law.

6.3 Notice. All notices and other communications to be
made or given pursuant to this Guaranty shall be sufficient if made
or given in writing and delivered by messenger or deposited in the
U.S. mails, registered or certified first class mail, and addressed
as provided under the Vishay Loan Agreement, with notice to any
Guarantor to be sent care of Vishay (and addressed as aforesaid),
or at such other addresses as directed by any of such parties to
the others, as applicable, in compliance with this paragraph.

6.4 Right of Offset. The Guarantors each acknowledge the
rights of the Agent and of each of the Banks to offset against
their respective obligations to the Banks under this Guaranty, any
amount owing by the Agent or the Banks, or any of them to such
Guarantors, whether represented by any deposit of such Guarantors
with the Agent or any of the Banks or otherwise.

6.5 Financial Statements. The Guarantors shall provide
Agent, or cause to be provided to Agent (with a copy for each of
the Banks) commencing as of the date of this Guaranty, with
quarterly and annual financial statements substantially in
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 8 -- Exhibit 10.7 (Permitted Borrowers Guaranty)

accordance with the requirements set forth in the Vishay Loan
Agreement and the DM Loan Agreement.

6.6 Amendments. The terms of this Guaranty may not be
waived, altered, modified, amended, supplemented or terminated in
any manner whatsoever except as provided herein and in accordance
with the Vishay Loan Agreement, the DM Loan Agreement and the
Roederstein Loan Agreement.

6.7 Joint and Several Obligation, etc. The obligation of
each of the Guarantors under this Guaranty shall be several and
also joint, each with all and also each with any one or more of the
others, and may be enforced against each severally, any two or more
jointly, or some severally and some jointly. Any one or more of the
Guarantors may be released from its obligations hereunder with or
without consideration for such release and the obligations of the
other Guarantors hereunder shall be in no way affected thereby.
Agent, on behalf of Banks, may fail or elect not to prove a claim
against any bankrupt or insolvent Guarantor and thereafter, Agent
and the Bank may, without notice to any Guarantors, extend or renew
any part or the all of any indebtedness of any of the Permitted
Borrowers, Vishay, VBG, Draloric or any of the Guarantors, and may
permit any such Person to incur additional indebtedness, without
affecting in any manner the unconditional obligation of the
Guarantors. Such action shall not affect any right of contribution
among the Guarantors.

6.8 Release. (a) Upon the satisfaction of the
obligations of the Guarantors hereunder, and when none of the
Guarantors is subject to any obligation hereunder or under the
Vishay Loan Agreement, the DM Loan Agreement or the Roederstein
Loan Agreements, the Agent shall deliver to the Guarantors, upon
written request therefor, (i) a written release of this Guaranty
and (ii) appropriate discharges of any Collateral provided by the
Guarantors for this Guaranty; provided that, the effectiveness of
this Guaranty shall be continued or be reinstated, as the case may
be, in the event: (x) that any payment received or credit given by
the Agent on the Banks is returned, disgorged, rescinded or
required to be recontributed to any party as an avoidable
preference, impermissible setoff, fraudulent conveyance,
restoration of capital or otherwise under any applicable state,
federal or national law of any jurisdiction, including, without
limitation, laws pertaining to bankruptcy or insolvency, in which
event this Guaranty shall thereafter be enforceable against the
Guarantors as if such returned, disgorged, recontributed or
rescinded payment or credit had not been received or given by the
Agent or the Banks, and whether or not the Agent or the Banks
relied upon such payment or credit or changed its position as a
consequence thereof; or (y) that any liability is imposed, or
sought to be imposed, against the Agent or any of the Banks
relating to the environmental condition of any property mortgaged
or pledged to the Agent or the Banks by any Guarantor, or any other
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 9 -- Exhibit 10.7 (Permitted Borrowers Guaranty)

party providing collateral for the indebtedness covered by this
Guaranty, whether such condition is known or unknown, now exists or
subsequently arises (excluding only conditions which arise after
any acquisition by Agent or any Bank of any such property, in lieu
of foreclosure or otherwise, due to the wrongful act or omission of
Agent of any Bank), in which event this Guaranty shall thereafter
be enforceable against the Guarantors to the extent of all
liability, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees)
incurred by Agent or any Bank as the direct or indirect result of
any such environmental condition. For purposes of this Guaranty,
"environmental condition" includes, without limitation, conditions
existing with respect to the surface or ground water, drinking
water supply, land surface or subsurface strata and the ambient
air.

(b) This Guaranty shall also be subject to release under
Section 13.21 of the Vishay Loan Agreement.

6.9 Limitation With Respect to Sfernice S.A.
Obligations. (a) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary
contained in this Guaranty, Sfernice shall not be required to pay,
pursuant to this Guaranty, more than the sum of (i) Six Million
Dollars ($6,000,000), plus (ii) the amount of all loans, advances
on open account or other funds furnished or to be furnished for the
benefit of or on behalf of Sfernice or any of its Subsidiaries by
Vishay, VBG or Draloric or any of their respective Subsidiaries
from and after July 21, 1989, the date of the initial guaranty
issued by Sfernice in connection with the Indebtedness, and (iii)
the amount of all sums guaranteed or subject to any other credit
accommodation extended by Vishay, VBG, Draloric or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or any of the Permitted Borrowers to any
Person, for the benefit of Sfernice or any of its Subsidiaries,
from and after July 21, 1989; provided, however, that the amounts
covered by subparagraphs (ii) and (iii), above shall not include
funds used for the purchase of, or invested in, shares of the
capital stock of Sfernice. Sfernice hereby represents, warrants and
acknowledges to Agent and the Banks that the limitation set forth
in this Section 6.9 has been determined by it (and its board of
directors) on the basis of, and does not exceed, the current
borrowing capacity of Sfernice under French law. The limitation
contained in this Section 6.9 shall not apply to, or otherwise
restrict or reduce in any manner whatsoever the liability of any of
the other Guarantors hereunder, or of any other Person directly or
indirectly liable for Indebtedness under the Vishay Loan Agreement,
the DM Loan Agreement, the Roederstein Loan Agreement, or any of
the other Loan Documents.

(b) This Guaranty shall not become effective as to
Sfernice (only) until approved by the Board of Directors of
Sfernice in accordance with Section 7.21 of the Vishay Loan
Agreement, but shall be immediately effective as to all of the
other Guarantors. Until such approval is obtained by Sfernice, the
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 10 -- Exhibit 10.7 (Permitted Borrowers Guaranty)

Prior Guaranty (as defined below) shall remain in full force and
effect according to its terms as to Sfernice and Sfernice hereby
acknowledges that the Prior Guaranty shall guarantee all of the
Indebtedness described in Sections 2(a) and 2(c) hereof (the
promissory notes referred to therein constituting renewals and
extensions of the Indebtedness secured by the Prior Guaranty). The
commencement of the effectiveness of this Guaranty as to Sfernice
shall be evidenced by the delivery to Agent of appropriate Board
resolutions or other documents and instruments satisfactory in form
and substance to the Agent in its sole discretion.

6.10 Limitation with Respect to VBG, Draloric and
Roederstein. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in
accordance with Sections 30 and 31 of the German GmbH-Gesetz
(German GmbH-Act), the liabilities of VBG hereunder for
indebtedness incurred by Draloric, the liabilities of Draloric
hereunder for indebtedness incurred by VBG and the liabilities of
Roederstein hereunder for indebtedness incurred by the Permitted
Borrowers shall be limited so that in no case shall enforcement of
such liabilities result in diminishing the assets of VBG, Draloric
or Roederstein below the level required to be maintained by it for
the preservation of its nominal share capital. Nothing contained in
this Section 6.10 shall be construed to restrict enforcement of
direct obligations of VBG, Draloric or Roederstein or the
liquidation of assets of VBG, Draloric or Roederstein for the
purpose of paying such direct obligations, whether or not such
enforcement or liquidation would result in impairment of the
nominal share capital of VBG, Draloric or Roederstein, as the case
may be.

6.11 Consent to Jurisdiction. Guarantors hereby
irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any United
States Federal or Michigan state court sitting in Detroit in any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Guaranty or
any of the Loan Documents and Guarantors hereby irrevocably agree
that all claims in respect of such action or proceeding may be
heard and determined in any such United States Federal or Michigan
state court. Guarantors irrevocably consent to the service of any
and all process in any such action or proceeding brought in any
court in or of the State of Michigan (and to the receipt of any and
all notices hereunder) by the delivery of copies of such process to
Guarantors at Vishay's addresses referred to in Section 6.3 hereof
or by certified mail directed to such address.

6.12 Jury Trial Waiver. Guarantors hereby irrevocably
agree to waive the right to trial by jury with respect to any and
all actions or proceedings in which Agent or the Banks (or any of
them), on one hand, and the Company or any of the Guarantors, on
the other hand, are parties, whether or not such actions or
proceedings arise out of this Agreement or the Loan Documents or
otherwise.
<PAGE>
<PAGE> 11 -- Exhibit 10.7 (Permitted Borrowers Guaranty)

6.13 Limitation under Applicable Insolvency Laws.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, it is
the intention of the Guarantors, Agent and the Banks that the
amount of the respective Guarantors' obligations hereunder shall be
in, but not in excess of, the maximum amount thereof not subject to
avoidance or recovery by operation of applicable law governing
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment of debts,
relief of debtors, dissolution, insolvency, fraudulent transfers or
conveyances or other similar laws (collectively, "Applicable
Insolvency Laws"). To that end, but only in the event and to the
extent that the Guarantors' respective obligations hereunder or any
payment made pursuant thereto would, but for the operation of the
foregoing proviso, be subject to avoidance or recovery under
Applicable Insolvency Laws, the amount of the Guarantors'
respective obligations hereunder shall be limited to the largest
amount which, after giving effect thereto, would not, under
Applicable Insolvency Laws, render the Guarantor's respective
obligations hereunder unenforceable or avoidable or subject to
recovery under Applicable Insolvency Laws. To the extent any
payment actually made hereunder exceeds the limitation contained in
this Section 6.13, then the amount of such excess shall, from and
after the time of payment by the Guarantors (or any of them), be
reimbursed by the Banks upon demand by such Guarantors. The
foregoing proviso is intended solely to preserve the rights of the
Agent and the Banks hereunder against the Guarantors to the maximum
extent permitted by Applicable Insolvency Laws and neither Vishay
nor any Guarantor nor any other Person shall have any right or
claim under this Section 6.13 that would not otherwise be available
under Applicable Insolvency Laws.

6.14 Amendment. This Guaranty shall be deemed to amend
and restate in its entirety that certain Amended and Restated
Permitted Borrowers Guaranty dated as of January 29, 1993 (the
"Prior Guaranty"), and others in connection with the Vishay Loan
Agreement, DM Loan Agreement, and the Roederstein Loan Agreement,
and nothing herein contained shall impair or otherwise affect the
security interests or liens established thereunder or in connection
therewith, which security interests and liens shall continue in
full force and effect.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the undersigned Guarantors have
executed this Guaranty as of July 18, 1994.
