UARCO ANNOUNCES SALE OF ITS
PROMOTIONAL GRAPHICS DIVISION

EUDORA, Kansas, June 1, 1994 -- UARCO Incorporated has agreed to sell its
Promotional Graphics Division, headquartered in Eudora, Kansas, to The Standard
Register Company of Dayton, Ohio.

UARCO's Promotional Graphics Division, with annual revenue of over $20 million,
specializes in the sale of personalized direct response mail products and 
services. These include promotional mailings for credit card solicitations,
magazine renewals and sweepstake entries. Standard Register will team the 
Promotional Graphics Division with its $80 million COMMUNICOLOR Division.

"This is a win win agreement for both companies," said Herbert L. Koelling,
UARCO's Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. "Standard Register's
COMMUNICOLOR Division has a significant share of the direct response market
and the Promotional Graphics acquisition will complement Standard Register's
business. The sale will allow UARCO to concentrate its assets in other 
potential high growth areas."

John K. Darragh, Standard Register's President and Chief Executive Officer, 
added, "UARCO's Promotional Graphics Division fits very well with our long term 
strategy for servicing the growing direct response market. The acquisition 
provides us with the opportunity to reach our goals more effectively."
