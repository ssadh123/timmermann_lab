FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE..BUSINESS & FINANCIAL EDITORS..October 26, 1994

PacifiCorp (NYSE:PPW) today reported third quarter 1994 consolidated earnings
on common stock from continuing operations of $122 million, or $.43 per share,
a 23 percent, or $.08 increase from the same quarter a year ago. For the year
to date, consolidated earnings on common stock from continuing operations rose
$32 million, or 11 percent, to $312 million. Earnings per share from
continuing operations rose $.07, or 7 percent, to $1.10 for the nine months.
The average number of shares outstanding in the quarter and year to date
periods increased 10 million, or 4 percent, primarily due to 6 million shares
of common stock sold to the public in September 1993.

President and Chief Executive Officer, Fred Buckman, said, "The Company's
reported earnings from continuing operations were up strongly this quarter,
due in part to growth in our basic businesses. Electric operations benefitted
from warmer than normal weather throughout its service territory and 2 percent
growth in the number of customers as compared with last year."

Total energy sales in the quarter increased 965,000 megawatt hours (mWh), or 7
percent. During the quarter, electric operations established a new total firm
load peak demand of 8,920 megawatts (MW).

<PAGE>
Regarding Pacific Telecom, Inc. (PTI), the company's 87 percent-owned
telecommunications subsidiary, Buckman said, "PTI also had a strong increase
in its basic businesses, including growth in local exchange and cellular
operations and higher long line rates of return."

Earnings in the quarter were also benefitted by two nonrecurring gains. These
two gains relate to the state regulators' approval of the recognition at
electric operations of a gain on the sale of sulfur dioxide emissions
allowances, which occurred in 1993, and the resolution of past cost study
issues associated with the Company's pending sale of Alascom, the long
distance subsidiary of PTI. The sale of allowances and the resolution of past
cost study issues contributed $.02 and $.03, respectively, to the company's
third quarter earnings per share.

THIRD QUARTER 1994 EARNINGS ANALYSIS
____________________________________

ELECTRIC OPERATIONS
___________________

REVENUES

Third quarter revenues rose $58 million, or 9 percent, to $680 million, on a 7
percent increase in energy sales.

Retail revenues were up $41 million, or 9 percent, as a result of an 8 percent
increase in energy sales. Revenues and sales volume increased in each retail
customer classification due to warmer weather, a 2 percent increase in
customers and increased customer usage.

Wholesale revenues increased $10 million to $151 million, a 7 percent
increase, benefiting from new short-term and long-term firm contracts and
higher prices. Total wholesale energy sales increased 4 percent. Firm
wholesale revenues rose $5 million to $128 million largely due to higher
prices and two new contracts. Spot market revenues increased $5 million to
$23 million on higher sales volume and prices.

The Western U.S. experienced strong energy demand relative to last year when
mild summer conditions prevailed. Hot weather spread to the normally mild
Pacific Northwest, with Portland and many other locations establishing new
record high temperatures. On July 21, 1994, PacifiCorp experienced a new
total firm load peak demand of 8,920 MW. Warmer weather increased usage by
residential and commercial customers, with residential average usage
increasing 8 
3
<PAGE>
percent over the third quarter of last year.

OPERATING EXPENSES

Total operating expenses increased $45 million, or 10 percent. Additional
power requirements due to increased energy volume sold, coupled with a 182,000
mWh, or 27 percent, decrease in hydro production were met by a 669,000 mWh, or
32 percent, increase in purchased power and a 655,000 mWh, or 5 percent,
increase in thermal generation. Purchased power and wheeling expense
increased $26 million primarily due to $15 million from increased volume
purchased and $11 million from higher prices, including $4 million under BPA
peaking and wheeling contracts. Fuel expense increased $6 million, or 5
percent.

EARNINGS CONTRIBUTION 

Income from operations increased $14 million, or 7 percent, to $208 million. 
Earnings contribution increased $9 million, or 11 percent, to $87 million for
the quarter. Two major elements combined to improve results: increased
income from operations and a $9 million pre-tax gain on the sale of sulfur
dioxide emission allowances. Income tax expense rose $14 million due to
increased pre-tax income and various adjustments which raised the effective
tax rate.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS
__________________

PTI's earnings contribution from continuing operations increased $14 million,
or 111 percent, to $26 million from the third quarter of 
4
<PAGE>
1993. PTI's earnings contribution included $8 million as the result of the
resolution of past cost study issues associated with the pending sale of
Alascom. PTI's earnings contribution also benefitted from higher long lines
rates of return, local exchange access line growth, customer growth in
cellular operations, and reduced interest expense due to lower borrowing
levels. In the third quarter of 1993, the company reported a $52 million gain
from discontinued operations for the sale of PTI's international
communications subsidiary.

On October 17, 1994, PacifiCorp announced that PTI signed an agreement to sell
Alascom to AT&T. Alascom, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PTI, furnishes
interstate and intrastate long distance service, private line and other
communications services throughout the state of Alaska. The transaction would
settle market restructuring issues in Alaska that have been the focus of
regulators, the company and its investors for more than ten years. Under the
terms of the agreement, AT&T will pay $290 million in cash for the Alascom
stock and for settlement of all past cost study issues. PTI will retain the
$75 million transition payment received in July 1994, bringing total proceeds
to $365 million. Proceeds from the sale will be redeployed in PTI's local
exchange acquisition program.

PacifiCorp will recognize, when the sale closes, an estimated after-tax gain
of between $44 million and $48 million, or between $.15 and $.17 per share. 
The sale of Alascom is expected to close in early 1995.

OTHER BUSINESSES

________________
PacifiCorp's other businesses earnings increased $4 million from the prior
year. This increase reflects the effect of certain nonrecurring corporate
expenses recorded in the third quarter of 1993, and reduced interest expense
in the current quarter.

The average number of common shares outstanding increased by 10 million, or 4
percent, due to the issuance of 6 million shares in a September 1993 public
offering and issuances under the dividend reinvestment and employee stock
ownership plans. PacifiCorp does not currently anticipate issuing any
additional common shares during the remainder of 1994 and will switch from new
issuances to open market purchases for its dividend reinvestment and employee
stock ownership plans. The Company's stock went ex-dividend on October 17 for
a $.27 per share dividend payment on November 15, 1994.
