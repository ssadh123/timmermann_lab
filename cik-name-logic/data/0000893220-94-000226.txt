FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE April 20, 1994

BANKRUPTCY COURT EXTENDS EXCLUSIVITY PERIODS
FOR COLUMBIA GAS COMPANIES UNTIL OCTOBER 20

WILMINGTON, DEL. -- The U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District

of Delaware today extended until October 20, 1994, the period during which The

Columbia Gas System, Inc. (NYSE:CG), and its principal pipeline subsidiary,

Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., have the exclusive right to advance Chapter 11

plans of reorganization.

The two companies originally requested extensions of

exclusivity until July 20, but the court, on its own accord, granted an

additional 90 days because it felt that the added time would be necessary to

resolve the complex issues involved in the case.

The Columbia Gas System, Inc., and Columbia Gas Transmission

Corp., which have been operating as debtors in possession under Chapter 11 of

the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since July 31, 1991, have been granted seven prior

extensions.
