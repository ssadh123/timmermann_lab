Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

On December 31, 1993 (the "Effective Date"), First Alabama Bancshares, Inc.
("First Alabama") completed the acquisition of Secor Bank, Federal Savings Bank
("Secor"). The acquisition was accomplished by means of the merger ("the
Merger") with and into Secor of Secor Interim Federal Savings Bank ("Secor
Interim"), a newly-formed second tier subsidiary of First Alabama, pursuant to
the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Reorganization between First
Alabama and Secor dated as of May 26, 1993 as amended and restated as of August
15, 1993 (the "Agreement"), and the related Agreement of Merger and Combination
between Secor and Secor Interim dated as of August 15, 1993. As a result of
the Merger, Secor became a wholly-owned second tier subsidiary of First Alabama.
In conjunction with and as a part of the Merger, each of the 4,707,840 shares
of Secor common stock was converted into 0.684 of a share of First Alabama
common stock. Immediately prior to the Effective Date, First Alabama had
37,829,163 shares of common stock issued and outstanding; 3,220,162 shares of
First Alabama common stock resulted from the conversion of Secor common stock;
and 41,049,325 shares of First Alabama common stock were issued and outstanding
immediately following the Merger.

On December 30, 1993, Secor paid to the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, as manager of the FSLIC Resolution Fund, $30.8 million in cash for
warrants to acquire a 25% equity interest in Secor (the "Warrants"). The funds
used to purchase the Warrants came from Secor's general working capital funds.

The consideration given by First Alabama to Secor stockholders in the
Merger was determined in arms-length negotiations between First Alabama and
Secor. There were no material relationships between First Alabama and Secor,
or between the affiliates, directors and officers of First Alabama and their
associates, on the one side, and the affiliates, directors and officers of
Secor and their associates, on the other side. First Alabama attempted to
agree upon an exchange ratio that would be sufficiently attractive to Secor to
induce Secor's agreement, and not result in significant dilution to First
Alabama's earnings or shareholders' equity. First Alabama also took into
account the trading price of its common stock at the time it entered into the
agreement, and agreed that the exchange ratio would be adjusted, as provided
for in the Agreement, based on changes in the market price of First Alabama's
common stock between the time the Agreement was negotiated and the valuation
period specified in the Agreement. When the agreement was negotiated in May
1993, the market price of First Alabama's common stock approximated $33.00 per
share. The valuation period occurred in November, 1993, resulting in a exchange
ratio of 0.684 of a share of First Alabama for each one share of Secor common
stock. If the valuation had been based on $33.00 per share of First Alabama
common stock, the exchange ratio would have been 0.667. The cash consideration
paid by Secor to the FDIC for the Warrants was based on the same market
valuation used to determine the exchange ratio.

Secor is a Birmingham-based thrift institution with assets of
approximately $1.9 billion as of September 30, 1993, and with 23 banking
offices in Alabama, 15 in Louisiana and 4 in Florida. The Alabama branches,
except for one branch in Centre, Alabama, will be transferred to First Alabama
Bank, First Alabama's commercial banking subsidiary in Alabama, in January,
1994. The Centre branch is required to be divested as a condition to approval
of the Merger by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

The plant, equipment, and other physical property acquired by First
Alabama in the Merger is not material.

Exhibit 99.1 
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Stockholders of Secor Bank, Federal Savings Bank:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial
condition of Secor Bank, Federal Savings Bank (a Federally chartered savings
bank), and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1992 and 1991, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1992. These financial
statements are the responsibility of the Bank's management. Our responsibility
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes
assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the financial condition of Secor Bank, Federal Savings
Bank, and subsidiaries, as of December 31, 1992 and 1991, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 1992, in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS
DECEMBER 31, 1992, 1991 AND 1990

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION --

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Secor Bank, Federal Savings Bank ("the Bank"), and its wholly owned
subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

INVESTMENTS, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE --

The Bank purchases investment securities and mortgage-backed securities for
investment purposes. Under certain circumstances the Bank may determine that
certain securities, which were originally purchased with the intent to be held
until maturity and were classified as investments or mortgage-backed securities
held for investment, may be sold. Upon making such determination, the Bank
reclassifies all assets meeting the characteristics to Assets Held for Sale.
Circumstances which the Bank has determined would make such a reclassification
necessary include, but are not limited to the following:

-- The downgrading of the credit rating of investment securities below
a specified level.

-- The identification of a specific group of assets which the Office
of Thrift Supervision determines to be inappropriate investments for the
Bank.

-- The anticipation of the adoption of new accounting standards which
would make such actions appropriate.

Investments and mortgage-backed securities held for investment purposes are
stated at amortized cost as a result of management's intent and ability to hold
the securities until maturity. Related premiums are amortized and discounts are
accreted using the level yield method. Investments and mortgage-backed
securities held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value. Gains
and losses on disposition of investments and mortgage-backed securities are
accounted for under the specific identification method.

The Bank recognizes income on the investments in CMO residuals and REMIC
"R" bonds in accordance with SFAS No. 91 which requires the use of the interest
method. The effective interest rate applied to the carrying value of the
investment is the discount rate that equates the present value of the estimated
future cash inflows to the initial purchase price of the investment. As the
estimate of future cash inflows changes, the Bank recalculates the effective
yield to reflect actual payments to date and the revised estimate of future cash
inflows. The net carrying value of the investment is adjusted to the amount that
would have existed had the revised effective yield been applied since the
purchase of the investment.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES --

The Bank provides allowances for estimated losses on loans when the
borrower's ability to repay is doubtful and a significant decline in the value
of the underlying collateral occurs. The Bank also records a provision, based
upon a number of factors, including management's ongoing assessment of credit
risk inherent in its loan portfolio, historical experience, and general market
conditions, which is allocated to a general valuation allowance. While
management uses the best information available in establishing allowances for
losses, future adjustments to the allowances may be necessary if there are
significant changes in economic conditions. In addition, the Bank also provides
an allowance for delinquent interest on loans considered uncollectible.

SECOR BANK, FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

COVERED ASSETS --

Assets covered by the FRF assistance agreement ("covered assets") are
carried at the lower of cost or fair value estimated at the end of each
accounting period through a valuation allowance, which is adjusted on the basis
of these estimates.

The FRF agreed to contribute to the Bank 75% of each covered asset loss.
The Bank has recorded an asset, representing 75% of the estimated covered asset
losses, that is included in "Covered Assets, Net" in the consolidated statements
of financial condition. See Notes 2, 6, and 11 for additional information.

LOANS AND FEES --

Loan fees, net of certain direct costs associated with originating or
acquiring loans, are deferred and accreted over the contractual lives of the
loans originated using the level yield method, adjusted for prepayments as they
occur.

Origination fees on loans sold are recognized as loan fee income upon sale
of the loan. Service release fees received on loans sold are recognized in
income on the date the servicing of the loan is transferred.

Loan commitment fees are recognized in income upon expiration of the
commitment period unless the commitment results in the loan being funded.

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT --

Buildings and equipment are stated at cost, and depreciation is provided at
straight-line rates over the estimated service lives of the related property.
Expenditures for repairs and maintenance that significantly extend the life of
an asset are capitalized and depreciated over its remaining useful life. Routine
repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense in the period incurred.

REAL ESTATE OWNED --

Real estate owned is recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in
the loan or fair value of the foreclosed property, less estimated costs of
disposition. Any excess of the recorded investment over fair value of the
property is charged to the allowance for loan losses at the time of foreclosure.
Holding costs related to real estate owned are expensed as incurred. A provision
for estimated losses on real estate is charged to earnings when, in management's
opinion, such losses are anticipated.

Loans receivable that have been "in-substance" foreclosed are recorded in
the same manner and are reflected as "Real Estate Owned, Net" in the
consolidated statements of financial condition. The Bank considers a loan as an
"in-substance" foreclosure when (1) the borrower has little or no equity in the
collateral based on current fair value, and (2) the repayment of the loan is
expected to be generated only through the operation or sale of the collateral,
and (3) the borrower has either abandoned control of the collateral or retained
control of the collateral but repayment in the foreseeable future is doubtful.
The net book value of covered and non-covered loans which are deemed to be
"in-substance" foreclosures was $9,308,000 and $7,875,000 as of December 31,
1992 and 1991, respectively.

INTANGIBLES --

In connection with acquisitions made by the Bank, the total amount of
liabilities assumed which exceeded the fair value of assets acquired was
presented as "Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired" in the
consolidated statements of financial condition. The cost in excess of fair value
of net assets acquired was previously being amortized over 10 years using the
straight-line method. During 1991, the amortization period

<PAGE> 8
SECOR BANK, FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

was adjusted in accordance with management's decision to dispose of the related
branch in 1992. See further discussion of branch sales pending at December 31,
1992, in Note 11.

In connection with deposit assumptions made by the Bank, the premium paid
for the Bank's entrance into new markets has been reflected as a "Market entry
intangible" in the consolidated statements of financial condition. The market
entry intangible is being amortized over 15 years using the straight-line
method.

In connection with the Bank's assumption of deposits, the premium paid by
the Bank for the core deposit bases was recorded as a core deposit intangible
and is classified in the consolidated statements of financial condition as "Core
deposit intangible." The core deposit intangible represents the present value of
the future benefits to be derived from the utilization of the assumed core
deposits over their expected lives. Core deposits are generally defined as
demand deposit transaction accounts, regular savings accounts and time deposit
accounts, excluding jumbo and brokered accounts. The core deposit intangible is
being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the core
deposits (7 years).

In connection with management's implementation of the Bank's strategic plan
which provides for the disposal of certain branches, core deposit and market
entry intangibles were written down by $961,000 and $2,200,000, respectively, to
estimated net realizable value in 1991.

During 1989 and 1991, the Bank purchased mortgage servicing rights for
which the cost has been reflected as "Purchased mortgage servicing" in the
consolidated statements of financial condition. The cost of the mortgage
servicing rights is being amortized over the estimated economic lives of the
related servicing contracts to reflect a constant rate of return on the
servicing portfolio.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS --

The Bank enters into interest rate swaps as a means of managing interest
rate exposure. The differential to be paid or received on these agreements is
accrued at the rates specified over the life of the agreements, and is included
in "Hedge expense, net," in the consolidated statements of operations. When
interest rate swaps are sold or terminated simultaneously with the disposition
of the related assets or liabilities, any resulting gain or loss is recognized.
When interest rate swaps are sold or terminated without simultaneous disposition
of the related assets or liabilities, any resulting gain or loss is deferred and
amortized over the life of the related asset or liability.

EARNINGS (LOSS) PER COMMON SHARE --

During 1992, 1991 and 1990, earnings per common share were reduced by the
effect of $6,748,000, $6,748,000 and $5,061,000, respectively, in annual
preferred stock dividends in arrears. Earnings/(loss) per common share was
computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the periods presented.

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS --

For purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Bank considers cash on
hand and in banks and interest bearing deposits to be cash and cash equivalents.
Supplemental disclosure of cash flow information is as follows:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
1992 1991 1990
-------- -------- --------
<S> <C> <C> <C>

Decrease in guarantee of ESOP debt (Note 10)................. -- (200) (400)
Transfer of mortgage-backed securities from held for
investment to held for sale............................... -- 113,657 --
</TABLE>

INCOME TAXES --

During 1992, the Bank adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 109, "Accounting
for Income Taxes" (which supersedes SFAS No. 96). There was no earnings impact
or effect on financial position from implementing this new statement. SFAS No.
109 generally requires that deferred income taxes be provided based upon enacted
tax rates which would apply during the period the taxes become payable, and the
adjustment of deferred tax assets or liabilities for changes in future tax
rates. Deferred taxes arise because certain transactions affect the
determination of net income for financial reporting purposes in one period and
the determination of taxable income for tax return purposes in a different
period. See Note 13 for further discussion.

FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS --

In December 1991, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued
SFAS No. 107, "Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments." This
statement is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 1992, and
requires disclosure of fair values of financial instruments and the methodology
and assumptions used in estimating fair values. These disclosure requirements
have been incorporated throughout the following applicable Notes to Consolidated
Statements. In the event that quoted market prices are not available for certain
financial instruments, fair values are based on estimates using present value
techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used,
including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Therefore, the
derived fair value estimates for such assets or liabilities cannot be
substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not
be realized in immediate settlement of the financial instrument. All
nonfinancial instruments, by definition, are excluded from the fair market
disclosure requirements. As a result, the aggregate fair value amounts presented
herein do not represent the underlying value of the Bank and may not be
indicative of amounts that might ultimately be realized upon disposition of
those assets and liabilities.

The following methods and assumptions were used by the Bank in determining
estimates of fair value disclosures for financial instruments:

CASH ON HAND AND IN BANKS: The carrying amount for cash on hand and
in banks and interest bearing deposits approximates the fair value of these
financial instruments.

<PAGE> 10
SECOR BANK, FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

INVESTMENTS AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES: Fair values for
investments and mortgage-backed securities are based on quoted market
prices, where available. In the event that quoted market prices are not
available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable
instruments.

LOANS RECEIVABLE: The fair value of loans receivable is estimated for
portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. The fair value
is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current
interest rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with
similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.

ASSETS HELD FOR SALE: Fair value of assets held for sale are based
either on the contractual price agreed upon at the commitment date to be
paid upon settlement or quoted market prices.

COVERED ASSETS: The carrying amount for financial instruments
included in covered assets approximates the fair value of these financial
instruments.

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS: Fair values of the Bank's
off-balance-sheet financial instruments, including interest rate swaps,
standby letters of credit, over-the-counter put options and lending
commitments are based on derivatives of quoted market prices, current
settlement values, or pricing models.

DEPOSITS: The fair values disclosed for non-interest bearing deposit
accounts, NOW and money market deposits and regular savings accounts are
equal to the reported carrying amount, which is the amount payable on
demand as of the reporting date. Fair values for certificates of deposit
are estimated using a discounted cash flow method which applies rates
currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.

BORROWINGS: The fair value of the Bank's borrowings are determined by
estimates using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the Bank's current
incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments.

FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECLASSIFICATIONS --

The consolidated financial statements for prior years have been
reclassified in certain instances in order to conform with the 1992 financial
statement presentation.

REGULATORY AGREEMENT --

On March 20, 1991, the Bank's Board of Directors signed an agreement with
the OTS to avoid the initiation of administrative proceedings by the OTS. The
provisions of the agreement, among other things, require the Bank (1) to obtain
OTS approval before the payment of dividends or the redemption of the preferred
stock issued to the FRF, (2) to modify or revise certain policies and procedures
related to asset classification, electronic data processing, interest rate risk,
and underwriting standards, (3) to develop a three-year strategic plan to be
approved by the OTS, and (4) to limit growth in total assets during a calendar
quarter to the amount of net interest credited to deposit liabilities during the
previous calendar quarter.

Management and the Board of Directors have taken steps to comply with all
provisions of the agreement; however, some of the actions have not been
completed. In the opinion of management, the agreement does not have a material
adverse effect on the accompanying financial statements.

2. ACQUISITIONS:

On December 31, 1987, the Bank acquired First Financial Bank, FSB, New
Orleans, Louisiana ("First Financial") and First Federal Savings Bank, Slidell,
Louisiana ("Slidell"). These institutions were Federally

<PAGE> 11
SECOR BANK, FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

chartered savings banks insured by the FSLIC. In connection with the
acquisitions, the FSLIC agreed to provide financial assistance and
indemnification related to the acquired entities as discussed below.

The acquisitions were accounted for as purchases. The fair value of assets
acquired exceeded the fair value of liabilities assumed, after consideration of
FSLIC assistance, by $9,036,000. The excess was assigned to negative goodwill
which has been classified in the consolidated statements of financial condition
as a reduction of "Land, Buildings, and Equipment, Net" (See Note 5). The
negative goodwill is being accreted to income on a straight-line basis over the
weighted average remaining life of the fixed assets which is estimated to be ten
years and is reflected as a reduction in depreciation expense. The accretion of
the negative goodwill totaled $821,000, $821,000 and $747,000 during 1992, 1991
and 1990, respectively.

As discussed in Note 1, the FSLIC agreed to provide assistance with the
acquisitions. The FSLIC agreed to initially contribute $57,085,000 in cash and
an $89,000,000 interest bearing note. In addition, the interest-bearing note and
cash contribution were subsequently increased by approximately $5,689,000 and
$1,253,000, respectively, after completion of an acquisition audit by the FDIC
in 1990. The note receivable earned interest based on the average six-month
Treasury bill rate plus 225 basis points and was paid off on September 30, 1991.
The FSLIC also agreed to cancel $61,600,000 of Income Capital Certificates of
First Financial. In exchange for cancellation of these Income Capital
Certificates and $50,000,000 of the initial cash contribution, the Bank issued
non-voting preferred stock with a stated value of $53,340,000 (See Notes 10 and
11).

In addition to the above, the FSLIC also agreed to provide the Bank with
ongoing assistance in an amount equal to 75% of all covered asset losses, yield
maintenance and defined holding costs on covered assets, and indemnification
against undisclosed liabilities or possible litigation arising from the
acquisitions (See Notes 6 and 11). All such amounts received and to be received
from the FSLIC/FRF are nontaxable under the Internal Revenue Code.

See discussion in Note 11 regarding the Bank's recently executed Letter of
Intent to terminate the FRF assistance agreement.

The acquisitions were treated as tax-free mergers under special provisions
of the Internal Revenue Code related to "troubled" savings and loan
institutions. As a result, there exists significant differences in the carrying
values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for income tax purposes versus
the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes (See Note 13).

All interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities acquired or
assumed were recorded at their estimated market values as of December 31, 1987.
The resulting discounts and premiums, net of accumulated amortization and
accretion, at December 31, 1992 and 1991, were as follows:

<TABLE>

</TABLE>

The discounts and premiums are included in the consolidated statements of
financial condition as an adjustment to the principal value of the applicable
asset/liability. The discounts and premiums are accreted/amortized using the
level yield method over the contractual lives of the related assets/liabilities
adjusted for actual prepayments. The net accretion recorded during 1992, 1991,
and 1990 was $1,037,000, $1,137,000 and $1,739,000, respectively. This
accretion/amortization is classified in the consolidated statements of
operations in the applicable interest income or interest expense category.

During 1992 and 1991, the Bank invested in REMIC Planned Amortization Class
bonds with maturities of less than five years, issued by the FNMA and the FHLMC.
These bonds generally maintain yield and average life stability over a range of
prepayment rates.

At December 31, 1992, interest-bearing deposits and investment securities
with a book value of $420,000 and $910,000, respectively, were pledged in
connection with public fund deposits and borrower guarantees. FHLB stock is
pledged as collateral to the FHLB for outstanding advances. See related
discussion in Note 8.

Proceeds from sales of investment securities during 1992, all of which were
classified as held for investment, were $4,806,000. Gross gains of $353,000 were
realized on these sales during 1992. These investments were sold as a result of
the downgrading of the credit rating of the securities.

4. LOANS RECEIVABLE AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES:

Loans receivable at December 31, 1992 and 1991, consisted of the following:

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

The amount of loans being serviced by the Bank for the benefit of others
was $620,029,000, $680,818,000 and $527,845,000 at December 31, 1992, 1991 and
1990, respectively. The 1991 amount includes $148,911,000 in loans being
sub-serviced by a third party.

The Bank had approximately $20,254,000 of loans sold to others with
recourse as of December 31, 1992.

In the ordinary course of business, the Bank makes loans to directors,
officers and principal stockholders of the Bank. In the opinion of management,
related party loans are made on substantially the same terms, including interest
rates and collateral, as comparable transactions with unrelated parties and do
not involve more than the normal risks of collectibility. The amount of such
related party loans was $2,170,000 and $2,525,000 at December 31, 1992 and 1991,
respectively. During 1992, $18,000 of such loans were made and repayments
totaled $373,000.

As a federal savings bank, the Bank has a credit concentration in
residential mortgages. Distribution of that concentration, among the Bank's
market areas is as follows as of December 31, 1992:

In connection with the acquisitions of First Financial and Slidell as
discussed in Note 2, the FSLIC agreed to provide contributions for losses on
certain assets and maintain a specified yield on the assets. These FSLIC (now
FRF) commitments were required by the Bank to acquire the existing problem
assets and assume the existing liabilities. The agreement between the Bank and
FRF defines "covered" assets as (i) loans delinquent 90 days or more as of
December 31, 1987, and loans that became and remained 90 days delinquent on the
360th day after December 31, 1987, unless foreclosure occurred during the
period; (ii) loans to facilitate the sale of real estate owned on the books as
of December 31, 1987; (iii) FSLIC/FRF-approved loans to facilitate the sale of
covered assets after December 31, 1987; (iv) all real estate owned and
repossessed property on the books as of December 31, 1987; (v) all loans
originated prior to December 31, 1987, which were foreclosed during 1988; and
(vi) certain other assets specifically identified in the agreement. The FSLIC
agreed to contribute an amount equal to 75% of each covered asset loss incurred
prior to the termination of the assistance agreement. A covered asset loss is
defined in the agreement as the amount by which the book value of the covered
asset exceeds the net proceeds received by the Bank upon disposition of the
asset. In addition, the FRF may elect to reimburse the Bank for 75% of the
estimated loss, based on appraised value, of a covered asset prior to
disposition. Upon such an election, no further yield maintenance or expense
reimbursements are provided. Book value is defined as the value of a covered
asset reflected on the books of the Bank, not giving effect to any specific
reserve or valuation allowance. As a result of this agreement, the Bank has
recorded an asset, the FRF assistance as described above, that represents an
amount equal to 75% of the estimated covered asset losses. See discussion in
Note 11 regarding the recently executed Letter of Intent to terminate the FRF
assistance agreements in 1993.

As previously discussed above, the FSLIC also agreed to pay the Bank a
yield maintenance on certain covered assets, for the term of the agreement,
equal to the excess of the guaranteed yield amount over the actual yield. The
guaranteed yield amount was equal to (i) the average six-month Treasury bill
rate plus 200 basis points for 1988; (ii) the average six-month Treasury bill
rate plus 150 basis points for 1989; (iii) the average six-month Treasury bill
rate plus 100 basis points for 1990; and (iv) the average six-month Treasury
bill rate plus 50 basis points for the remaining years of the agreement. If the
actual yield on covered assets exceeded the guaranteed yield amount, the Bank
paid an amount equal to 50% of the excess to the FRF. The yield maintenance
earned by the Bank was recorded as income in the period to which it accrued. The
Letter of Intent to terminate the FRF assistance agreement (See Note 11 for
further discussion) provides that yield maintenance provisions of the agreement
will terminate as of September 30, 1992. Therefore, no yield maintenance income
or charge was recorded subsequent to September 30, 1992.

During the fourth quarter of 1991, the FRF elected to reimburse the Bank
for 75% of the estimated loss on certain commercial properties based on most
recent appraised values. This reimbursement, totaling $14,425,000, was received
during the first quarter of 1992 and is included in "Due from FRF" at

<PAGE> 17

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

December 31, 1991. The FRF will further reimburse the Bank for 75% of any
additional loss incurred upon the ultimate disposition of these properties.
However, as a result of this election, yield maintenance and expense
reimbursement for these properties has been discontinued.

The Bank has recorded a receivable in the amount of $2,271,000 and
$32,763,000 as of December 31, 1992 and 1991, respectively, which represents
fourth quarter amounts due from FRF for covered asset losses, yield subsidy
income on covered assets and other related claims. These amounts are included in
the consolidated statements of financial condition as "Due from FRF."

The Bank recognized $(1,785,000), $2,380,000 and $7,644,000 in yield
subsidy (expense)/income on covered assets, $157,000, $485,000, and $335,000 in
yield subsidy income on real estate operations and $414,000, $574,000, and
$819,000 in covered asset expense reimbursements by the FRF in 1992, 1991, and
1990, respectively.

The valuation allowances on covered assets and real estate owned at
December 31, 1992 and 1991, included the following:

$25,800,000, $7,500,000, and $8,100,000, respectively, of Loan-to-Lender
certificates of deposit arising from the acquisition of First Financial, as
discussed in Note 2. These certificates of deposit were issued by First
Financial in connection with various Louisiana Public Facilities Authority (the
"Authority") Loan-to-Lender Revenue Bond issues. Upon issuance of Revenue Bonds,
the Authority deposited the proceeds with First Financial which issued
Loan-to-Lender certificates of deposit which were "marked-to-market" in
connection with the Bank's acquisition of First Financial. The early redemption
of these certificates of deposit resulted from early retirement of the
associated bond issues.

The Bank has pledged as collateral for the Federal Home Loan Bank advances,
qualifying first mortgage loans in an amount in excess of approximately 125% of
the advances plus all of its Federal Home Loan Bank stock. The advances had
weighted average rates of 6.85% and 8.63% at December 31, 1992 and 1991,
respectively.

On June 2, 1986, the Bank issued $25 million principal amount of 7.5%
Convertible Subordinated Debentures due 2011. The debentures are convertible at
any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed, into shares of the
Bank's common stock at an initial conversion price of $10.22 per share. Interest
on the debentures is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The
debentures are redeemable, in whole or in part, at the option of the Bank, at
declining redemption prices. The Bank is required to redeem annually
approximately 5% of the original principal amount of the debentures, commencing
on June 1, 1996, resulting in retirement of at least 75% of the original
principal amount of the debentures prior to maturity. No debentures were
converted to stock during 1992 and 1991. During 1990, the Bank redeemed
$7,957,000 of the convertible debt. A gain of $1,881,000 was recorded in
connection with the early extinguishment of the debt and this amount is
presented as an "Extraordinary Item" in the consolidated statements of
operations. See Note 7 for discussion of the remaining extraordinary gain in
1990. Debt issuance costs are being amortized over 25 years using the level
yield method. The Bank is allowed to include the debentures in supplementary
capital for purposes of determining total capital under the capital regulations
set forth by Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act
("FIRREA") (See Note 10).

<PAGE> 20
SECOR BANK, FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

In July 1987, the Bank filed a $200 million mortgage-backed medium-term
note shelf registration. The notes under this registration are issued in minimum
denominations of $100,000, range in maturity from nine months to fifteen years,
and are issued at fixed or variable rates of interest. During 1988, the Bank
issued $90.5 million in notes under the shelf registration. At December 31, 1992
and 1991, the interest rates on outstanding notes ranged from 9.33% to 9.63% and
9.15% to 9.63%, respectively. The notes outstanding at December 31, 1992, mature
at various dates ranging from August 1993 to August 1995. Mortgage-backed
securities with a book value of $64,581,000 are pledged as collateral on the
notes.

Mortgages payable at December 31, 1992, consisted primarily of a mortgage
on an apartment complex, representing the Bank's guarantee under a multifamily
housing bond issue. This mortgage bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.63% and
matures in October 1995. No principal is due prior to maturity.

Periodically, the Bank enters into sales of securities under agreements to
repurchase. The securities underlying the agreements remain in the asset
accounts in the consolidated statements of financial condition; however, the
securities underlying the agreements are physically delivered to national
securities dealers who arrange the transactions. During the terms of the
agreements, the dealers may have sold or loaned such securities to other parties
in the normal course of their operations and have agreed to resell to the Bank
the identical securities at the maturities of the agreements. At December 31,
1992 and 1991, there were no securities sold under agreements to repurchase.
Securities sold under agreements to repurchase averaged $5,644,000, $67,748,000
and $151,385,000 during 1992, 1991, and 1990, respectively, and the maximum
amount outstanding at any month-end during 1992, 1991, and 1990 was $24,634,000,
$200,394,000, and $266,878,000, respectively.

9. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS:

PROFIT SHARING PLAN --

The Bank has a defined contribution profit sharing plan. The Plan was
effective January 1, 1983, and covers all employees who meet certain age and
service requirements. The Bank's contributions to the Plan are comprised of an
amount determined at the discretion of the Board of Directors and a required
amount to match 25% of each employee's voluntary contribution up to 6% of the
employee's compensation. No discretionary contribution was made for 1992. The
discretionary contribution for 1991 and 1990 was $100,000 and $125,000,
respectively. Total expense to the Bank under the Plan was $198,000, $214,000,
and $219,000, in 1992, 1991, and 1990, respectively.

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN ("ESOP") --

In May 1985, the Bank adopted a defined contribution, leveraged, ESOP.
Under the ESOP, the Bank can make annual contributions for the benefit of
eligible employees, in the form of either cash, common shares, or preferred
shares of the Bank. The amount of the annual contribution is discretionary
except that it must be sufficient to enable the ESOP to meet its current
obligations. The Bank has received a determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service qualifying the ESOP under the Internal Revenue Code. The annual
discretionary contribution was $150,000, $400,000, and $474,000 for 1992, 1991,
and 1990, respectively. Total expense to the Bank under the ESOP was $161,000,
$439,000, and $355,000 in 1992, 1991, and 1990, respectively.

The Bank is authorized to issue 10,000 shares of preferred stock, $100 par
value, that is restricted to ownership by the ESOP. During 1988, 10,000 shares
were issued to the Plan and were funded by a loan obtained by the ESOP from a
local commercial bank which was repaid in 1991.

A defined benefit pension plan of an acquired institution was terminated
effective December 31, 1988. The termination of this plan was approved by both
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the Internal

<PAGE> 21
SECOR BANK, FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

Revenue Service. Reversionary benefits of $134,000 are included in the Bank's
discretionary contribution to the ESOP in 1990 and reduced total expense to the
Bank for that year.

POST RETIREMENT BENEFITS --

In December, 1990, the FASB issued SFAS No. 106, "Accounting for Post
Retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," adoption of which is required by 1993.
The Bank has not implemented SFAS No. 106 as of December 31, 1992; however, had
the new accounting standard been implemented by the Bank, the effect on the
consolidated financial statements would not have been significant.

10. STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY:

Current regulations require that savings institutions maintain capital
sufficient to meet three requirements, as defined: (1) a leverage ratio
requirement, (2) a risk-based capital requirement, and (3) a tangible capital
requirement. The leverage capital requirement is equal to 3% of adjusted total
assets (the OTS has proposed to increase this minimum level to at least 4% for
all but the most highly rated institutions), the risk-based capital requirement
is equal to 8% of risk-based assets, and the tangible capital requirement is
equal to 1.5% of adjusted total assets. In December 1992, the capital standards
under FDICIA became effective. These regulations established capital standards
in five categories ranging from "critically undercapitalized" to "well
capitalized," and defined "adequately capitalized" as at least 4% for core
(leverage) capital. Institutions with a core capital level less than 4% or
risk-based capital less than 8% are considered "undercapitalized," and subject
to increasingly stringent prompt corrective action measures. The Bank was in
compliance with all three capital requirements as of December 31, 1992.

At the time of conversion from a mutual to stock association (November 6,
1985), the Bank was required by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board ("FHLBB") to
establish a "liquidation account" for the benefit of persons who were account
holders as of December 31, 1982, ("Eligible Account Holders") and persons who
were account holders as of June 30, 1985, ("Supplemental Eligible Account
Holders") who continue to maintain their account in the Bank after the date of
conversion. This special account was credited with an amount equal to the net
worth of the Bank on June 30, 1985 ($20,078,000 unaudited). Each Eligible
Account Holder and Supplemental Eligible Account Holder will, with respect to
each savings account held, have a related interest in a portion of the balance
of the liquidation account. This interest is referred to as a "subaccount
balance." The interest of each Eligible Account Holder and each Supplemental
Eligible Account Holder is reduced annually by an amount proportionate to any
reduction in savings account balances measured on December 31 of each year
beginning December 31, 1982, for Eligible Account Holders and December 31, 1985,
for Supplemental Eligible Account Holders. In the event of a complete
liquidation of the Bank, each such account holder will be entitled to a
liquidation distribution from the liquidation account in an amount equal to the
then current adjusted subaccount balance for savings accounts then held, before
any liquidation distribution may be made with respect to capital stock.

The Bank issued to the FSLIC 26,670 shares of Series B, Class 1 Preferred
Stock in conjunction with the acquisition of First Financial (See Note 2). The
preferred stock provides for quarterly payments of cumulative dividends of 12.5%
per annum, has a stated value of $2,000 per share, and is redeemable at the
option of the Bank at any time at a redemption value of $2,000 per share plus
any dividends accrued and unpaid. The Bank is also authorized to issue up to
27,000 shares of Series B, Class 2 Preferred Stock to any person purchasing the
Class 1 shares from the FRF. See discussion in Note 11 regarding the Bank's
recently executed Letter of Intent to repurchase the outstanding preferred stock
held by the FRF in 1993.

During 1988, the Bank issued 10,000 shares of Series A, 1987, 8% Cumulative
Convertible Preferred Stock, with a par value of $100 per share. The preferred
stock is unregistered and is restricted to ownership by the ESOP (See Note 9).
Each share of stock is convertible, at the option of the Bank, to 8.33 shares of
common stock. The ESOP will receive dividends, if declared, of 8% per annum per
share, payable on a semi-

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

annual basis. The ESOP funded the purchase of the stock with a $1 million loan
from a commercial bank. The loan was repaid by the ESOP in quarterly
installments in the amount of $100,000 each, which began on December 31, 1988,
with interest at a rate of 8% per annum and was completely repaid in 1991. The
ESOP funded the repayment of the debt with contributions made by the Bank. As
the loan was repaid, the Bank reduced the liability and corresponding charge to
stockholders' equity recorded on its books.

The Bank may not pay dividends on or repurchase any of its common stock if
the effect thereof would reduce net worth below the amount required for the
liquidation account, below the fully phased-in capital requirements prescribed
by the OTS, or below the adequately capitalized level as defined by FDICIA.

On May 16, 1990, the Board of Directors suspended the declaration of all
dividends. Accordingly, no dividends were declared, accrued or paid subsequent
to that date. Preferred stock dividends not accrued or paid were $6,748,000
annually, or $1.90 per common share, for the years ended December 31, 1992 and
1991, and $5,061,000, or $1.43 per common share, for the year ended December 31,
1990. Earnings per share have been reduced by the effect of each year's
preferred stock dividends in arrears. Cumulative preferred stock dividends in
arrears at December 31, 1992, totaled $18,557,000. The resumption of the payment
of dividends must be approved by the OTS.

11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES:

The Bank is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in
the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers and
to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These financial
instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit,
over-the-counter put options, and interest rate swaps. These instruments
involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate, and market risk
in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated statements of financial
position. Credit risk is defined as the possibility that a loss may occur from
the failure of another party to perform according to the terms of the contract.
Market risk is defined as the possibility that future changes in the market
price may make a financial instrument less valuable or more costly. The contract
or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the
Bank has in particular classes of financial instruments. Financial instruments
with off-balance-sheet risk at December 31, 1992, were:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
CONTRACT OR
NOTIONAL AMOUNT
---------------
(IN THOUSANDS)
<S> <C>
Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk:
Commitments to extend credit (including commitments on loans to be

Financial instruments whose notional or contract amounts represent
market risk:
Interest rate swap agreements....................................... 169,900
Over-the-counter put options........................................ 10,000
</TABLE>

The Bank estimates the fair value of the above off-balance-sheet
commitments based upon the net current settlement values of the individual
instruments, which was a payable of $7,743,000 at December 31, 1992 (consisting
of a payable of $7.7 million on interest rate swap agreements offset by a
receivable on the over-the-counter put options of $24,000).

For commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, the Bank's
exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party is
represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The Bank uses the
same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it
does for on-balance-sheet instruments. For interest rate swap transactions, the
contract or notional amounts do not

<PAGE> 23
SECOR BANK, FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

represent exposure to credit loss but rather give an indication of the volume of
the transactions. The Bank controls the credit risk of its interest rate swap
agreements through credit approvals, limits, and monitoring procedures.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long
as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.
Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses
and may require payment of a fee. Since a portion of the commitments are
expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amount does
not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Bank evaluates each
customer's creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral
obtained, if deemed necessary by the Bank, upon extension of credit is based on
management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies but
may include real estate, personal property, and income-producing commercial
properties.

Outstanding commitments to extend credit are for loans with a weighted
average coupon rate of 7.74%, excluding discount points, and a weighted average
maturity of 25 years. Approximately 7% of these commitments are for loans to be
sold to investors upon final origination.

Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to
guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Those guarantees are
primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including
commercial paper, bond financing, and similar transactions. These commitments
expire at various times between October 1995 and October 1997. The credit risk
involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved
in extending loans to customers. The commitments are collateralized by real
property. The extent of collateral held for these commitments at December 31,
1992, varies from 99% to 128% of the commitment amount; the average amount
collateralized is 111%. In addition, the Bank has pledged $24,542,000 in
mortgage-backed securities in connection with standby letters of credit
agreements.

To hedge/mitigate the aforementioned market risk inherent in the
origination of mortgage loans, the Bank uses over-the-counter put options.
Options are considered by many in the financial markets as "insurance" against
adverse price movement, while offering the flexibility to benefit from possible
favorable price movement. An option, when purchased, gives the buyer the right,
but not the obligation, to buy or sell a specific amount (the notional amount)
of a specific commodity at a specific price, within a specified period of time.

The Bank has entered into interest rate swap agreements with major
investment and banking firms for the purpose of hedging outstanding borrowings
to assist in its overall asset/liability management strategy. Interest rate swap
transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed and floating rate interest
payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying notional principal
amounts. The agreements, which expire from 1993 to 1996, provide for fixed and
variable rate interest payments (ranging from 3.12% to 13.43%) by the Bank and
fixed and variable rate interest receipts (ranging from 3.25% to 8.35%) on
approximately $169.9 million notional principal amount at December 31, 1992. At
December 31, 1992, the weighted average interest rate payable and receivable on
swap agreements was 7.82% and 5.05%, respectively. Interest expense, net of
interest income, on the swap agreements is classified as "Hedge expense, net" in
the consolidated statements of operations. The Bank has provided letters of
credit totaling $9,800,000 and mortgage-backed securities totaling $4,244,000 as
collateral for these agreements. The letters of credit were issued by the FHLB
on behalf of the Bank.

Entering into interest rate swap agreements involves not only the risk of
dealing with counterparties and their ability to meet the terms of the contracts
but also the interest rate risk associated with unmatched positions if a
counterparty defaults. Notional principal amounts often are used to express the
volume of these transactions, but the amounts potentially subject to credit risk
are limited to the interest receivable from the counterparty less any interest
owed to that party.

CASH RESTRICTIONS --

As of December 31, 1992 and 1991, cash on hand and in banks includes
$3,700,000 and $3,645,000, respectively, of required reserves held on deposit
with the FHLB.

LEASES --

The Bank leases land and certain of its office and branch facilities under
noncancelable operating lease agreements which expire between 1993 and 2011. The
majority of the leases provide for renewal options to extend the life of the
lease. The Bank subleases certain of these properties. The aggregate future
minimum payments and receipts under such operating leases and subleases that
have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of
December 31, 1992, are as follows:

FDIC ASSESSMENTS --

The responsibility of insuring deposits of savings institutions rests with
the SAIF. This fund, which is supervised by the FDIC, keeps insurance fees and
assessments from savings institutions separate from those paid by banks and is
backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.

The FDIC-SAIF assessments became effective January 1, 1990. The FDIC
assessment rates were $2.08 per $1,000 of deposits until December 31, 1990 and
were $2.30 per $1,000 from January 1, 1991, until December 31, 1992. The FDIC
Improvement Act of 1991 expanded the FDIC's assessment latitude, including the
ability to base assessments on risk profiles. As of January 1, 1993, the Bank's
assessment rate increased to $2.90 per $1,000 of deposits. The Bank was assessed
insurance premiums of $3,654,000 during 1992 by the FDIC.

In addition to the insurance assessments discussed above, the OTS was
empowered to assess savings institutions a "general assessment." This
assessment, which is based on an institution's total assets, allows the OTS to
raise funds to cover supervisory and operating expenses. During 1992, 1991, and
1990, the Bank was assessed $332,000, $340,000, and $464,000, respectively.
These amounts are presented in the consolidated statements of operations as
"Other operating expenses."

LETTERS OF INTENT --

On February 24, 1992, the Bank executed a Letter of Intent setting forth an
agreement in principle for the acquisition of the Bank by Union Planters
Corporation ("UPC"), a multi-state bank holding company headquartered in
Memphis, Tennessee. The negotiations were terminated later in 1992 because the
two parties could not agree to mutually acceptable terms.

In December 1992, the FDIC approved a proposed transaction between the Bank
and the FDIC as manager of the FRF which would (1) allow the Bank to purchase
its $53,340,000 in preferred stock held by

<PAGE> 25
SECOR BANK, FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

the FRF (See Notes 2 and 10) and (2) provide for a settlement and termination of
the assistance agreement between the FRF and the Bank (See Notes 2 and 6).

The proposed transaction, which the Bank anticipates to be completed in
April 1993, is subject to (1) the execution by the FDIC and the Bank of a
definitive agreement, (2) approval of the definitive agreement by the OTS and
(3) approval by the Bank's stockholders.

Consideration to be paid for the repurchase of the $53,340,000 in preferred
stock, together with all related unpaid dividends in arrears, which totaled
$18,336,000 at December 31, 1992, is proposed to consist of the following:

-- The payment to the FDIC of $27,000,000 in a combination of cash
(approximately $15,000,000) and an initial credit related to the
settlement and termination of the covered assets assistance agreement
(approximately $12,000,000).

-- The issuance to the FDIC by the Bank of $8,000,000 of seven year 9.5%
subordinated debentures which may be redeemed by the Bank at its option
during the first six months of issue at 78.5% of par and thereafter at
par.

-- The issuance to the FDIC by the Bank of ten year warrants to purchase
25% of the fully diluted shares of the Bank's common stock (or
approximately 1,600,000 shares) at an exercise price of $2.00 per share.

The proposed settlement and termination of the assistance agreement, which
originated with the Bank's acquisition of two Louisiana thrifts in 1987 (See
Notes 2 and 6), was also approved by the FDIC. In general, the settlement will
be based upon the valuation or disposition of the covered assets and contingent
liabilities of the acquired institutions, including pre-acquisition legal
matters referred to below.

Any loss resulting from the valuation or disposition of the covered assets
will be borne 75% by the FDIC and 25% by the Bank. The FDIC has agreed to pay
the Bank $3,000,000 to assume responsibility for contingent liabilities of the
acquired institutions.

PENDING TRANSACTIONS --

On September 3, 1992, the Bank signed a definitive agreement with AmSouth
Bank, N.A. for the sale of five of the Bank's Alabama branches and on October
20, 1992, the Bank signed a definitive agreement with West Alabama Bank and
Trust for the sale of three of the Bank's Alabama branches. These agreements are
subject to various regulatory approvals and are in accordance with the Bank's
strategic plan for downsizing the balance sheet through redefinition of the
Bank's branch delivery system. Based on December 31, 1992 balances, the proposed
branch sales will approximate $121,300,000 in deposits, $45,400,000 in loans,
and the sale of all related facilities and branch assets. It is anticipated that
these transactions will be closed in the first half of 1993.

LEGAL MATTERS --

The Bank is a party to a number of claims and lawsuits generally common to
its operations. Certain of these matters involve lawsuits filed against acquired
institutions on actions prior to their respective acquisition dates. In the
event actual losses related to the acquired institutions exceed reserves
established for such purposes at the acquisition dates, the Bank will be
reimbursed between 90% and 100% of losses in excess of such amounts, depending
on the specific assistance agreement. However, upon the completion of the
proposed settlement and termination of the assistance agreement discussed above,
the FDIC has agreed to pay the Bank $3,000,000 to assume responsibility for
contingent liabilities of the acquired institutions. Reserves have been provided
for the expected losses to be incurred with respect to claims and lawsuits and
are classified in "Other Liabilities" in the accompanying consolidated
statements of financial condition. Management is of the opinion

<PAGE> 26
SECOR BANK, FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

that final disposition of these matters will not have a material effect on the
Bank's financial condition and results of operations.

In October, 1991, a jury in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County rendered
a verdict against the Bank in the aggregate amount of $3,525,000 (subsequently
reduced by a judgment to $2,100,000) for alleged breaches of contract, fraud,
and punitive damages. The judgment has been appealed by both parties. The Bank
recorded a provision in 1991 for management's estimate of probable loss in
connection with this matter.

12. STOCK OPTION PLAN:

The Bank has 161,771 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the
1988 Stock Option Plan and 317,250 shares of common stock reserved for issuance
under the 1985 Stock Option Plan. The Bank has granted total options under both
plans, net of cancellations, for 337,625 shares as of December 31, 1992.

The Plans provide that the option price may not be less than the fair
market value of the shares on the date of the grant. The options granted can be
exercised beginning one year from the date of the grant (except the May 1986
options which were not exercisable until May 1988 and the December 1987 options
which were not exercisable until December 1989). The options under both Plans
expire ten years after the date of the grant. The Plans also provide that stock
appreciation rights may be granted concurrently with stock options under the
Plans. The appreciation rights entitle the participant to receive shares of
common stock or cash for the excess of the fair market value of the stock at the
date of exercise over the option price. Stock appreciation rights totalling
72,000 were outstanding under the Plans as of December 31, 1992.

Information with respect to the stock options for the years ended December
31, 1992, 1991, and 1990, is summarized as follows:

For Federal income tax purposes, the Bank files a consolidated Federal
income tax return with its subsidiaries. The Bank files an Alabama financial
institution excise tax return and the subsidiaries file an Alabama domestic
corporation income tax return.

As a result of prior year income tax net operating losses and the
acquisition of First Financial (See Note 2), net operating losses of
approximately $88,000,000 are available at December 31, 1992, to reduce future
Federal income taxes payable through 2006. Net operating losses of approximately
$32,000,000 are also available at December 31, 1992, to reduce future State of
Alabama taxes payable. Additionally, at December 31, 1992, the tax basis of net
assets exceeded their related carrying values for financial reporting purposes
by approximately $53,000,000. These loss carryforwards and excess tax basis
result in a potential unrecorded tax benefit of $48,000,000 at a current
statutory income tax rate of 34%. Current proposals indicate these potential tax
benefits could be significantly reduced through changes in legislation.

Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the Bank is also subject to alternative
minimum tax. The Bank has approximately $43,000,000 in alternative minimum tax
("AMT") net operating loss carryforwards to reduce alternative minimum taxes
payable through 2005. The AMT net operating loss carryforwards may be used to
offset only 90% of the AMT taxable income each year.

The net operating loss carryforwards available to the Bank for income tax
purposes as of December 31, 1992, will expire as follows:

During 1991 and 1990, the Bank purchased REMIC "R" bonds (See Note 3). The
Bank, as holder of these bonds, must include the taxable income or loss of the
REMIC in determining its Federal taxable income. During the early years of the
REMIC, the REMIC's taxable income will exceed the income on the bonds reported
for financial statement purposes. Under current tax law and regulations, the
Bank may use future tax losses as well as current net operating loss
carryforwards to offset such taxable income. In the later years of the REMIC,
the REMIC will realize tax losses which will serve to reduce future taxable
income or generate net operating loss carryforwards.

14. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE:

Assets held for sale include mortgage loans originated and intended for
sale in the secondary market and mortgage-backed securities not held on a
long-term basis and are carried in the consolidated statements of financial
condition at the lower of cost or fair value. Assets held for sale at December

15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS:

LETTER OF INTENT --

The transaction between the Bank and the FDIC regarding the repurchase of
the Bank's $53,340,000 in preferred stock and settlement of the assistance
agreement (See Note 11) was completed on April 30, 1993. The transaction
(including the redemption at 78.5% of par of the $8,000,000 subordinated
debentures on May 7, 1993), added approximately $20,000,000 to common
stockholders' equity.

DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT --

On May 26, 1993, the Bank executed a definitive agreement which provides
for the acquisition of the Bank by First Alabama Bancshares, Inc. ("First
Alabama"). The agreement provides that each share of the Bank's outstanding
stock would be converted into 0.667 of a share of First Alabama common stock,
subject to adjustment.

The proposed exchange ratio would be adjusted pursuant to a formula which
in effect offsets fifty percent of any decline in market value of First Alabama
common stock between $33.00 and $25.50 per share. Similarly, the exchange ratio
would be adjusted in a manner which would benefit each share of the Bank's stock
by fifty percent of any increase in the market value of First Alabama common
stock above $33.00 per share. The market value of First Alabama common stock to
be used in the pricing formula will be determined based upon the average closing
price over the ten trading days ending on the date that the parties receive the
approval of the OTS.

At a price of $33.00 per share of First Alabama common stock, the exchange
ratio would remain unchanged at 0.667, providing a market value equivalent of
$22.01 for each share of the Bank's common stock. At a price of $25.50 per share
of First Alabama common stock, the exchange ratio would be adjusted to 0.765,
the highest possible ratio under the formula, providing a market value
equivalent of $19.50 for each share of the Bank's common stock. If the market
value of First Alabama common stock were to be below $25.50, the exchange ratio
would remain unadjusted at 0.667 and the Bank would have the option of
terminating the transaction.

The increased market value of First Alabama common stock to be received by
the Bank's stockholders if the market value of First Alabama common stock
exceeds $33.50 per share is limited only by the formula's fifty percent sharing
arrangement.

The definitive agreement further provides that the warrants presently held
by the FDIC, as manager of the FSLIC Resolution Fund, to purchase in the
aggregate 1,577,875 shares of the Bank's common stock will be canceled at the
effective time of the transaction in consideration for a cash payment to the
FDIC. For each share of the Bank's common stock subject to a warrant, such cash
payment would be equal to the market value of the First Alabama common stock to
be received for each share of the Bank's common stock in the transaction less
the $2.00 exercise price of the warrant.

In addition, all stock options and outstanding convertible debentures
issued by the Bank will be assumed by First Alabama and the one series of
convertible preferred stock of the Bank currently outstanding and held by the
Bank's ESOP will be converted into First Alabama common stock, in each case on a
basis that reflects the exchange ratio of the Bank's common stock for First
Alabama common stock.

The proposed acquisition is subject to various conditions, including
completion of appropriate due diligence satisfactory to First Alabama, approval
of appropriate regulatory authorities, approval of the shareholders of the Bank,
and approval of the FDIC as manager of the FSLIC Resolution Fund.

COMPLETED BRANCH SALE --

On April 8, 1993, the Bank completed the sale of five of the Bank's Alabama
branches to AmSouth Bank, N.A. (See Note 11). The Bank received a premium of
approximately $2,400,000 for the sale of approximately $73,000,000 in deposits
and $34,000,000 in loans. It is anticipated that any gain on this transaction
will be offset by certain charges related to the branch restructuring plan.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS --

On April 16, 1993, the Supreme Court of Alabama reversed the $2,100,000
judgment against the Bank related to the matter discussed in Note 11, and
remanded the matter to the trial court for a new trial.

SECOR BANK, FEDERAL SAVINGS BANK
AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)

(1) BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of Secor Bank, Federal Savings Bank ("the Bank") and its
wholly owned subsidiaries. Significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of
normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair presentation
of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of
the Bank for the interim periods. The results of operations for the
nine months ended September 30, 1993, are not necessarily indicative
of the results which may be expected for the entire year.

The 1992 consolidated financial statements presented herein have been
reclassified in certain instances in order to conform with the 1993
financial statement presentation.

(2) LOANS HELD FOR SALE

Loans held for sale consist of loans originated and intended for sale
in the secondary market, and are carried in the consolidated
statement of financial condition at the lower of aggregate cost or
fair value.

(3) STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

On May 16, 1990, the Board of Directors suspended the declaration of
all dividends. Accordingly, except as discussed below, no dividends
were declared or paid during the periods ended September 30, 1993.

In the quarter ended September 30, 1993, the Bank, after having
received approval from the Office of Thrift Supervision ("OTS"), paid
$280,000 in preferred stock dividends related to its Series A, 8%
cumulative convertible preferred stock held by the Bank's Employee
Stock Ownership Plan ("ESOP"). This payment satisfied all current
dividends, as well as all dividends in arrears. On October 1, 1993,
this preferred stock issue was converted to 83,300 shares of the
Bank's common stock. The payment of the dividends, as well as the
subsequent conversion to common stock, is a result of the Bank's
planned termination of its ESOP to be effective with the pending
acquisition of the Bank by First Alabama Bancshares, Inc. (see Note
5).

On August 2, 1993, the Bank, after having received approval from the
OTS, issued notices of redemption on all of its 7.5% convertible
subordinated debentures. Under the terms of the debentures, the
debentures are convertible into shares of the Bank's common stock at a
conversion price of $10.22 per share.
<PAGE> 8

Subsequent to the issue of the notices of redemption and prior to the
stated redemption date (October 1, 1993), holders of $9,025,000 of
debentures elected to convert their debentures to 883,016 shares of
the Bank's common stock. The remaining $10,000 of debentures were
redeemed at the stated price of 102.25%. Unamortized debt issuance
cost related to the debentures of $258,364 was charged to paid-in
capital as of September 30, 1993.

As discussed in Note 4, on April 30, 1993, the Bank completed the
repurchase of its $53.3 million in preferred stock held by the Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation ("FSLIC") Resolution Fund
("FRF") and settlement of the covered assets assistance agreement. In
addition, cumulative dividends in arrears related to the FRF preferred
stock of $20,002,500 as of March 31, 1993, were relinquished.

As a result of the foregoing transactions, there were no cumulative
preferred stock dividends in arrears at September 30, 1993, compared
to $18,557,000 at December 31, 1992. For purposes of computing
earnings per share, preferred stock dividends have been deducted in
the amount of $20,000 and $60,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 1993, and $1,686,875 and $5,060,625 for the nine months ended
September 30, 1992.

(4) REPURCHASE OF FRF PREFERRED STOCK

On April 28, 1993, the Bank's shareholders approved a proposed
transaction between the Bank and the FDIC, as manager of the FRF, for
the (1) repurchase by the Bank of its $53,340,000 in preferred stock
held by the FRF and (2) settlement and termination of the assistance
agreement between the FRF and the Bank. The stock repurchase
transaction, which was consummated on April 30, 1993, consisted of the
following:

- The payment to the FDIC of approximately $27 million in a
combination of cash (approximately $15 million) and an initial
credit related to the settlement and termination of the
covered assets assistance agreement (approximately $12
million).

- The issuance to the FDIC by the Bank of $8 million of seven
year 9.5% subordinated debentures, which were redeemed by the
Bank at its option on May 7, 1993, at 78.5% of par.

- The issuance to the FDIC by the Bank of ten year warrants to
purchase 25% of the fully diluted shares of the Bank's common
stock (or 1,577,875 shares) at an exercise price of $2.00 per
share. See Note 5 which describes the impact of the warrants
on the pending acquisition of the Bank by First Alabama
Bancshares, Inc.

The impact of the above transaction, including the redemption of the
9.5% subordinated debentures, was to increase common stockholders'
equity by $20.1 million. In addition, cumulative dividends in arrears
as of March 31, 1993, of approximately $20 million were relinquished.

<PAGE> 9

Also, the Bank agreed to dismiss a lawsuit against the United States
in which the Bank claimed damages for breach of contract with respect
to the treatment of "supervisory goodwill" arising out of the Bank's
Louisiana acquisitions in 1987.

The termination of the covered assets assistance agreement was also
provided for in the settlement. In general, this settlement is based
upon the valuation or disposition of the covered assets and contingent
liabilities of the acquired institutions. Any loss resulting from the
valuation or disposition of the covered assets will be borne 75% by
the FDIC and 25% by the Bank. The Bank received a credit of $3
million as settlement for the contingent liabilities of the acquired
institutions. Management of the Bank does not anticipate future
charges to earnings resulting from the final settlement of covered
assets and contingent liabilities of the acquired institutions.

(5) DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH FIRST ALABAMA BANCSHARES, INC.

On May 26, 1993, the Bank's Board of Directors approved the signing of
a definitive agreement which provides for the acquisition of the Bank
by First Alabama Bancshares, Inc. ("First Alabama"). An agreement in
principle had been announced on May 18, 1993.

The definitive agreement provides that each of the outstanding shares
of the Bank's common stock would be converted into 0.667 of a share of
First Alabama common stock, subject to adjustment.

The proposed exchange ratio would be adjusted pursuant to a formula
which in effect offsets fifty percent of any decline in value of First
Alabama common stock to be received for each share of the Bank's
common stock as a result of any possible future decline in the market
value of First Alabama common stock between $33.00 and $25.50.
Similarly, the exchange ratio will be adjusted so that the resulting
value of the First Alabama common stock received for each share of the
Bank's common stock would be increased by fifty percent of any
increase in the market value of First Alabama common stock above
$33.00. The market value of First Alabama stock to be used in the
pricing formula will be determined based upon the average closing
price over the ten trading days ending on the date that the parties
receive the approval of the OTS.

At a price of $33.00 per share of First Alabama common stock, the
exchange ratio would remain unchanged at 0.667, providing a market
value equivalent of $22.00 for each share of the Bank's common stock.
At a price of $25.50 per share of First Alabama common stock, the
exchange ratio would be adjusted to 0.765, the highest possible ratio
under the formula, providing a market value equivalent of $19.50 for
each share of the Bank's common stock. If the market value of First
Alabama common stock were to be below $25.50, the exchange ratio would
remain unadjusted at 0.667 and the Bank would have the option of
terminating the transaction.

The increased market value of First Alabama common stock to be
<PAGE> 10
received by the Bank's stockholders if the market value of First
Alabama common stock exceeds $33.00 per share is limited only by the
formula's fifty percent sharing arrangement.

The definitive agreement further provides that the warrants presently
held by the FDIC, as manager of the FSLIC Resolution Fund, to purchase
in the aggregate 1,577,875 shares of Secor common stock will be
canceled at the effective time of the transaction in consideration for
a cash payment to the FDIC. For each share of the Bank's common stock
subject to a warrant, such cash payment would be equal to the market
value of the First Alabama common stock to be received for each share
of Secor common stock in the transaction less the $2.00 exercise price
of the warrant.

In addition, all stock options and outstanding convertible debentures
issued by the Bank will be assumed by First Alabama and the one series
of convertible preferred stock of Secor currently outstanding and held
by the Bank's ESOP will be converted into First Alabama common stock,
in each case on a basis that reflects the exchange ratio of the Bank's
common stock for First Alabama common stock.

The proposed acquisition is subject to various conditions, including
approval of appropriate regulatory authorities, approval of the
shareholders of Secor, and approval of the FDIC as manager of the
FSLIC Resolution Fund.

Due diligence satisfactory to First Alabama was completed on June 25,
1993. On July 15, 1993, the Bank announced that the Board of
Directors of the FDIC, acting solely in its capacity as manager of the
FRF, consented to the terms of the purchase by First Alabama of the
warrants held by the FDIC in accordance with the terms set forth in
the definitive agreement, amended to reflect certain terms requested
by the FDIC and described below.

The warrants, if exercised by the FDIC, would result in the FDIC
owning 25% of the Bank's common stock on a fully-diluted basis. Under
the terms of the definitive agreement entered into by First Alabama
and the Bank, each of the warrants would be canceled upon the closing
of the acquisition, in consideration of a cash payment equal to the
difference between (1) the market value of the First Alabama common
stock into which each share of the Bank's common stock is to be
converted and (2) $2.00, the exercise price of the warrant. Under the
original terms of the agreement, the exchange ratio of First Alabama
common stock for the Bank's common stock would be determined at the
time the OTS approves the transaction and the market value used to
determine the warrant payment would be determined immediately prior to
closing. The FDIC conditioned its consent upon the agreement being
amended so that the market value of First Alabama common stock used to
determine the cash payment for each warrant is the same as the market
value used to determine the exchange ratio of First Alabama common
stock for the Bank's common stock. First Alabama and the Bank have
agreed to the amendment. No other terms of the agreement were
affected by the amendment.

The consent of the FDIC described above was given by the FDIC
<PAGE> 11
solely in its capacity as manager of the FRF, and was not made by the
FDIC in any regulatory or supervisory capacity. Such consent does not
imply any endorsement by the FDIC of the acquisition of the Bank by
First Alabama or any determination by the FDIC of the fairness of the
financial terms of the acquisition to the Bank's shareholders. The
acquisition remains subject to approval by the Bank's shareholders and
to various regulatory approvals.

(6) STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

For purposes of the statements of cash flows for 1993 and 1992, the
Bank has considered cash on hand and in banks and interest bearing
deposits to be cash and cash equivalents. Total interest paid for the
nine months ended September 30, 1993 and 1992, was $72.7 million and
$96.4 million, respectively. Total income taxes paid for the nine
months ended September 30, 1993 and 1992 was $71,000 and $222,000,
respectively.

(7) REGULATIONS

The Bank is subject to examination and regulation by the OTS and the
FDIC.

On December 19, 1991, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
("FDIC") Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA") was signed into law. This
act, among other things, established new capital categories for banks
and thrifts, increased the borrowing authority of the Bank Insurance
Fund ("BIF"), and expanded industry reporting requirements and
regulatory authority. The FDICIA regulations established five capital
levels, with increasing regulatory authority for "prompt corrective
action" in the three "undercapitalized" levels. As of September 30,
1993, the Bank meets the requirements of the "adequately capitalized"
level.

PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed statement of condition
as of September 30, 1993, gives effect to (i) the acquisition of Secor Bank,
Federal Savings Bank ("Secor") by First Alabama Bancshares, Inc. ("First
Alabama") and (ii) the acquisition of First Federal Savings Bank of DeFuniak
Springs, Florida and First Federal Savings Bank of Marianna, Florida ("Other
Acquisitions") by First Alabama, assuming all the acquisitions are treated as
purchases for accounting purposes, as if all the transactions had been
consummated on September 30, 1993.

The following unaudited pro forma combined condensed statements of income
for the year ended December 31, 1992, and the nine months ended September 30,
1993, give effect to (i) the acquisition of Secor by First Alabama and (ii) the
Other Acquisitions by First Alabama, assuming that all the acquisitions are
treated as purchases for accounting purposes, as if all the transactions had
been consummated on January 1, 1992.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements are
presented for information purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of
the combined financial position or results of operations which would actually
have occurred if the transactions had been consummated in the past or which may
be obtained in the future.

The Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Reorganization between
First Alabama and Secor dated as of May 26, 1993, and amended and restated as
of August 15, 1993 (the "Agreement"), provided that Secor would use its best
efforts to modify and change its loan and real estate valuation policies and
practices (including potential strategies for more rapid disposition and
recovery of certain classified assets) immediately prior to consummation of the
Merger so as to be consistent on a mutually satisfactory basis with those of
First Alabama and, in addition, immediately prior to consummation of the
Merger, Secor would record certain expenses incurred in connection with the
Merger and related matters. The aggregate amount of the pro forma adjustments
resulting from such actions, as reflected in the accompanying pro forma
financial information, is estimated based on current information and,
therefore, is subject to modification.

The unaudited pro forma combined condensed financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes of Secor,
included as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

(a) These amounts reflect the revaluation of assets and liabilities of
Secor in accordance with purchase accounting treatment. Current market values
of investment securities were determined using publicly quoted prices. Certain
long-term fixed rate loans and deposits were valued based on prevailing market
interest rates. The final purchase accounting adjustments may vary to the
extent that the market values of these assets and liabilities change. The 
addition to the allowance for loan losses reflects the use of potential 
strategies for more rapid disposition and recovery of certain classified assets.

January 3, 1994

FIRST ALABAMA COMPLETES SECOR ACQUISITION

First Alabama Bancshares, Inc. announced today that the acquisition of Secor
Bank, Federal Savings Bank was completed on December 31, 1993.

First Alabama will issue approximately 3.2 million shares of its common
stock in exchange for all of Secor's outstanding common stock. The exchange
ratio will be 0.684 shares of First Alabama common stock for each share of
Secor common stock. Secor stockholders will receive a letter of instruction
early in January describing how to submit their Secor stock certificates for
exchange.

First Alabama's consolidated total assets, including Secor, are expected to
exceed $10 billion at year end 1993.

Secor Bank will operate as a separate subsidiary of First Alabama in
Florida and Louisiana, with customers of these offices seeing no immediate
changes. The thrift's Alabama offices, except for the office in Centre, will
be consolidated into First Alabama Bank during January. Customers in Alabama
have already been notified of changes that may affect them. Once the
consolidation has been completed, they should enjoy improved availability of
services and a wider range of banking products.

The Federal Reserve Board's approval of the transaction requires the
divestiture of Secor's Centre, Alabama branch. Arrangements for a sale of this
branch are being worked out. Until the sale is completed, the Centre office
will continue to operate as a Secor branch, with no customer impact.
