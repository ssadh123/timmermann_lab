Section 104. Acts of Holders; Record Dates.
----------------------------- 

(a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or
taken by Holders of the Outstanding Securities of all series or one or more
series, as the case may be, may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more
instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Holders in person
or by an agent or agents duly appointed in writing. If Securities of a
series are issuable as Bearer Securities, any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided
by this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders of Securities of such
series may, alternatively, be embodied in and evidenced by the record of
Holders of Securities of such series voting in favor thereof, either in
person or by proxies duly appointed in writing, at any meeting of Holders
of Securities of such series duly called and held in accordance with the
provisions of Article Fourteen, or a combination of such instruments and
any such record. Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such
action shall become effective when such instrument or instruments or record
or both are delivered to the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly
required, to the Company. Such instrument or instruments and any such
record (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby) are herein
sometimes referred to as the "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument
or instruments or so voting at any such meeting. Proof of execution of any
such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent, or of the
holding by any Person of a Security, shall be sufficient for any purpose of
this Indenture and conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company, if
made in the manner provided in this Section. The record of any meeting of
Holders of Securities shall be proved in the manner provided in Section
1406.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a Holder,
including a Depositary that is a Holder of a Global Security, may make,
give or take, by a proxy, or proxies, duly appointed in writing, any
request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other
action provided in this Indenture to be made, given or taken by Holders,
and a Depositary that is a Holder of a Global Security may provide its
proxy or proxies to the beneficial owners of interest in any such Global
Security.

(b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such
instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such
execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer
authorized by law to take acknowledgments of
<PAGE>

14

deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing
acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Where such execution is by a
signer acting in a capacity other than his individual capacity, such
certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his
authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or
writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be
proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.

(c) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security
Register.

(d) The ownership of Bearer Securities may be proved by the
production of such Bearer Securities or by a certificate executed, as
depositary, by any trust company, bank, banker or other depositary,
wherever situated, if such certificate shall be deemed by the Trustee to be
satisfactory, showing that at the date therein mentioned such Person had on
deposit with such depositary, or exhibited to it, the Bearer Securities
therein described; or such facts may be proved by the certificate or
affidavit of the Person holding such Bearer Securities, if such certificate
or affidavit is deemed by the Trustee to be satisfactory. The Trustee and
the Company may assume that such ownership of any Bearer Security continues
until (1) another certificate or affidavit bearing a later date issued in
respect of the same Bearer Security is produced, or (2) such Bearer
Security is produced to the Trustee by some other Person, or (3) such
Bearer Security is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security, or
(4) such Bearer Security is no longer outstanding. The ownership of Bearer
Securities may also be proved in any other manner that the Trustee deems
sufficient.

(e) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind
every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security
issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or
in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done
by the Trustee, any Security Registrar, any Paying Agent, any
Authenticating Agent or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not
notation of such action is made upon such Security.

Section 105. Notices, Etc. to Trustee and Company.
------------------------------------ 

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this
Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,

(1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company shall be
sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein
expressly provided) if made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or
with the Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Corporate
Trust and Agency Group, or

(2) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be
sufficient for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein
expressly provided) if made, given, furnished or filed in writing 

<PAGE>

Section 106. Notice to Holders; Waiver.
------------------------- 

Where this Indenture provides for notice of any event to Holders
of Registered Securities by the Company or the Trustee, such notice shall
be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in
writing and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each such Holder
affected by such event, at his address as it appears in the Security
Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest
date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. In any case where notice
to Holders of Registered Securities is given by mail, neither the failure
to mail such notice, nor any defect in any notice so mailed, to any
particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with respect
to other Holders of Registered Securities or the sufficiency of any notice
to Holders of Bearer Securities given as provided herein. Any notice
mailed to a Holder in the manner herein prescribed shall be conclusively
deemed to have been received by such Holder, whether or not such Holder
actually receives such notice.

If by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in regular
mail service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to
give such notice by mail, then such notification to Holders of Registered
Securities as shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall
constitute a sufficient notification to such Holders for every purpose
hereunder.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or otherwise
specified with respect to any Securities pursuant to Section 301, where
this Indenture provides for notice to Holders of Bearer Securities of any
event, such notice shall be sufficiently given if published in an
Authorized Newspaper in The City of New York and in such other city or
cities as may be specified in such Securities on a Business Day, such
publication to be not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the
earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such notice. Any such notice
shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if
published more than once, on the date of the first such publication.

If by reason of the suspension of publication of any Authorized
Newspaper or Authorized Newspapers or by reason of any other cause it shall
be impracticable to publish any notice to Holders of Bearer Securities as
provided above, then such notification to Holders of Bearer Securities as
shall be given with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute sufficient
notice to such Holders for every purpose hereunder. Neither the failure to
give notice by publication to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided
above, nor any defect in any notice so published, shall affect the
sufficiency of such notice with respect to other Holders of Bearer
Securities or the sufficiency of any notice to Holders of Registered
Securities given as provided herein.
<PAGE>

16

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or
waiver required or permitted under this Indenture shall be in the English
language, except that any published notice may be in an official language
of the country of publication.

Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such
notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such
notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the
equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders shall be filed
with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the
validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

equitable right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.

coupon other than a provision in the Securities of any series which

Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to the
delivery of the Officers' Certificate setting forth the terms of the Securities
of such series.

Section 302. Denominations.
------------- 

The Securities of each series shall be issuable in such denominations
as shall be specified as contemplated by Section 301. With respect to
Securities of any series denominated in Dollars, in the absence of any such
provisions with respect to the Securities of any series, the Registered
Securities of such series, other than Registered Securities issued
<PAGE>

24

in global form (which may be of any denomination) shall be issuable in
denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof, and the Bearer
Securities of such series, other than Bearer Securities issued in global form
(which may be of any denomination), shall be issuable in a denomination of
$5,000.

Section 303. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
---------------------------------------------- 

The Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto shall be executed
on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, or one of its Vice
Chairman of the Board, its President or one of its Vice Presidents, under its
corporate seal reproduced thereon, and attested by its Secretary or one of its
Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities
and coupons may be manual or facsimile signatures of the present or any future
such authorized officer and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the
Securities and coupons.

Securities or coupons bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of
individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind
the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to
hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or
did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities or coupons.

At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of
this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series together with
any coupon appertaining thereto, executed by the Company to the Trustee for
authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and
delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee upon receipt of and in accordance
with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities; provided,
however, that, in connection with its original issuance, no Bearer Security
shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United States; and
provided further that, unless otherwise specified with respect to any series of
Securities pursuant to Section 301, a Bearer Security may be delivered in
connection with its original issuance only if the Person entitled to receive
such Bearer Security shall have furnished a certificate in the form set forth in
Exhibit A-1 to this Indenture, dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the
earlier of the date on which such Bearer Security is delivered and the date on
which any temporary Security first becomes exchangeable for such Bearer Security
in accordance with the terms of such temporary Security and this Indenture. If
any Security shall be represented by a permanent global Bearer Security, then,
for purposes of this Section and Section 304, the notation of a beneficial
owner's interest therein upon original issuance of such Security or upon
exchange of a portion of a temporary global Security shall be deemed to be
delivery in connection with its original issuance of such beneficial owner's
interest in such permanent global Security. Except as permitted by Section 306,
the Trustee shall not authenticate and deliver any Bearer Security unless all
appurtenant coupons for interest then matured have been detached and cancelled.
If not all the Securities of any series are to be issued at one time and if the
Board Resolution or supplemental indenture establishing such series shall so
permit, such Company Order may set forth procedures
<PAGE>

25

acceptable to the Trustee for the issuance of such Securities and determining
terms of particular Securities of such series, such as interest rate, maturity
date, date of issuance and date from which interest shall accrue. In
authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities
under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be
entitled to receive, and (subject to TIA Sections 315(a) through 315(d)) shall
be fully protected in relying upon,

(i) an Opinion of Counsel stating,

(a) that the form or forms of such Securities and any coupons
have been established in conformity with the provisions of this
Indenture;

(b) that the terms of such Securities and any coupons have been
established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and 

(c) that such Securities, together with any coupons appertaining
thereto, when completed by appropriate insertions and executed and
delivered by the Company to the Trustee for authentication in
accordance with this Indenture, authenticated and delivered by the
Trustee in accordance with this Indenture and issued by the Company in
the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of
Counsel, will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of
the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other similar
laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement
of creditors' rights, to general equitable principles and to such
other qualifications as such counsel shall conclude do not materially
affect the rights of Holders of such Securities and any coupons; and

(ii) an Officers' Certificate stating, to the best of the knowledge
of the signers of such certificate, that no Event of Default with respect
to any of the Securities shall have occurred and be continuing.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding two
paragraphs, if not all the Securities of any series are to be issued at one
time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise
required pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel
otherwise required pursuant to the preceding two paragraphs prior to or at the
time of issuance of each Security, but such documents shall be delivered prior
to or at the time of issuance of the first Security of such series.

If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not
be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities
pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties,
obligations or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise
in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. Notwithstanding
the generality of the foregoing, the Trustee will not be
<PAGE>

26

required to authenticate Securities denominated in a Foreign Currency if the
Trustee reasonably believes that it would be unable to perform its duties with
respect to such Securities.

Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its
authentication, and each Bearer Security shall be dated as of the date specified
as contemplated by Section 301.

No Security or coupon shall be entitled to any benefit under this
Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such
Security or Security to which such coupon appertains a certificate of
authentication substantially in the form provided for herein duly executed by
the Trustee by manual signature of a Responsible Officer, and such certificate
upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such
Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to
the benefits of this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security
shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold
by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for
cancellation as provided in Section 310 together with a written statement (which
need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of
Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the
Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never
to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled
to the benefits of this Indenture.

Section 304. Temporary Securities.
-------------------- 

(a) Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series,
the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate
and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten,
mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination,
substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they
are issued, in registered form, or, if authorized, in bearer form with one or
more coupon or without coupons, and with such appropriate insertions, omissions,
substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may
determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Securities. In
the case of Securities of any series, such temporary Securities may be in global
form.

Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form (which shall
be exchanged in accordance with the provisions of the following paragraphs), if
temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive
Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the
preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of
such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series, upon
surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of
the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder.
Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any
series (accompanied by any unmatured coupons appertaining thereto), the Company
shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange
therefor a like principal
<PAGE>

27

amount of definitive Securities of the same series of authorized denominations;
provided, however, that no definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in
exchange for a temporary Registered Security; and provided further that a
definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Bearer
Security only in compliance with the conditions set forth in Section 303. Until
so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all respects be
entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of
such series.

(b) Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to a Board Resolution,
this Section 304(b) shall govern the exchange of temporary Securities issued in
global form. If temporary Securities or any series are issued in global form,
any such temporary global Security shall, unless otherwise provided therein, be
delivered to the London office of a depositary or common depositary (the "Common
Depositary"), for the benefit of Euroclear and CEDEL, for credit to the
respective accounts of the beneficial owners of such Securities (or to such
other accounts as they may direct).

Without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the date
specified in, or determined pursuant to the terms of, any such temporary global
Security (the "Temporary/Definitive Exchange Date"), the Company shall deliver
to the Trustee definitive Securities, in aggregate principal amount equal to the
principal amount of such temporary global Security, executed by the Company. On
or after the Temporary/Definitive Exchange Date, such temporary global Security
shall be surrendered by the Common Depositary to the Trustee, as the Company's
agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part,
for definitive Securities without charge, and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in exchange for each portion of such temporary global Security, an
equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of
authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such temporary
global Security to be exchanged. The definitive Securities to be delivered in
exchange for any such temporary global Security shall be in bearer form,
registered form, permanent global bearer form or permanent global registered
form, or any combination thereof, as specified as contemplated by Section 301,
and, if any combination thereof is so specified, as requested by the beneficial
owner thereof; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified in such
temporary global Security, upon such presentation by the Common Depositary, such
temporary global Security is accompanied by a certificate dated the
Temporary/Definitive Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by Euroclear
as to the portion of such temporary global Security held for its account then to
be exchanged and a certificate dated the Temporary/Definitive Exchange Date or a
subsequent date and signed by CEDEL as to the portion of such temporary global
Security held for its account then to be exchanged, each in the form set forth
in Exhibit A-2 to this Indenture (or in such other form as may be established
pursuant to Section 301); and provided further that definitive Bearer Securities
shall be delivered in exchange for a portion of a temporary global Security only
in compliance with the requirements of Section 303.

Unless otherwise specified in such temporary global Security, the
interest of a beneficial owner of Securities of a series in a temporary global
Security shall be exchanged
<PAGE>

28

for definitive Securities of the same series and of like tenor following the
Temporary/Definitive Exchange Date when the account holder instructs Euroclear
or CEDEL, as the case may be, to request such exchange on his behalf and
delivers to Euroclear or CEDEL, as the case may be, a certificate in the form
set forth in Exhibit A-1 to this Indenture (or in such other form as may be
established pursuant to Section 301), dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the
Temporary/Definitive Exchange Date, copies of which certificate shall be
available from the offices of Euroclear and CEDEL, the Trustee, any
Authenticating Agent appointed for such series of Securities and each Paying
Agent. Unless otherwise specified in such temporary global Security, any such
exchange shall be made free of charge to the beneficial owners of such temporary
global Security, except that a Person receiving definitive Securities must bear
the cost of insurance, postage, transportation and the like unless such Person
takes delivery of such definitive Securities in person at the offices of
Euroclear or CEDEL. Definitive Securities in bearer form to be delivered in
exchange for any portion of a temporary global Security shall be delivered only
outside the United States.

Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, the temporary
Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits
under this Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series and of like
tenor authenticated and delivered hereunder, except that, unless otherwise
specified as contemplated by Section 301, interest payable on a temporary global
Security on an Interest Payment Date for Securities of such series occurring
prior to the applicable Temporary/Definitive Exchange Date shall be payable to
Euroclear and CEDEL on such Interest Payment Date upon delivery by Euroclear and
CEDEL to the Trustee of a certificate or certificates in the form set forth in
Exhibit A-2 to this Indenture (or in such other form as may be established
pursuant to Section 301), for credit without further interest on or after such
Interest Payment Date to the respective accounts of the Persons who are the
beneficial owners of such temporary global Security on such Interest Payment
Date and who have each delivered to Euroclear or CEDEL, as the case may be, a
certificate dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the Interest Payment Date
occurring prior to such Temporary/Definitive Exchange Date in the form set forth
in Exhibit A-1 to this Indenture (or in such other form as may be established
pursuant to Section 301). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein
contained, the certifications made pursuant to this paragraph shall satisfy the
certification requirements of the preceding two paragraphs of this Section and
of the third paragraph of Section 303 of this Indenture and the interests of the
Persons who are the beneficial owners of the temporary global Security with
respect to which such certification was made will be exchanged for definitive
Securities of the same series and of like tenor on the Temporary/Definitive
Exchange Date or the date of certification if such date occurs after the
Temporary/Definitive Exchange Date, without further act or deed by such
beneficial owners. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, no payments
of principal (or premium, if any) or interest owing with respect to a beneficial
interest in a temporary global Security will be made unless and until such
interest in such temporary global Security shall have been exchanged for an
interest in a definitive Security. Any interest so received by Euroclear and
CEDEL and not paid as herein provided shall be returned to the Trustee
immediately prior to the expiration of two years after such Interest Payment
Date in order to be repaid to the Company.

Section 305. Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
--------------------------------------------------- 

The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of
the Trustee a register for each series of Securities (the registers maintained
in the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee and in any other office or agency
of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively
referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable
regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration
of Registered Securities and of transfers of Registered Securities. The
Security Register shall be in written form or any other form capable of being
converted into written form within a reasonable time. The Trustee, at its
Corporate Trust Office, is hereby initially appointed "Security Registrar" for
the purpose of registering Registered Securities and transfers of Registered
Securities on such Security Register as herein provided. In the event that the
Trustee shall cease to be Security Registrar, it shall have the right to examine
the Security Register at all reasonable times.

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Registered Security
of any series at the office or agency in a Place of Payment for that series, the
Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the
name of the designated transferee, one or more new Registered Securities of the
same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal
amount, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding and containing
identical terms and provisions.

At the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series may
be exchanged for other Registered Securities of the same series, of any
authorized denomination and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender
of the Registered Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever
any Registered Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall
execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Registered
Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Unless
otherwise specified with respect to any series of Securities as contemplated by
Section 301, Bearer Securities may not be issued in exchange for Registered
Securities.

If (but only if) expressly permitted in or pursuant to the applicable
Board Resolution and (subject to Section 303) set forth in the applicable
Officers' Certificate, or in any indenture supplemental hereto, delivered as
contemplated by Section 301, at the option of the Holder, Bearer Securities of
any series may be exchanged for Registered Securities of the same series of any
authorized denomination and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor, upon
surrender of the Bearer Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency,
with all unmatured coupons and all matured coupons in default thereto
appertaining. If the Holder of a Bearer Security is unable to produce any such
unmatured coupon or coupons or matured coupon or coupons in default, any such
permitted exchange may be effected if the Bearer Securities are accompanied by
payment in funds acceptable to the Company in an amount equal to the face amount
of such missing coupon or coupons, or the surrender of such missing coupon or
coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there is furnished to
them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and
<PAGE>

30

any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall
surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in respect of which such a
payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the
amount of such payment; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in
Section 1002, interest represented by coupons shall be payable only upon
presentation and surrender of those coupons at an office or agency located
outside the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case a Bearer
Security of any series is surrendered at any such office or agency in a
permitted exchange for a Registered Security of the same series and like tenor
after the close of business at such office or agency on (i) any Regular Record
Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant
Interest Payment Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of
business at such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of
Defaulted Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the coupon
relating to such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case
may be, and interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be
payable on such Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case
may be, in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer
Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such coupon when due in
accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.

Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company
shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities
which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise specified as
contemplated by Section 301, any permanent global Security shall be exchangeable
only as provided in this paragraph. If any beneficial owner of an interest in a
permanent global Security is entitled to exchange such interest for Securities
of such series and of like tenor and principal amount of another authorized form
and denomination, as specified as contemplated by Section 301 and provided that
any applicable notice provided in the permanent global Security shall have been
given, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the
earliest date on which such interest may be so exchanged, the Company shall
deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities in aggregate principal amount equal
to the principal amount of such beneficial owner's interest in such permanent
global Security, executed by the Company. On or after the earliest date on
which such interests may be so exchanged, such permanent global Security shall
be surrendered by the Common Depositary or such other depositary as shall be
specified in the Company Order with respect thereto to the Trustee, as the
Company's agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or from time to time
in part, for definitive Securities without charge, and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, in exchange for each portion of such permanent global
Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the
same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such
permanent global Security to be exchanged which, unless the Securities of the
series are not issuable both as Bearer Securities and as Registered Securities,
as specified as contemplated by Section 301, shall be in the form of Bearer
Securities or Registered Securities, or any combination thereof, as shall be
specified by the beneficial owner thereof; provided, however, that no such
exchanges may occur during a period beginning at the
<PAGE>

31

opening of business 15 days before any selection of Securities to be redeemed
and ending on the relevant Redemption Date if the Security for which exchange is
requested may be among those selected for redemption; and provided further that
no Bearer Security delivered in exchange for a portion of a permanent global
Security shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United
States. If a Registered Security is issued in exchange for any portion of a
permanent global Security after the close of business at the office or agency
where such exchange occurs on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening
of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or
(ii) any Special Record Date and the opening of business at such office or
agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, interest
or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest
Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of
such Registered Security, but will be payable on such Interest Payment Date or
proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the Person to whom
interest in respect of such portion of such permanent global Security is payable
in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.

All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of
Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same
debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities
surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

Every Registered Security presented or surrendered for registration of
transfer or for exchange or redemption shall (if so required by the Company or
the Security Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security
Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized
in writing.

No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or
exchange or redemption of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other
than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906, 1107 or 1305 not involving any
transfer.

The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer
of or exchange any Security if such Security may be among those selected for
redemption during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before
the day of the selection for redemption of Securities of that series under
Section 1103 or 1203 and ending at the close of business on (A) if Securities of
the series are issuable only as Registered Securities, the day of the mailing of
the relevant notice of redemption and (B) if Securities of the series are
issuable as Bearer Securities, the day of the first publication of the relevant
notice of redemption or, if Securities of the series are also issuable as
Registered Securities and there is no publication, the mailing of the relevant
notice of redemption, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any
Registered Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the
unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part, or (iii) to
<PAGE>

32

exchange any Bearer Security so selected for redemption except that such a
Bearer Security may be exchanged for a Registered Security of that series and
like tenor; provided that such Registered Security shall be simultaneously
surrendered for redemption, or (iv) to issue, register the transfer of or
exchange any Security which has been surrendered for repayment at the option of
the Holder, except the portion, if any, of such Security not to be so repaid.

Section 306. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
------------------------------------------------ 

If any mutilated Security or a Security with a mutilated coupon
appertaining to it is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and
the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security
of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number
not contemporaneously outstanding, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if
any, appertaining to the surrendered Security.

If there shall be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee (i)
evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security
or coupon and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save
each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of
notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security or coupon has been
acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its
request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such
destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for the Security to which a
destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains (with all appurtenant coupons not
destroyed, lost or stolen), a new Security of the same series and principal
amount, containing identical terms and provisions and bearing a number not
contemporaneously outstanding, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if
any, appertaining to such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the Security
to which such destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous two paragraphs, in case
any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or coupon has become or
is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead
of issuing a new Security, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if any,
appertaining to such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the
Security to which such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen coupons appertains,
pay such Security or coupon; provided, however, that payment of principal of
(and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on Bearer Securities shall, except
as otherwise provided in Section 1002, be payable only at an office or agency
located outside the United States and, unless otherwise specified as
contemplated by Section 301, any interest on Bearer Securities shall be payable
only upon presentation and surrender of the coupons appertaining thereto.

Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company
may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other
expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
<PAGE>

33

Every new Security of any series with its coupons, if any, issued
pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in
exchange for a Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains,
shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company,
whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security and its coupons, if any,
or the destroyed, lost or stolen coupon, shall be at any time enforceable by
anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and
proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series and their
coupons, if any, duly issued hereunder.

The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to
the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement
or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or coupons.

Section 307. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved; Optional Interest
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Reset.
----- 

(a) Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with
respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Registered Security which
is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment
Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Security (or one or more
Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular
Record Date for such interest at the office or agency of the Company maintained
for such purpose pursuant to Section 1002; provided, however, that each
installment of interest on any Registered Security may at the Company's option
be paid by (i) mailing a check for such interest, payable to or upon the written
order of the Person entitled thereto pursuant to Section 309, to the address of
such Person as it appears on the Security Register or (ii) transfer to an
account maintained by the payee located in the United States.

Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect
to the Securities of any series, payment of interest may be made, in the case of
a Bearer Security, by transfer to an account maintained by the payee with a bank
located outside the United States.

Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301, every
permanent global Security will provide that interest, if any, payable on any
Interest Payment Date will be paid to each of Euroclear and CEDEL with respect
to that portion of such permanent global Security held for its account by the
Common Depositary, for the purpose of permitting each of Euroclear and CEDEL to
credit the interest received by it in respect of such permanent global Security
to the accounts of the beneficial owners thereof.

In case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered in exchange for
a Registered Security of such series after the close of business (at an office
or agency in a Place of Payment for such series) on any Regular Record Date and
before the opening of business (at such office or agency) on the next succeeding
Interest Payment Date, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the
coupon relating to such Interest Payment
<PAGE>

34

Date and interest will not be payable on such Interest Payment Date in respect
of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but will
be payable only to the Holder of such coupon when due in accordance with the
provisions of this Indenture.

Except as otherwise specified with respect to a series of Securities
in accordance with the provisions of Section 301, any interest on any Registered
Security of any series that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly
provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest")
shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder thereto on the
relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such
Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as
provided in clause (1) or (2) below:

(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest
to the Persons in whose names the Registered Securities of such series (or
their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of
business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted
Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall
notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed
to be paid on each Registered Security of such series and the date of the
proposed payment (which shall not be less than 20 days after such notice is
received by the Trustee), and at the same time the Company shall deposit
with the Trustee an amount of money in the currency or currencies, currency
unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the Securities
of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to
Section 301 for the Securities of such series and except, if applicable, as
provided in Sections 312(b), 312(d) and 312(e)) equal to the aggregate
amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall
make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the
date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust
for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in
this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record
Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more
than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed
payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the
notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the
Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of
the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted
Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class
postage prepaid, to each Holder of Registered Securities of such series at
his address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days
prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such
Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so
mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names
the Registered Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor
Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record
Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
In case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered at the office or
agency in a Place of Payment for such series in exchange for a Registered
Security of such series
<PAGE>

35

after the close of business at such office or agency on any Special Record
Date and before the opening of business at such office or agency on the
related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, such Bearer
Security shall be surrendered without the coupon relating to such proposed
date of payment and Defaulted Interest will not be payable on such proposed
date of payment in respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange
for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of such
coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.

(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the
Registered Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not
inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such
Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such
exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the
proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be
deemed acceptable to the Trustee.

(b) The provisions of this Section 307(b) may be made applicable to
any series of Securities pursuant to Section 301 (with such modifications,
additions or substitutions as may be specified pursuant to such Section 301).
The interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such
interest rate, if applicable) on any Security of such series may be reset by the
Company on the date or dates specified on the face of such Security (each an
"Optional Reset Date"). The Company may exercise such option with respect to
such Security by notifying the Trustee of such exercise at least 50 but not more
than 60 days prior to an Optional Reset Date for such Note. Not later than 40
days prior to each Optional Reset Date, the Trustee shall transmit, in the
manner provided for in Section 106, to the Holder of any such Security a notice
(the "Reset Notice") indicating whether the Company has elected to reset the
interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such
interest rate, if applicable), and if so (i) such new interest rate (or such new
spread or spread multiplier, if applicable) and (ii) the provisions, if any, for
redemption during the period from such Optional Reset Date to the next Optional
Reset Date or if there is no such next Optional Reset Date, to the Stated
Maturity Date of such Security (each such period a "Subsequent Interest
Period"), including the date or dates on which or the period or periods during
which and the price or prices at which such redemption may occur during the
Subsequent Interest Period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days prior to the
Optional Reset Date, the Company may, at its option, revoke the interest rate
(or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if
applicable) provided for in the Reset Notice and establish an interest rate (or
a spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if
applicable) that is higher than the interest rate (or the spread or spread
multiplier, if applicable) provided for in the Reset Notice, for the Subsequent
Interest Period by causing the Trustee to transmit, in the manner provided for
in Section 106, notice of such higher interest rate (or such higher spread or
spread multiplier, if applicable) to the Holder of such Security. Such notice
shall be irrevocable. All Securities with respect to which the interest rate
(or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if
applicable) is
<PAGE>

36

reset on an Optional Reset Date, and with respect to which the Holders of such
Securities have not tendered such Securities for repayment (or have validly
revoked any such tender) pursuant to the next succeeding paragraph, will bear
such higher interest rate (or such higher spread or spread multiplier, if
applicable).

The Holder of any such Security will have the option to elect
repayment by the Company of the principal of such Security on each Optional
Reset Date at a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus interest
accrued to such Optional Reset Date. In order to obtain repayment on an
Optional Reset Date, the Holder must follow the procedures set forth in Article
Thirteen for repayment at the option of Holders except that the period for
delivery or notification to the Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than
35 days prior to such Optional Reset Date and except that, if the Holder has
tendered any Security for repayment pursuant to the Reset Notice, the Holder
may, by written notice to the Trustee, revoke such tender or repayment until the
close of business on the tenth day before such Optional Reset Date.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 305,
each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or
in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to
interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other
Security.

Section 308. Optional Extension of Maturity.
------------------------------ 

The provisions of this Section 308 may be made applicable to any
series of Securities pursuant to Section 301 (with such modifications, additions
or substitutions as may be specified pursuant to such Section 301). The Stated
Maturity of any Security of such series may be extended at the option of the
Company for the period or periods specified on the face of such Security (each
an "Extension Period") up to but not beyond the date (the "Final Maturity") set
forth on the face of such Security. The Company may exercise such option with
respect to any Security by notifying the Trustee of such exercise at least 50
but not more than 60 days prior to the Stated Maturity of such Security in
effect prior to the exercise of such option (the "Original Stated Maturity").
If the Company exercises such option, the Trustee shall transmit, in the manner
provided for in Section 106, to the Holder of such Security not later than 40
days prior to the Original Stated Maturity a notice (the "Extension Notice")
indicating (i) the election of the Company to extend the Stated Maturity, (ii)
the new Stated Maturity, (iii) the interest rate, if any, applicable to the
Extension Period and (iv) the provisions, if any, for redemption during such
Extension Period. Upon the Trustee's transmittal of the Extension Notice, the
Stated Maturity of such Security shall be extended automatically and, except as
modified by the Extension Notice and as described in the next paragraph, such
Security will have the same terms as prior to the transmittal of such Extension
Notice.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days before the
Original Stated Maturity of such Security, the Company may, at its option,
revoke the interest rate
<PAGE>

37

provided for in the Extension Notice and establish a higher interest rate for
the Extension Period by causing the Trustee to transmit, in the manner provided
for in Section 106, notice of such higher interest rate to the Holder of such
Security. Such notice shall be irrevocable. All Securities with respect to
which the Stated Maturity is extended will bear such higher interest rate.

If the Company extends the Maturity of any Security, the Holder will
have the option to elect repayment of such Security by the Company on the
Original Stated Maturity at a price equal to the principal amount thereof, plus
interest accrued to such date. In order to obtain repayment on the Original
Stated Maturity once the Company has extended the Maturity thereof, the Holder
must follow the procedures set forth in Article Fifteen for repayment at the
option of Holders, except that the period for delivery or notification to the
Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than 35 days prior to the Original
Stated Maturity and except that, if the Holder has tendered any Security for
repayment pursuant to an Extension Notice, the Holder may by written notice to
the Trustee revoke such tender for repayment until the close of business on the
tenth day before the Original Stated Maturity.

Section 309. Persons Deemed Owners.
--------------------- 

Prior to due presentment of a Registered Security for registration of
transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee
may treat the Person in whose name such Registered Security is registered as the
owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and
premium, if any) and (subject to Sections 305 and 307) interest, if any, on such
Registered Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such
Registered Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any
agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

Title to any Bearer Security and any coupons appertaining thereto
shall pass by delivery. The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company
or the Trustee may treat the bearer of any Bearer Security and the bearer of any
coupon as the absolute owner of such Security or coupon for the purpose of
receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and for all other purposes
whatsoever, whether or not such Security or coupons be overdue, and neither the
Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be
affected by notice to the contrary.

None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security
Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the
records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership
interests of a Security in global form or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any global Security,
nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee, or any agent of the
Company or the Trustee,
<PAGE>

38

from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization
furnished by any depositary, as a Holder, with respect to such global Security
or impair, as between such depositary and owners of beneficial interests in such
global Security, the operation of customary practices governing the exercise of
the rights of such depositary (or its nominee) as Holder of such global
Security.

Section 310. Cancellation.
------------ 

All Securities and coupons surrendered for payment, redemption,
repayment at the option of the Holder, registration of transfer or exchange or
for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person
other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and any such Securities and
coupons and Securities and coupons surrendered directly to the Trustee for any
such purpose shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time
deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated
and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner
whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery
to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated
hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so
delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. If the Company shall so
acquire any of the Securities, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a
redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities
unless and until the same are surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation. No
Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities
cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this
Indenture. Cancelled Securities and coupons held by the Trustee shall be
destroyed by the Trustee in its customary manner and the Trustee shall deliver a
certificate of such destruction to the Company, unless by a Company Order the
Company directs their return to it within 30 days after such Securities have
been delivered to the Trustee for such purpose. The Trustee shall not be
required to hold cancelled Securities for more than one year.

Section 311. Computation of Interest.
----------------------- 

Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with
respect to Securities of any series, interest, if any, on the Securities of each
series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

Section 312. Currency and Manner of Payments in Respect of Securities.
-------------------------------------------------------- 

(a) Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities
pursuant to Section 301, with respect to Registered Securities of any series not
permitting the election provided for in paragraph (b) below or the Holders of
which have not made the election provided for in paragraph (b) below, and with
respect to Bearer Securities of any series, except as provided in paragraph (d)
below, payment of the principal of (and premium, if any, on) and interest, if
any, on any Registered or Bearer Security of such series will be made in the
currency or currencies in which such Registered Security or Bearer Security, as
the case may be, is
<PAGE>

39

payable. The provisions of this Section 312 may be modified or superseded with
respect to any Securities pursuant to Section 301.

(b) It may be provided pursuant to Section 301 with respect to
Registered Securities of any series that Holders shall have the option, subject
to paragraphs (d) and (e) below, to receive payments of principal of (and
premium, if any, on) or interest, if any, on such Registered Securities in any
of the currencies, currency units or composite currencies which may be
designated for such election by delivering to the Trustee for such series of
Registered Securities a written election with signature guarantees and in the
applicable form established pursuant to Section 301, not later than the close of
business on the Currency Election Date immediately preceding the applicable
payment date. If a Holder so elects to receive such payments in any such
currency, currency unit or composite currency, such election will remain in
effect for such Holder or any transferee of such Holder until changed by such
Holder or such transferee by written notice to the Trustee for such series of
Registered Securities (but any such change must be made not later than the close
of business on the Currency Election Date immediately preceding the next payment
date to be effective for the payment to be made on such payment date and no such
change of election may be made with respect to payments to be made on any
Registered Security of such series with respect to which an Event of Default has
occurred or with respect to which the Company has deposited funds pursuant to
Article Four or Fourteen or with respect to which a notice of redemption has
been given by the Company or a notice of option to elect repayment has been sent
by such Holder or such transferee). Any Holder of any such Registered Security
who shall not have delivered any such election to the Trustee of such series of
Registered Securities not later than the close of business on the applicable
Currency Election Date will be paid the amount due on the applicable payment
date in the relevant currency or currencies as provided in Section 312(a). The
Trustee for each such series of Registered Securities shall notify the Exchange
Rate Agent as soon as practicable after the Currency Election Date of the
aggregate principal amount of Registered Securities for which Holders have made
such written election.

(c) Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, if the
election referred to in paragraph (b) above has been provided for pursuant to
Section 301, then, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, not later
than the fourth Business Day after the Currency Election Date for each payment
date for Registered Securities of any series, the Exchange Rate Agent will
deliver to the Company a written notice specifying, in the currency or
currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which
Registered Securities of such series are payable, the respective aggregate
amounts of principal of (and premium, if any, on) and interest, if any, on the
Registered Securities to be paid on such payment date, specifying the amounts in
such currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or
currencies so payable in respect of the Registered Securities as to which the
Holders of Registered Securities denominated in any currency or currencies,
currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies shall have elected to
be paid in another currency, currency unit or composite currency as provided in
paragraph (b) above. If the election referred to in paragraph (b) above has
been provided for pursuant to Section 301 and if at least one Holder has made
such election, then, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, on the
second
<PAGE>

40

Business Day preceding such payment date the Company will deliver to the Trustee
for such series of Registered Securities an Exchange Rate Officer's Certificate
in respect of the Dollar or Foreign Currency payments to be made on such payment
date. Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, the Dollar, Foreign
Currency or currencies, ECU or currency unit amount receivable by Holders of
Registered Securities who have elected payment in a currency or currency unit as
provided in paragraph (b) above shall be determined by the Company on the basis
of the applicable Market Exchange Rate in effect on the second Business Day (the
"Valuation Date") immediately preceding each payment date, and such
determination shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest
error. 

(d) If a Currency Conversion Event occurs with respect to a Foreign
Currency, the ECU or any other currency unit in which any of the Securities are
denominated or payable other than pursuant to an election provided for pursuant
to paragraph (b) above, then with respect to each date for the payment of
principal of (and premium, if any, on) and interest, if any, on the applicable
Securities denominated or payable in such Foreign Currency, the ECU or such
other currency unit occurring after the last date on which such Foreign
Currency, the ECU or such other currency unit was used (the "Currency Conversion
Date"), the Dollar shall be the Currency of payment for use on each such payment
date. Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, the Dollar amount to
be paid by the Company to the Trustee of each series of Securities and by the
Trustee or any Paying Agent to the Holders of such Securities with respect to
such payment date shall be, in the case of a Foreign Currency other than a
currency unit, the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency or, in the case of
a currency unit, the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit, in each case as
determined by the Exchange Rate Agent in the manner provided in paragraph (f) or
(g) below.

(e) Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, if the Holder
of a Registered Security denominated in any currency or currencies, currency
unit or units or composite currency or currencies shall have elected to be paid
in another currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency
or currencies as provided in paragraph (b) above, and a Currency Conversion
Event occurs with respect to such elected currency or currencies, currency unit
or units or composite currency or currencies, such Holder shall receive payment
in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or
currencies in which payment would have been made in the absence of such
election; and if a Currency Conversion Event occurs with respect to the currency
or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in
which payment would have been made in the absence of such election, such Holder
shall receive payment in Dollars as provided in paragraph (d) above.

(f) The "Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency" shall be
determined by the Exchange Rate Agent and shall be obtained for each subsequent
payment date by converting the specified Foreign Currency into Dollars at the
Market Exchange Rate on the Currency Conversion Date.

(g) The "Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit" shall be determined
by the Exchange Rate Agent and subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) below
shall be the sum of
<PAGE>

41

each amount obtained by converting the Specified Amount of each Component
Currency into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate for such Component Currency on
the Valuation Date with respect to each payment.

(h) For purposes of this Section 312, the following terms shall have
the following meanings:

A "Component Currency" shall mean any Currency which, on the Currency
Conversion Date, was a component currency of the relevant currency unit,
including, but not limited to, the ECU.

A "Specified Amount" of a Component Currency shall mean the number of
units of such Component Currency or fractions thereof which were
represented in the relevant currency unit, including, but not limited to,
the ECU, on the Currency Conversion Date. If after the Currency Conversion
Date the official unit of any Component Currency is altered by way of
combination or subdivision, the Specified Amount of such Component Currency
shall be divided or multiplied in the same proportion. If after the
Currency Conversion Date two or more Component Currencies are consolidated
into a single currency, the respective Specified Amounts of such Component
Currencies shall be replaced by an amount in such single currency equal to
the sum of the respective Specified Amounts of such consolidated Component
Currencies expressed in such single currency, and such amount shall
thereafter be a Specified Amount and such single currency shall thereafter
be a Component Currency. If after the Currency Conversion Date any
Component Currency shall be divided into two or more currencies, the
Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall be replaced by amounts of
such two or more currencies, having an aggregate Dollar Equivalent value at
the Market Exchange Rate on the date of such replacement equal to the
Dollar Equivalent value of the Specified Amount of such former Component
Currency at the Market Exchange Rate immediately before such division, and
such amounts shall thereafter be Specified Amounts and such currencies
shall thereafter be Component Currencies. If, after the Currency
Conversion Date of the relevant currency unit, including, but not limited
to, the ECU, a Currency Conversion Event (other than any event referred to
above in this definition of "Specified Amount") occurs with respect to any
Component Currency of such currency unit and is continuing on the
applicable Valuation Date, the Specified Amount of such Component Currency
shall, for purposes of calculating the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency
Unit, be converted into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate in effect on
the Currency Conversion Date of such Component Currency.

"Currency Election Date" shall mean the date for any series of
Registered Securities as specified pursuant to clause (13) of Section 301
by which the written election referred to in paragraph (b) above may be
made.

All decisions and determinations of the Exchange Rate Agent regarding
the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency, the Dollar Equivalent of the
Currency Unit, the Market
<PAGE>

42

Exchange Rate and changes in the Specified Amounts as specified above shall be
in its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of manifest error, be
conclusive for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the Company, the
Trustee and all Holders of such Securities denominated or payable in the
relevant currency. The Exchange Rate Agent shall promptly give written notice
to the Company and the Trustee of any such decision or determination.

In the event that the Company determines in good faith that a Currency
Conversion Event has occurred with respect to a Foreign Currency, the Company
will immediately give written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Exchange
Rate Agent (and upon receipt thereof the Trustee will promptly thereafter give
notice in the manner provided for in Section 106 to the affected Holders)
specifying the Currency Conversion Date. In the event the Company so determines
that a Currency Conversion Event has occurred with respect to the ECU or any
other currency unit in which Securities are denominated or payable, the Company
will immediately give written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Exchange
Rate Agent (and upon receipt thereof the Trustee will promptly thereafter give
notice in the manner provided for in Section 106 to the affected Holders)
specifying the Currency Conversion Date and the Specified Amount of each
Component Currency on the Currency Conversion Date. In the event the Company
determines in good faith that any subsequent change in any Component Currency as
set forth in the definition of Specified Amount above has occurred, the Company
will similarly give written notice to the Trustee and the Exchange Rate Agent.

The Trustee shall be fully justified and protected in relying and
acting upon information received by it from the Company and the Exchange Rate
Agent and shall not otherwise have any duty or obligation to determine the
accuracy or validity of such information.

successor Exchange Rate Agent or Exchange Rate Agents with respect to the
Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor

--------
that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the
correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained
in any notice of redemption.

46

instrument under which there may be issued or by which there may be secured
or evidenced any indebtedness for money borrowed in an aggregate principal
amount exceeding $20,000,000 by the Company or a Significant Bank
(including this Indenture), whether such indebtedness now exists or shall
hereafter be created, which default shall have resulted in such
indebtedness becoming or being declared due and payable prior to the date
on which it would otherwise have become due and payable, without such
acceleration having been rescinded or annulled within a period of 10 days
after there shall have been given, by registered or certified mail, to the

deemed to have knowledge of such default unless either (A) a Responsible
Officer of the Trustee shall have actual knowledge of such default or (B)
the Trustee shall have received written notice thereof from the Company,
from any Holder, from the holder of any such indebtedness or from the
trustee under any such mortgage, indenture or other instrument; or

consent by it to the entry of a decree or order for relief in respect of
the Company or a Significant Bank in an involuntary case or proceeding
under any applicable Federal or State bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or other similar law or to the commencement of any
bankruptcy or insolvency case or proceeding against it, or the filing by it
of a petition or answer or consent seeking reorganization or relief under
any applicable Federal or State law, or the consent by it to the filing of
such petition or to the appointment of or taking possession by a custodian,

inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, or the taking of
corporate action by the Company or a Significant Bank in furtherance of any
such action; or

(8) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of

Section 502. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
-------------------------------------------------- 

If an Event of Default described in clause (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) or
(8) of Section 501 with respect to Securities of any series at the time
Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the
Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities
of that series may declare the principal amount (or, if the Securities of that
series are Original Issue Discount Securities or Indexed Securities, such
portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series)
of all of the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by a
notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and
upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified portion thereof)
shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default described in
clause (6) or (7) of Section 501 occurs and is continuing, then in every such
case the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of all
of the Securities then Outstanding may declare the principal amount (or, if any
such Securities are Original Issue Discount Securities or Indexed Securities,
such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that
series) of all of the Outstanding Securities to be due and payable immediately,
by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by the
Holders) and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified
portion thereof) shall become immediately due and payable.

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect to
Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree for
payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as hereinafter in this
Article provided, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of that series, by written notice to the Company and the
Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and its consequences if

(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum
sufficient to pay in the currency, currency unit or composite currency in
which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise
specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series and
except, if applicable, as provided in Sections 312(b), 312(d) and 312(e)):

(A) all overdue installments of interest, if any, on all
Outstanding Securities of that series and any related coupons,

(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Outstanding
Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such
<PAGE>

48

declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or
rates borne by or provided for in such Securities,

(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful,
interest upon overdue installments of interest at the rate or rates
borne by or provided for in such Securities, and

(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel;

and

(2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series,
other than the non-payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or
interest on Securities of that series which have become due solely by such
declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in
Section 513.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

Section 503. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
--------------------------------------------------------------- 

The Company covenants that if

(1) default is made in the payment of any installment of interest, if
any, on any Security of any series and any related coupon when such
interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of
30 days, or

(2) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium,
if any, on) any Security of any series at its Maturity,

then the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of
the Holders of such Securities or such series and coupons, the whole amount then
due and payable on such Securities and coupons for principal (and premium, if
any) and interest, if any, with interest upon any overdue principal (and
premium, if any) and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be
legally enforceable, upon any overdue installments of interest, if any, at the
rate or rates borne by or provided for in such Securities, and, in addition
thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and
expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand,
the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a
judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may
prosecute such proceeding to
<PAGE>

49

judgment or final decree, and may enforce the same against the Company or any
other obligor upon such Securities of such series and collect the moneys
adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the
property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities of such
series, wherever situated.

If an Event of Default with respect to Securities of any series occurs
and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and
enforce its rights and the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series
and any related coupons by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee
shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for
the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in
aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper
remedy.

Section 504. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
-------------------------------- 

In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation,
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other
judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the
Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their
creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities
of any series shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by
declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made
any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal, premium, if any,
or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding
or otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture
Act in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such
proceeding and, in particular: (i) to file and prove a claim for the whole
amount (or in the case of Original Issue Discount Securities, such portion of
the principal as may be provided for in the terms thereof) (and premium, if any)
and interest, if any, owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to file
such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have
the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel) and
of the holders allowed in such judicial proceeding, and to collect and receive
any moneys or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to
distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator,
sequestrator (or other similar official) in any such judicial proceeding is
hereby authorized by each Holder of Securities of such series and coupons to
make such payments to the Trustee, and in the event that the Trustee shall
consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the
Trustee any amount due it for the reasonable compensation, expenses,
disbursements and advances of the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee, their
agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to the Trustee or any predecessor
Trustee under Section 606. 

No provision of this Indenture and nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on
behalf of any Holder of a Security or coupon any plan of reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or coupons or
the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect
of the claim of any Holder of a Security or coupon in any such
<PAGE>

50

proceeding; provided, however, the Trustee may vote on behalf of the Holders for
the election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and may be a member
of a creditors' or other similar committee.

Section 505. Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of Securities.
----------------------------------------------------------- 

All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or any of the
Securities or coupons may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the
possession of any of the Securities or coupons or the production thereof in any
proceeding relating thereto, and any such proceeding instituted by the Trustee
shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any
recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents
and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities and
coupons in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.

Section 506. Application of Money Collected.
------------------------------ 

Any money collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be
applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and,
in case of the distribution of such money on account of principal (or premium,
if any) or interest, if any, upon presentation of the Securities or coupons, or
both, as the case may be, and the notation thereon of the payment if only
partially paid and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee and any
predecessor Trustee under Section 606;

SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid upon
the Securities and coupons for principal (and premium, if any) and
interest, if any, in respect of which or for the benefit of which such
money has been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of
any kind, according to the aggregate amounts due and payable on such
Securities and coupons for principal (and premium, if any) and
interest, if any, respectively; and

THIRD: To the payment of the remainder, if any, to the Company
or any other Person or Persons entitled thereto.

Section 507. Limitation on Suits.
------------------- 

No Holder of any Security of any series or any related
coupon shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or
otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a
receiver or trustee, or for any other remedy hereunder, unless
<PAGE>

51

(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of
a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of that
series;

(2) the Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to
the Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default in
its own name as Trustee hereunder;

(3) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee security or
indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs,
expenses and liabilities to be incurred in compliance with such request;

(4) the Trustee for 60 days after its receipt of such notice, request
and offer of indemnity has failed to institute any such proceeding; and

(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been
given to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority
in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;

it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have
any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision
of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of
such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any
other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in
the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such
Holders.

Section 508. Unconditional Right of Holders to Receive Principal, Premium and
----------------------------------------------------------------
Interest.
-------- 

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of
any Security or coupon shall have the right, which is absolute and
unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of (and premium, if any, and
Additional Amounts, if any) and (subject to Sections 305 and 307) interest, if
any, on such Security or payment of such coupon on the respective due dates
expressed in such Security or coupon (or, in the case of redemption, on the
Redemption Date) and to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment,
and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.

Section 509. Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
---------------------------------- 

If the Trustee or any Holder of a Security or coupon has instituted
any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such
proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been
determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such
case, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of Securities and coupons shall,
subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and
respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and
remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such
proceeding had been instituted.
<PAGE>

52

Section 510. Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
------------------------------ 

Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or
payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or coupons in the
last paragraph of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or
reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities or coupons is intended
to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall,
to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other
right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in
equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy
hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or
employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.

Section 511. Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
---------------------------- 

No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Security
or coupon to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default
shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event
of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this
Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to
time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders
of Securities or coupons, as the case may be.

Section 512. Control by Holders.

place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or
exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee, with respect to the
Securities of such series, provided that

(1) such direction shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or
with this Indenture,

(2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the
Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction, and

(3) the Trustee need not take any action which might involve it in
personal liability or be unjustly prejudicial to the Holders of Securities
of such series not consenting.

Section 513. Waiver of Past Defaults.
----------------------- 

The Holders of not less than 66-2/3% in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all
the Securities of such series and any related coupons waive any past
default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except
a default
<PAGE>

53

(1) in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or
interest, if any, on any Security of such series or any related coupons, or

(2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article
Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of
each Outstanding Security of such series affected.

Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event
of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every
purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

Section 514. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.
-------------------------------- 

The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that
it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim
or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted,
now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the
performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may
lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such
law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any
power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of
every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

shall have been cured or waived; provided, however, that, except in the case of
a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest,
if any, on any Security of such series, or in the payment of any sinking or
purchase fund installment with respect to the Securities of such series, the
Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the
board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors
and/or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that the
withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Holders of the Securities
and coupons of such series; and provided further that in the case of any default
or breach of the character specified in Section 501(4) with respect to the
Securities and coupons of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given
until at least 60 days after the occurrence thereof. For
<PAGE>

reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate

Agent, Security Registrar and Exchange Rate Agent, as the case may be.

Section 606. Compensation and Reimbursement.
------------------------------ 

The Company agrees:

(1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation for all
services rendered by it hereunder as has been agreed upon in writing (which
compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the
compensation of a trustee of an express trust);

(2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse each
of the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee upon its request for all
reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the

reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents
and counsel), except to the extent any such expense, disbursement or
advance may be attributable to its negligence or bad faith; and

(3) to indemnify each of the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee (and
its officers, directors, employees and agents) for, and to hold it harmless
against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad
faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the trust or trusts hereunder, including the costs and
expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection
with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder,
except to the extent any such loss, liability or expense may be
attributable to its negligence or bad faith.

As security for the performance of the obligations of the Company
under this Section, the Trustee shall have a claim prior to the Securities upon
all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such, except funds
held in trust for the payment of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest,
if any, on particular Securities or coupons.

The Company's payment obligations pursuant to this Section shall

the Company, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration
under the Federal Bankruptcy Code.

capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If such Person publishes reports
of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of
Federal, State, Territorial or District of Columbia supervising or examining
authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and
surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as
set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time
the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this
Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect
hereinafter specified in this Article. 

(b) The following indenture shall be deemed to be specfically described 
herein for the purposes of clause (i) of the first proviso contained in TIA 
Section 310(b): Indenture dated as of January 1, 1985 between KeyCorp and 
Bankers Trust Company. 

Section 608. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
------------------------------------------------- 

(a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a
successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the
acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the
applicable requirements of Section 609.

(b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities
of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If an
instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been delivered to
the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the
resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such
series.

(c) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the
Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount
of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to
the Company.

(d) If at any time:

(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of TIA
Section 310(b) after written request therefor by the Company or by any
Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at
least six months, or

shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by
any Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for
at least six months, or

a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property
shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of
the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of
rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,
<PAGE>

58

then, in any such case, (i) the Company by or pursuant to a Board Resolution may
remove the Trustee and appoint a successor Trustee with respect to all
securities, or (ii) subject to TIA Section 315(e), any Holder of a Security who
has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf
of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and
the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.

(e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of
acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause with
respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by or pursuant to
a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with
respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any
such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or
more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee
with respect to the Securities of any particular series). If, within one year
after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such
vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall
be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring
Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance
of such appointment, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities
of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by
the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any
series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders of Securities
and accepted appointment in the manner hereinafter provided, any Holder of a
Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at
least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,

removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each
appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series
in the manner provided for notices to the Holders of Securities in Section 106.
Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the
Securities of such series and the address of its corporate trust office.

Section 609. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
-------------------------------------- 

(a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with
respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an
instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal
of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request
of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon
payment of all amounts owed to it pursuant to this Indenture, execute and
deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights,
powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee, and shall duly assign, transfer
<PAGE>

59

and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such
retiring Trustee hereunder, subject nevertheless to its claim, if any, provided
for in Section 606. The retiring Trustee shall have no liability for any acts
or omissions of any successor Trustee.

(b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with
respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the
retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of
one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto
wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall
contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and
confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers,
trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that
or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2)
if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall
contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm
that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with
respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring
Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and
(3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be
necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts
hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or
in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the
same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts
hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by
any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental
indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become
effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the
Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor
Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such
retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of all amounts owed to it pursuant to this
Indenture, duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all
property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the
Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor
Trustee relates.

(c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall
execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and
confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred
to in paragraph (a) and (b) of this Section, as the case may be.

(d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the
time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible
under this Article.

Section 610. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.
----------------------------------------------------------- 

Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or
with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any
corporation succeeding to all or
<PAGE>

60

substantially all the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the
successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such corporation shall be otherwise
qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of
any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case
any Securities or coupons shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by
the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or
consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and
deliver the Securities or coupons so authenticated with the same effect as if
such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities. In case any
Securities or coupons shall not have been authenticated by such predecessor
Trustee, any such successor Trustee may authenticate and deliver such Securities
or coupons, in either its own name or that of its predecessor Trustee, with the
full force and effect which this Indenture provides for the certificate of
authentication of the Trustee.

Section 611. Appointment of Authenticating Agent.
----------------------------------- 

At any time when any of the Securities remain Outstanding, the Trustee
may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series
of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to
authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original Issue and upon
exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to
Section 306, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits
of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if
authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Any such appointment shall be evidenced
by an instrument in writing signed by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, a
copy of which instrument shall be promptly furnished to the Company. Wherever
reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of
Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication, such
reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of
the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication
executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each
Authenticating Agent shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company and, except
as may otherwise be provided pursuant to Section 301, shall at all times be a
bank or trust company or corporation organized and doing business and in good
standing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof or
the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating
Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and
subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authorities. If such
Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant
to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then
for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such
Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as
set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time
an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately
in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.

Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent
shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or
corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall
<PAGE>

61

continue to be an Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be
otherwise eligible under this Section, without the execution or filing of any
paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.

An Authenticating Agent for any series of Securities may resign at any
time by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee for such series and
to the Company. The Trustee for any series of Securities may at any time
terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of
termination to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving
such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time
such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, the Trustee for such series may appoint a successor
Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall give
notice of such appointment to all Holders of Securities of the series with
respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve in the manner set forth in
Section 106. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its
appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties
of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an
Authenticating Agent herein. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be
appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.

The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to
time reasonable compensation including reimbursement of its reasonable expenses
for its services under this Section.

If an appointment with respect to one or more series is made pursuant
to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in
addition to or in lieu of the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an
alternative certificate of authentication in the following form:

This is one of the Securities of the series designated therein
referred to in the within-mentioned Indenture.

Covenants

Section 1001. Payment of Principal, Premium and Interest.
------------------------------------------ 

The Company covenants and agrees for the benefit of the Holders of
each series of Securities that it will duly and punctually pay the principal of
(and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on the Securities of that series in
accordance with the terms of such series of Securities and this Indenture. Any
interest due on Bearer Securities on or before Maturity, other than Additional
Amounts, if any, payable as provided in Section 1004 in respect of principal of
(or premium, if any, on) such a Security, shall be payable only upon
presentation and surrender of the several coupons for such interest installments
as are evidenced thereby as they severally mature. Unless otherwise specified
with respect to Securities of any series pursuant to Section 301, at the option
of the Company, all payments of principal may be paid by check to the registered
Holder of the Registered Security or other person entitled thereto against
surrender of such Security. Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by
Section 301 with respect to any series of Securities, any interest due on Bearer
Securities on or before Maturity shall be payable only upon presentation and
surrender of the several coupons for such interest installments as are evidenced
thereby as they severally mature.

Section 1002. Maintenance of Office or Agency.
------------------------------- 

If Securities of a series are issuable only as Registered Securities,
the Company shall maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities
an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented or
surrendered for payment, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for
registration of transfer or exchange, where Securities of that series that are
convertible or exchangeable may be surrendered for conversion or exchange, as
applicable, and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of
the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. If Securities
of a series are issuable as Bearer Securities, the Company will maintain (A) in
the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, an office or agency where any
Registered Securities of that series may be presented or surrendered for
payment, where any Registered Securities of that series may be surrendered for
registration of transfer or exchange, where Securities of that series that are
convertible or exchangeable may be surrendered for conversion or exchange, as
applicable, where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the
Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served and where Bearer
Securities of that series and related coupons may be presented or surrendered
for payment in the circumstances described in the following paragraph (and not
otherwise), (B) subject to any laws or regulations applicable thereto, in a
Place of Payment for that series which is located outside the United States, an
office or agency where Securities of that series and related coupons may be
presented and surrendered for payment; provided, however, that if the Securities
of that series are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange or any other stock
exchange located outside the United States and such stock exchange shall so
require, the Company will maintain a Paying Agent for the Securities of that
series in
<PAGE>

69

Luxembourg or any other required city located outside the United States, as the
case may be, so long as the Securities of that series are listed on such
exchange, and (C) subject to any laws or regulations applicable thereto, in a
Place of Payment for that series located outside the United States an office or
agency where any Registered Securities of that series may be surrendered for
registration of transfer or exchange, where Securities of that series that are
convertible or exchangeable may be surrendered for conversion or exchange, as
applicable, and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of
the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be served. The Company
will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change
in the location, of each such office or agency. If at any time the Company
shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to
furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders,
notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the
Trustee, except that Bearer Securities of that series and the related coupons
may be presented and surrendered for payment at the offices specified in the
Security, in London, England, and the Company hereby appoints the same as its
agent to receive such respective presentations, surrenders, notices and demands,
and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee its agent to receive all such
presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.

Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities pursuant to
Section 301, no payment of principal, premium or interest on Bearer Securities
shall be made at any office or agency of the Company in the United States or by
check mailed to any address in the United States or by transfer to an account
maintained with a bank located in the United States; provided, however, that, if
the Securities of a series are payable in Dollars, payment of principal of (and
premium, if any) and interest, if any, on any Bearer Security shall be made at
the office of the Company's Paying Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, The City
of New York, if (but only if) payment in Dollars of the full amount of such
principal, premium or interest, as the case may be, at all offices or agencies
outside the United States maintained for such purpose by the Company in
accordance with this Indenture, is illegal or effectively precluded by exchange
controls or other similar restrictions.

The Company may from time to time designate one or more other offices
or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or
surrendered for any or all of such purposes, and may from time to time rescind
such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission
shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office
or agency in accordance with the requirements set forth above for Securities of
any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to
the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the
location of any such other office or agency. Unless otherwise specified with
respect to any Securities pursuant to Section 301 with respect to a series of
Securities, the Company hereby designates as Places of Payment for each series
of Securities the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan,
The City of New York, and initially appoints the Trustee at its Corporate Trust
Office in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York as Paying Agent in each
such city and as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders,
notices and demands.
<PAGE>

Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities pursuant to
Section 301, if and so long as the Securities of any series (i) are denominated
in a currency other than Dollars or (ii) may be payable in a currency other than
Dollars, or so long as it is required under any other provision of the
Indenture, then the Company will maintain with respect to each such series of
Securities, or as so required, at least one Exchange Rate Agent.

Section 1003. Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust.
------------------------------------------------- 

If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with
respect to any series of any Securities and any related coupons, it will, on or
before each due date of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if
any, on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for
the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum in the currency or currencies,
currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the
Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to
Section 301 for the Securities of such series and except, if applicable, as
provided in Sections 312(b), 312(d) and 312(e)) sufficient to pay the principal
of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on Securities of such series so
becoming due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed
of as herein provided, and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or
failure so to act.

Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any
series of Securities and any related coupons, it will, prior to each due date of
the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any Securities of
that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum (in the currency or currencies,
currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies described in the
preceding paragraph) sufficient to pay the principal (or premium, if any) or
interest, if any, so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit
of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium or interest and (unless such
Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its
action or failure so to act.

The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or
by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in
trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee
upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or
such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee,
such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to
such sums.

Except, as otherwise provided in the Securities of any series, any
money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the
Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or
interest, if any, on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two
years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable shall
be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company)
shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall
thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for
payment of such principal, premium
<PAGE>

71

or interest on any Security, without interest thereon, and all liability of the
Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to such trust money, and all liability
of the Company as trustee thereof, shall thereupon cease; provided, however,
that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required to make any such
repayment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published once, in an
Authorized Newspaper, notice that such money remains unclaimed and that, after a
date specified therein, which shall not be less than 30 days from the date of
such publication, any unclaimed balance of such money then remaining will be
repaid to the Company.

Section 1004. Additional Amounts.
------------------ 

If any Securities of a series provide for the payment of Additional
Amounts, the Company will pay to the Holder of any Security of such series or
any coupon appertaining thereto Additional Amounts as may be specified as
contemplated by Section 301. Whenever in this Indenture there is mentioned, in
any context, the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest,
if any, on any Security of any series or payment of any related coupon or the
net proceeds received on the sale or exchange of any Security of any series,
such mention shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional
Amounts provided by the terms of such series established pursuant to Section 301
to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be
payable in respect thereof pursuant to such terms and express mention of the
payment of Additional Amounts (if applicable) in any provisions hereof shall not
be construed as excluding Additional Amounts in those provisions hereof where
such express mention is not made.

Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, if the
Securities of a series provide for the payment of Additional Amounts, at least
10 days prior to the first Interest Payment Date with respect to that series of
Securities (or if the Securities of that series will not bear interest prior to
Maturity, the first day on which a payment of principal and any premium is
made), and at least 10 days prior to each date of payment of principal, premium
or interest if there has been any change with respect to the matters set forth
in the below-mentioned Officers' Certificate, the Company will furnish the
Trustee and the Company's principal Paying Agent or Paying Agents, if other than
the Trustee, with an Officers' Certificate instructing the Trustee and such
Paying Agent or Paying Agents whether such payment of principal, premium or
interest on the Securities of that series shall be made to Holders of Securities
of that series or any related coupons who are not United States persons without
withholding for or on account of any tax, assessment or other governmental
charge described in the Securities of the series. If any such withholding shall
be required, then such Officers' Certificate shall specify by country the
amount, if any, required to be withheld on such payments to such Holders of
Securities of that series or related coupons and the Company will pay to the
Trustee or such Paying Agent the Additional Amounts required by the terms of
such Securities. In the event that the Trustee or any Paying Agent, as the case
may be, shall not so receive the above-mentioned certificate, then the Trustee
or such Paying Agent shall be entitled (i) to assume that no such withholding or
deduction is required with respect to any payment of principal or interest with
respect to any Securities of a series or related coupons until it shall have
received a certificate advising
<PAGE>

72

otherwise and (ii) to make all payments of principal and interest with respect
to the Securities of a series or related coupons without withholding or
deductions until otherwise advised. The Company covenants to indemnify the
Trustee and any Paying Agent for, and to hold them harmless against, any loss,
liability or expense reasonably incurred without negligence or bad faith on
their part arising out of or in connection with actions taken or omitted by any
of them in reliance on any Officers' Certificate furnished pursuant to this
Section or in reliance on the Company's not furnishing such an Officers'
Certificate.

Section 1005. Statement by Officers as to Default.
----------------------------------- 

The Company will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end
of each fiscal year of the Company ending after the date hereof, an Officers'
Certificate, stating whether to the best knowledge of the signers thereof the
Company is in default in the performance and observance of any of the conditions
or covenants of this Indenture (without regard to any period of grace or
requirement of notice provided hereunder) and, if the Company shall be in
default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and status thereof of which
they may have knowledge.

Section 1006. Existence.
--------- 

Subject to Article Eight, the Company will do or cause to be done all
things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence,
rights (charter and statutory) and franchises; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if the
Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer
desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and that the loss
thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.

Section 1007. Maintenance of Properties.
------------------------- 

The Company will cause all properties used or useful in the conduct of
its business or the business of any Subsidiary to be maintained and kept in good
condition, repair and working order and supplied with all necessary equipment
and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements,
betterments and improvements thereof, all as in the judgment of the Company may
be necessary so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be
properly and advantageously conducted at all times; provided, however, that
nothing in this Section shall prevent the Company from discontinuing the
operation or maintenance of any of such properties if such discontinuance is, in
the judgment of the Company, desirable in the conduct of its business or the
business of any Subsidiary and not disadvantageous in any material respect to
the Holders.
<PAGE>

73

Section 1008. Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.
--------------------------------- 

The Company will pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged,
before the same shall become delinquent, (1) all taxes, assessments and
governmental charges levied or imposed upon the Company or any Subsidiary or
upon the income, profits or property of the Company or any Subsidiary, and (2)
all lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by
law become a lien upon the property of the Company or any Subsidiary; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to
be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim whose amount,
applicability or validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings.

Section 1009. Ownership of Voting Stock of Significant Banks.
---------------------------------------------- 

Subject to Article Eight, the Company will not sell or otherwise
dispose of, or grant a security interest in, or permit any Significant Bank to
issue, any shares of voting stock of such Significant Bank, unless the Company
will own free of any security interest at least 80% of the issued and
outstanding voting stock of such Significant Bank; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not apply to (x) any such sale or disposition where the proceeds
therefrom are invested, within 90 days of such sale or disposition, in any
Subsidiary (including any corporation which upon such investment becomes a
Subsidiary) engaged in a banking business or any business legally permissible
for bank holding companies; provided, however, that if the proceeds are so
invested in any Subsidiary engaged in a business legally permissible for bank
holding companies other than a banking business, the Company shall not sell or
otherwise dispose of, or grant a security interest in, or permit such Subsidiary
to issue, any shares of voting stock of such Subsidiary to the same extent as if
such Subsidiary were a Significant Bank if, upon making such investment, the
assets of, or held for the account of, such Subsidiary constitutes 10% or more
of the consolidated assets of the Company or (y) any disposition in exchange for
the stock of any bank.

Section 1010. Waiver of Certain Covenants.
--------------------------- 

The Company may, with respect to any series of Securities, omit in any
particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition which
affects such series set forth in Section 801(3) or Sections 1007 to 1009,
inclusive, and, as specified pursuant to Section 301(15) for Securities of any
series, in any covenants of the Company added to Article Ten pursuant to Section
301(14) or Section 301(15), in connection with Securities of a series if before
the time for such compliance the Holders of at least 66-2/3% in principal amount
of all Outstanding Securities of any series, by Act of such Holders, waive such
compliance in such instance with such term, provision or condition, but no such
waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the
extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the
obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee to Holders of
Securities of such series in respect of any such term, provision or condition
shall remain in full force and effect.

ARTICLE ELEVEN

Redemption of Securities

Section 1101. Applicability of Article.
------------------------ 

Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated
Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as
otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series)
in accordance with this Article.

Section 1102. Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.
------------------------------------- 

The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be
evidenced by or pursuant to a Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at
the election of the Company of less than all the Securities of any series, the
Company shall, at least 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the
Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify
the Trustee of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Securities of
such series to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior
to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of
such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the
Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with such
restriction.

Section 1103. Selection by Trustee of Securities to Be Redeemed.
------------------------------------------------- 

If less than all the Securities of any series issued on the same day
with the same terms are to be redeemed, the particular Securities to be redeemed
shall be selected in accordance with the terms of such Securities but, if not
specified, shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date
by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series issued on such
date with the same terms not previously called for redemption, by the Trustee in
its customary manner, which may provide for the selection for redemption of
portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for Securities of that
series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of securities
of such series of a denomination larger than the minimum authorized denomination
for Securities of that series.

The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company and the Security
Registrar (if other than itself) in writing of the Securities selected for
redemption and, in the case of any Securities selected for partial redemption,
the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.

For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise
requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate,
in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the
portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be
redeemed.
<PAGE>

75

Section 1104. Notice of Redemption.
-------------------- 

Notice of redemption shall be given in the manner provided in Section
106, not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date,
unless a shorter period is specified by the terms of such series established
pursuant to Section 301, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, but
failure to give such notice in the manner herein provided to the Holder of any
Security designated for redemption as a whole or in part, or any defect in the
notice to any such Holder, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for
the redemption of any other such Security or portion thereof.

Any notice that is mailed to the Holders of Registered Securities in
the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly
given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice.

All notices of redemption shall state:

(l) the Redemption Date,

(2) the Redemption Price and accrued interest to the Redemption Date
payable as provided in Section 1106, if any,

(3) if less than all Outstanding Securities of any series are to be
redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the
principal amounts) of the particular Security or Securities to be redeemed,

(4) in case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice
which relates to such Security shall state that on and after the Redemption
Date, upon surrender of such Security, the holder will receive, without a
charge, a new Security or Securities of authorized denominations for the
principal amount thereof remaining unredeemed,

(5) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price and accrued
interest to the Redemption Date payable as provided in Section 1106, if
any, will become due and payable upon each such Security, or the portion
thereof, to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will
cease to accrue on and after said date,

(6) the Place or Places of Payment where such Securities, together in
the case of Bearer Securities with all coupons appertaining thereto, if
any, maturing after the Redemption Date, are to be surrendered for payment
of the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any,

(7) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case,

(8) that, unless otherwise specified in such notice, Bearer
Securities of any series, if any, surrendered for redemption must be
accompanied by all coupons maturing
<PAGE>

76

subsequent to the date fixed for redemption or the amount of any such
missing coupon or coupons will be deducted from the Redemption Price,
unless security or indemnity satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee for
such series and any Paying Agent is furnished,

(9) if Bearer Securities of any series are to be redeemed and any
Registered Securities of such series are not to be redeemed, and if such
Bearer Securities may be exchanged for Registered Securities not subject to
redemption on this Redemption Date pursuant to Section 305 or otherwise,
the last date, as determined by the Company, on which such exchanges may be
made, and

(10) the CUSIP number of such Security, if any.

Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of
the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the
Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company and shall be irrevocable.

Section 1105. Deposit of Redemption Price.
--------------------------- 

Prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the
Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying
Agent, which it may not do in the case of a sinking fund payment under Article
Twelve, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of
money in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite
currency or currencies in which the Securities of such series are payable
(except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of
such series and except, if applicable, as provided in Sections 312(b), 312(d)
and 312(e)) sufficient to pay on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price of,
and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued
interest on, all the Securities or portions thereof which are to be redeemed on
that date.

Section 1106. Securities Payable on Redemption Date.
------------------------------------- 

Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so
to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the
Redemption Price therein specified in the currency or currencies, currency unit
or units or composite currency or currencies in which the Securities of such
series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for
the Securities of such series and except, if applicable, as provided in Sections
312(b), 312(d) and 312(e)) (together with accrued interest, if any, to the
Redemption Date), and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default
in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such Securities
shall if the same were interest-bearing cease to bear interest and the coupons
for such interest appertaining to any Bearer Securities so to be redeemed,
except to the extent provided below, shall be void. Upon surrender of any such
Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, together with all
coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing after the Redemption Date, such
Security shall be paid by the
<PAGE>

77

Company at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest, if any, to the
Redemption Date; provided, however, that, installments of interest on Bearer
Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be
payable only at an office or agency located outside the United States (except as
otherwise provided in Section 1002) and, unless otherwise specified as
contemplated by Section 301, only upon presentation and surrender of coupons for
such interest, and provided further that installments of interest on Registered
Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be
payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor
Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record
Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307.

If any Bearer Security surrendered for redemption shall not be
accompanied by all appurtenant coupons maturing after the Redemption Date, such
Security may be paid after deducting from the Redemption Price an amount equal
to the face amount of all such missing coupons, or the surrender of such missing
coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there be
furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of
them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security
shall surrender to the Trustee or any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in
respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the Redemption Price,
such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted; provided,
however, that interest represented by coupons shall be payable only at an office
or agency located outside the United States (except as otherwise provided in
Section 1002) and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301,
only upon presentation and surrender of those coupons.

If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon
surrender thereof for redemption, the Redemption Price shall, until paid, bear
interest from the Redemption Date at the rate of interest set forth in such
Security or, in the case of an Original Issue Discount Security, at the Yield to
Maturity of such Security. 

Section 1107. Securities Redeemed in Part.
--------------------------- 

Any Registered Security which is to be redeemed only in part (pursuant
to the provisions of this Article or of Article Twelve) shall be surrendered at
a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires,
due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney
duly authorized in writing) and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service
charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized
denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to
and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so
surrendered.

ARTICLE TWELVE

Sinking Funds

Section 1201. Applicability of Article.
------------------------ 

The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund
for the retirement of Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as
contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of such series.

The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the
terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking
fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by
the terms of such Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional
sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms of Securities of any
series, the cash amount of any mandatory sinking fund payment may be subject to
reduction as provided in Section 1202. Each sinking fund payment shall be
applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the
terms of Securities of such series.

Section 1202. Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.
----------------------------------------------------- 

The Company may, in satisfaction of all or any part of any mandatory
sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of a series, (1) deliver
Outstanding Securities of such series (other than any previously called for
redemption) together in the case of any Bearer Securities of such series with
all unmatured coupons appertaining thereto and (2) apply as a credit Securities
of such series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company
pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted
optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each
case in satisfaction of all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment
with respect to the Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to
the terms of such Securities as provided for by the terms of such series;
provided that such Securities so delivered or applied as a credit have not been
previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such
purpose by the Trustee at the applicable Redemption Price specified in such
Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount
of such mandatory sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.

Section 1203. Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.
----------------------------------------- 

Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for
Securities of any series, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for
that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion hereof, if any,
which is to be satisfied by payment of cash in the currency or currencies,
currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the
Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to
Section 301 for the
<PAGE>

Securities of such series and except, if applicable, as provided in Sections
312(b), 312(d) and 312(e)) and the portion thereof, if any, which is to be
satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to
Section 1202, and the optional amount, if any, to be added in cash to the next
ensuing mandatory sinking fund payment, and will also deliver to the Trustee any
Securities to be so delivered and credited. If such Officers' Certificate shall
specify an optional amount to be added in cash to the next ensuing mandatory
sinking fund payment, the Company shall thereupon be obligated to pay the amount
therein specified. Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment
date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking
fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of
the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the
Company in the manner provided in Section 1104. Such notice having been duly
given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the
manner stated in Sections 1106 and 1107.

ARTICLE THIRTEEN

Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance

Section 1301. Applicability of Article; Company's Option to Effect Defeasance or
------------------------------------------------------------------
Covenant Defeasance.
------------------- 

If pursuant to Section 301 provision is made for either or both of (a)
defeasance of the Securities of or within a series under Section 1302 or (b)
covenant defeasance of the Securities of or within a series under Section 1303,
then the provisions of such Section or Sections, as the case may be, together
with the other provisions of this Article (with such modifications thereto as
may be specified pursuant to Section 301 with respect to any Securities), shall
be applicable to such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, and the
Company may at its option by Board Resolution, at any time, with respect to such
Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, elect to have Section 1302 (if
applicable) or Section 1303 (if applicable) be applied to such Outstanding
Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto upon compliance with the
conditions set forth below in this Article.

Section 1302. Defeasance and Discharge.
------------------------ 

Upon the Company's exercise of the above option applicable to this
Section with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Company shall
be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such
Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto on the date the
conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter, "defeasance").
For this purpose, such defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have
paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Outstanding
Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, which shall thereafter be
deemed to be "Outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 1305 and the other
Sections of this Indenture referred to in clauses (A) and (B) of this Section,
and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and
<PAGE>

80

any coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture insofar as such Securities
and any coupons appertaining thereto are concerned (and the Trustee, at the
expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the
same), except for the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated
or discharged hereunder: (A) the rights of Holders of such Outstanding
Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto to receive, solely from the
trust fund described in Section 1304 and as more fully set forth in such
Section, payments in respect of the principal of (and premium, if any) and
interest, if any, on such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto when
such payments are due, (B) the Company's obligations with respect to such
Securities under Sections 305, 306, 1002 and 1003 and with respect to the
payment of Additional Amounts, if any, on such Securities as contemplated by
Section 1004, (C) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the
Trustee hereunder and (D) this Article. Subject to compliance with this Article
Thirteen, the Company may exercise its option under this Section notwithstanding
the prior exercise of its option under Section 1303 with respect to such
Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto.

Section 1303. Covenant Defeasance.
------------------- 

Upon the Company's exercise of the above option applicable to this
Section with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Company shall
be released from its obligations under Sections 1004 and 1005, and, if specified
pursuant to Section 301, its obligations under any other covenant, with respect
to such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto on and after
the date the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter,
"covenant defeasance"), and such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto
shall thereafter be deemed to be not "Outstanding" for the purposes of any
direction, waiver, consent or declaration or Act of Holders (and the
consequences of any thereof) in connection with Sections 1004 and 1005, or such
other covenant, but shall continue to be deemed "Outstanding" for all other
purposes hereunder. For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with
respect to such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, the
Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any
term, condition or limitation set forth in any such Section or such other
covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere
herein to any such Section or such other covenant or by reason of reference in
any such Section or such other covenant to any other provision herein or in any
other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a default or an
Event of Default under Section 501(4) or 501(7) or otherwise, as the case may
be, but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such
Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto shall be unaffected thereby.

Section 1304. Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
----------------------------------------------- 

The following shall be the conditions to application of Section 1302
or Section 1303 to any Outstanding Securities of or within a series and any
coupons appertaining thereto:

(a) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be
deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee satisfying the requirements

who shall agree to comply with the provisions of this Article Thirteen
applicable to it) as trust funds in trust for the purpose of making the
following payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated
solely to, the benefit of the Holders of such Securities and any coupons
appertaining thereto, (1) an amount (in such currency, currencies or
currency unit in which such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto
are then specified as payable at Stated Maturity), or (2) Government
Obligations applicable to such Securities and coupons appertaining thereto
(determined on the basis of the currency, currencies or currency unit in
which such Securities and coupons appertaining thereto are then specified
as payable at Stated Maturity) which through the scheduled payment of
principal and interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms
will provide, not later than one day before the due date of any payment of
principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on such Securities
and any coupons appertaining thereto, money in an amount, or (3) a
combination thereof in an amount, sufficient, in the opinion of a
nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a
written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and
discharge, and which shall be applied by the Trustee (or other qualifying
trustee) to pay and discharge, (i) the principal of (and premium, if any)
and interest, if any, on such Outstanding Securities and any coupons
appertaining thereto on the Stated Maturity of such principal or
installment of principal or interest and (ii) any mandatory sinking fund
payments or analogous payments applicable to such Outstanding Securities
and any coupons appertaining thereto on the day on which such payments are
due and payable in accordance with the terms of this Indenture and of such
Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto.

(b) Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not result in a
breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, this Indenture or
any other material agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party
or by which it is bound.

(c) No Event of Default or event which with notice or lapse of time
or both would become an Event of Default with respect to such Securities
and any coupons appertaining thereto shall have occurred and be continuing
on the date of such deposit or, insofar as Sections 501(5) and 501(6) are
concerned, at any time during the period ending on the 91st day after the
date of such deposit (it being understood that this condition shall not be
deemed satisfied until the expiration of such period).

(d) In the case of an election under Section 1302, the Company shall
have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (i) the
Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal
Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii) since the date of execution of this
Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax
law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion
shall confirm that, the Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any
coupons appertaining thereto will not recognize income, gain or loss for
Federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be
subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts,
<PAGE>

82

in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if
such defeasance had not occurred.

(e) In the case of an election under Section 1303, the Company shall
have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the
Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto
will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as
a result of such covenant defeasance and will be subject to Federal income
tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred.

(f) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions
precedent to the defeasance under Section 1302 or the covenant defeasance
under Section 1303 (as the case may be) have been complied with and an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that either (i) as a result of a deposit
pursuant to subsection (a) above and the related exercise of the Company's
option under Section 1302 or Section 1303 (as the case may be),
registration is not required under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, by the Company, with respect to the trust funds representing such
deposit or by the trustee for such trust funds or (ii) all necessary
registrations under said Act have been effected.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, such
defeasance or covenant defeasance shall be effected in compliance with any
additional or substitute terms, conditions or limitations which may be
imposed on the Company in connection therewith pursuant to Section 301.

Section 1305. Deposited Money and Government Obligations to Be Held in Trust;
---------------------------------------------------------------
Other Miscellaneous Provisions.
------------------------------ 

Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all
money and Government Obligations (or other property as may be provided pursuant
to Section 301) (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or
other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 1305, the
"Trustee") pursuant to Section 1304 in respect of any Outstanding Securities of
any series and any coupons appertaining thereto shall be held in trust and
applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and
any coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture, to the payment, either
directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own
Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities
and any coupons appertaining thereto of all sums due and to become due thereon
in respect of principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, but such
money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by
law.

Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Security pursuant to
Section 301, if, after a deposit referred to in Section 1304(a) has been made,
(a) the Holder of a Security in respect of which such deposit was made is
entitled to, and does, elect pursuant to Section 312(b)
<PAGE>

83

or the terms of such Security to receive payment in a currency or currency unit
other than that in which the deposit pursuant to Section 1304(a) has been made
in respect of such Security, or (b) a Currency Conversion Event occurs as
contemplated in Section 312(d) or 312(e) or by the terms of any Security in
respect of which the deposit pursuant to Section 1304(a) has been made, the
indebtedness represented by such Security and any coupons appertaining thereto
shall be deemed to have been, and will be, fully discharged and satisfied
through the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if
any, on such Security as the same becomes due out of the proceeds yielded by
converting (from time to time as specified below in the case of any such
election) the amount or other property deposited in respect of such Security
into the currency or currency unit in which such Security becomes payable as a
result of such election or Currency Conversion Event based on the applicable
Market Exchange Rate for such currency or currency unit in effect on the second
Business Day prior to each payment date, except, with respect to a Currency
Conversion Event, for such currency or currency unit in effect (as nearly as
feasible) at the time of the Currency Conversion Event.

The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee
or other charge imposed on or assessed against the Government Obligations
deposited pursuant to Section 1304 or the principal and interest received in
respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for
the account of the Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any coupons
appertaining thereto.

Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee
shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any
money or Government Obligations (or other property and any proceeds therefrom)
held by it as provided in Section 1304 which, in the opinion of a nationally
recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written
certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount
thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect a defeasance or
covenant defeasance, as applicable, in accordance with this Article.

Section 1306. Reinstatement.
------------- 

If the Trustee or any Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in
accordance with Section 1305 by reason of any order or judgment of any court or
governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such
application, then the Company's obligations under this Indenture and such
Securities and any related coupons shall be revived and reinstated as though no
deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 1302 or 1303, as the case may be, until
such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in
accordance with Section 1305; provided, however, that if the Company makes any
payment of principal of (or premium, if any, on) or interest on any such
Security or any related coupon following the reinstatement of its obligations,
the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities
and any related coupons to receive such payment from the money held by the
Trustee or Paying Agent.

(a) Notwithstanding any provisions of this Indenture, the Trustee may
make such reasonable regulations as it may deem advisable for any meeting of
Holders of Securities of a series in regard to proof of the holding of
Securities of such series and of the appointment of proxies and in regard to the
appointment and duties of inspectors of votes, the submission and examination of
proxies, certificates and other evidence of the right to vote, and such other
matters concerning the conduct of the meeting as it shall deem appropriate.
Except as otherwise permitted or required by any such regulations, the holding
of Securities shall be proved in the manner specified in Section 104 and the
appointment of any proxy shall be proved in the manner specified in Section 104
or by having the signature of the Person executing the proxy witnessed or
guaranteed by any trust company, bank or banker authorized by Section 104 to
certify to the holding of Bearer Securities. Such regulations may provide that
written instruments appointing proxies, regular on their face, may be presumed
valid and genuine without the proof specified in Section 104 or other proof.

(b) The Trustee shall, by an instrument in writing, appoint a
temporary chairman of the meeting, unless the meeting shall have been called by
the Company or by Holders of Securities as provided in Section 1402(b), in which
case the Company or the Holders of Securities of the series calling the meeting,
as the case may be, shall in like manner appoint a temporary chairman. A
permanent chairman and a permanent secretary of the meeting shall be elected by
vote of the Persons entitled to vote a majority in principal amount of the

reports in duplicate of all votes cast at the meeting. A record, at least in
duplicate, of the proceedings of each meeting of Holders of Securities of any
Series shall be prepared by the secretary of the meeting and there shall be

vote by ballot taken thereat and affidavits by one or more persons having
knowledge of the fact, setting forth a copy of the notice of the meeting and
showing that said notice was given as provided in Section 1402 and, if
applicable, Section 1404. Each copy shall be signed and verified by the
affidavits of the permanent chairman and secretary of the meeting and one such
copy shall be delivered to the Company and another to the Trustee to be
preserved by the Trustee, the latter to have attached thereto the ballots voted

of the matters therein stated.

ARTICLE FIFTEEN

Repayment at the Option of Holders

Section 1501. Applicability of Article.
------------------------ 

Repayment of Securities of any series before their Stated Maturity at
the option of Holders thereof shall be made in accordance with the terms of such
Securities and (except as otherwise specified by the terms of such series
established pursuant to Section 301) in accordance with this Article.

Section 1502. Repayment of Securities.
----------------------- 

Securities of any series subject to repayment in whole or in part at
the option of the Holders thereof will, unless otherwise provided in the terms
of such Securities, be repaid at the Repayment Price thereof, together with
interest, if any, thereon accrued to the Repayment Date specified in or pursuant
to the terms of such Securities. The Company covenants that on or before the
Repayment Date it will deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if
the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as
provided in Section 1003) an amount of money in the currency or currencies,
currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the
Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to
Section 301 for the Securities of such series and 
<PAGE>

88

except, if applicable, as provided in Sections 312(b), 312(d) and 312(e))
sufficient to pay the Repayment Price of, and (except if the Repayment Date
shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities or
portions thereof, as the case may be, to be repaid on such date. 

Section 1503. Exercise of Option.
------------------ 

Securities of any series subject to repayment at the option of the
Holders thereof will contain an "Option to Elect Repayment" form on the reverse
of such Securities. To be repaid at the option of the Holder, any Security so
providing for such repayment, with the "Option to Elect Repayment" form on the
reverse of such Security duly completed by the Holder (or by the Holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing), must be received by the Company at the
Place of Payment therefor specified in the terms of such Security (or at such
other place or places of which the Company shall from time to time notify the
Holders of such Securities) not earlier than 45 days nor later than 30 days
prior to the Repayment Date. If less than the entire Repayment Price of such
Security is to be repaid in accordance with the terms of such Security, the
portion of the Repayment Price of such Security to be repaid, in increments of
the minimum denomination for Securities of such series, and the denomination or
denominations of the Security or Securities to be issued to the Holder for the
portion of such Security surrendered that is not to be repaid, must be
specified. Any Security providing for repayment at the option of the Holder
thereof may not be repaid in part if, following such repayment, the unpaid
principal amount of such Security would be less than the minimum authorized
denomination of Securities of the series of which such Security to be repaid is
a part. Except as otherwise may be provided by the terms of any Security
providing for repayment at the option of the Holder thereof, exercise of the
repayment option by the Holder shall be irrevocable unless waived by the
Company. 

Section 1504. When Securities Presented for Repayment Become Due and Payable.
-------------------------------------------------------------- 

If Securities of any series providing for repayment at the option of
the Holders thereof shall have been surrendered as provided in this Article and
as provided by or pursuant to the terms of such Securities, such Securities or
the portions thereof, as the case may be, to be repaid shall become due and
payable and shall be paid by the Company on the Repayment Date therein
specified, and on and after such Repayment Date (unless the Company shall
default in the payment of such Securities on such Repayment Date) such
Securities shall, if the same were interest-bearing, cease to bear interest and
the coupons for such interest appertaining to any Bearer Securities so to be
repaid, except to the extent provided below, shall be void. Upon surrender of
any such Security for repayment in accordance with such provisions, together
with all coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing after the Repayment
Date, the principal amount of such Security so to be repaid shall be paid by the
Company, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Repayment Date;
provided, however, that coupons whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the
Repayment Date shall be payable only at an office or agency located outside the
United States (except as otherwise provided in Section 1002) and, unless
otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, only upon presentation and
surrender of such coupons, and provided
<PAGE>

89

further that, in the case of Registered Securities, installments of interest, if
any, whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the Repayment Date shall be payable
(but without interest thereon, unless the Company shall default in the payment
thereof) to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor
Securities, registered as such at the close of business on the relevant Record
Dates according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307.

If any Bearer Security surrendered for repayment shall not be
accompanied by all appurtenant coupons maturing after the Repayment Date, such
Security may be paid after deducting from the amount payable therefor as
provided in Section 1502 an amount equal to the face amount of all such missing
coupons, or the surrender of such missing coupon or coupons may be waived by the
Company and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity
as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If
thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to the Trustee or any
Paying Agent any such missing coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have
been made as provided in the preceding sentence, such Holder shall be entitled
to receive the amount so deducted; provided, however, that interest represented
by coupons shall be payable only at an office or agency located outside the
United States (except as otherwise provided in Section 1002) and, unless
otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, only upon presentation and
surrender of those coupons.

If any Security surrendered for repayment shall not be so repaid upon
surrender thereof, the Repayment Price (together with interest, if any, thereon
accrued to such Repayment Date) shall, until paid, bear interest from the
Repayment Date at the rate of interest set forth in such Security or, in the
case of an Original Issue Discount Security, at the Yield to Maturity of such
Security. 

Section 1505. Securities Repaid in Part.
------------------------- 

Upon surrender of any Registered Security which is to be repaid in
part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver to the Holder of such Security, without service charge and at the
expense of the Company, a new Registered Security or Securities of the same
series, of any authorized denomination specified by the Holder, in an aggregate
principal amount equal to and in exchange for the portion of the principal of
such Security so surrendered which is not to be repaid.

instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such
execution or by a certificate of a notary public or other officer
authorized by law to take acknowledgments of deeds, certifying that the
individual signing such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the
execution thereof. Where such execution is by a signer acting in a
capacity other than his individual capacity, such certificate or affidavit
shall also constitute sufficient proof of his

authority. The fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or
writing, or the authority of the Person executing the same, may also be
proved in any other manner which the Trustee deems sufficient.

(c) The ownership of Securities shall be proved by the Security
Register.

(d) The ownership of Bearer Securities may be proved by the
production of such Bearer Securities or by a certificate executed, as
depositary, by any trust company, bank, banker or other depositary,
wherever situated, if such certificate shall be deemed by the Trustee to be
satisfactory, showing that at the date therein mentioned such Person had on
deposit with such depositary, or exhibited to it, the Bearer Securities
therein described; or such facts may be proved by the certificate or
affidavit of the Person holding such Bearer Securities, if such certificate
or affidavit is deemed by the Trustee to be satisfactory. The Trustee and
the Company may assume that such ownership of any Bearer Security continues
until (1) another certificate or affidavit bearing a later date issued in
respect of the same Bearer Security is produced, or (2) such Bearer
Security is produced to the Trustee by some other Person, or (3) such
Bearer Security is surrendered in exchange for a Registered Security, or
(4) such Bearer Security is no longer outstanding. The ownership of Bearer
Securities may also be proved in any other manner that the Trustee deems
sufficient.

(e) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or other Act of the Holder of any Security shall bind
every future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security
issued upon the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or
in lieu thereof in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done
by the Trustee, any Security Registrar, any Paying Agent, any
Authenticating Agent or the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not
notation of such action is made upon such Security.

Section 105. Notices, Etc. to Trustee and Company.
------------------------------------ 

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or Act of Holders or other document provided or permitted by this
Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to, or filed with,

(1) the Trustee by any Holder or by the Company shall be sufficient
for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if
made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Trustee at its
Corporate Trust Office, Attention: Corporate Trust and Agency Group, or

(2) the Company by the Trustee or by any Holder shall be sufficient
for every purpose hereunder (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if
made, given, furnished or filed in writing to or with the Company by first
class mail, facsimile or overnight courier, at the address of its principal
office specified in the first paragraph of this instrument or at any other
address previously furnished in writing to the Trustee by the Company.

Section 106. Notice to Holders; Waiver.
------------------------- 

Where this Indenture provides for notice of any event to Holders of
Registered Securities by the Company or the Trustee, such notice shall be
sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein expressly provided) if in writing
and mailed, first-class postage prepaid, to each such Holder affected by such
event, at his address as it appears in the Security Register, not later than the
latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving
of such notice. In any case where notice to Holders of Registered Securities is
given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice, nor any defect in any
notice so mailed, to any particular Holder shall affect the sufficiency of such
notice with respect to other Holders of Registered Securities or the sufficiency
of any notice to Holders of Bearer Securities given as provided herein. Any
notice mailed to a Holder in the manner herein prescribed shall be conclusively
deemed to have been received by such Holder, whether or not such Holder actually
receives such notice.

If by reason of the suspension of or irregularities in regular mail
service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such
notice by mail, then such notification to Holders of Registered Securities as
shall be made with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient
notification to such Holders for every purpose hereunder.

Except as otherwise expressly provided herein or otherwise specified
with respect to any Securities pursuant to Section 301, where this Indenture
provides for notice to Holders of Bearer Securities of any event, such notice
shall be sufficiently given if published in an Authorized Newspaper in The City
of New York and in such other city or cities as may be specified in such
Securities on a Business Day, such publication to be not later than the latest
date, and not earlier than the earliest date, prescribed for the giving of such
notice. Any such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such
publication or, if published more than once, on the date of the first such
publication.

If by reason of the suspension of publication of any Authorized
Newspaper or Authorized Newspapers or by reason of any other cause it shall be
impracticable to publish any notice to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided
above, then such notification to Holders of Bearer Securities as shall be given
with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute sufficient notice to such
Holders for every purpose hereunder. Neither the failure to give notice by
publication to Holders of Bearer Securities as provided above, nor any defect in
any notice so published, shall affect the sufficiency of such notice with
respect to other Holders of Bearer Securities or the sufficiency of any notice
to Holders of Registered Securities given as provided herein.

Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or
waiver required or permitted under this Indenture shall be in the English
language, except that any published notice may be in an official language of the
country of publication.

Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice
may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to receive such notice, either
before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such
notice. Waivers of notice by Holders
<PAGE>

17

shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition
precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon such waiver.

Section 107. Effect of Headings and Table of Contents.

for convenience only and shall not affect the construction hereof.

hereunder and the Holders, any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy
or claim under this Indenture.

Section 111. Governing Law.

This Indenture and the Securities and coupons shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. This Indenture
is subject to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act that are required to be

provisions.

Section 112. Legal Holidays.
-------------- 

In any case where any Interest Payment Date, Redemption Date,
Repayment Date, sinking fund payment date, Stated Maturity or Maturity of any
Security shall not be a Business Day at any Place of Payment, then
(notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or any Security or coupon
other than a provision in the Securities of any series which specifically states
that such provision shall apply in lieu of this Section), payment of principal
(or premium, if any) or interest, if any, need not be made at such Place of
Payment on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day at
such Place of Payment with the same force and effect as if made on the Interest
Payment Date, Redemption Date, Repayment Date or sinking fund payment date, or
at the Stated Maturity or Maturity, provided that no interest shall accrue on

representations, warranties, covenants, agreements or other obligations of the
Company hereunder or in any of the certificates, notices or agreements of the
Company delivered pursuant hereto, as to all of which recourse shall be had
solely to the assets of the Company, and under no circumstances shall Bankers
Trust Company be personally liable for the payment of any indebtedness or
expenses of the Company; provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall
affect obligations of the Company to the Trustee as set forth in Section 606,
subject to the exceptions thereto and limitations thereon.

ARTICLE TWO

Security Forms

Section 201. Forms Generally.
--------------- 

The Registered Securities, if any, of such series and the Bearer
Securities, if any, of each series and related coupons shall be in substantially
the forms as shall be established in one or more indentures supplemental hereto
or approved from time to time by or pursuant to a Board Resolution in accordance
with Section 301, shall have such appropriate insertions, omissions,
substitutions and other variations as are required or permitted by this
Indenture or any indenture supplemental hereto, and may have such letters,
numbers or other marks of identification or designation and such legends or
endorsements placed thereon as the Company may deem appropriate and as are not
inconsistent with the provisions of this Indenture, or as may be required to
comply with any law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with
any rule or regulation of any stock exchange on which the Securities may be
listed, or to conform to usage. If the form of Securities of any series is
established by action taken pursuant to a Board Resolution, a copy of an
appropriate record of such action shall be certified by the Secretary or an
Assistant Secretary of the Company and delivered to the Trustee at or prior to
the delivery of the Company Order contemplated by Section 303 for the
authentication and delivery of such Securities.

Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, Bearer
Securities shall have interest coupons attached.

The definitive Securities and coupons shall be printed, lithographed
or engraved or produced by any combination of these methods on a steel engraved
border or steel engraved borders or may be produced in any other manner, all as
determined by the officers executing such Securities or coupons, as evidenced by

Section 203. Securities Issuable in Global Form.
---------------------------------- 

If Securities of or within a series are issuable in global form, as
specified as contemplated by Section 301, then, notwithstanding clause (8) of
Section 301 and the provisions of Section 302, any such Security shall represent
such of the Outstanding Securities of such series as shall be specified therein
and may provide that it shall represent the aggregate amount of Outstanding
Securities of such series from time to time endorsed thereon and that the
aggregate amount of Outstanding Securities of such series represented thereby
may from time to time be increased or decreased to reflect exchanges. Any
endorsement of a Security in global form to reflect the amount, or any increase
or decrease in the amount, of Outstanding Securities represented thereby shall
be made by the Trustee in such manner and upon instructions given by such Person
or Persons as shall be specified therein or in the Company Order to be delivered
to the Trustee pursuant to Section 303 or 304. Subject to the provisions of
Section 303 and, if applicable, Section 304, the Trustee shall deliver and
redeliver any Security in permanent global form in the manner and upon
instructions given by the Person or Persons specified therein or in the
applicable Company Order. If a Company Order pursuant to Section 303 or 304 has
been, or simultaneously is, delivered, any instructions by the Company with
respect to endorsement or delivery or redelivery of a Security in global form
shall be in writing but need not comply with Section 102 and need not be
accompanied by an additional Opinion of Counsel.

The provisions of the last sentence of Section 303 shall apply to any
Security represented by a Security in global form if such Security was never
issued and sold by the Company and the Company delivers to the Trustee the
Security in global form together with written instructions (which need not
comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel)
with regard to the reduction in the principal amount of Securities represented
thereby, together with the written statement contemplated by the last sentence
of Section 303.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 307, unless otherwise
specified as contemplated by Section 301, payment of principal of (and premium,
if any) and interest, if any, on any Security in permanent global form shall be
made to the Person or Persons specified therein.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 309 and except as provided
in the preceding paragraph, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the
Company and the
<PAGE>

20

Trustee shall treat as the Holder of such principal amount of Outstanding
Securities represented by a permanent global Security (i) in the case of a
permanent global Security in registered form, the Holder of such permanent
global Security in registered form, or (ii) in the case of a permanent global
Security in bearer form, Euroclear or CEDEL.

Securities of any series denominated in Dollars, in the absence of any such
provisions with respect to the Securities of any series, the Registered
Securities of such series, other than Registered Securities issued in global
form (which may be of any denomination) shall be issuable in denominations of
$1,000 and any integral multiple thereof, and the Bearer Securities of such
series, other than Bearer Securities issued in global form (which may be of any
denomination), shall be issuable in a denomination of $5,000.

Section 303. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
---------------------------------------------- 

The Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto shall be executed
on behalf of the Company by its Chairman of the Board, or one of its Vice
Chairman of the Board, its President or one of its Vice Presidents, under its
corporate seal reproduced thereon, and attested by its Secretary or one of its
Assistant Secretaries. The signature of any of these officers on the Securities
and coupons may be manual or facsimile signatures of the present or any future
such authorized officer and may be imprinted or otherwise reproduced on the
Securities and coupons.

Securities or coupons bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of
individuals who were at any time the proper officers of the Company shall bind
the Company, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to
hold such offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or
did not hold such offices at the date of such Securities or coupons.

At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of
this Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities of any series together with
any coupon appertaining thereto, executed by the Company to the Trustee for
authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication and
delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee upon receipt of and in accordance
with the Company Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities; provided,
however, that, in connection with its original issuance, no Bearer Security
shall be mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United States; and
provided further that, unless otherwise specified with respect to any series of
Securities pursuant to Section 301, a Bearer Security may be delivered in
connection with its original issuance only if the Person entitled to receive
such Bearer Security shall have furnished a certificate in the form set forth in
Exhibit A-1 to this Indenture, dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the
earlier of the date on which such Bearer Security is delivered and the date on
which any temporary Security first becomes exchangeable for such Bearer Security
in accordance with the terms of such temporary Security and this Indenture. If
any Security
<PAGE>

25

shall be represented by a permanent global Bearer Security, then, for purposes
of this Section and Section 304, the notation of a beneficial owner's interest
therein upon original issuance of such Security or upon exchange of a portion of
a temporary global Security shall be deemed to be delivery in connection with
its original issuance of such beneficial owner's interest in such permanent
global Security. Except as permitted by Section 306, the Trustee shall not
authenticate and deliver any Bearer Security unless all appurtenant coupons for
interest then matured have been detached and cancelled. If not all the
Securities of any series are to be issued at one time and if the Board
Resolution or supplemental indenture establishing such series shall so permit,
such Company Order may set forth procedures acceptable to the Trustee for the
issuance of such Securities and determining terms of particular Securities of
such series, such as interest rate, maturity date, date of issuance and date
from which interest shall accrue. In authenticating such Securities, and
accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to
such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to TIA
Sections 315(a) through 315(d)) shall be fully protected in relying upon,

(i) an Opinion of Counsel stating,

(a) that the form or forms of such Securities and any coupons
have been established in conformity with the provisions of this
Indenture;

(b) that the terms of such Securities and any coupons have been
established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture; and

(c) that such Securities, together with any coupons appertaining
thereto, when completed by appropriate insertions and executed and
delivered by the Company to the Trustee for authentication in
accordance with this Indenture, authenticated and delivered by the
Trustee in accordance with this Indenture and issued by the Company in
the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion of
Counsel, will constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of
the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other similar
laws of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement
of creditors' rights, to general equitable principles and to such
other qualifications as such counsel shall conclude do not materially
affect the rights of Holders of such Securities and any coupons; and

(ii) an Officers' Certificate stating, to the best of the knowledge
of the signers of such certificate, that no Event of Default with respect
to any of the Securities shall have occurred and be continuing.

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301 and of the preceding two
paragraphs, if not all the Securities of any series are to be issued at one
time, it shall not be necessary to deliver the Officers' Certificate otherwise
required pursuant to Section 301 or the Company Order and Opinion of Counsel
otherwise required pursuant to the preceding two paragraphs prior to or at the
time of issuance of each Security, but such documents shall be delivered prior
to or at the time of issuance of the first Security of such series.
<PAGE>

26

If such form or terms have been so established, the Trustee shall not
be required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities
pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee's own rights, duties,
obligations or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise
in a manner which is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee. Notwithstanding
the generality of the foregoing, the Trustee will not be required to
authenticate Securities denominated in a Foreign Currency if the Trustee
reasonably believes that it would be unable to perform its duties with respect
to such Securities.

Each Registered Security shall be dated the date of its
authentication, and each Bearer Security shall be dated as of the date specified
as contemplated by Section 301.

No Security or coupon shall be entitled to any benefit under this
Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such
Security or Security to which such coupon appertains a certificate of
authentication substantially in the form provided for herein duly executed by
the Trustee by manual signature of a Responsible Officer, and such certificate
upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such
Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and is entitled to
the benefits of this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security
shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold
by the Company, and the Company shall deliver such Security to the Trustee for
cancellation as provided in Section 310 together with a written statement (which
need not comply with Section 102 and need not be accompanied by an Opinion of
Counsel) stating that such Security has never been issued and sold by the
Company, for all purposes of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never
to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled
to the benefits of this Indenture.

Section 304. Temporary Securities.
-------------------- 

(a) Pending the preparation of definitive Securities of any series,
the Company may execute, and upon Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate
and deliver, temporary Securities which are printed, lithographed, typewritten,
mimeographed or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination,
substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities in lieu of which they
are issued, in registered form, or, if authorized, in bearer form with one or
more coupon or without coupons, and with such appropriate insertions, omissions,
substitutions and other variations as the officers executing such Securities may
determine, as conclusively evidenced by their execution of such Securities. In
the case of Securities of any series, such temporary Securities may be in global
form.

Except in the case of temporary Securities in global form (which shall
be exchanged in accordance with the provisions of the following paragraphs), if
temporary Securities of any series are issued, the Company will cause definitive
Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the
preparation of definitive Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of
such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series, upon
surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of
the Company in a Place of Payment for that series, without charge to the Holder.
Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any
<PAGE>

27

series (accompanied by any unmatured coupons appertaining thereto), the Company
shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange
therefor a like principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of
authorized denominations; provided, however, that no definitive Bearer Security
shall be delivered in exchange for a temporary Registered Security; and provided
further that a definitive Bearer Security shall be delivered in exchange for a
temporary Bearer Security only in compliance with the conditions set forth in
Section 303. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall
in all respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as
definitive Securities of such series.

(b) Unless otherwise provided in or pursuant to a Board Resolution,
this Section 304(b) shall govern the exchange of temporary Securities issued in
global form. If temporary Securities or any series are issued in global form,
any such temporary global Security shall, unless otherwise provided therein, be
delivered to the London office of a depositary or common depositary (the "Common
Depositary"), for the benefit of Euroclear and CEDEL, for credit to the
respective accounts of the beneficial owners of such Securities (or to such
other accounts as they may direct).

Without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the date
specified in, or determined pursuant to the terms of, any such temporary global
Security (the "Temporary/Definitive Exchange Date"), the Company shall deliver
to the Trustee definitive Securities, in aggregate principal amount equal to the
principal amount of such temporary global Security, executed by the Company. On
or after the Temporary/Definitive Exchange Date, such temporary global Security
shall be surrendered by the Common Depositary to the Trustee, as the Company's
agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or from time to time in part,
for definitive Securities without charge, and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver, in exchange for each portion of such temporary global Security, an
equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the same series of
authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such temporary
global Security to be exchanged. The definitive Securities to be delivered in
exchange for any such temporary global Security shall be in bearer form,
registered form, permanent global bearer form or permanent global registered
form, or any combination thereof, as specified as contemplated by Section 301,
and, if any combination thereof is so specified, as requested by the beneficial
owner thereof; provided, however, that, unless otherwise specified in such
temporary global Security, upon such presentation by the Common Depositary, such
temporary global Security is accompanied by a certificate dated the
Temporary/Definitive Exchange Date or a subsequent date and signed by Euroclear
as to the portion of such temporary global Security held for its account then to
be exchanged and a certificate dated the Temporary/Definitive Exchange Date or a
subsequent date and signed by CEDEL as to the portion of such temporary global
Security held for its account then to be exchanged, each in the form set forth
in Exhibit A-2 to this Indenture (or in such other form as may be established
pursuant to Section 301); and provided further that definitive Bearer Securities
shall be delivered in exchange for a portion of a temporary global Security only
in compliance with the requirements of Section 303.

Unless otherwise specified in such temporary global Security, the
interest of a beneficial owner of Securities of a series in a temporary global
Security shall be exchanged for definitive Securities of the same series and of
like tenor following the
<PAGE>

28

Temporary/Definitive Exchange Date when the account holder instructs Euroclear
or CEDEL, as the case may be, to request such exchange on his behalf and
delivers to Euroclear or CEDEL, as the case may be, a certificate in the form
set forth in Exhibit A-1 to this Indenture (or in such other form as may be
established pursuant to Section 301), dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the
Temporary/Definitive Exchange Date, copies of which certificate shall be
available from the offices of Euroclear and CEDEL, the Trustee, any
Authenticating Agent appointed for such series of Securities and each Paying
Agent. Unless otherwise specified in such temporary global Security, any such
exchange shall be made free of charge to the beneficial owners of such temporary
global Security, except that a Person receiving definitive Securities must bear
the cost of insurance, postage, transportation and the like unless such Person
takes delivery of such definitive Securities in person at the offices of
Euroclear or CEDEL. Definitive Securities in bearer form to be delivered in
exchange for any portion of a temporary global Security shall be delivered only
outside the United States.

Until exchanged in full as hereinabove provided, the temporary
Securities of any series shall in all respects be entitled to the same benefits
under this Indenture as definitive Securities of the same series and of like
tenor authenticated and delivered hereunder, except that, unless otherwise
specified as contemplated by Section 301, interest payable on a temporary global
Security on an Interest Payment Date for Securities of such series occurring
prior to the applicable Temporary/Definitive Exchange Date shall be payable to
Euroclear and CEDEL on such Interest Payment Date upon delivery by Euroclear and
CEDEL to the Trustee of a certificate or certificates in the form set forth in
Exhibit A-2 to this Indenture (or in such other form as may be established
pursuant to Section 301), for credit without further interest on or after such
Interest Payment Date to the respective accounts of the Persons who are the
beneficial owners of such temporary global Security on such Interest Payment
Date and who have each delivered to Euroclear or CEDEL, as the case may be, a
certificate dated no earlier than 15 days prior to the Interest Payment Date
occurring prior to such Temporary/Definitive Exchange Date in the form set forth
in Exhibit A-1 to this Indenture (or in such other form as may be established
pursuant to Section 301). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein
contained, the certifications made pursuant to this paragraph shall satisfy the
certification requirements of the preceding two paragraphs of this Section and
of the third paragraph of Section 303 of this Indenture and the interests of the
Persons who are the beneficial owners of the temporary global Security with
respect to which such certification was made will be exchanged for definitive
Securities of the same series and of like tenor on the Temporary/Definitive
Exchange Date or the date of certification if such date occurs after the
Temporary/Definitive Exchange Date, without further act or deed by such
beneficial owners. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, no payments
of principal (or premium, if any) or interest owing with respect to a beneficial
interest in a temporary global Security will be made unless and until such
interest in such temporary global Security shall have been exchanged for an
interest in a definitive Security. Any interest so received by Euroclear and
CEDEL and not paid as herein provided shall be returned to the Trustee
immediately prior to the expiration of two years after such Interest Payment
Date in order to be repaid to the Company.

Section 305. Registration, Registration of Transfer and Exchange.
--------------------------------------------------- 

The Company shall cause to be kept at the Corporate Trust Office of
the Trustee a register for each series of Securities (the registers maintained
in the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee and in any other office or agency
of the Company in a Place of Payment being herein sometimes collectively
referred to as the "Security Register") in which, subject to such reasonable
regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall provide for the registration
of Registered Securities and of transfers of Registered Securities. The
Security Register shall be in written form or any other form capable of being
converted into written form within a reasonable time. The Trustee, at its
Corporate Trust Office, is hereby initially appointed "Security Registrar" for
the purpose of registering Registered Securities and transfers of Registered
Securities on such Security Register as herein provided. In the event that the
Trustee shall cease to be Security Registrar, it shall have the right to examine
the Security Register at all reasonable times.

Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Registered Security
of any series at the office or agency in a Place of Payment for that series, the
Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the
name of the designated transferee, one or more new Registered Securities of the
same series, of any authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal
amount, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding and containing
identical terms and provisions.

At the option of the Holder, Registered Securities of any series may
be exchanged for other Registered Securities of the same series, of any
authorized denomination and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon surrender
of the Registered Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever
any Registered Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall
execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Registered
Securities which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Unless
otherwise specified with respect to any series of Securities as contemplated by
Section 301, Bearer Securities may not be issued in exchange for Registered
Securities.

If (but only if) expressly permitted in or pursuant to the applicable
Board Resolution and (subject to Section 303) set forth in the applicable
Officers' Certificate, or in any indenture supplemental hereto, delivered as
contemplated by Section 301, at the option of the Holder, Bearer Securities of
any series may be exchanged for Registered Securities of the same series of any
authorized denomination and of a like aggregate principal amount and tenor, upon
surrender of the Bearer Securities to be exchanged at any such office or agency,
with all unmatured coupons and all matured coupons in default thereto
appertaining. If the Holder of a Bearer Security is unable to produce any such
unmatured coupon or coupons or matured coupon or coupons in default, any such
permitted exchange may be effected if the Bearer Securities are accompanied by
payment in funds acceptable to the Company in an amount equal to the face amount
of such missing coupon or coupons, or the surrender of such missing coupon or
coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there is furnished to
them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of them and any
Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security shall
surrender to any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in respect of which such a
payment shall have been made, such Holder shall be entitled to receive the
amount of such payment; provided,
<PAGE>

30

however, that, except as otherwise provided in Section 1002, interest
represented by coupons shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of
those coupons at an office or agency located outside the United States.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in case a Bearer Security of any series is
surrendered at any such office or agency in a permitted exchange for a
Registered Security of the same series and like tenor after the close of
business at such office or agency on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the
opening of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment
Date, or (ii) any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at such
office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest,
such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the coupon relating to such
Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, and
interest or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such
Interest Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in
respect of the Registered Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security,
but will be payable only to the Holder of such coupon when due in accordance
with the provisions of this Indenture.

Whenever any Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Company
shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities
which the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as otherwise specified as
contemplated by Section 301, any permanent global Security shall be exchangeable
only as provided in this paragraph. If any beneficial owner of an interest in a
permanent global Security is entitled to exchange such interest for Securities
of such series and of like tenor and principal amount of another authorized form
and denomination, as specified as contemplated by Section 301 and provided that
any applicable notice provided in the permanent global Security shall have been
given, then without unnecessary delay but in any event not later than the
earliest date on which such interest may be so exchanged, the Company shall
deliver to the Trustee definitive Securities in aggregate principal amount equal
to the principal amount of such beneficial owner's interest in such permanent
global Security, executed by the Company. On or after the earliest date on
which such interests may be so exchanged, such permanent global Security shall
be surrendered by the Common Depositary or such other depositary as shall be
specified in the Company Order with respect thereto to the Trustee, as the
Company's agent for such purpose, to be exchanged, in whole or from time to time
in part, for definitive Securities without charge, and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver, in exchange for each portion of such permanent global
Security, an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of the
same series of authorized denominations and of like tenor as the portion of such
permanent global Security to be exchanged which, unless the Securities of the
series are not issuable both as Bearer Securities and as Registered Securities,
as specified as contemplated by Section 301, shall be in the form of Bearer
Securities or Registered Securities, or any combination thereof, as shall be
specified by the beneficial owner thereof; provided, however, that no such
exchanges may occur during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days
before any selection of Securities to be redeemed and ending on the relevant
Redemption Date if the Security for which exchange is requested may be among
those selected for redemption; and provided further that no Bearer Security
delivered in exchange for a portion of a permanent global Security shall be
mailed or otherwise delivered to any location in the United States. If a
Registered Security is issued in exchange for any portion of a permanent global
Security after the close of business at the office or agency
<PAGE>

31

where such exchange occurs on (i) any Regular Record Date and before the opening
of business at such office or agency on the relevant Interest Payment Date, or
(ii) any Special Record Date and the opening of business at such office or
agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted Interest, interest
or Defaulted Interest, as the case may be, will not be payable on such Interest
Payment Date or proposed date for payment, as the case may be, in respect of
such Registered Security, but will be payable on such Interest Payment Date or
proposed date for payment, as the case may be, only to the Person to whom
interest in respect of such portion of such permanent global Security is payable
in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.

All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of
Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Company, evidencing the same
debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Securities
surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.

Every Registered Security presented or surrendered for registration of
transfer or for exchange or redemption shall (if so required by the Company or
the Security Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security
Registrar, duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized
in writing.

No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or
exchange or redemption of Securities, but the Company may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other
than exchanges pursuant to Section 304, 906, 1107 or 1305 not involving any
transfer.

The Company shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer
of or exchange any Security if such Security may be among those selected for
redemption during a period beginning at the opening of business 15 days before
the day of the selection for redemption of Securities of that series under
Section 1103 or 1203 and ending at the close of business on (A) if Securities of
the series are issuable only as Registered Securities, the day of the mailing of
the relevant notice of redemption and (B) if Securities of the series are
issuable as Bearer Securities, the day of the first publication of the relevant
notice of redemption or, if Securities of the series are also issuable as
Registered Securities and there is no publication, the mailing of the relevant
notice of redemption, or (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any
Registered Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the
unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part, or (iii) to exchange
any Bearer Security so selected for redemption except that such a Bearer
Security may be exchanged for a Registered Security of that series and like
tenor; provided that such Registered Security shall be simultaneously
surrendered for redemption, or (iv) to issue, register the transfer of or
exchange any Security which has been surrendered for repayment at the option of
the Holder, except the portion, if any, of such Security not to be so repaid.

Section 306. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities.
------------------------------------------------ 

If any mutilated Security or a Security with a mutilated coupon
appertaining to it is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and
the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security
of the same series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number
not contemporaneously outstanding, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if
any, appertaining to the surrendered Security.

If there shall be delivered to the Company and to the Trustee (i)
evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security
or coupon and (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save
each of them and any agent of either of them harmless, then, in the absence of
notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security or coupon has been
acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon its
request the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such
destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in exchange for the Security to which a
destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains (with all appurtenant coupons not
destroyed, lost or stolen), a new Security of the same series and principal
amount, containing identical terms and provisions and bearing a number not
contemporaneously outstanding, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if
any, appertaining to such destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the Security
to which such destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains.

Notwithstanding the provisions of the previous two paragraphs, in case
any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or coupon has become or
is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead
of issuing a new Security, with coupons corresponding to the coupons, if any,
appertaining to such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security or to the
Security to which such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen coupons appertains,
pay such Security or coupon; provided, however, that payment of principal of
(and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on Bearer Securities shall, except
as otherwise provided in Section 1002, be payable only at an office or agency
located outside the United States and, unless otherwise specified as
contemplated by Section 301, any interest on Bearer Securities shall be payable
only upon presentation and surrender of the coupons appertaining thereto.

Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company
may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other
expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.

Every new Security of any series with its coupons, if any, issued
pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security or in
exchange for a Security to which a destroyed, lost or stolen coupon appertains,
shall constitute an original additional contractual obligation of the Company,
whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security and its coupons, if any,
or the destroyed, lost or stolen coupon, shall be at any time enforceable by
anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and
proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series and their
coupons, if any, duly issued hereunder.
<PAGE>

33

The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to
the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement
or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or coupons.

Section 307. Payment of Interest; Interest Rights Preserved; Optional Interest
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Reset.
- - ----- 

(a) Except as otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with
respect to any series of Securities, interest on any Registered Security which
is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment
Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name such Security (or one or more
Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular
Record Date for such interest at the office or agency of the Company maintained
for such purpose pursuant to Section 1002; provided, however, that each
installment of interest on any Registered Security may at the Company's option
be paid by (i) mailing a check for such interest, payable to or upon the written
order of the Person entitled thereto pursuant to Section 309, to the address of
such Person as it appears on the Security Register or (ii) transfer to an
account maintained by the payee located in the United States.

Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301 with respect
to the Securities of any series, payment of interest may be made, in the case of
a Bearer Security, by transfer to an account maintained by the payee with a bank
located outside the United States.

Unless otherwise provided as contemplated by Section 301, every
permanent global Security will provide that interest, if any, payable on any
Interest Payment Date will be paid to each of Euroclear and CEDEL with respect
to that portion of such permanent global Security held for its account by the
Common Depositary, for the purpose of permitting each of Euroclear and CEDEL to
credit the interest received by it in respect of such permanent global Security
to the accounts of the beneficial owners thereof.

In case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered in exchange for
a Registered Security of such series after the close of business (at an office
or agency in a Place of Payment for such series) on any Regular Record Date and
before the opening of business (at such office or agency) on the next succeeding
Interest Payment Date, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the
coupon relating to such Interest Payment Date and interest will not be payable
on such Interest Payment Date in respect of the Registered Security issued in
exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable only to the Holder of
such coupon when due in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture.

Except as otherwise specified with respect to a series of Securities
in accordance with the provisions of Section 301, any interest on any Registered
Security of any series that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly
provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (herein called "Defaulted Interest")
shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered Holder thereto on the
relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such
Defaulted Interest may be paid by the Company, at its election in each case, as
provided in clause (1) or (2) below:
<PAGE>

34

(1) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to
the Persons in whose names the Registered Securities of such series (or
their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of
business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted
Interest, which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Company shall
notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed
to be paid on each Registered Security of such series and the date of the
proposed payment (which shall not be less than 20 days after such notice is
received by the Trustee), and at the same time the Company shall deposit
with the Trustee an amount of money in the currency or currencies, currency
unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the Securities
of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to
Section 301 for the Securities of such series and except, if applicable, as
provided in Sections 312(b), 312(d) and 312(e)) equal to the aggregate
amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall
make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the
date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust
for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in
this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a Special Record
Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more
than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed
payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the
notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the
Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of
the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted
Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed, first-class
postage prepaid, to each Holder of Registered Securities of such series at
his address as it appears in the Security Register, not less than 10 days
prior to such Special Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such
Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so
mailed, such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names
the Registered Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor
Securities) are registered at the close of business on such Special Record
Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
In case a Bearer Security of any series is surrendered at the office or
agency in a Place of Payment for such series in exchange for a Registered
Security of such series after the close of business at such office or
agency on any Special Record Date and before the opening of business at
such office or agency on the related proposed date for payment of Defaulted
Interest, such Bearer Security shall be surrendered without the coupon
relating to such proposed date of payment and Defaulted Interest will not
be payable on such proposed date of payment in respect of the Registered
Security issued in exchange for such Bearer Security, but will be payable
only to the Holder of such coupon when due in accordance with the
provisions of this Indenture.

(2) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the
Registered Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not
inconsistent with the requirements of any securities exchange on which such
Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such
exchange, if, after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of the
proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be
deemed acceptable to the Trustee.
<PAGE>

35

(b) The provisions of this Section 307(b) may be made applicable to
any series of Securities pursuant to Section 301 (with such modifications,
additions or substitutions as may be specified pursuant to such Section 301).
The interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such
interest rate, if applicable) on any Security of such series may be reset by the
Company on the date or dates specified on the face of such Security (each an
"Optional Reset Date"). The Company may exercise such option with respect to
such Security by notifying the Trustee of such exercise at least 50 but not more
than 60 days prior to an Optional Reset Date for such Note. Not later than 40
days prior to each Optional Reset Date, the Trustee shall transmit, in the
manner provided for in Section 106, to the Holder of any such Security a notice
(the "Reset Notice") indicating whether the Company has elected to reset the
interest rate (or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such
interest rate, if applicable), and if so (i) such new interest rate (or such new
spread or spread multiplier, if applicable) and (ii) the provisions, if any, for
redemption during the period from such Optional Reset Date to the next Optional
Reset Date or if there is no such next Optional Reset Date, to the Stated
Maturity Date of such Security (each such period a "Subsequent Interest
Period"), including the date or dates on which or the period or periods during
which and the price or prices at which such redemption may occur during the
Subsequent Interest Period.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days prior to the
Optional Reset Date, the Company may, at its option, revoke the interest rate
(or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if
applicable) provided for in the Reset Notice and establish an interest rate (or
a spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if
applicable) that is higher than the interest rate (or the spread or spread
multiplier, if applicable) provided for in the Reset Notice, for the Subsequent
Interest Period by causing the Trustee to transmit, in the manner provided for
in Section 106, notice of such higher interest rate (or such higher spread or
spread multiplier, if applicable) to the Holder of such Security. Such notice
shall be irrevocable. All Securities with respect to which the interest rate
(or the spread or spread multiplier used to calculate such interest rate, if
applicable) is reset on an Optional Reset Date, and with respect to which the
Holders of such Securities have not tendered such Securities for repayment (or
have validly revoked any such tender) pursuant to the next succeeding paragraph,
will bear such higher interest rate (or such higher spread or spread multiplier,
if applicable).

The Holder of any such Security will have the option to elect
repayment by the Company of the principal of such Security on each Optional
Reset Date at a price equal to the principal amount thereof plus interest
accrued to such Optional Reset Date. In order to obtain repayment on an
Optional Reset Date, the Holder must follow the procedures set forth in Article
Thirteen for repayment at the option of Holders except that the period for
delivery or notification to the Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than
35 days prior to such Optional Reset Date and except that, if the Holder has
tendered any Security for repayment pursuant to the Reset Notice, the Holder
may, by written notice to the Trustee, revoke such tender or repayment until the
close of business on the tenth day before such Optional Reset Date.

Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section and Section 305,
each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or
in exchange for or
<PAGE>

36

in lieu of any other Security shall carry the rights to interest accrued and
unpaid, and to accrue, which were carried by such other Security.

Section 308. Optional Extension of Maturity.
------------------------------ 

The provisions of this Section 308 may be made applicable to any
series of Securities pursuant to Section 301 (with such modifications, additions
or substitutions as may be specified pursuant to such Section 301). The Stated
Maturity of any Security of such series may be extended at the option of the
Company for the period or periods specified on the face of such Security (each
an "Extension Period") up to but not beyond the date (the "Final Maturity") set
forth on the face of such Security. The Company may exercise such option with
respect to any Security by notifying the Trustee of such exercise at least 50
but not more than 60 days prior to the Stated Maturity of such Security in
effect prior to the exercise of such option (the "Original Stated Maturity").
If the Company exercises such option, the Trustee shall transmit, in the manner
provided for in Section 106, to the Holder of such Security not later than 40
days prior to the Original Stated Maturity a notice (the "Extension Notice")
indicating (i) the election of the Company to extend the Stated Maturity, (ii)
the new Stated Maturity, (iii) the interest rate, if any, applicable to the
Extension Period and (iv) the provisions, if any, for redemption during such
Extension Period. Upon the Trustee's transmittal of the Extension Notice, the
Stated Maturity of such Security shall be extended automatically and, except as
modified by the Extension Notice and as described in the next paragraph, such
Security will have the same terms as prior to the transmittal of such Extension
Notice.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20 days before the
Original Stated Maturity of such Security, the Company may, at its option,
revoke the interest rate provided for in the Extension Notice and establish a
higher interest rate for the Extension Period by causing the Trustee to
transmit, in the manner provided for in Section 106, notice of such higher
interest rate to the Holder of such Security. Such notice shall be irrevocable.
All Securities with respect to which the Stated Maturity is extended will bear
such higher interest rate.

If the Company extends the Maturity of any Security, the Holder will
have the option to elect repayment of such Security by the Company on the
Original Stated Maturity at a price equal to the principal amount thereof, plus
interest accrued to such date. In order to obtain repayment on the Original
Stated Maturity once the Company has extended the Maturity thereof, the Holder
must follow the procedures set forth in Article Seventeen for repayment at the
option of Holders, except that the period for delivery or notification to the
Trustee shall be at least 25 but not more than 35 days prior to the Original
Stated Maturity and except that, if the Holder has tendered any Security for
repayment pursuant to an Extension Notice, the Holder may by written notice to
the Trustee revoke such tender for repayment until the close of business on the
tenth day before the Original Stated Maturity.

Section 309. Persons Deemed Owners.
--------------------- 

Prior to due presentment of a Registered Security for registration of
transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee
may treat the Person
<PAGE>

37

in whose name such Registered Security is registered as the owner of such
Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of (and premium, if
any) and (subject to Sections 305 and 307) interest, if any, on such Registered
Security and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Registered
Security be overdue, and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the
Company or the Trustee shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

Title to any Bearer Security and any coupons appertaining thereto
shall pass by delivery. The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company
or the Trustee may treat the bearer of any Bearer Security and the bearer of any
coupon as the absolute owner of such Security or coupon for the purpose of
receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and for all other purposes
whatsoever, whether or not such Security or coupons be overdue, and neither the
Company, the Trustee nor any agent of the Company or the Trustee shall be
affected by notice to the contrary.

None of the Company, the Trustee, any Paying Agent or the Security
Registrar will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the
records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership
interests of a Security in global form or for maintaining, supervising or
reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interests.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any global Security,
nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee, or any agent of the
Company or the Trustee, from giving effect to any written certification, proxy
or other authorization furnished by any depositary, as a Holder, with respect to
such global Security or impair, as between such depositary and owners of
beneficial interests in such global Security, the operation of customary
practices governing the exercise of the rights of such depositary (or its
nominee) as Holder of such global Security.

Section 310. Cancellation.
------------ 

All Securities and coupons surrendered for payment, redemption,
repayment at the option of the Holder, registration of transfer or exchange or
for credit against any sinking fund payment shall, if surrendered to any Person
other than the Trustee, be delivered to the Trustee and any such Securities and
coupons and Securities and coupons surrendered directly to the Trustee for any
such purpose shall be promptly cancelled by it. The Company may at any time
deliver to the Trustee for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated
and delivered hereunder which the Company may have acquired in any manner
whatsoever, and may deliver to the Trustee (or to any other Person for delivery
to the Trustee) for cancellation any Securities previously authenticated
hereunder which the Company has not issued and sold, and all Securities so
delivered shall be promptly cancelled by the Trustee. If the Company shall so
acquire any of the Securities, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a
redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities
unless and until the same are surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation. No
Securities shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Securities
cancelled as provided in this Section, except as expressly permitted by this
Indenture. Cancelled Securities and coupons held by the Trustee shall be
destroyed by the Trustee, in its customary manner and the
<PAGE>

38

Trustee shall deliver a certificate of such destruction to the Company, unless
by a Company Order the Company directs their return to it within 30 days after
such securities have been delivered to the Trustee for such purpose. The
Trustee shall not be required to hold cancelled securities for more than one
year.

Section 311. Computation of Interest.
----------------------- 

Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 with
respect to Securities of any series, interest, if any, on the Securities of each
series shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

Section 312. Currency and Manner of Payments in Respect of Securities.
-------------------------------------------------------- 

(a) Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities
pursuant to Section 301, with respect to Registered Securities of any series not
permitting the election provided for in paragraph (b) below or the Holders of
which have not made the election provided for in paragraph (b) below, and with
respect to Bearer Securities of any series, except as provided in paragraph (d)
below, payment of the principal of (and premium, if any, on) and interest, if
any, on any Registered or Bearer Security of such series will be made in the
currency or currencies in which such Registered Security or Bearer Security, as
the case may be, is payable. The provisions of this Section 312 may be modified
or superseded with respect to any Securities pursuant to Section 301.

(b) It may be provided pursuant to Section 301 with respect to
Registered Securities of any series that Holders shall have the option, subject
to paragraphs (d) and (e) below, to receive payments of principal of (and
premium, if any, on) or interest, if any, on such Registered Securities in any
of the currencies, currency units or composite currencies which may be
designated for such election by delivering to the Trustee for such series of
Registered Securities a written election with signature guarantees and in the
applicable form established pursuant to Section 301, not later than the close of
business on the Currency Election Date immediately preceding the applicable
payment date. If a Holder so elects to receive such payments in any such
currency, currency unit or composite currency, such election will remain in
effect for such Holder or any transferee of such Holder until changed by such
Holder or such transferee by written notice to the Trustee for such series of
Registered Securities (but any such change must be made not later than the close
of business on the Currency Election Date immediately preceding the next payment
date to be effective for the payment to be made on such payment date and no such
change of election may be made with respect to payments to be made on any
Registered Security of such series with respect to which an Event of Default has
occurred or with respect to which the Company has deposited funds pursuant to
Article Four or Fourteen or with respect to which a notice of redemption has
been given by the Company or a notice of option to elect repayment has been sent
by such Holder or such transferee). Any Holder of any such Registered Security
who shall not have delivered any such election to the Trustee of such series of
Registered Securities not later than the close of business on the applicable
Currency Election Date will be paid the amount due on the applicable payment
date in the relevant currency or currencies as provided in Section 312(a). The
Trustee for each such series of Registered Securities shall notify the Exchange
Rate Agent as soon as practicable after the Currency Election Date
<PAGE>

39

of the aggregate principal amount of Registered Securities for which Holders
have made such written election.

(c) Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, if the
election referred to in paragraph (b) above has been provided for pursuant to
Section 301, then, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, not later
than the fourth Business Day after the Currency Election Date for each payment
date for Registered Securities of any series, the Exchange Rate Agent will
deliver to the Company a written notice specifying, in the currency or
currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which
Registered Securities of such series are payable, the respective aggregate
amounts of principal of (and premium, if any, on) and interest, if any, on the
Registered Securities to be paid on such payment date, specifying the amounts in
such currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or
currencies so payable in respect of the Registered Securities as to which the
Holders of Registered Securities denominated in any currency or currencies,
currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies shall have elected to
be paid in another currency, currency unit or composite currency as provided in
paragraph (b) above. If the election referred to in paragraph (b) above has
been provided for pursuant to Section 301 and if at least one Holder has made
such election, then, unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, on the
second Business Day preceding such payment date the Company will deliver to the
Trustee for such series of Registered Securities an Exchange Rate Officer's
Certificate in respect of the Dollar or Foreign Currency payments to be made on
such payment date. Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, the
Dollar, Foreign Currency or currencies, ECU or currency unit amount receivable
by Holders of Registered Securities who have elected payment in a currency or
currency unit as provided in paragraph (b) above shall be determined by the
Company on the basis of the applicable Market Exchange Rate in effect on the
second Business Day (the "Valuation Date") immediately preceding each payment
date, and such determination shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes,
absent manifest error. 

(d) If a Currency Conversion Event occurs with respect to a Foreign
Currency, the ECU or any other currency unit in which any of the Securities are
denominated or payable other than pursuant to an election provided for pursuant
to paragraph (b) above, then with respect to each date for the payment of
principal of (and premium, if any, on) and interest, if any, on the applicable
Securities denominated or payable in such Foreign Currency, the ECU or such
other currency unit occurring after the last date on which such Foreign
Currency, the ECU or such other currency unit was used (the "Currency Conversion
Date"), the Dollar shall be the Currency of payment for use on each such payment
date. Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, the Dollar amount to
be paid by the Company to the Trustee of each series of Securities and by the
Trustee or any Paying Agent to the Holders of such Securities with respect to
such payment date shall be, in the case of a Foreign Currency other than a
currency unit, the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency or, in the case of
a currency unit, the Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit, in each case as
determined by the Exchange Rate Agent in the manner provided in paragraph (f) or
(g) below.

(e) Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, if the Holder
of a Registered Security denominated in any currency or currencies, currency
unit or units or
<PAGE>

40

composite currency or currencies shall have elected to be paid in another
currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or
currencies as provided in paragraph (b) above, and a Currency Conversion Event
occurs with respect to such elected currency or currencies, currency unit or
units or composite currency or currencies, such Holder shall receive payment in
the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or
currencies in which payment would have been made in the absence of such
election; and if a Currency Conversion Event occurs with respect to the currency
or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in
which payment would have been made in the absence of such election, such Holder
shall receive payment in Dollars as provided in paragraph (d) above.

(f) The "Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency" shall be
determined by the Exchange Rate Agent and shall be obtained for each subsequent
payment date by converting the specified Foreign Currency into Dollars at the
Market Exchange Rate on the Currency Conversion Date.

(g) The "Dollar Equivalent of the Currency Unit" shall be determined
by the Exchange Rate Agent and subject to the provisions of paragraph (h) below
shall be the sum of each amount obtained by converting the Specified Amount of
each Component Currency into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate for such
Component Currency on the Valuation Date with respect to each payment.

(h) For purposes of this Section 312, the following terms shall have
the following meanings:

A "Component Currency" shall mean any Currency which, on the Currency
Conversion Date, was a component currency of the relevant currency unit,
including, but not limited to, the ECU.

A "Specified Amount" of a Component Currency shall mean the number of
units of such Component Currency or fractions thereof which were
represented in the relevant currency unit, including, but not limited to,
the ECU, on the Currency Conversion Date. If after the Currency Conversion
Date the official unit of any Component Currency is altered by way of
combination or subdivision, the Specified Amount of such Component Currency
shall be divided or multiplied in the same proportion. If after the
Currency Conversion Date two or more Component Currencies are consolidated
into a single currency, the respective Specified Amounts of such Component
Currencies shall be replaced by an amount in such single currency equal to
the sum of the respective Specified Amounts of such consolidated Component
Currencies expressed in such single currency, and such amount shall
thereafter be a Specified Amount and such single currency shall thereafter
be a Component Currency. If after the Currency Conversion Date any
Component Currency shall be divided into two or more currencies, the
Specified Amount of such Component Currency shall be replaced by amounts of
such two or more currencies, having an aggregate Dollar Equivalent value at
the Market Exchange Rate on the date of such replacement equal to the
Dollar Equivalent value of the Specified Amount of such former Component
Currency at the Market Exchange Rate immediately before such
<PAGE>

41

division, and such amounts shall thereafter be Specified Amounts and such
currencies shall thereafter be Component Currencies. If, after the
Currency Conversion Date of the relevant currency unit, including, but not
limited to, the ECU, a Currency Conversion Event (other than any event
referred to above in this definition of "Specified Amount") occurs with
respect to any Component Currency of such currency unit and is continuing
on the applicable Valuation Date, the Specified Amount of such Component
Currency shall, for purposes of calculating the Dollar Equivalent of the
Currency Unit, be converted into Dollars at the Market Exchange Rate in
effect on the Currency Conversion Date of such Component Currency.

"Currency Election Date" shall mean the date for any series of
Registered Securities as specified pursuant to clause (13) of Section 301
by which the written election referred to in paragraph (b) above may be
made.

All decisions and determinations of the Exchange Rate Agent regarding
the Dollar Equivalent of the Foreign Currency, the Dollar Equivalent of the
Currency Unit, the Market Exchange Rate and changes in the Specified Amounts as
specified above shall be in its sole discretion and shall, in the absence of
manifest error, be conclusive for all purposes and irrevocably binding upon the
Company, the Trustee and all Holders of such Securities denominated or payable
in the relevant currency. The Exchange Rate Agent shall promptly give written
notice to the Company and the Trustee of any such decision or determination.

In the event that the Company determines in good faith that a Currency
Conversion Event has occurred with respect to a Foreign Currency, the Company
will immediately give written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Exchange
Rate Agent (and upon receipt thereof the Trustee will promptly thereafter give
notice in the manner provided for in Section 106 to the affected Holders)
specifying the Currency Conversion Date. In the event the Company so determines
that a Currency Conversion Event has occurred with respect to the ECU or any
other currency unit in which Securities are denominated or payable, the Company
will immediately give written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Exchange
Rate Agent (and upon receipt thereof the Trustee will promptly thereafter give
notice in the manner provided for in Section 106 to the affected Holders)
specifying the Currency Conversion Date and the Specified Amount of each
Component Currency on the Currency Conversion Date. In the event the Company
determines in good faith that any subsequent change in any Component Currency as
set forth in the definition of Specified Amount above has occurred, the Company
will similarly give written notice to the Trustee and the Exchange Rate Agent.

The Trustee shall be fully justified and protected in relying and
acting upon information received by it from the Company and the Exchange Rate
Agent and shall not otherwise have any duty or obligation to determine the
accuracy or validity of such information.

Section 313. Appointment and Resignation of Successor Exchange Rate Agent.
------------------------------------------------------------ 

(a) Unless otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, if and so
long as the Securities of any series (i) are denominated in a currency other
than Dollars or (ii) may be payable in a currency other than Dollars, or so long
as it is required under any other provision of this Indenture, then the Company
will maintain with respect to each such series of Securities, or as so required,
at least one Exchange Rate Agent. The Company will cause the Exchange Rate
Agent to make the necessary foreign exchange determinations at the time and in
the manner specified pursuant to Section 301 for the purpose of determining the
applicable rate of exchange and, if applicable, for the purpose of converting
the issued currency into the applicable payment currency for the payment of
principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, pursuant to Section 312.

(b) No resignation of the Exchange Rate Agent and no appointment of a
successor Exchange Rate Agent pursuant to this Section shall become effective
until the acceptance of appointment by the successor Exchange Rate Agent as
evidenced by a written instrument delivered to the Company and the Trustee.

(c) If the Exchange Rate Agent shall resign, be removed or become
incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of the Exchange
Rate Agent for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more series,
the Company, by or pursuant to a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a
successor Exchange Rate Agent or Exchange Rate Agents with respect to the
Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any such successor
Exchange Rate Agent may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or
more or all of such series and that, unless otherwise specified pursuant to
Section 301, at any time there shall only be one Exchange Rate Agent with
respect to the Securities of any particular series that are originally issued by
the Company on the same date and that are initially denominated and/or payable
in the same currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite currency
or currencies).

Section 314. CUSIP Numbers.
-------------

The Company in issuing the Securities may use "CUSIP" numbers (if then
generally in use), and, if so, the Trustee shall indicate the "CUSIP" numbers of
the Securities in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders; provided 
that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the 
correctness of such numbers either as pointed on the Securities or as contained 
in any notice of redemption.

Thirteen or be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by operation of law or
pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or any order, rule or
regulation of any administrative or governmental body):

in writing of its inability to pay its debts generally as they become due,
or the taking of corporate action by the Company in furtherance of any such
action; or

(3) any other Event of Default provided with respect to Securities of
that series.

Section 502. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment.
-------------------------------------------------- 

If an Event of Default described in clause (1) or (2) of Section
501 occurs and is continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the
Holders of not less than 25% in principal amount of all of the Securities
then Outstanding may declare the principal amount (or, if any such
Securities are Original Issue Discount Securities or Indexed Securities,
such portion of the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of
that series) of all of the Outstanding Securities to be due and payable
immediately, by a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if
given by the Holders) and upon any such declaration such principal amount
(or specified portion thereof) shall become immediately due and payable.
If an Event of Default described in clause (3) of Section 501 with respect
to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is
continuing, then in every such case the Trustee or the Holders of not less
than 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series
may declare the principal amount (or, if the Securities of that series are
Original Issue Discount Securities or Indexed Securities, such portion of
the principal amount as may be specified in the terms of that series) of
all of the Securities of that series to be due and payable immediately, by
a notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by
Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount (or specified
portion thereof) shall become immediately due and payable.

At any time after such a declaration of acceleration with respect
to Securities of any series has been made and before a judgment or decree
for payment of the money due has been obtained by the Trustee as
hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series, by written
notice to the Company and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such
declaration and its consequences if
<PAGE>

46

(1) the Company has paid or deposited with the Trustee a sum
sufficient to pay in the currency, currency unit or composite currency in
which the Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise
specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of such series and
except, if applicable, as provided in Sections 312(b), 312(d) and 312(e)):

(A) all overdue installments of interest, if any, on all
Outstanding Securities of that series and any related coupons,

(B) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any Outstanding
Securities of that series which have become due otherwise than by such
declaration of acceleration and any interest thereon at the rate or
rates borne by or provided for in such Securities,

(C) to the extent that payment of such interest is lawful,
interest upon overdue installments of interest at the rate or rates
borne by or provided for in such Securities, and

(D) all sums paid or advanced by the Trustee hereunder and the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel;

and

(2) all Events of Default with respect to Securities of that series,
other than the non-payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or
interest on Securities of that series which have become due solely by such
declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in
Section 513.

No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

Section 503. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee.
--------------------------------------------------------------- 

The Company covenants that if

(1) an Event of Default with respect to any Security of any series
shall occur,

(2) default is made in the payment of any installment of interest, if
any, on any Security of any series and any related coupon when
such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues
for a period of 30 days (whether or not such payment is then
prohibited by Article XVI),
<PAGE>

47

(3) default is made in the payment of the principal of (or premium,
if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof (whether or not
such payment is then prohibited by Article XVI),

(4) default is made in the making or satisfaction of any sinking fund
payment or analogous obligation when the same becomes due
pursuant to the terms of any Security,

(5) default is made in the performance, or breach, of any covenant or
warranty of the Company in this Indenture (other than a covenant
or warranty a default in whose performance or whose breach is
elsewhere in this Section specifically dealt with or which has
expressly been included in this Indenture solely for the benefit
of series of Securities other than that series) and continuance
of such default or breach for a period of 60 days after there has
been given, by registered or certified mail, to the Company by
the Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the Holders of
at least 25% in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of
that series a written notice specifying such default or breach
and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a
"Notice of Default" hereunder, or

(6) any other default provided with respect to a Security of that
series is made (each a "Default"),

the Company will, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the
Holders of such Securities of such series and any related coupons, the whole
amount then due and payable on such Securities and any related coupons for
principal, including any sinking fund payment or analogous obligations (and
premium, if any), and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest
shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal (and premium, if
any) and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates prescribed therefor in
such Securities, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be
sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee,
its agents and counsel.

If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand,
the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a
judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may
prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same
against the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities and collect the
moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of
the property of the Company or any other obligor upon such Securities, wherever
situated.

If a Default with respect to Securities of any series (or all series,
as the case may be) shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee may in its
discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the
Holders of Securities of such series (or all series, as the case may be) and any
related coupons by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall
deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for the
<PAGE>

48

specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of
the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

Section 504. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
-------------------------------- 

In case of the pendency of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation,
bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or other
judicial proceeding relative to the Company or any other obligor upon the
Securities or the property of the Company or of such other obligor or their
creditors, the Trustee (irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities
of any series shall then be due and payable as therein expressed or by
declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee shall have made
any demand on the Company for the payment of overdue principal, premium, if any,
or interest) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding
or otherwise, to take any and all actions authorized under the Trust Indenture
Act in order to have claims of the Holders and the Trustee allowed in any such
proceeding and, in particular: (i) to file and prove a claim for the whole

Securities, such portion of the principal as may be provided for in the terms
thereof) (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, owing and unpaid in respect
of the Securities and to file such other papers or documents as may be necessary

proceeding, and to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or
deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian,
receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator (or other similar
official) in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder of
Securities of such series and coupons to make such payments to the Trustee, and
in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments
directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee and
any predecessor Trustee, their agents and counsel, and any other amounts due to
the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee under Section 606. 

No provision of this Indenture and nothing contained herein shall be
deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on
behalf of any Holder of a Security or coupon any plan of reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or coupons or
the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect
of the claim of any Holder of a Security or coupon in any such proceeding;
provided, however, the Trustee may vote on behalf of the Holders for the
election of a trustee in bankruptcy or similar official and may be a member of a
creditors' or other similar committee.

All rights of action and claims under this Indenture or any of the
Securities or coupons may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the
possession of any of the Securities or coupons or the production thereof in any

shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and any
recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents

------------------- 

No Holder of any Security of any series or any related
coupon shall have any right to institute any proceeding, judicial or
otherwise, with respect to this Indenture, or for the appointment of a

(1) such Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of
a continuing Default with respect to the Securities of that series;

Outstanding Securities of that series shall have made written request to

indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs,

<PAGE>

50

(5) no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given
to the Trustee during such 60-day period by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of that series;

it being understood and intended that no one or more of such Holders shall have
any right in any manner whatever by virtue of, or by availing of, any provision
of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of any other of
such Holders, or to obtain or to seek to obtain priority or preference over any
other of such Holders or to enforce any right under this Indenture, except in
the manner herein provided and for the equal and ratable benefit of all such
Holders.

Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of
any Security or coupon shall have the right, which is absolute and
unconditional, to receive payment of the principal of (and premium, if any, and
Additional Amounts, if any) and (subject to Sections 305 and 307) interest, if
any, on such Security or payment of such coupon on the respective due dates

and such rights shall not be impaired without the consent of such Holder.

Section 509. Restoration of Rights and Remedies.
---------------------------------- 

If the Trustee or any Holder of a Security or coupon has instituted
any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture and such
proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been
determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holder, then and in every such
case, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of Securities and coupons shall,
subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and
respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights and
remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such
proceeding had been instituted.

Section 510. Rights and Remedies Cumulative.
------------------------------ 

Except as otherwise provided with respect to the replacement or
payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities or coupons in the
last paragraph of Section 306, no right or remedy herein conferred upon or
reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders of Securities or coupons is intended
to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every right and remedy shall,
to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in addition to every other
right and remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in
equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or remedy
hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or
employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.
<PAGE>

51

Section 511. Delay or Omission Not Waiver.
---------------------------- 

No delay or omission of the Trustee or of any Holder of any Security
or coupon to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default
shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event
of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this
Article or by law to the Trustee or to the Holders may be exercised from time to
time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders
of Securities or coupons, as the case may be.

with this Indenture,

(2) the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the
Trustee which is not inconsistent with such direction, and

(3) the Trustee need not take any action which might involve it in
personal liability or be unjustly prejudicial to the Holders of Securities

Section 513. Waiver of Past Defaults.
----------------------- 

The Holders of not less than 66 2/3% in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of any series may on behalf of the Holders of all
the Securities of such series and any related coupons waive any past
default hereunder with respect to such series and its consequences, except
a default

(1) in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or
interest, if any, on any Security of such series or any related coupons, or

(2) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof which under Article
Nine cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the Holder of
each Outstanding Security of such series affected.

Upon any such waiver, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event
of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every
purpose of this Indenture; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or
other default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.
<PAGE>

52

Section 514. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws.
-------------------------------- 

The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that
it will not at any time insist upon, or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim
or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay or extension law wherever enacted,
now or at any time hereafter in force, which may affect the covenants or the
performance of this Indenture; and the Company (to the extent that it may
lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such
law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or impede the execution of any
power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and permit the execution of
every such power as though no such law had been enacted.

ARTICLE SIX

The Trustee

Section 601. Notice of Defaults.
------------------ 

Within 90 days after the occurrence of any default hereunder with
respect to the Securities of any series, the Trustee shall transmit in the
manner and to the extent provided in TIA Section 313(c), notice of such default
hereunder known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, unless such default
shall have been cured or waived; provided, however, that, except in the case of
a default in the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest,
if any, on any Security of such series, or in the payment of any sinking or
purchase fund installment with respect to the Securities of such series, the
Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as the
board of directors, the executive committee or a trust committee of directors
and/or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determines that the
withholding of such notice is in the interests of the Holders of the Securities
and coupons of such series; and provided further that in the case of any default
or breach of the character specified in Section 503(4) with respect to the
Securities and coupons of such series, no such notice to Holders shall be given
until at least 60 days after the occurrence thereof. For the purpose of this
Section, the term "default" means any event which is, or after notice or lapse
of time or both would become, a Default with respect to the Securities of such
series.

Section 602. Certain Rights of Trustee.
------------------------- 

Subject to the provisions of TIA Section 315(a) through 315(d):

parties;

which shall be sufficiently evidenced as provided therein) and any
resolution of the Board of Directors may be sufficiently evidenced by a
Board Resolution;

(c) whenever in the administration of this Indenture the Trustee
shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to

other evidence be herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of
bad faith on its part, rely upon a Board Resolution, an Opinion of Counsel
or an Officers' Certificate; 

(d) the Trustee may consult with counsel and the advice of such
counsel (confirmed in writing) or any Opinion of Counsel shall be full and
complete authorization and protection in respect of any action taken,
suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in reliance thereon;

(e) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request or direction
of any of the Holders of Securities of any series or any related coupons

Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the
costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred by it in compliance
with such request or direction;

(f) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into the
facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order,
bond, debenture, note, coupon or other paper or document, but the Trustee,
in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such
facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to
make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine
the books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or
attorney;

such agent, attorney, custodian or nominee appointed with due care by it
hereunder; and

(h) the Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or
omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or within
the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this Indenture.

The Trustee shall not be required to expend or risk its own funds or
otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties
hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have
reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate
indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.
<PAGE>

54

The rights and protections afforded to the Trustee by this Indenture
shall also be afforded to it to the extent applicable in its capacity as Paying
Agent, Security Registrar and Exchange Rate Agent, as the case may be.

Section 603. Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Securities.
------------------------------------------------------ 

The recitals contained herein and in the Securities, except the
Trustee's certificate of authentication, and in any coupons shall be taken as
the statements of the Company, and neither the Trustee nor any Authenticating
Agent assumes any responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no
representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the
Securities or coupons, except that the Trustee represents that it is duly
authorized to execute and deliver this Indenture, authenticate the Securities
and perform its obligations hereunder and that the statements made by it in a
Statement of Eligibility on Form T-1 supplied to the Company are true and
accurate, subject to the qualifications set forth therein. Neither the Trustee
nor any Authenticating Agent shall be accountable for the use or application by
the Company of Securities or the proceeds thereof.

Section 604. May Hold Securities.
------------------- 

The Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, Paying Agent, Security
Registrar or other agent of the Company, in its individual or any other
capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and coupons and, subject
to TIA Sections 310(b) and 311, may otherwise deal with the Company with the
same rights it would have if it were not Trustee, Authenticating Agent, Paying
Agent, Security Registrar or such other agent.

Section 605. Money Held in Trust.
------------------- 

Money held by the Trustee in trust hereunder need not be segregated
from other funds except to the extent required by law. The Trustee shall be
under no liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as
otherwise agreed with the Company.

Section 606. Compensation and Reimbursement.
------------------------------ 

The Company agrees:

(1) to pay to the Trustee from time to time such compensation for all
services rendered by it hereunder as has been agreed upon in writing (which
compensation shall not be limited by any provision of law in regard to the
compensation of a trustee of an express trust);

(2) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse each
of the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee upon its request for all
reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by the
Trustee in accordance with any provision of this Indenture (including the
reasonable compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents
and counsel),
<PAGE>

55

except to the extent any such expense, disbursement or advance may be
attributable to its negligence or bad faith; and

(3) to indemnify each of the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee (and
its officers, directors, employees and agents) for, and to hold it harmless
against, any loss, liability or expense incurred without negligence or bad
faith on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the trust or trusts hereunder, including the costs and
expenses of defending itself against any claim or liability in connection
with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder,
except to the extent any such loss, liability or expense may be
attributable to its negligence or bad faith.

As security for the performance of the obligations of the Company
under this Section, the Trustee shall have a claim prior to the Securities upon
all property and funds held or collected by the Trustee as such, except funds
held in trust for the payment of principal of (and premium, if any) or interest,
if any, on particular Securities or coupons.

The Company's payment obligations pursuant to this Section shall
survive the discharge of this Indenture. When the Trustee incurs expenses after
the occurrence of an Event of Default specified in Section 501(1) or (2) with
respect to the Company, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of
administration under the Federal Bankruptcy Code.

Section 607. Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility.
--------------------------------------- 

There shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder which shall be
eligible to act as Trustee under TIA Section 310(a)(1) and shall have a combined
capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000. If such Person publishes reports
of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of
Federal, State, Territorial or District of Columbia supervising or examining
authority, then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and
surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as
set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time
the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this
Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect
hereinafter specified in this Article.

Section 608. Resignation and Removal; Appointment of Successor.
------------------------------------------------- 

(a) No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no appointment of a
successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the
acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee in accordance with the
applicable requirements of Section 609.

(b) The Trustee may resign at any time with respect to the Securities
of one or more series by giving written notice thereof to the Company. If an
instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been delivered to
the Trustee within 30
<PAGE>

56

days after the giving of such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor
Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.

(c) The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect to the
Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount
of the Outstanding Securities of such series, delivered to the Trustee and to
the Company.

(d) If at any time:

(1) the Trustee shall fail to comply with the provisions of TIA
Section 310(b) after written request therefor by the Company or by any
Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at
least six months, or

(2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible under Section 607(a) and
shall fail to resign after written request therefor by the Company or by
any Holder of a Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for
at least six months, or

(3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting or shall be adjudged
a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property
shall be appointed or any public officer shall take charge or control of
the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of
rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,

then, in any such case, (i) the Company by or pursuant to a Board Resolution may
remove the Trustee and appoint a successor Trustee with respect to all
securities, or (ii) subject to TIA Section 315(e), any Holder of a Security who
has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf
of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities and
the appointment of a successor Trustee or Trustees.

(e) If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become incapable of
acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause with
respect to the Securities of one or more series, the Company, by or pursuant to
a Board Resolution, shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with
respect to the Securities of that or those series (it being understood that any
such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or
more or all of such series and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee
with respect to the Securities of any particular series). If, within one year
after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of such
vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall
be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Company and the retiring
Trustee, the successor Trustee so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance
of such appointment, become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities
of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed by
the Company. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any
series shall have been so appointed by the Company or the Holders of Securities
and accepted appointment in the manner hereinafter provided, any Holder of a
Security who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security of such series for at
least six
<PAGE>

57

months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any
court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee with
respect to the Securities of such series.

(f) The Company shall give notice of each resignation and each
removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each
appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series
in the manner provided for notices to the Holders of Securities in Section 106.
Each notice shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the
Securities of such series and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.

Section 609. Acceptance of Appointment by Successor.
-------------------------------------- 

(a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with
respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Company and to the retiring Trustee an
instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal
of the retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee,
without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request
of the Company or the successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall, upon
payment of all amounts owed to it pursuant to this Indenture, execute and
deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the rights,
powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee, and shall duly assign, transfer and
deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money held by such retiring
Trustee hereunder, subject nevertheless to its claim, if any, provided for in
Section 606. The retiring Trustee shall have no liability for any acts or
omissions of any successor Trustee.

(b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor Trustee with
respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Company, the
retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of
one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto
wherein each successor Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall
contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and
confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers,
trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that
or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2)
if the retiring Trustee is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall
contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm
that all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with
respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which the retiring
Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and
(3) shall add to or change any of the provisions of this Indenture as shall be
necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts
hereunder by more than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or
in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees of the
same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts
hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by
any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental
indenture the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become
effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee,
<PAGE>

58

without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the
rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the
Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor
Trustee relates; but, on request of the Company or any successor Trustee, such
retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of all amounts owed to it pursuant to this
Indenture, duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all
property and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the
Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor
Trustee relates.

(c) Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the Company shall
execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and
confirming to such successor Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred
to in paragraph (a) and (b) of this Section, as the case may be.

(d) No successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the
time of such acceptance such successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible
under this Article.

Section 610. Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business.
----------------------------------------------------------- 

Any corporation into which the Trustee may be merged or converted or
with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any
corporation succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business
of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder, provided such
corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this Article,
without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of
any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities or coupons shall have been
authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor
by merger, conversion or consolidation to such authenticating Trustee may adopt
such authentication and deliver the Securities or coupons so authenticated with
the same effect as if such successor Trustee had itself authenticated such
Securities. In case any Securities or coupons shall not have been authenticated
by such predecessor Trustee, any such successor Trustee may authenticate and
deliver such Securities or coupons, in either its own name or that of its
predecessor Trustee, with the full force and effect which this Indenture
provides for the certificate of authentication of the Trustee.

Section 611. Appointment of Authenticating Agent.
----------------------------------- 

At any time when any of the Securities remain Outstanding, the Trustee
may appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series
of Securities which shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to
authenticate Securities of such series issued upon original issue and upon
exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof or pursuant to
Section 306, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits
of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if
authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Any such appointment shall be evidenced
by an instrument in writing signed by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, a
copy of which instrument shall be promptly furnished to the
<PAGE>

59

Company. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and
delivery of Securities by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of
authentication, such reference shall be deemed to include authentication and
delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate
of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent.
Each Authenticating Agent shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company and,
except as may otherwise be provided pursuant to Section 301, shall at all times
be a bank or trust company or corporation organized and doing business and in
good standing under the laws of the United States of America, any State thereof
or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating
Agent, having a combined capital and surplus of not less than $50,000,000 and
subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authorities. If such
Authenticating Agent publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant
to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority, then
for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such
Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as
set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time
an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately
in the manner and with the effect specified in this Section.

Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which such Authenticating Agent
shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or
corporate trust business of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an
Authenticating Agent, provided such corporation shall be otherwise eligible
under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent.

An Authenticating Agent for any series of Securities may resign at any
time by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee for such series and
to the Company. The Trustee for any series of Securities may at any time
terminate the agency of an Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of
termination to such Authenticating Agent and to the Company. Upon receiving
such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or in case at any time
such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
provisions of this Section, the Trustee for such series may appoint a successor
Authenticating Agent which shall be acceptable to the Company and shall give
notice of such appointment to all Holders of Securities of the series with
respect to which such Authenticating Agent will serve in the manner set forth in
Section 106. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its
appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties
of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an
Authenticating Agent herein. No successor Authenticating Agent shall be
appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.

The Company agrees to pay to each Authenticating Agent from time to
time reasonable compensation including reimbursement of its reasonable expenses
for its services under this Section.

to this Section, the Securities of such series may have endorsed thereon, in
addition to or in lieu of the Trustee's certificate of authentication, an

such supplemental indenture shall, without the consent of the Holder of each
Outstanding Security of such series affected thereby,

(1) change the Stated Maturity of the principal of (or premium, if
any, on), or any installment of principal of or interest on, any Security;
or reduce the principal amount thereof or the rate of interest thereon, or
any premium payable upon the redemption thereof, or change any obligation

other provision of this Indenture which has expressly been included solely for
the benefit of one or more particular series of Securities, or which modifies
the rights of the Holders of Securities of such series with respect to such
covenant or other provision, shall be deemed not to affect the rights under this

Amounts, if any, payable as provided in Section 1004 in respect of principal of
(or premium, if any, on) such a Security, shall be payable only upon

respect to any series of Securities, any interest due on Bearer Securities on or
before Maturity shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of the
several coupons for such interest installments as are evidenced thereby as they
severally mature.

Section 1002. Maintenance of Office or Agency.
------------------------------- 

If Securities of a series are issuable only as Registered Securities,
the Company shall maintain in each Place of Payment for any series of Securities
an office or agency where Securities of that series may be presented or
surrendered for payment, where Securities of that series may be surrendered for
registration of transfer or exchange, where Securities of that series that are
convertible or exchangeable may be surrendered for conversion, and where notices
and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series
and this Indenture may be served. If Securities of a series are issuable as
Bearer Securities, the Company will maintain (A) in the Borough of Manhattan,
The City of New York, an office or agency where any Registered Securities of
that series may be presented or surrendered for payment, where any Registered
Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange, where Securities of that series that are convertible or exchangeable
may be surrendered for conversion or exchange, as applicable, where notices and
demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and

described in the following paragraph (and not otherwise), (B) subject to any
laws or regulations applicable thereto, in a Place of Payment for that series
which is located outside the United States, an office or agency where Securities
of that series and related coupons may be presented and surrendered for payment;
provided, however, that if the Securities of that series are listed on the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange or any other stock exchange located outside the United
States and such stock exchange shall so require, the Company will maintain a
Paying Agent for the Securities of that series in Luxembourg or any other
required city located outside the United States, as the case may be, so long as
the Securities of that series are listed on such exchange, and (C) subject to
any laws or regulations applicable thereto, in a Place of Payment for that
series located outside the United States an office or agency where any
Registered Securities of that series may be surrendered for registration of
transfer or exchange, where Securities of that series that are convertible or
exchangeable may be surrendered for conversion or exchange, as applicable, and
where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of
that series and this Indenture may be served. The Company will give prompt
written notice to the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location,
of each such office or agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to
maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee
with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands
may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, except that
Bearer Securities of that series and the related coupons may be presented and
surrendered for payment at the offices specified in the Security, in London,
England, and the Company hereby appoints the same as its agent to receive such
respective presentations,
<PAGE>

68

surrenders, notices and demands, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee its
agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands.

Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities pursuant to
Section 301, no payment of principal, premium or interest on Bearer Securities
shall be made at any office or agency of the Company in the United States or by
check mailed to any address in the United States or by transfer to an account
maintained with a bank located in the United States; provided, however, that, if
the Securities of a series are payable in Dollars, payment of principal of (and
premium, if any) and interest, if any, on any Bearer Security shall be made at
the office of the Company's Paying Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, The City
of New York, if (but only if) payment in Dollars of the full amount of such
principal, premium or interest, as the case may be, at all offices or agencies
outside the United States maintained for such purpose by the Company in
accordance with this Indenture, is illegal or effectively precluded by exchange
controls or other similar restrictions.

The Company may from time to time designate one or more other offices
or agencies where the Securities of one or more series may be presented or
surrendered for any or all of such purposes, and may from time to time rescind
such designations; provided, however, that no such designation or rescission
shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain an office
or agency in accordance with the requirements set forth above for Securities of
any series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to
the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and of any change in the
location of any such other office or agency. Unless otherwise specified with
respect to any Securities pursuant to Section 301 with respect to a series of
Securities, the Company hereby designates as Places of Payment for each series
of Securities the office or agency of the Company in the Borough of Manhattan,
The City of New York, and initially appoints the Trustee at its Corporate Trust
Office in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York as Paying Agent in each
such city and as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders,
notices and demands.

Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Securities pursuant to
Section 301, if and so long as the Securities of any series (i) are denominated
in a currency other than Dollars or (ii) may be payable in a currency other than
Dollars, or so long as it is required under any other provision of the
Indenture, then the Company will maintain with respect to each such series of
Securities, or as so required, at least one Exchange Rate Agent.

Section 1003. Money for Securities Payments to Be Held in Trust .
------------------------------------------------- 

If the Company shall at any time act as its own Paying Agent with
respect to any series of any Securities and any related coupons, it will, on or
before each due date of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if
any, on any of the Securities of that series, segregate and hold in trust for
the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto a sum in the currency or currencies,
currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the
Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to
Section 301 for the Securities of such series and except, if applicable, as
provided in
<PAGE>

69

Sections 312(b), 312(d) and 312(e)) sufficient to pay the principal of (and
premium, if any) and interest, if any, on Securities of such series so becoming
due until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as
herein provided, and will promptly notify the Trustee of its action or failure
so to act.

Whenever the Company shall have one or more Paying Agents for any
series of Securities and any related coupons, it will, prior to each due date of
the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, on any Securities of
that series, deposit with a Paying Agent a sum (in the currency or currencies,
currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies described in the
preceding paragraph) sufficient to pay the principal (or premium, if any) or
interest, if any, so becoming due, such sum to be held in trust for the benefit
of the Persons entitled to such principal, premium or interest and (unless such
Paying Agent is the Trustee) the Company will promptly notify the Trustee of its
action or failure so to act.

The Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or
by Company Order direct any Paying Agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in
trust by the Company or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee
upon the same trusts as those upon which such sums were held by the Company or
such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee,
such Paying Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to
such sums.

Except, as otherwise provided in the Securities of any series, any
money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent, or then held by the
Company, in trust for the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or
interest, if any, on any Security of any series and remaining unclaimed for two
years after such principal, premium or interest has become due and payable shall
be paid to the Company on Company Request, or (if then held by the Company)
shall be discharged from such trust; and the Holder of such Security shall
thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Company for
payment of such principal, premium or interest on any Security, without interest
thereon, and all liability of the Trustee or such Paying Agent with respect to
such trust money, and all liability of the Company as trustee thereof, shall
thereupon cease; provided, however, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent,
before being required to make any such repayment, may at the expense of the
Company cause to be published once, in an Authorized Newspaper, notice that such
money remains unclaimed and that, after a date specified therein, which shall
not be less than 30 days from the date of such publication, any unclaimed
balance of such money then remaining will be repaid to the Company.

Section 1004. Additional Amounts.
------------------ 

If any Securities of a series provide for the payment of Additional
Amounts, the Company will pay to the Holder of any Security of such series or
any coupon appertaining thereto Additional Amounts as may be specified as
contemplated by Section 301. Whenever in this Indenture there is mentioned, in
any context, the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest,
if any, on any Security of any series
<PAGE>

70

or payment of any related coupon or the net proceeds received on the sale or
exchange of any Security of any series, such mention shall be deemed to include
mention of the payment of Additional Amounts provided by the terms of such
series established pursuant to Section 301 to the extent that, in such context,
Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to
such terms and express mention of the payment of Additional Amounts (if
applicable) in any provisions hereof shall not be construed as excluding
Additional Amounts in those provisions hereof where such express mention is not
made.

Except as otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, if the
Securities of a series provide for the payment of Additional Amounts, at least
10 days prior to the first Interest Payment Date with respect to that series of
Securities (or if the Securities of that series will not bear interest prior to
Maturity, the first day on which a payment of principal and any premium is
made), and at least 10 days prior to each date of payment of principal, premium
or interest if there has been any change with respect to the matters set forth
in the below-mentioned Officers' Certificate, the Company will furnish the
Trustee and the Company's principal Paying Agent or Paying Agents, if other than
the Trustee, with an Officers' Certificate instructing the Trustee and such
Paying Agent or Paying Agents whether such payment of principal, premium or
interest on the Securities of that series shall be made to Holders of Securities
of that series or any related coupons who are not United States persons without
withholding for or on account of any tax, assessment or other governmental
charge described in the Securities of the series. If any such withholding shall
be required, then such Officers' Certificate shall specify by country the
amount, if any, required to be withheld on such payments to such Holders of
Securities of that series or related coupons and the Company will pay to the
Trustee or such Paying Agent the Additional Amounts required by the terms of
such Securities. In the event that the Trustee or any Paying Agent, as the case
may be, shall not so receive the above-mentioned certificate, then the Trustee
or such Paying Agent shall be entitled (i) to assume that no such withholding or
deduction is required with respect to any payment of principal or interest with
respect to any Securities of a series or related coupons until it shall have
received a certificate advising otherwise and (ii) to make all payments of
principal and interest with respect to the Securities of a series or related
coupons without withholding or deductions until otherwise advised. The Company
covenants to indemnify the Trustee and any Paying Agent for, and to hold them
harmless against, any loss, liability or expense reasonably incurred without
negligence or bad faith on their part arising out of or in connection with
actions taken or omitted by any of them in reliance on any Officers' Certificate
furnished pursuant to this Section or in reliance on the Company's not
furnishing such an Officers' Certificate.

Section 1005. Statement by Officers as to Default.
----------------------------------- 

The Company will deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the end
of each fiscal year of the Company ending after the date hereof, an Officers'
Certificate, stating whether to the best knowledge of the signers thereof the
Company is in default in the performance and observance of any of the conditions
or covenants of this Indenture (without regard to any period of grace or
requirement of notice provided hereunder) and,
<PAGE>

if the Company shall be in default, specifying all such defaults and the nature
and status thereof of which they may have knowledge.

Section 1006. Existence.

Subject to Article Eight, the Company will do or cause to be done all
things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence,
rights (charter and statutory) and franchises; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be required to preserve any such right or franchise if the
Board of Directors shall determine that the preservation thereof is no longer
desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and that the loss
thereof is not disadvantageous in any material respect to the Holders.

Section 1007. Maintenance of Properties.
------------------------- 

The Company will cause all properties used or useful in the conduct of
its business or the business of any Subsidiary to be maintained and kept in good
condition, repair and working order and supplied with all necessary equipment
and will cause to be made all necessary repairs, renewals, replacements,
betterments and improvements thereof, all as in the judgment of the Company may
be necessary so that the business carried on in connection therewith may be
properly and advantageously conducted at all times; provided, however, that
nothing in this Section shall prevent the Company from discontinuing the
operation or maintenance of any of such properties if such discontinuance is, in
the judgment of the Company, desirable in the conduct of its business or the
business of any Subsidiary and not disadvantageous in any material respect to
the Holders.

Section 1008. Payment of Taxes and Other Claims.
--------------------------------- 

The Company will pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged,
before the same shall become delinquent, (1) all taxes, assessments and
governmental charges levied or imposed upon the Company or any Subsidiary or
upon the income, profits or property of the Company or any Subsidiary, and (2)
all lawful claims for labor, materials and supplies which, if unpaid, might by
law become a lien upon the property of the Company or any Subsidiary; provided,
however, that the Company shall not be required to pay or discharge or cause to
be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim whose amount,
applicability or validity is being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings.

Section 1009. Waiver of Certain Covenants.
--------------------------- 

The Company may, with respect to any series of Securities, omit in any
particular instance to comply with any term, provision or condition which
affects such series set forth in Sections 1007 and 1008, and, as specified
pursuant to Section 301(15) for Securities of any series, in any covenants of
the Company added to Article Ten pursuant to Section 301(14) or Section 301(15),
in connection with Securities of a series if before the time for such compliance
the Holders of at least 66-2/3% in principal amount of all Outstanding
Securities of any series, by Act of such Holders, waive such

compliance in such instance with such term, provision or condition, but no such
waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the
extent so expressly waived, and, until such waiver shall become effective, the
obligations of the Company and the duties of the Trustee to Holders of
Securities of such series in respect of any such term, provision or condition
shall remain in full force and effect.

ARTICLE ELEVEN

Redemption of Securities

Section 1101. Applicability of Article.
------------------------ 

Securities of any series which are redeemable before their Stated
Maturity shall be redeemable in accordance with their terms and (except as
otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of any series)
in accordance with this Article.

Section 1102. Election to Redeem; Notice to Trustee.
------------------------------------- 

The election of the Company to redeem any Securities shall be
evidenced by or pursuant to a Board Resolution. In case of any redemption at
the election of the Company of less than all the Securities of any series, the
Company shall, at least 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the
Company (unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify
the Trustee of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Securities of
such series to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior
to the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of
such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the
Trustee with an Officers' Certificate evidencing compliance with such
restriction.

Section 1103. Selection by Trustee of Securities to Be Redeemed.
------------------------------------------------- 

If less than all the Securities of any series issued on the same day
with the same terms are to be redeemed (unless all of the Securities of such
series and of a specified tenor are to be redeemed), the particular Securities
to be redeemed shall be selected in accordance with the terms of such Securities
but, if not specified, shall be selected not more than 60 days prior to the
Redemption Date by the Trustee, from the Outstanding Securities of such series
issued on such date with the same terms not previously called for redemption, by
the Trustee in its customary manner which may provide for the selection for
redemption of portions (equal to the minimum authorized denomination for
Securities of that series or any integral multiple thereof) of the principal
amount of securities of such series of a denomination larger than the minimum
authorized denomination for Securities of that series.

The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company and the Security
Registrar (if other than itself) in writing of the Securities selected for
redemption and, in the case of
<PAGE>

73

any Securities selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to
be redeemed.

For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise
requires, all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate,
in the case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the
portion of the principal amount of such Securities which has been or is to be
redeemed.

Section 1104. Notice of Redemption.
-------------------- 

Notice of redemption shall be given in the manner provided in Section
106, not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date,
unless a shorter period is specified by the terms of such series established
pursuant to Section 301, to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed, but
failure to give such notice in the manner herein provided to the Holder of any
Security designated for redemption as a whole or in part, or any defect in the
notice to any such Holder, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for
the redemption of any other such Security or portion thereof.

Any notice that is mailed to the Holders of Registered Securities in
the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly
given, whether or not the Holder receives the notice.

All notices of redemption shall state:

(l) the Redemption Date,

(2) the Redemption Price and accrued interest to the Redemption Date
payable as provided in Section 1106, if any,

(3) if less than all Outstanding Securities of any series are to be
redeemed, the identification (and, in the case of partial redemption, the
principal amounts) of the particular Security or Securities to be redeemed,

(4) in case any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice
which relates to such Security shall state that on and after the Redemption
Date, upon surrender of such Security, the holder will receive, without a
charge, a new Security or Securities of authorized denominations for the
principal amount thereof remaining unredeemed,

(5) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price and accrued
interest to the Redemption Date payable as provided in Section 1106, if
any, will become due and payable upon each such Security, or the portion
thereof, to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will
cease to accrue on and after said date,

(6) the Place or Places of Payment where such Securities, together in
the case of Bearer Securities with all coupons appertaining thereto, if
any,
<PAGE>

74

maturing after the Redemption Date, are to be surrendered for payment of
the Redemption Price and accrued interest, if any,

(7) that the redemption is for a sinking fund, if such is the case,

(8) that, unless otherwise specified in such notice, Bearer
Securities of any series, if any, surrendered for redemption must be
accompanied by all coupons maturing subsequent to the date fixed for
redemption or the amount of any such missing coupon or coupons will be
deducted from the Redemption Price, unless security or indemnity
satisfactory to the Company, the Trustee for such series and any Paying
Agent is furnished,

(9) if Bearer Securities of any series are to be redeemed and any
Registered Securities of such series are not to be redeemed, and if such
Bearer Securities may be exchanged for Registered Securities not subject to
redemption on this Redemption Date pursuant to Section 305 or otherwise,
the last date, as determined by the Company, on which such exchanges may be
made, and

(10) the CUSIP number of such Security, if any.

Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of
the Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's request, by the
Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company and shall be irrevocable.

Section 1105. Deposit of Redemption Price.
--------------------------- 

Prior to any Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the
Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying
Agent, which it may not do in the case of a sinking fund payment under Article
Twelve, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of
money in the currency or currencies, currency unit or units or composite
currency or currencies in which the Securities of such series are payable
(except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for the Securities of
such series and except, if applicable, as provided in Sections 312(b), 312(d)
and 312(e)) sufficient to pay on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price of,
and (except if the Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued
interest on, all the Securities or portions thereof which are to be redeemed on
that date.

Section 1106. Securities Payable on Redemption Date.
------------------------------------- 

Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid, the Securities so
to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the
Redemption Price therein specified in the currency or currencies, currency unit
or units or composite currency or currencies in which the Securities of such
series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301 for
the Securities of such series and except, if applicable, as provided in Sections
312(b), 312(d) and 312(e)) (together with accrued interest, if any, to the
Redemption Date), and from and after such date (unless the Company shall default
in the payment of the Redemption Price and accrued interest) such
<PAGE>

75

Securities shall if the same were interest-bearing cease to bear interest and
the coupons for such interest appertaining to any Bearer Securities so to be
redeemed, except to the extent provided below, shall be void. Upon surrender of
any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, together with
all coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing after the Redemption Date,
such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption Price, together
with accrued interest, if any, to the Redemption Date; provided, however, that
installments of interest on Bearer Securities whose Stated Maturity is on or
prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable only at an office or agency
located outside the United States (except as otherwise provided in Section 1002)
and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, only upon
presentation and surrender of coupons for such interest, and provided further
that installments of interest on Registered Securities whose Stated Maturity is
on or prior to the Redemption Date shall be payable to the Holders of such
Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the
close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the
provisions of Section 307.

If any Bearer Security surrendered for redemption shall not be
accompanied by all appurtenant coupons maturing after the Redemption Date, such
Security may be paid after deducting from the Redemption Price an amount equal
to the face amount of all such missing coupons, or the surrender of such missing
coupon or coupons may be waived by the Company and the Trustee if there be
furnished to them such security or indemnity as they may require to save each of
them and any Paying Agent harmless. If thereafter the Holder of such Security
shall surrender to the Trustee or any Paying Agent any such missing coupon in
respect of which a deduction shall have been made from the Redemption Price,
such Holder shall be entitled to receive the amount so deducted; provided,
however, that interest represented by coupons shall be payable only at an office
or agency located outside the United States (except as otherwise provided in
Section 1002) and, unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301,
only upon presentation and surrender of those coupons.

If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon
surrender thereof for redemption, the Redemption Price shall, until paid, bear 
interest from the Redemption Date at the rate of interest set forth in such 
Security or, in the case of an Orginal Issue Discount Security, at the Yield to 
Maturity of such Security. 

Section 1107. Securities Redeemed in Part.
--------------------------- 

Any Registered Security which is to be redeemed only in part (pursuant
to the provisions of this Article or of Article Twelve) shall be surrendered at
a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires,
due endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the Company and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney
duly authorized in writing) and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service
charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series, of any authorized
denomination as requested by such Holder, in aggregate principal amount equal to
and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so
surrendered.

ARTICLE TWELVE

Sinking Funds

Section 1201. Applicability of Article.
------------------------ 

The provisions of this Article shall be applicable to any sinking fund
for the retirement of Securities of a series except as otherwise specified as
contemplated by Section 301 for Securities of such series.

The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the
terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a "mandatory sinking
fund payment", and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by
the terms of such Securities of any series is herein referred to as an "optional
sinking fund payment". If provided for by the terms of Securities of any
series, the cash amount of any mandatory sinking fund payment may be subject to
reduction as provided in Section 1202. Each sinking fund payment shall be
applied to the redemption of Securities of any series as provided for by the
terms of Securities of such series.

Section 1202. Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.
----------------------------------------------------- 

The Company may, in satisfaction of all or any part of any mandatory
sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of a series, (1) deliver
Outstanding Securities of such series (other than any previously called for
redemption) together in the case of any Bearer Securities of such series with
all unmatured coupons appertaining thereto and (2) apply as a credit Securities
of such series which have been redeemed either at the election of the Company
pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted
optional sinking fund payments pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each
case in satisfaction of all or any part of any mandatory sinking fund payment
with respect to the Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to
the terms of such Securities as provided for by the terms of such series;
provided that such Securities so delivered or applied as a credit have not been
previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such
purpose by the Trustee at the applicable Redemption Price specified in such
Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount
of such mandatory sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.

Section 1203. Redemption of Securities for Sinking Fund.
----------------------------------------- 

Not less than 60 days prior to each sinking fund payment date for
Securities of any series, the Company will deliver to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for
that series pursuant to the terms of that series, the portion hereof, if any,
which is to be satisfied by payment of cash in the currency or currencies,
currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the
Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to
Section 301 for the Securities of such series and except, if applicable, as
provided in Sections 312(b), 312(d) and 312(e)) and the portion thereof, if any,
which is to be
<PAGE>

77

satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that series pursuant to
Section 1202, and the optional amount, if any, to be added in cash to the next
ensuing mandatory sinking fund payment, and will also deliver to the Trustee any
Securities to be so delivered and credited. If such Officers' Certificate shall
specify an optional amount to be added in cash to the next ensuing mandatory
sinking fund payment, the Company shall thereupon be obligated to pay the amount
therein specified. Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment
date the Trustee shall select the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking
fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 1103 and cause notice of
the redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the
Company in the manner provided in Section 1104. Such notice having been duly
given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the
manner stated in Sections 1106 and 1107.

ARTICLE THIRTEEN

Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance

Section 1301. Applicability of Article; Company's Option to Effect Defeasance or
------------------------------------------------------------------
Covenant Defeasance.
------------------- 

If pursuant to Section 301 provision is made for either or both of (a)
defeasance of the Securities of or within a series under Section 1302 or (b)
covenant defeasance of the Securities of or within a series under Section 1303,
then the provisions of such Section or Sections, as the case may be, together
with the other provisions of this Article (with such modifications thereto as
may be specified pursuant to Section 301 with respect to any Securities), shall
be applicable to such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, and the
Company may at its option by Board Resolution, at any time, with respect to such
Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, elect to have Section 1302 (if
applicable) or Section 1303 (if applicable) be applied to such Outstanding
Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto upon compliance with the
conditions set forth below in this Article.

Section 1302. Defeasance and Discharge.
------------------------ 

Upon the Company's exercise of the above option applicable to this
Section with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Company shall
be deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to such
Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto on the date the
conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter, "defeasance").
For this purpose, such defeasance means that the Company shall be deemed to have
paid and discharged the entire indebtedness represented by such Outstanding
Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, which shall thereafter be
deemed to be "Outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 1305 and the other
Sections of this Indenture referred to in clauses (A) and (B) of this Section,
and to have satisfied all its other obligations under such Securities and any
coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture insofar as such Securities and
any coupons appertaining thereto are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense
of the Company, shall execute proper
<PAGE>

78

instruments acknowledging the same), except for the following which shall
survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (A) the rights of
Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto to
receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 1304 and as more fully
set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of (and premium,
if any) and interest, if any, on such Securities and any coupons appertaining
thereto when such payments are due, (B) the Company's obligations with respect
to such Securities under Sections 305, 306, 1002 and 1003 and with respect to
the payment of Additional Amounts, if any, on such Securities as contemplated by
Section 1004, (C) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the
Trustee hereunder and (D) this Article. Subject to compliance with this Article
Thirteen, the Company may exercise its option under this Section notwithstanding
the prior exercise of its option under Section 1303 with respect to such
Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto.

Section 1303. Covenant Defeasance.
------------------- 

Upon the Company's exercise of the above option applicable to this
Section with respect to any Securities of or within a series, the Company shall
be released from its obligations under Sections 1004 and 1005, and, if specified
pursuant to Section 301, its obligations under any other covenant, with respect
to such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto on and after
the date the conditions set forth in Section 1304 are satisfied (hereinafter,
"covenant defeasance"), and such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto
shall thereafter be deemed to be not "Outstanding" for the purposes of any
direction, waiver, consent or declaration or Act of Holders (and the
consequences of any thereof) in connection with Sections 1004 and 1005, or such
other covenant, but shall continue to be deemed "Outstanding" for all other
purposes hereunder. For this purpose, such covenant defeasance means that, with
respect to such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto, the
Company may omit to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any
term, condition or limitation set forth in any such Section or such other
covenant, whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere
herein to any such Section or such other covenant or by reason of reference in
any such Section or such other covenant to any other provision herein or in any
other document and such omission to comply shall not constitute a default or a
Default under Section 503(4) or otherwise, as the case may be, but, except as
specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such Securities and any
coupons appertaining thereto shall be unaffected thereby.

Section 1304. Conditions to Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
----------------------------------------------- 

The following shall be the conditions to application of Section 1302
or Section 1303 to any Outstanding Securities of or within a series and any
coupons appertaining thereto:

(a) The Company shall irrevocably have deposited or caused to be
deposited with the Trustee (or another trustee satisfying the requirements
of Section 607 who shall agree to comply with the provisions of this
Article Thirteen applicable to it) as trust funds in trust for the purpose
of making the following
<PAGE>

79

payments, specifically pledged as security for, and dedicated solely to,
the benefit of the Holders of such Securities and any coupons appertaining
thereto, (1) an amount (in such currency, currencies or currency unit in
which such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto are then
specified as payable at Stated Maturity), or (2) Government Obligations
applicable to such Securities and coupons appertaining thereto (determined
on the basis of the currency, currencies or currency unit in which such
Securities and coupons appertaining thereto are then specified as payable
at Stated Maturity) which through the scheduled payment of principal and
interest in respect thereof in accordance with their terms will provide,
not later than one day before the due date of any payment of principal of
(and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on such Securities and any
coupons appertaining thereto, money in an amount, or (3) a combination
thereof in an amount, sufficient, in the opinion of a nationally recognized
firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification
thereof delivered to the Trustee, to pay and discharge, and which shall be
applied by the Trustee (or other qualifying trustee) to pay and discharge,
(i) the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on such
Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto on the Stated
Maturity of such principal or installment of principal or interest and (ii)
any mandatory sinking fund payments or analogous payments applicable to
such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto on the day
on which such payments are due and payable in accordance with the terms of
this Indenture and of such Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto.

(b) Such defeasance or covenant defeasance shall not result in a
breach or violation of, or constitute a default under, this Indenture or
any other material agreement or instrument to which the Company is a party
or by which it is bound.

(c) No Event of Default or event which with notice or lapse of time
or both would become an Event of Default with respect to such Securities
and any coupons appertaining thereto shall have occurred and be continuing
on the date of such deposit.

(d) In the case of an election under Section 1302, the Company shall
have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel stating that (i) the
Company has received from, or there has been published by, the Internal
Revenue Service a ruling, or (ii) since the date of execution of this
Indenture, there has been a change in the applicable Federal income tax
law, in either case to the effect that, and based thereon such opinion
shall confirm that, the Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any
coupons appertaining thereto will not recognize income, gain or loss for
Federal income tax purposes as a result of such defeasance and will be
subject to Federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and
at the same times as would have been the case if such defeasance had not
occurred.

(e) In the case of an election under Section 1303, the Company shall
have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the
Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any coupons appertaining thereto
will not recognize income, gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as
a result of such
<PAGE>

80

covenant defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same
amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the
case if such covenant defeasance had not occurred.

(f) The Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating that all conditions
precedent to the defeasance under Section 1302 or the covenant defeasance
under Section 1303 (as the case may be) have been complied with and an
Opinion of Counsel to the effect that either (i) as a result of a deposit
pursuant to subsection (a) above and the related exercise of the Company's
option under Section 1302 or Section 1303 (as the case may be),
registration is not required under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, by the Company, with respect to the trust funds representing such
deposit or by the trustee for such trust funds or (ii) all necessary
registrations under said Act have been effected.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section, such
defeasance or covenant defeasance shall be effected in compliance with any
additional or substitute terms, conditions or limitations which may be
imposed on the Company in connection therewith pursuant to Section 301.

Section 1305. Deposited Money and Government Obligations to Be Held in Trust;
---------------------------------------------------------------
Other Miscellaneous Provisions.
------------------------------ 

Subject to the provisions of the last paragraph of Section 1003, all
money and Government Obligations (or other property as may be provided pursuant
to Section 301) (including the proceeds thereof) deposited with the Trustee (or
other qualifying trustee, collectively for purposes of this Section 1305, the
"Trustee") pursuant to Section 1304 in respect of any Outstanding Securities of
any series and any coupons appertaining thereto shall be held in trust and
applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and
any coupons appertaining thereto and this Indenture, to the payment, either
directly or through any Paying Agent (including the Company acting as its own
Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of such Securities
and any coupons appertaining thereto of all sums due and to become due thereon
in respect of principal (and premium, if any) and interest, if any, but such
money need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by
law.

Unless otherwise specified with respect to any Security pursuant to
Section 301, if, after a deposit referred to in Section 1304(a) has been made,
(a) the Holder of a Security in respect of which such deposit was made is
entitled to, and does, elect pursuant to Section 312(b) or the terms of such
Security to receive payment in a currency or currency unit other than that in
which the deposit pursuant to Section 1304(a) has been made in respect of such
Security, or (b) a Currency Conversion Event occurs as contemplated in Section
312(d) or 312(e) or by the terms of any Security in respect of which the deposit
pursuant to Section 1304(a) has been made, the indebtedness represented by such
Security and any coupons appertaining thereto shall be deemed to have been, and
will be, fully discharged and satisfied through the payment of the principal of
(and premium, if any) and interest, if any, on such Security as the same becomes
due out of
<PAGE>

81

the proceeds yielded by converting (from time to time as specified below in the
case of any such election) the amount or other property deposited in respect of
such Security into the currency or currency unit in which such Security becomes
payable as a result of such election or Currency Conversion Event based on the
applicable Market Exchange Rate for such currency or currency unit in effect on
the second Business Day prior to each payment date, except, with respect to a
Currency Conversion Event, for such currency or currency unit in effect (as
nearly as feasible) at the time of the Currency Conversion Event.

The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee
or other charge imposed on or assessed against the Government Obligations
deposited pursuant to Section 1304 or the principal and interest received in
respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other charge which by law is for
the account of the Holders of such Outstanding Securities and any coupons
appertaining thereto.

Anything in this Article to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee
shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon Company Request any
money or Government Obligations (or other property and any proceeds therefrom)
held by it as provided in Section 1304 which, in the opinion of a nationally
recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written
certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount
thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect a defeasance or
covenant defeasance, as applicable, in accordance with this Article.

Section 1306. Reinstatement.
------------- 

If the Trustee or any Paying Agent is unable to apply any money in
accordance with Section 1305 by reason of any order or judgment of any court or
governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such
application, then the Company's obligations under this Indenture and such
Securities and any related coupons shall be revived and reinstated as though no
deposit had occurred pursuant to Section 1302 or 1303, as the case may be, until
such time as the Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such money in
accordance with Section 1305; provided, however, that if the Company makes any
payment of principal of (or premium, if any, on) or interest on any such
Security or any related coupon following the reinstatement of its obligations,
the Company shall be subrogated to the rights of the Holders of such Securities
and any related coupons to receive such payment from the money held by the
Trustee or Paying Agent.

the meeting prior to the adjournment of such adjourned meeting. Notice of the
reconvening of any adjourned meeting shall be given as provided in Section
1402(a), except that such notice need be given only once not less than five days
prior to the date on which the meeting is scheduled to be reconvened. Notice of
the reconvening of any adjourned meeting shall state expressly the percentage,
as provided above, of the principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such
series which shall constitute a quorum.

Except as limited by the proviso to Section 902, any resolution
presented to a meeting or adjourned meeting duly reconvened at which a quorum is
present as aforesaid may be adopted by the affirmative vote of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities if that series;
provided, however, that, except as limited by the proviso to Section 902, any
resolution with respect to any request, demand, authorization, direction,
notice, consent, waiver or other action which this Indenture expressly provides
may be made, given or taken by the Holders of a specified percentage, which is
less than a majority, in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of a
series may be adopted at a meeting or an adjourned meeting duly reconvened and
at which a quorum is present as aforesaid by the affirmative vote of the Holders
of such specified percentage in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities
of that series.

Any resolution passed or decision taken at any meeting of Holders of
Securities of any series duly held in accordance with this Section shall be
binding on all the Holders of Securities of such series and the related coupons,
whether or not present or represented at the meeting.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 1404, if any
action is to be taken at a meeting of Holders of Securities of any series with
respect to any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or other action that this Indenture expressly provides may be made, given
or taken by the Holders of a specified percentage in principal amount of all
Outstanding Securities affected thereby, or of the Holders of such series and
one or more additional series:

(i) there shall be no minimum quorum requirement for such meeting;
and

(ii) the principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such
series that vote in favor of such request, demand, authorization,
direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action shall be taken into
account in determining whether such request, demand, authorization,
direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action has been made, given or
taken under this Indenture.

Section 1405. Determination of Voting Rights; Conduct and Adjournment of
----------------------------------------------------------
Meetings.
-------- 

(a) Notwithstanding any provisions of this Indenture, the Trustee may
make such reasonable regulations as it may deem advisable for any meeting of
Holders of Securities of a series in regard to proof of the holding of
Securities of such series and of the appointment of proxies and in regard to the
appointment and duties of inspectors of votes, the submission and examination of
proxies, certificates and other evidence of the right to vote, and such other
matters concerning the conduct of the meeting as it shall deem appropriate.
Except as otherwise permitted or required by any such regulations, the holding
of Securities shall be proved in the manner specified in Section 104 and the
appointment of any proxy shall be proved in the manner specified in Section 104
or by having the signature of the Person executing the proxy witnessed or
guaranteed by any trust company, bank or banker authorized by Section 104 to
certify to the holding of Bearer Securities. Such regulations may provide that
written instruments appointing proxies, regular on their face, may be presumed
valid and genuine without the proof specified in Section 104 or other proof.

(b) The Trustee shall, by an instrument in writing, appoint a
temporary chairman of the meeting, unless the meeting shall have been called by
the Company or by Holders of Securities as provided in Section 1402(b), in which
case the Company or the Holders of Securities of the series calling the meeting,
as the case may be, shall in like manner appoint a temporary chairman. A
permanent chairman and a permanent secretary of the meeting shall be elected by
vote of the Persons entitled to vote a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of such series represented at the meeting.

(c) At any meeting each Holder of a Security of such series or proxy
shall be entitled to one vote for each $1,000 principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of such series held or represented by him; provided,
however, that no vote shall be cast or counted at any meeting in respect of any
Security challenged as not Outstanding and ruled by the chairman of the meeting
to be not Outstanding. The chairman of the meeting shall have no right to vote,
except as a Holder of a Security of such series or proxy.

(d) Any meeting of Holders of Securities of any series duly called
pursuant to Section 1402 at which a quorum is present may be adjourned from time
to time by Persons entitled to vote a majority in principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities of such series represented at the meeting, and the
meeting may be held as so adjourned without further notice.

Section 1406. Counting Votes and Recording Action of Meetings.
----------------------------------------------- 

The vote upon any resolution submitted to any meeting of Holders of
Securities of any series shall be by written ballots on which shall be
subscribed the signatures of the Holders of Securities of such series or of
their representatives by proxy and the principal amounts and serial numbers of
the Outstanding Securities of such series held or represented by them. The
permanent chairman of the meeting shall appoint two inspectors of votes who
shall count all votes cast at the meeting for or against any
<PAGE>

85

resolution and who shall make and file with the secretary of the meeting their
verified written reports in duplicate of all votes cast at the meeting. A
record, at least in duplicate, of the proceedings of each meeting of Holders of
Securities of any Series shall be prepared by the secretary of the meeting and
there shall be attached to said record the original reports of the inspectors of
votes on any vote by ballot taken thereat and affidavits by one or more persons
having knowledge of the fact, setting forth a copy of the notice of the meeting
and showing that said notice was given as provided in Section 1402 and, if
applicable, Section 1404. Each copy shall be signed and verified by the
affidavits of the permanent chairman and secretary of the meeting and one such
copy shall be delivered to the Company and another to the Trustee to be
preserved by the Trustee, the latter to have attached thereto the ballots voted
at the meeting. Any record so signed and verified shall be conclusive evidence
of the matters therein stated.

ARTICLE FIFTEEN

Conversion of Securities

Section 1501. Applicability of Article.
------------------------ 

Securities of any series which are convertible into Common Stock at
the option of the Holder of such Securities shall be convertible in accordance
with their terms and (unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301
for the Securities of any series) in accordance with this Article. Each
reference in this Article Fifteen to "a Security" or "the Securities" refers to
the Securities of the particular series that is convertible into Common Stock.
If more than one series of Securities with conversion privileges are Outstanding
at any time, the provisions of this Article Fifteen shall be applied separately
to each such series.

Section 1502. Right of Holders to Convert Securities.
-------------------------------------- 

Subject to and upon compliance with the terms of the Securities and
the provisions of Section 1108 and this Article Fifteen, at the option of the
Holder thereof, any Security of any series of any authorized denomination, or
any portion of the principal amount thereof which is $1,000 or any integral
multiple of $1,000, may, at any time during the period specified in the
Securities of such series, or in case such Security or portion thereof shall
have been called for redemption, then in respect of such Security or portion
thereof until and including, but not after (unless the Company shall default in
payment due upon the redemption thereof) the close of business on the Redemption
Date (except that in the case of redemption at the option of the Holder, if
specified in the terms of the relevant Security, such right shall terminate upon
receipt of written notice of the exercise of such option), be converted into
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common
Stock, as specified in such Security, at the conversion price or conversion rate
for each $1,000 principal amount of Securities (such initial conversion rate
reflecting an initial conversion price specified in such Security) in effect
<PAGE>

86

on the conversion date, or, in case an adjustment in the conversion price has
taken place pursuant to the provisions of Section 1505, then at the applicable
conversion price as so adjusted, upon surrender of the Security or Securities,
the principal amount of which is so to be converted, to the Company at any time
during usual business hours at the office or agency to be maintained by it in
accordance with the provisions of Section 1002, accompanied by a written notice
of election to convert as provided in Section 1503 and, if so required by the
Company and/or the Trustee, by a written instrument or instruments of transfer
in form satisfactory to the Company and/or the Trustee, as applicable, duly
executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing. All
Securities surrendered for conversion shall, if surrendered to the Company or
any conversion agent, be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation and cancelled
by it, or shall, if surrendered to the Trustee, be cancelled by it, as provided
in Section 310.

The initial conversion price or conversion rate in respect of a series
of Securities shall be as specified in the Securities of such series. The
conversion price or conversion rate will be subject to adjustment on the terms
set forth in Section 1505 or such other or different terms, if any, as may be
specified by Section 301 for Securities of such series. Provisions of this
Indenture that apply to conversion of all of a Security also apply to conversion
of a portion of it.

Section 1503. Issuance of Shares of Common Stock on Conversions.
------------------------------------------------- 

As promptly as practicable after the surrender, as herein provided, of
any Security or Securities for conversion, the Company shall deliver or cause to
be delivered at its said office or agency to or upon the written order of the
Holder of the Security or Securities so surrendered a certificate or
certificates representing the number of duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock into which such Security or
Securities may be converted in accordance with the terms thereof and the
provisions of this Article Fifteen. Prior to delivery of such certificate or
certificates, the Company shall require written notice at its said office or
agency from the Holder of the Security or Securities so surrendered stating that
the Holder irrevocably elects to convert such Security or Securities, or, if
less than the entire principal amount thereof is to be converted, stating the
portion thereof to be converted. Such notice shall also state the name or names
(with address and social security or other taxpayer identification number) in
which said certificate or certificates are to be issued. Such conversion shall
be deemed to have been made at the time that such Security or Securities shall
have been surrendered for conversion and such notice shall have been received by
the Company or the Trustee, the rights of the Holder of such Security or
Securities as a Holder shall cease at such time, the Person or Persons entitled
to receive the shares of Common Stock upon conversion of such Security or
Securities shall be treated for all purposes as having become either record
holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock at such time and such
conversion shall be at the conversion price in effect at such time. In the case
of any Security of any series which is converted in part only, upon such
conversion, the Company shall execute and, upon the Company's request and at the
Company's expense, the Trustee or an Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and
deliver to the Holder thereof, as requested by such Holder, a new Security or
Securities of such
<PAGE>

87

series of authorized denominations in aggregate principal amount equal to the
unconverted portion of such Security.

If the last day on which a Security may be converted is not a Business
Day in a place where the conversion agent for that Security is located, the
Security may be surrendered to that conversion agent on the next succeeding day
that is a Business Day.

The Company shall not be required to deliver certificates for shares
of Common Stock upon conversion while its stock transfer books are closed for a
meeting of shareholders or for the payment of dividends or for any other
purpose, but certificates for shares of Common Stock shall be delivered as soon
as the stock transfer books shall again be opened.

Section 1504. No Payment or Adjustment for Interest or Dividends.
-------------------------------------------------- 

Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for
Securities of such series, Securities surrendered for conversion during the
period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date (or Special Record
Date) next preceding any Interest Payment Date to the opening of business on
such Interest Payment Date (except Securities called for redemption on a
Redemption Date within such period) when surrendered for conversion must be
accompanied by payment (by certified or official bank check to the order of the
Company payable in clearing house funds at the location where the Securities are
surrendered) of an amount equal to the interest thereon which the Holder is to
receive on such Interest Payment Date. Payment of interest shall be made, as of
such Interest Payment Date or such other payment date (as set forth in Section
307), as the case may be, to the Holder of the Securities as of such Regular
Record Date or Special Record Date, as applicable. Except where Securities
surrendered for conversion must be accompanied by payment as described above, no
interest on converted Securities will be payable by the Company on any Interest
Payment Date subsequent to the date of conversion. No other payment or
adjustment for interest or dividends is to be made upon conversion.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon conversion of any Original Issue Discount
Security, the fixed number of shares of Common Stock into which such Security is
convertible delivered by the Company to the Holder thereof shall be applied,
first, to the portion attributable to the accrued original issue discount
relating to the period from the date of issuance to the date of conversion of
such Security, and second, to the portion attributable to the balance of the
principal amount of such Security.

Section 1505. Adjustment of Conversion Price.
------------------------------ 

Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301 for
Securities of such series, the conversion price for Securities shall be adjusted
from time to time as follows:

(a) In case the Company shall pay a dividend or make a distribution
on Common Stock in shares of Common Stock, the conversion price for the
Securities of such series in effect at the opening of business on the day
following the date fixed for the determination of shareholders entitled to
receive such dividend or
<PAGE>

88

other distribution shall be adjusted by multiplying such conversion price
by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding at the close of business on the record date and
the denominator of which shall be the sum of such number of shares of
Common Stock and the total number of shares of Common Stock constituting
such dividend or other distribution and the resulting adjusted conversion
price shall become effective immediately after the opening of business on
the day following the record date, except as provided in subsection (i)
below.

(b) In case the Company shall subdivide the outstanding Common Stock
into a greater number of shares of Common Stock, the conversion price for
the Securities of such series in effect at the opening of business on the
day following the date upon which such subdivision becomes effective shall
be proportionately reduced, and conversely, in case the Company shall
combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of
Common Stock, the conversion price in effect at the opening of business on
the day following the date upon which such combination becomes effective
shall be proportionately increased, and the resulting reduced or increased
conversion price, as the case may be, shall become effective immediately
after the opening of business on the day following the date upon which such
subdivision or combination becomes effective.

(c) In case the Company shall issue rights or warrants to all holders
of Common Stock entitling them (for a period expiring within 45 days after
the record date mentioned below) to subscribe for or purchase shares of
Common Stock at a price per share less than the current market price per
share of Common Stock (as defined for purposes of this subsection (c) in
subsection (f) below), at the record date for the determination of
stockholders entitled to receive such rights or warrants, the conversion
price in effect immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so that the
same shall equal the price determined by multiplying the conversion price
in effect immediately prior to the date of issuance of such rights or
warrants by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date for issuance of such
rights or warrants plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the
aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Common Stock so
offered would purchase at such current market price, and the denominator of
which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the
record date for issuance of such rights or warrants plus the number of
additional shares of Common Stock receivable upon exercise of such rights
or warrants. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such
rights or warrants are issued, and shall become effective immediately,
except as provided in subsection (i) below, after such record date. In
determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the Holders of the
Securities of such series to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common
Stock at less than such current market price, and in determining the
aggregate offering price of such shares of Common Stock, there shall be
taken into account any consideration received by the Company for such
rights or warrants plus the exercise price thereof, the value of such
consideration or exercise price, as the case may be, if other than cash, to
be determined by the Board of Directors.
<PAGE>

89

(d) In case the Company shall distribute to all holders of Common
Stock any shares of capital stock of the Company (other than Common Stock)
or evidences of its indebtedness or assets (excluding cash dividends or
distributions paid from retained earnings of the Company or dividends
payable in shares of Common Stock) or rights or warrants to subscribe for
or purchase any of its securities (excluding those rights or warrants
referred to in subsection (c) above) (any of the foregoing being herein in
this subsection (d) called the "Distributed Securities"), then, in each
such case, unless the Company elects to reserve such Distributed Securities
for distribution to the Holders of Securities of such series upon the
conversion so that any such Holder converting such Securities will receive
upon such conversion, in addition to the shares of Common Stock to which
such Holder is entitled, the amount and kind of Distributed Securities
which such Holder would have received if such Holder had, immediately prior
to the record date for the distribution of the Distributed Securities,
converted Securities into Common Stock, the conversion price shall be
adjusted so that the same shall equal the price determined by multiplying
the conversion price in effect immediately prior to the date of such
distribution by a fraction the numerator of which shall be the current
market price per share (as defined for purposes of this subsection (d) in
subsection (f) below) of Common Stock on the record date mentioned above
less the then fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors,
whose determination shall, if made in good faith, be conclusive) of the
portion of the Distributed Securities so distributed allocable to one share
of Common Stock and the denominator of which shall be the then current
market price per share (as defined in subsection (f) below) of Common
Stock; provided, however, that in the event the then fair market value (as
so determined) of the portion of the Distributed Securities so distributed
allocable to one share of Common Stock is equal to or greater than the
current market price per share (as defined in subsection (f) below) of
Common Stock on the record date mentioned above, in lieu of the foregoing
adjustment, adequate provision shall be made so that each Holder of
Securities of such series shall have the right to receive the amount and
kind of Distributed Securities such holder would have received had he
converted such Securities immediately prior to the record date for the
distribution of the Distributed Securities. Such adjustment shall become
effective immediately, except as provided in subsection (i) below, after
the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive
such distribution.

(e) If, pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) above, the conversion price
shall have been adjusted because the Company has declared a dividend, or
made a distribution, on the outstanding shares of Common Stock in the form
of any right or warrant to purchase securities of the Company, or the
Company has issued any such right or warrant, then, upon the expiration of
any such unexercised right or unexercised warrant, the conversion price
shall forthwith be adjusted to equal the conversion price that would have
applied had such right or warrant never been declared, distributed or
issued.

(f) For the purposes of any computation under subsection (c) above,
the current market price per share of Common Stock on any date shall be
deemed to
<PAGE>

90

be the average of the reported last sales prices for the thirty consecutive
Trading Days (as defined below) commencing forty-five Trading Days before
the date in question. For the purpose of any computation under subsection
(d) above, the current market price per share of Common Stock on any date
shall be deemed to be the average of the reported last sales prices for the
ten consecutive Trading Days before the date in question. The reported
last sales price for each day (whether for purposes of subsection (c) or
subsection (d)) shall be the reported last sales price, regular way, or, in
case no sale takes place on such day, the average of the reported closing
bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported on the New
York Stock Exchange Composite Tape or, if the Common Stock is not listed or
admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange at such time, on the
principal national securities exchange on which the Common Stock is listed
or admitted to trading or, if not listed or admitted to trading on any
national securities exchange, on the National Market of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotations System
("NASDAQ") or, if the Common Stock is not quoted on such National Market
System, the average of the closing bid and asked prices on such day in the
over-the-counter market as reported by NASDAQ or, if bid and asked prices
for the Common Stock on each such day shall not have been reported through
NASDAQ, the average of the bid and asked prices for such day as furnished
by any New York Stock Exchange member firm regularly making a market in the
Common Stock selected for such purpose by the Board of Directors or a
committee thereof or, if no such quotations are available, the fair market
value of the Common Stock as determined by a New York Stock Exchange member
firm regularly making a market in the Common Stock selected for such
purpose by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof. As used herein,
the term "Trading Day" with respect to the Common Stock means (x) if the
Common Stock is listed or admitted for trading on the New York Stock
Exchange or another national securities exchange, a day on which the New
York Stock Exchange or such other national securities exchange is open for
business or (y) if the Common Stock is quoted on the National Market of the
NASDAQ, a day on which trades may be made on such National Market or (z)
otherwise, any day other than a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which
banking institutions in the State of New York are authorized or obligated
by law or executive order to close.

(g) No adjustment in the conversion price shall be required unless
such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in
such conversion price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by
reason of this subsection (g) are not required to be made shall be carried
forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment; and, provided
further that adjustment shall be required and made in accordance with the
provisions of this Article Fifteen (other than this subsection (g)) not
later than such time as may be required in order to preserve the tax free
nature of a distribution to the holders of Common Stock. All calculations
under this Article Fifteen shall be made to the nearest cent or to the
nearest 1/100 of a share, as the case may be, with one-half cent and 1/200
of a share, respectively, being rounded upward. Anything in this Section
1505 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall be entitled to make
such reductions in the conversion price, in addition to those required by
this Section 1505, as it in its
<PAGE>

91

discretion shall determine to be advisable in order that any stock
dividend, subdivision of shares, distribution of rights or warrants to
purchase stock or securities, or distribution of other assets (other than
cash dividends) hereafter made by the Company to its stockholders shall not
be taxable.

(h) Whenever the conversion price is adjusted as herein provided, the
Company shall promptly file with the Trustee, at the Corporate Trust Office
of the Trustee, and with the office or agency maintained by the Company for
the conversion of Securities of such series pursuant to Section 1002, an
Officers' Certificate, setting forth the conversion price after such
adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such
adjustment, which certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the
correctness of such adjustment. Neither the Trustee nor any conversion
agent shall be under any duty or responsibility with respect to any such
certificate or any facts or computations set forth therein, except to
exhibit said certificate from time to time to any Holder of a Security of
such series desiring to inspect the same. The Company shall promptly cause
a notice setting forth the adjusted conversion price to be mailed to the
Holders of Securities of such series, as their names and addresses appear
upon the Security Register of the Company.

(i) In any case in which this Section 1505 provides that an
adjustment shall become effective immediately after a record date for an
event, the Company may defer until the occurrence of such event (y) issuing
to the Holder of any Security of such series converted after such record
date and before the occurrence of such event the additional shares of the
Common Stock issuable upon such conversion by reason of the adjustment
required by such event over and above the Common Stock issuable upon such
conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (z) paying to such
holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fractional share of Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1506 hereof.

(j) Whenever there shall be any change in the conversion price
hereunder, then there shall be an adjustment (to the nearest hundredth of a
share) in the number of shares of Common Stock receivable upon conversion
of each Security, which adjustment shall become effective at the time such
change in the conversion price becomes effective and shall be made by
multiplying the number of shares of Common Stock receivable upon conversion
of such Security immediately before such change in the conversion price by
a fraction the numerator of which is the conversion price immediately
before such change and the denominator of which is the conversion price
immediately after such change. The conversion price per share of Common
Stock shall be adjusted and readjusted from time to time as provided in
this Section 1505 and, as so adjusted or readjusted, shall remain in effect
until a further adjustment or readjustment thereof is required by this
Section 1505.

(k) The form of Security need not be changed because of any
adjustment made pursuant to this Section 1505 and Securities issued after
such adjustment may state the same conversion price and the same number of
shares of Common Stock
<PAGE>

92

as are stated in the Securities initially issued pursuant to this
Indenture. The Company, however, may at any time in its sole discretion
make any change in the form of Securities that it may deem appropriate to
reflect such adjustment and that does not otherwise affect the substance
thereof, and any Securities thereafter issued or countersigned, whether in
exchange or substitution for outstanding Securities or otherwise, may be in
the form as so changed.

(1) Reference is made to the Company's Rights Agreement, dated as 
of August 25, 1989, between the Company and Society National Bank, as 
successor Rights Agent, as such Rights Agreement may be from time to time
amended, extended or otherwise modified, including any successor 
agreement or other similar agreement entered into in replacement thereof 
or substitution therefor (the "Rights Agreement"). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section 1505, no adjustment in the conversion 
price shall be required pursuant to this Section 1505 by virtue of the 
issuance of rights to purchase shares of Common Stock of the Company 
(each a "Right") pursuant to the Rights Agreement prior to such Rights 
becoming exercisable upon a Triggering Event (as such term is from time 
to time defined in the Rights Agreement) at a purchase price less than 
the current market price per share of Common Stock (as defined for 
purposes of Section 1505(c)). Upon the Rights becoming exercisable 
following a Triggering Event at a purchase price less than the current 
market price per share of Common Stock, the conversion price of a 
Security of such series shall be adjusted in accordance with Section 
1505(c) above, as if the Rights were issued to all holders of shares of
Common Stock on the date the Triggering Event occurred, provided, 
--------
however, that no such adjustment in the conversion price of a Security
-------
of such series shall be made if Rights held by the holder of such Security
of such series would be voided in accordance with the terms of the Rights
Agreement, and, provided further, that any adjustment to the conversion 
----------------
price made pursuant to this Section 1505(1) shall be subject to further 
adjustment in accordance with Section 1505(e) (including, without 
limitation, if any Rights become void pursuant to the provisions of the 
Rights Agreement). Nothing in this Section 1505 shall be deemed to 
require the Company to maintain the Rights Agreement or restrict the 
Company's ability to amend or terminate the Rights Agreement in accordance
with its terms. 

Section 1506. No Fractional Shares to Be Issued.
--------------------------------- 

No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
conversions of Securities. If more than one Security of any series shall
be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of
full shares which shall be issuable upon conversion thereof shall be
computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities
of such series (or specified portions thereof to the extent permitted
hereby) so surrendered. Instead of a fraction of a share of Common Stock
which would otherwise be issuable upon conversion of any Security or
Securities (or specified portions thereof), the Company shall pay a cash
adjustment (computed to the nearest cent, with one-half cent being rounded
upward) in respect of such fraction of a share in an amount equal to the
same fractional interest of the reported last sales price (as defined in
Section 1505(e)) of the Common Stock on the Trading Day (as defined in
Section 1505(e)) next preceding the day of conversion.

Section 1507. Preservation of Conversion Rights upon Consolidation, Merger, Sale
------------------------------------------------------------------
or Conveyance.
------------- 

In case of any consolidation of the Company with, or merger of the
Company into, any other corporation (other than a consolidation or merger in
which the Company is the continuing corporation), or in the case of any sale or
transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, the
corporation formed by such consolidation or the corporation into which the
Company shall have been merged or the corporation which shall have acquired such
assets, as the case may be, shall execute and deliver to the Trustee a
supplemental indenture, in accordance with the provisions of
<PAGE>

93

Articles Eight and Nine as they relate to supplemental indentures, providing
that the Holder of each Security then Outstanding of a series which was
convertible into Common Stock shall have the right thereafter to convert such
Security into the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and
property, including cash, receivable upon such consolidation, merger, sale or
transfer by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock of the Company into
which such Securities might have been converted immediately prior to such
consolidation, merger, sale or transfer. Such supplemental indenture shall
conform to the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect and shall
provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be
practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article Fifteen. Neither
the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall have any liability or responsibility
for determining the correctness of any provision contained in any such
supplemental indenture relating either to the kind or amount of shares of stock
or other securities or property receivable by Holders of the Securities upon the
conversion of their Securities after any such consolidation, merger, sale or
transfer, or to any adjustment to be made with respect thereto and, subject to
the provisions of Section 313 of the Trust Indenture Act, may accept as
conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be
protected in relying upon, an Officers' Certificate with respect thereto and an
Opinion of Counsel with respect to legal matters related thereto. If in the
case of any such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer, the stock or other
securities and property receivable by a Holder of the Securities includes stock
or other securities and property of a corporation other than the successor or
purchasing corporation, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed
by such other corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to
protect the interests of the Holders of the Securities as the Board of Directors
shall reasonably consider necessary. The above provisions of this Section 1507
shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales or transfers.

Section 1508. Notice to Holders of the Securities of a Series Prior to Taking
---------------------------------------------------------------
Certain Types of Action.

any, deliverable upon such subdivision, combination, consolidation, merger,
sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation, winding up or other action. The
failure to give the notice required by this Section 1508 or any defect therein
shall not affect the legality or validity of any distribution, right, warrant,
subdivision, combination, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution,
liquidation, winding up or other action, or the vote upon any of the foregoing.
Such notice shall also be published by and at the expense of the Company not
later than the aforesaid filing date at least once in an Authorized Newspaper.

Section 1509. Covenant to Reserve Shares for Issuance on Conversion of
--------------------------------------------------------
Securities.
---------- 

The Company covenants that at all times it will reserve and keep
available out of each class of its authorized Common Stock, free from preemptive
rights, solely for the purpose of issue upon conversion of Securities of any
series as herein provided, such number of shares of Common Stock as shall then
be issuable upon the conversion of all Outstanding Securities of such series.
The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock which shall be so issuable
shall, when issued or delivered, be duly and validly issued shares of Common
Stock into which Securities of such series are convertible, and shall be fully
paid and nonassessable, free of all liens and charges and not subject to
preemptive rights and that, upon conversion, the appropriate capital stock
accounts of the Company will be duly credited.

Section 1510. Compliance with Governmental Requirements.
----------------------------------------- 

The Company covenants that if any shares of Common Stock required to
be reserved for purposes of conversion of Securities hereunder require
registration or listing with or approval of any governmental authority under any
Federal or State law, pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or any national or regional
securities exchange on which Common Stock is listed at the time of delivery of
any shares of Common Stock, before such shares may be issued upon conversion,
the Company will use its best efforts to cause such shares to be duly
registered, listed or approved, as the case may be.

Section 1511. Payment of Taxes upon Certificates for Shares Issued upon
---------------------------------------------------------
Conversion.
----------

tax (including, without limitation, all documentary and stamp taxes) in respect
of the issuance and delivery of such certificates, and such certificates shall
be issued in the respective names of, or in such names as may be directed by,
the holders of the Securities converted; provided, however, that the Company
shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any
transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such certificate in a name
other than that of the Holder of the Security converted, and the Company shall
not be required to issue or deliver such certificate unless or until the Person
or Persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the
amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company
that such tax has been paid.

Section 1512. Trustee's Duties with Respect to Conversion Provisions.
------------------------------------------------------ 

The Trustee and any conversion agent shall have no duty,
responsibility or liability to any Holder to determine whether any facts exist
which may require any adjustment of the conversion rate, or with respect to the
nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to the method
employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in
making the same. Neither the Trustee nor any conversion agent shall be
accountable with respect to the registration under securities laws, listing,
validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of
any other securities or property, which may at any time be issued or delivered
upon the conversion of any Security; and neither the Trustee nor any conversion
agent makes any representation with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor
any conversion agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to make
any cash payment or to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of stock or stock
certificates or other securities or property upon the surrender of any Security
for the purpose of conversion; and the Trustee and any conversion agent, subject
to the provisions of Section 313 of the Trust Indenture Act, shall not be
responsible for any failure of the Company to comply with any of the covenants
of the Company contained in this Article Fifteen.

ARTICLE SIXTEEN

Subordination of Securities

Section 1601. Securities Subordinate to Senior Indebtedness.
--------------------------------------------- 

The Company covenants and agrees, and each Holder of a Security, by
his acceptance thereof, likewise covenants and agrees, that the payment of the
principal of (and premium, if any, and Additional Amounts, if any) and interest,
if any, on each and all of the Securities is hereby expressly subordinated, to
the extent and in the manner hereinafter set forth in this Article, to the prior
payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness.

Section 1602. Payment Over of Proceeds upon Dissolution, Etc.
---------------------------------------------- 

In the event of (a) any insolvency or bankruptcy case or proceeding,
or any receivership, liquidation, reorganization or other similar case or
proceeding in connection
<PAGE>

96

therewith, relative to the Company or to its creditors, as such, or to its
assets, or (b) any liquidation, dissolution or other winding up of the Company,
whether voluntary or involuntary and whether or not involving insolvency or
bankruptcy, or (c) any assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other
marshalling of assets and liabilities of the Company, then and in any such event
the holders of all Senior Indebtedness shall be entitled to receive payment in
full of all amounts due on or in respect of all Senior Indebtedness, or
provision shall be made for such payment in money or money's worth, before the
Holders of the Securities are entitled to receive any payment on account of
principal of (or premium, if any, or Additional Amounts, if any) or interest,
if any, on the Securities, and to that end the holders of Senior Indebtedness
shall be entitled to receive, for application to the payment thereof, any
payment or distribution of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or
securities, which may be payable or deliverable in respect of the Securities in
any such case, proceeding, dissolution, liquidation or other winding up or
event.

In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
Section, the Trustee or Holder of any Security shall have received any payment
or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in
cash, property or securities before all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full or
payment thereof provided for, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the time of
such payment or distribution, have been made known to a Responsible Officer of
the Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such
payment or distribution shall be paid over or delivered forthwith to the trustee
in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee, agent or
other Person making payment or distribution of assets of the Company for
application to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid, to the
extent necessary to pay all Senior Indebtedness in full, after giving effect to
any concurrent payment or distribution to or for the holders of Senior
Indebtedness.

For purposes of this Article only, the words "cash, property or
securities" shall not be deemed to include shares of stock of the Company as
reorganized or readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other corporation
provided for by a plan of reorganization or readjustment which are subordinated
in right of payment to all Senior Indebtedness which may at the time be
outstanding to the same extent as, or to a greater extent than, the Securities
are so subordinated as provided in this Article. The consolidation of the
Company with, or the merger of the Company into, another Person or the
liquidation or dissolution of the Company following the conveyance or transfer
of its properties and assets substantially as an entirety to another Person upon
the terms and conditions set forth in Article Eight shall not be deemed a
dissolution, winding up, liquidation, reorganization, assignment for the benefit
of creditors or marshalling of assets and liabilities of the Company for the
purposes of this Section if the Person formed by such consolidation or into
which the Company is merged or the Person which acquires by conveyance or
transfer such properties and assets substantially as an entirety, as the case
may be, shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance or transfer,
comply with the conditions set forth in Article Eight.

Section 1603. No Payment When Senior Indebtedness in Default.
---------------------------------------------- 

(a) In the event and during the continuation of any default in the
payment of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Senior
Indebtedness beyond any applicable grace period with respect thereto, or in the
event that any event of default with respect to any Senior Indebtedness shall
have occurred and be continuing permitting the holders of such Senior
Indebtedness (or a trustee on behalf of the holders thereof) to declare such
Senior Indebtedness due and payable prior to the date on which it would
otherwise have become due and payable, unless and until such event of default
shall have been cured or waived or shall have ceased to exist and such
acceleration shall have been rescinded or annulled, or (b) in the event any
judicial proceeding shall be pending with respect to any such default in
payment, or event of default, then no payment shall be made by the Company on
account of principal of (or premium, if any) or interest, if any, or Additional
Amounts, if any, on the Securities or on account of the purchase or other
acquisition of Securities; provided, however, that if as specified as
contemplated by Section 301 Article Twelve is applicable to any series of
Securities, nothing in this Section shall prevent the satisfaction of any
sinking fund payment in accordance with Article Twelve by delivering and
crediting pursuant to Section 1202 Securities of such series which have been
acquired (upon redemption or otherwise) prior to such default in payment or
event of default.

In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall
make any payment to the Trustee or the Holder of any Security prohibited by the
foregoing provisions of this Section, and if such fact shall, at or prior to the
time of such payment, have been made known to a Responsible Officer of the
Trustee or, as the case may be, such Holder, then and in such event such payment
shall be paid over and delivered forthwith to the Company.

The provisions of this Section shall not apply to any payment with
respect to which Section 1602 would be applicable.

Section 1604. Payment Permitted if No Default.
------------------------------- 

Nothing contained in this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or in
any of the Securities shall prevent (a) the Company, at any time except during
the pendency of any case, proceeding, dissolution, liquidation or other winding
up, assignment for the benefit of creditors or other marshalling of assets and
liabilities of the Company referred to in Section 1602 or under the conditions
described in Section 1603, from making payments at any time of principal of (and
premium, if any, or Additional Amounts, if any) or interest on the Securities,
or (b) the application by the Trustee of any moneys deposited with it hereunder
to the payment of or on account of the principal of (or premium, if any, or
Additional Amounts, if any) or interest on the Securities or the retention by
the Holder, if, at the time of such application by the Trustee, a Responsible
Officer did not have knowledge that such payment would have been prohibited by
the provisions of this Article.
<PAGE>

98

Section 1605. Subrogation to Rights of Holders of Senior Indebtedness.
------------------------------------------------------- 

Subject to the payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, the Holders
of the Securities shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the holders of
all Existing Subordinated Indebtedness and all indebtedness of the Company which
by its express terms is subordinated to indebtedness of the Company to
substantially the same extent as the Securities or the Existing Subordinated
Indebtedness are subordinated and is entitled to like rights of subrogation) to
the extent of the payments or distributions made to the holders of such Senior
Indebtedness pursuant to the provisions of this Article to the rights of the
holders of such Senior Indebtedness to receive payments and distributions of
cash, property and securities applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until the
principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities shall be paid
in full. For purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the
holders of the Senior Indebtedness of any cash, property or securities to which
the Holders of the Securities or the Trustee would be entitled except for the
provisions of this Article and no payments over pursuant to the provisions of
this Article to the holders of Senior Indebtedness by Holders of the Securities
or the Trustee, shall, as among the Company, its creditors other than holders of
Senior Indebtedness and the Holders of the Securities, be deemed to be a payment
or distribution by the Company to or on account of the Senior Indebtedness.

Section 1606. Provisions Solely to Define Relative Rights.
------------------------------------------- 

The provisions of this Article are and are intended solely for the
purpose of defining the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities on the
one hand and the holders of Senior Indebtedness (and, in the case of Section
1614, the holders of Existing Subordinated Indebtedness and Entitled Persons in
respect of Other Senior Obligations) on the other hand. Nothing contained in
this Article or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Securities is intended to
or shall (a) impair, as among the Company, its creditors other than holders of
Senior Indebtedness and the Holders of the Securities, the obligation of the
Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the Holders of the
Securities the principal of (and premium, if any, or Additional Amounts, if any)
and interest on the Securities as and when the same shall become due and payable
in accordance with their terms; (b) affect the relative rights against the
Company of the Holders of the Securities and creditors of the Company other than
the holders of Senior Indebtedness and of Existing Subordinated Indebtedness; or
(c) prevent the Trustee or the Holder of any Security from exercising all
remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this
Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article of the holders of
Senior Indebtedness, and under Section 1614 of Entitled Persons in respect of
Other Senior Obligations, to receive cash, property and securities otherwise
payable or deliverable to the Trustee or such Holder.

Section 1607. Trustee to Effectuate Subordination and Payment Provisions.
---------------------------------------------------------- 

Each Holder of a Security by his acceptance thereof authorizes and
directs the Trustee on his behalf to take such action as may be necessary or
appropriate to effectuate the subordination and payment provisions provided in
this Article and appoints the Trustee his attorney-in-fact for any and all such
purposes.
<PAGE>

99

Section 1608. No Waiver of Subordination Provisions.
------------------------------------- 

No right of any present or future holder of any Senior Indebtedness to
enforce subordination as herein provided shall at any time in any way be
prejudiced or impaired by any failure to act on the part of the Company or by
any failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any non-compliance
by the Company with the terms, provisions and covenants of this Indenture,
regardless of any knowledge thereof any such holder may have or be otherwise
charged with.

Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph,
the holders of Senior Indebtedness may, at any time and from time to time,
without the consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders of the
Securities, without incurring responsibilities to the Holders of the Securities
and without impairing or releasing the subordination provided in this Article or
the obligations hereunder of the Holders of the Securities to the holders of
Senior Indebtedness, do any one or more of the following: (i) change the manner,
place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter,
Senior Indebtedness, or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner Senior
Indebtedness or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which
Senior Indebtedness is outstanding; (ii) sell, exchange, release or otherwise
deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing Senior
Indebtedness; (iii) release any Person liable in any manner for the collection
of Senior Indebtedness; and (iv) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights
against the Company and any other Person.

Section 1609. Notice to Trustee.
----------------- 

The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any
fact known to the Company which would prohibit the making of any payment to or
by the Trustee in respect of the Securities. Notwithstanding the provisions of
this Article or any other provision of this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be
charged with knowledge of the existence of any facts which would prohibit the
making of any payment to or by the Trustee in respect of the Securities, unless
and until the Trustee shall have received written notice thereof from the
Company or a holder of Senior Indebtedness or from any trustee therefor or from
any Entitled Persons in respect of Other Senior Obligations, and, prior to the
receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee, subject to the provisions of
Section 601, shall be entitled in all respects to assume that no such facts
exist; provided, however, that if the Trustee shall not have received the notice
provided for in this Section at least two Business Days prior to the date upon
which by the terms hereof any money may become payable for any purpose
(including, without limitation, the payment of the principal (and premium, if
any, or Additional Amounts, if any) or interest on any Security), then, anything
herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the Trustee shall have full
power and authority to receive such money and to apply the same to the purpose
for which such money was received and shall not be affected by any notice to the
contrary which may be received by it within two Business Days prior to such
date.

Subject to the provisions of Section 601, the Trustee shall be
entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person
representing himself to be a holder of Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee
therefor) or an Entitled Person in respect of Other Senior
<PAGE>

100

Obligations to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of Senior
Indebtedness (or a trustee therefor) or an Entitled Person in respect of Other
Senior Obligations. In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that
further evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder
of Senior Indebtedness or an Entitled Person in respect of Other Senior
Obligations to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this
Article, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness
or Other Senior Obligations held by such Person, the extent to which such Person
is entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts
pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article, and if such evidence
is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment or distribution to such
Person pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive
such payment.

Section 1610. Reliance on Judicial Order or Certificate of Liquidating Agent.
-------------------------------------------------------------- 

Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to
in this Article, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities shall be entitled
to rely upon any order or decree entered by any court of competent jurisdiction
in which such insolvency, bankruptcy, receivership, liquidation, reorganization,
dissolution, winding up or similar case or proceeding is pending, or a
certificate of the trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, liquidating trustee,
custodian, assignee for the benefit of creditors, agent or other Person making
such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders of
Securities, for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate
in such payment or distribution, the holders of the Senior Indebtedness and
other indebtedness of the Company and the Entitled Persons in respect of Other
Senior Obligations, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount or amounts
paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to this
Article.

Section 1611. Trustee Not Fiduciary for Holders of Senior Indebtedness or
-----------------------------------------------------------
Entitled Persons.
---------------- 

The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the
holders of Senior Indebtedness or Entitled Persons in respect of Other Senior
Obligations and shall not be liable to any such holders or creditors if it shall
in good faith pay over or distribute to Holders of Securities or to the Company
or to any other Person cash, property or securities to which any holders of
Senior Indebtedness or Entitled Persons in respect of Other Senior Obligations
shall be entitled by virtue of this Article or otherwise.

Section 1612. Rights of Trustee as Holder of Senior Indebtedness or Entitled
--------------------------------------------------------------
Person; Preservation of Trustee's Rights.
---------------------------------------- 

The Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the
rights set forth in this Article with respect to any Senior Indebtedness which
may at any time be held by it and with respect to any Other Senior Obligations
owed to the Trustee as an Entitled Person, to the same extent as any other
holder of Senior Indebtedness or Entitled Person in respect of Other Senior
Obligations, as the case may be, and nothing in this Indenture shall deprive the
Trustee of any of its rights as such holder or Entitled Person.
<PAGE>

101

Nothing in this Article shall apply to claims of, or payments to, the
Trustee under or pursuant to Section 606.

Section 1613. Article Applicable to Paying Agents.
----------------------------------- 

In case at any time any Paying Agent other than the Trustee shall have
been appointed by the Company and be then acting hereunder, the term "Trustee"
as used in this Article shall in such case (unless the context otherwise
requires) be construed as extending to and including such Paying Agent within
its meaning as fully for all intents and purposes as if such Paying Agent were
named in this Article in addition to or in place of the Trustee; provided,
however, that Section 1612 shall not apply to the Company or any Affiliate of
the Company if it or such Affiliate acts as Paying Agent.

Section 1614. Relationship to Existing Subordinated Indebtedness; Payment of
--------------------------------------------------------------
Excess Proceeds in Certain Cases.
- - -------------------------------- 

(a) The Securities shall not be superior in right of payment to any
of the Existing Subordinated Indebtedness and the obligations of the Company
evidenced by the Securities shall not constitute "senior indebtedness" as
defined in the Society Subordinated Indenture or in the Old KeyCorp Subordinated
Indentures, or in any other indenture or other instrument or document
establishing or governing the terms of any other Existing Subordinated
Indebtedness.

(b) Upon the occurrence of any of the events specified in clauses
(a), (b) and (c) of the first paragraph of Section 1602, the provisions of that
Section and the corresponding provisions of each indenture or other instrument
or document establishing or governing the terms of any Existing Subordinated
Indebtedness shall be given effect in accordance with their respective terms to
determine the amount of cash, property or securities which may be payable or
deliverable as among the holders of Senior Indebtedness and the holders of
"senior indebtedness", as defined in such indentures, instruments and documents,
on the one hand, and the Holders of Securities and holders of Existing
Subordinated Indebtedness, on the other hand. To the extent that the Securities
and any Existing Subordinated Indebtedness rank equally and pari passu, the
provisions of Section 1602 and the corresponding provisions of the indenture or
other instrument or document establishing or governing the terms of such
Existing Subordinated Indebtedness shall be given effect on a pro rata basis to
determine the amount of cash, property or securities which may be payable or
deliverable as between the holders of Senior Indebtedness and the holders of
"senior indebtedness", as defined in such indentures, instruments and documents,
on the one hand, and the Holders of Securities and holders of such Existing
Subordinated Indebtedness, on the other hand.

(c) If, after giving effect, to the extent applicable, to the
provisions of Section 1602, Section 1605, Section 1614(b) and the respective
corresponding provisions of each indenture or other instrument or document
establishing or governing the terms of any Existing Subordinated Indebtedness,
any amount of cash, property or securities shall be available for payment or
distribution in respect of the Securities ("Excess Proceeds"), and any Entitled
Persons in respect of Other Senior Obligations shall not have received
<PAGE>

102

payment in full of all amounts due on or in respect of such Other Senior
Obligations (and provision shall not have been made for such payment in money or
money's worth), then such Excess Proceeds shall first be applied (ratably with
any amount of cash, property or securities available for payment or distribution
in respect of any other indebtedness of the Company that by its express terms
provides for the payment over of amounts corresponding to Excess Proceeds to
Entitled Persons in respect of Other Senior Obligations) to pay or provide for
the payment of the Other Senior Obligations remaining unpaid, to the extent
necessary to pay all Other Senior Obligations in full, after giving effect to
any concurrent payment or distribution to or for Entitled Persons in respect of
Other Senior Obligations. Any Excess Proceeds remaining after the payment (or
provision for payment) in full of all Other Senior Obligations shall be
available for payment or distribution in respect of the Securities.

(d) In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
subsection (c) of this Section, the Trustee or Holder of any Security shall have
received any payment or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or
character, whether in cash, property or securities, before all Other Senior
Obligations are paid in full or payment thereof duly provided for, and if such
fact shall, at or prior to the time of such payment or distribution have been
made known to a Responsible Officer of the Trustee or, as the case may be, such
Holder, then and in such event, subject to any obligation that the Trustee or
such Holder may have pursuant to Section 1602, such payment or distribution
shall be paid over or delivered forthwith to the trustee in bankruptcy,
receiver, liquidating trustee, custodian, assignee, agent or other Person making
payment or distribution of assets of the Company for payment in accordance with
subsection (c).

(e) Subject to the payment in full of all Other Senior Obligations,
the Holders of the Securities shall be subrogated (equally and ratably with the
holders of all indebtedness of the Company that by its express terms provides
for the payment over of amounts corresponding to Excess Proceeds to Entitled
Persons in respect of Other Senior Obligations and is entitled to like rights of
subrogation) to the extent of the payments or distributions made to Entitled
Persons in respect of Other Senior Obligations pursuant to subsection (c) or (d)
of this Section to the rights of the Entitled Persons in respect of Other Senior
Obligations to receive payments and distributions of cash, property and
securities applicable to the Other Senior Obligations until the principal of
(and premium, if any) and interest on the Securities shall be paid in full. For
purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to Entitled Persons
in respect of Other Senior Obligations of any cash, property or securities to
which Holders of the Securities or the Trustee would be entitled except for the
provisions of this Section, and no payments over pursuant to the provisions of
this Section to Entitled Persons in respect of Other Senior Obligations by
Holders of Securities or the Trustee, shall, as among the Company, its creditors
other than Entitled Persons in respect of Other Senior Obligations and the
Holders of Securities be deemed to be a payment or distribution by the Company
to or on account of the Other Senior Obligations.

(f) The provisions of subsections (c), (d) and (e) of this Section
are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of
the Holders of the Securities, on the one hand, and the Entitled Persons in
respect of Other Senior
<PAGE>

103

Obligations, on the other hand, after giving effect to the rights of the holders
of Senior Indebtedness, as provided in this Article. Nothing contained in
subsections (c), (d) and (e) of this Section is intended to or shall affect the
relative rights against the Company of the Holders of the Securities and (1) the
holders of Senior Indebtedness, (2) the holders of Existing Subordinated
Indebtedness or (3) other creditors of the Company other than Entitled Persons
in respect of Other Senior Obligations.

ARTICLE SEVENTEEN

Repayment at the Option of Holders

Section 1701. Applicability of Article.
------------------------ 

Repayment of Securities of any series before their Stated Maturity at
the option of Holders thereof shall be made in accordance with the terms of such
Securities and (except as otherwise specified by the terms of such series
established pursuant to Section 301) in accordance with this Article.

Section 1702. Repayment of Securities.
----------------------- 

Securities of any series subject to repayment in whole or in part at
the option of the Holders thereof will, unless otherwise provided in the terms
of such Securities, be repaid at the Repayment Price thereof, together with
interest, if any, thereon accrued to the Repayment Date specified in or pursuant
to the terms of such Securities. The Company covenants that on or before the
Repayment Date it will deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if
the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate and hold in trust as
provided in Section 1003) an amount of money in the currency or currencies,
currency unit or units or composite currency or currencies in which the
Securities of such series are payable (except as otherwise specified pursuant to
Section 301 for the Securities of such series and except, if applicable, as
provided in Sections 312(b), 312(d) and 312(e)) sufficient to pay the 
Repayment Price of, and (except if the Repayment Date shall be an Interest
Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities or portions thereof, as
the case may be, to be repaid on such date. 

Section 1703. Exercise of Option.
------------------ 

Securities of any series subject to repayment at the option of the
Holders thereof will contain an "Option to Elect Repayment" form on the reverse
of such Securities. To be repaid at the option of the Holder, any Security so
providing for such repayment, with the "Option to Elect Repayment" form on the
reverse of such Security duly completed by the Holder (or by the Holder's
attorney duly authorized in writing), must be received by the Company at the
Place of Payment therefor specified in the terms of such Security (or at such
other place or places of which the Company shall from time to time notify the
Holders of such Securities) not earlier than 45 days nor later than 30 days
prior to the Repayment Date. If less than the entire Repayment Price of such

<PAGE>

104

Security is to be repaid in accordance with the terms of such Security, the
portion of the Repayment Price of such Security to be repaid, in increments of
the minimum denomination for Securities of such series, and the denomination or
denominations of the Security or Securities to be issued to the Holder for the
portion of such Security surrendered that is not to be repaid, must be
specified. Any Security providing for repayment at the option of the Holder
thereof may not be repaid in part if, following such repayment, the unpaid
principal amount of such Security would be less than the minimum authorized
denomination of Securities of the series of which such Security to be repaid is
a part. Except as otherwise may be provided by the terms of any Security
providing for repayment at the option of the Holder thereof, exercise of the
repayment option by the Holder shall be irrevocable unless waived by the
Company. 

Section 1704. When Securities Presented for Repayment Become Due and Payable.
-------------------------------------------------------------- 

If Securities of any series providing for repayment at the option of
the Holders thereof shall have been surrendered as provided in this Article and
as provided by or pursuant to the terms of such Securities, such Securities or
the portions thereof, as the case may be, to be repaid shall become due and
payable and shall be paid by the Company on the Repayment Date therein
specified, and on and after such Repayment Date (unless the Company shall
default in the payment of such Securities on such Repayment Date) such
Securities shall, if the same were interest-bearing, cease to bear interest and
the coupons for such interest appertaining to any Bearer Securities so to be
repaid, except to the extent provided below, shall be void. Upon surrender of
any such Security for repayment in accordance with such provisions, together
with all coupons, if any, appertaining thereto maturing after the Repayment
Date, the principal amount of such Security so to be repaid shall be paid by the
Company, together with accrued interest, if any, to the Repayment Date;
provided, however, that coupons whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the
Repayment Date shall be payable only at an office or agency located outside the
United States (except as otherwise provided in Section 1002) and, unless
otherwise specified pursuant to Section 301, only upon presentation and
surrender of such coupons, and provided further that, in the case of Registered
Securities, installments of interest, if any, whose Stated Maturity is on or
prior to the Repayment Date shall be payable (but without interest thereon,
unless the Company shall default in the payment thereof) to the Holders of such
Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the
close of business on the relevant Record Dates according to their terms and the
provisions of Section 307.

If any Bearer Security surrendered for repayment shall not be
accompanied by all appurtenant coupons maturing after the Repayment Date, such
Security may be paid after deducting from the amount payable therefor as
provided in Section 1702 an amount equal to the face amount of all such missing
coupons, or the surrender of such missing coupon or coupons may be waived by the
Company and the Trustee if there be furnished to them such security or indemnity
as they may require to save each of them and any Paying Agent harmless. If
thereafter the Holder of such Security shall surrender to the Trustee or any
Paying Agent any such missing coupon in respect of which a deduction shall have
been made as provided in the preceding sentence, such Holder shall be entitled

105

to receive the amount so deducted; provided, however, that interest represented
by coupons shall be payable only at an office or agency located outside the
United States (except as otherwise provided in Section 1002) and, unless
otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, only upon presentation and
surrender of those coupons.

If any Security surrendered for repayment shall not be so repaid upon 
surrender thereof, the Repayment Price (together with interest, if any,
thereon accrued to such Repayment Date) shall, until paid, bear interest from
the Repayment Date at the rate of interest set forth in such Security or, in the
case of an Original Issue Discount Security, at the Yield of Maturity of such
Security. 

Section 1705. Securities Repaid in Part.
-------------------------- 

Upon surrender of any Registered Security which is to be repaid in
part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver to the Holder of such Security, without service charge and at the
expense of the Company, a new Registered Security or Securities of the same
series, of any authorized denomination specified by the Holder, in an aggregate
principal amount equal to and in exchange for the portion of the principal of
such Security so surrendered which is not to be repaid.

This instrument may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of
which so executed shall be deemed to be an original, but all such counterparts
shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Indenture to
be duly executed, and their respective corporate seals to be hereunto affixed
and attested, all as of the day and year first above written.
