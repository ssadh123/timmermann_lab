HASBRO, INC. ANNOUNCES RECORD REVENUES
AND EARNINGS FOR FIRST QUARTER 1994

Pawtucket, RI (April 13, 1994) -- Hasbro, Inc. (HAS:ASE) today reported 
results for its first quarter ended March 27, 1994.

Revenues increased approximately $2,100,000 to $489,133,000 from the 
$487,036,000 reported in the first quarter of 1993 and,absent the effect of the 
strengthened U.S. dollar, would have increased an additional $8,000,000. 
Earnings before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles were 
$26,717,000 for the quarter compared with $26,580,000 last year. On the same 
basis, earnings per share were $.30 in both periods. 

"Again this year, we have begun on a positive note", said Alan G. 
Hassenfeld, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, "and are pleased with our 
results which represent first quarter records for both revenues and earnings 
before an accounting change." 

During the quarter, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting 
Standards No. 112, relating to postemployment benefits. The adoption of this 
statement, which represents a change in accounting principles, reduced net 
earnings and earnings per share by $4,282,000 and $.05, respectively. Earnings 
and earnings per share after the accounting change were $22,435,000 and $.25, 
respectively. The weighted average number of common shares outstanding was 
90,100,000 compared to 89,639,000 a year earlier.

"We are particularly proud of the performance of our international units 
this quarter", he continued. "Revenue growth was experienced in virtually all 
countries and in constant dollars their revenues increased by more than 20%. 
Domestically, even given the difficult retail environment, further complicated 
by the unusually severe weather in much of the country during January and 
February, we experienced strong retail sales of our products in comparison to 
1993. Especially noteworthy this quarter were the innovative products from 
Playskool, including Cool Tools(TM) and In-Line Skates, as well as the 
continuing momentum of many of Kenner's items. This consumer strength was 
tempered, however, by the ongoing effort of many of our customers to minimize 
their inventory levels. In particular, one customer initiated a centralized 
buying system which, when fully implemented, will make them a more efficient 
retailer. This change resulted in a substantial decrease in their first quarter 
purchases from us although we expect the full year to be on plan."

Mr. Hassenfeld concluded by noting "Even though we had a strong first 
quarter, we are well aware that the balance of 1994 will present significant 
challenges as a greater proportion of our business moves to the second half of 
the year. We feel, however, that with our strong and diverse portfolio of 
products and our dedicated team of employees we are well equipped to meet those 
challenges."
