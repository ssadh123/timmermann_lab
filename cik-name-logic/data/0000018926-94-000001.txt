Item 2. Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.

On February 10, 1994 Century Telephone Enterprises, Inc. ("Century"),
under the terms of a definitive merger agreement entered into on October
8, 1993 (the "Merger Agreement"), acquired all of the capital stock of
Celutel, Inc. ("Celutel") in exchange for approximately $51,400,000 cash
and approximately 1,900,000 shares of Century's common stock. The cash
portion of the purchase price is subject to a post-closing adjustment,
the results of which are not anticipated to be material. Under the
terms of the Merger Agreement, Century officers have been named as the
officers and directors of Celutel and its operating subsidiaries. 

In connection with the acquisition, Century refinanced approximately
$41,700,000 of Celutel's debt. Century funded this refinancing and the
cash portion of the purchase price through a bridge term loan from
NationsBank of Texas, N.A. It is currently anticipated that the bridge
term loan will be repaid prior to September 30, 1994 with proceeds from
the issuance of long-term debt. Although the terms and conditions of
this debt have not yet been determined, Century anticipates issuing
unsecured senior debt. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase
and approximately $138,000,000 of cost in excess of net assets acquired
was recorded as a result of the acquisition.

Celutel is a telecommunications company that provides cellular service
in five metropolitan statistical areas in Mississippi and Texas. 
Celutel presently serves areas having an aggregate population of
approximately 1.4 million and controls approximately 1.1 million pops.
