October 19, 1994, Houston, Texas ........ Reading &
Bates Corporation (RB-NYSE) reported a net loss of $4
million ($.09 per share after preferred stock dividends of
$1.2 million) for the quarter ended September 30, 1994
compared to net income of $5.1 million ($.08 per share
after preferred stock dividends of $.8 million) for the
quarter ended September 30, 1993. Operating income for
the third quarter of 1994 was $.5 million on revenues of
$42.8 million, compared to an operating income of $9
million on revenues of $51.4 million for the third quarter
of 1993. The decrease in operating income is primarily
attributable to lower fleet utilization. Utilization for
the third quarter of 1994 was 74% compared to 94% in the
third quarter of 1993. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 1994 the
Company reported a net loss of $11.5 million ($.27 per
share after preferred stock dividends of $3.6 million)
compared with net income of $5.2 million ($.08 per share
after preferred stock dividends of $.8 million) for the
nine months ended September 30, 1993. The operating loss
for the first nine months of 1994 was $.3 million on
revenues of $124.6 million, compared to operating income
of $15.9 million on revenues of $135.7 million for the
first nine months of 1993. The decrease in operating
income is primarily attributable to lower fleet
utilization. Utilization for the nine months ended
September 30, 1994 was 73% compared to 84% for the
comparable period in 1993. 

The Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
Paul B. Loyd, Jr. stated, "Earnings continue to be
disappointing due to utilization weakness in some of our
international markets. However, based on current contract
activity with a number of clients, we expect 1995 results
to reflect substantial improvement over 1994."
