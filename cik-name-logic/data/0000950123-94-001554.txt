AMENDMENT, dated as of September 11, 1994, to the

Rights Agreement, dated as of January 28, 1986, as previously

amended on November 29, 1988 and May 22, 1991 (the "Rights

Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the

The Company and the Rights Agent have heretofore exe-

cuted and entered into the Rights Agreement. Pursuant to Sec-

tion 27 of the Rights Agreement, the Company and the Rights

Agent may from time to time amend or supplement the Rights

Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Section 27

Amendment by the Company and the Rights Agent have been in all

respects authorized by the Company and the Rights Agent.

In consideration of the foregoing and the mutual

Agreement as follows:

<PAGE> 2

1. It is hereby confirmed and agreed that the

execution of the Letter Agreement (the "Letter Agreement"), to

be dated as of September 11, 1994 between the Company and

Whitehall Associates, L.P. does not cause Parent, or the

Purchaser (as such terms are defined in the Letter Agreement)

to be the "Beneficial Owner" (as defined in Section 1(c) of the

Rights Agreement) of any Common Shares of the Company.

2. Section 1(a) of the Rights Agreement is hereby

modified and amended to add at the end thereof the following

paragraph:

"Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided that

the Purchaser (as defined in the Letter Agreement),

together with its Affiliates and Associates, does

not after the date hereof and prior to the

consummation of the purchase by it of the Committed

Shares (as defined in the Letter Agreement) acquire

Beneficial Ownership of any shares of Common Stock

of the Company that are not Committed Shares, the

Purchaser (together with its Affiliates and

Associates) shall not be deemed to be an "Acquiring

Person" by virtue of the consummation of the

purchase by the Purchaser (or an Affiliate thereof)

of the Committed Shares in the manner contemplated

by the Letter Agreement, regardless of the number

-2-

<PAGE> 3

of shares of Common Stock of the Company then

Beneficially Owned by Purchaser (together with its

Affiliates and Associates) provided, further, that

if the Purchaser (or its Affiliates or Associates)

shall become the Beneficial Owner of 20% or more of

the Common Stock of the Company then outstanding by

reason of the acquisition of the Committed Shares

and shall, after such acquisition, become the

Beneficial Owner of any additional Common Stock of

the Company, then Purchaser (and/or such Affiliates

and Associates) shall be deemed to be an Acquiring

Person."

3. Section 3(a) of the Rights Agreement is hereby

modified and amended to add at the end thereof the following

sentence:

"Notwithstanding the foregoing, the execution and

delivery of the Letter Agreement and announcement

of the Offer and the Merger (as such terms are

defined in the Letter Agreement) shall not cause

the Distribution Date to occur."

4. The form of Right Certificate attached to the

Rights Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following

phrase after "May 22, 1991" in the fifth line of the last para-

graph on page 1 thereof:

-3-

<PAGE> 4

"and as of September 11, 1994"

5. This Amendment shall be governed by and con-

strued in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey

and for all purposes shall be governed by and construed in

accordance with the laws of such State applicable to contracts

to be made and performed entirely within such State.

6. This Amendment may be executed in any number of

counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but such

counterparts shall together constitute one and the same instru-

ment.

7. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction

of this Amendment is held by a court of competent jurisdiction

to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the

terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Amend-

ment, and of the Rights Agreement, shall remain in full force

and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invali-

dated.

8. In all respects not inconsistent with the terms

and provisions of this Amendment, the Rights Agreement is here-

by ratified, adopted, approved and confirmed. In executing and

delivering this Amendment, the Rights Agent shall be entitled

to all the privileges and immunities afforded to the Rights

other number of Shares as is equal to 19.9% of the Company's outstanding Shares
on the date hereof) (the "Option Shares"), in exchange for the number of whole
shares of Holdings Common Stock as set forth in the Conditional Purchase/Stock
Option Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (the "Conditional Purchase/Stock
Option Agreement"), among Purchaser, Parent and the Company; and in order to
induce Parent and Purchaser to enter into this Agreement, the Company has
agreed to grant Purchaser the Conditional Purchase Right and to execute and
deliver the Conditional Purchase/Stock Option Agreement;
WHEREAS, it is presently contemplated that the right
of Purchaser to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the
right of Purchaser to exercise the Conditional Purchase Right granted in the

direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent);
WHEREAS, Purchaser, Parent and the Company desire to
make certain representations, warranties, covenants and

agreements in connection with the Offer and the Merger and also to prescribe
various conditions to the Offer and the Merger; and 
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing
and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set 
forth herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, Parent, Purchaser and 
the Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1

THE EXCHANGE OFFER

Section 1.1 THE EXCHANGE OFFER. (a) Provided that
(i) this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with Section
7.1 and (ii) none of the events set forth in Annex A hereto shall have occurred
or be existing, Parent shall cause Purchaser to commence, and Purchaser shall
commence, the Offer as soon as reasonably practicable following the
effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the Offer
(together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Form S-4") under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). Each Share
accepted by Purchaser in accordance with the Offer shall be converted into the
right to receive from Purchaser that number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Holdings Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. The "Exchange
Ratio" shall mean the quotient (rounded to the nearest 1/100,000) obtained by
dividing (i) $14.25 by (ii) the average of the average of the high and low
sales prices of Holdings Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Tape on each of the ten consecutive

<PAGE> 8
4

trading days immediately preceding the second trading day prior to the date of
expiration of the Offer (the "Valuation Period"); provided that the Exchange
Ratio shall not be less than 1.78125 or greater than 2.375. The obligations of
Purchaser to consummate the Offer and to accept for exchange the Shares
tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the conditions set
forth in Annex A hereto and, without the written consent of the Company,
Purchaser shall not decrease the number of Shares being sought in the Offer,
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer (other than by adding
consideration), add additional conditions to the Offer or make any other change
in the terms or conditions of the Offer which is adverse to the holders of
Shares, it being agreed that a waiver by Purchaser of any condition in whole or
in part at any time and from time to time in its discretion shall not be deemed
to be materially adverse to any holder of Shares; provided that if Purchaser
shall have exercised the Conditional Purchase Right in whole or in part prior
to the termination of the Offer, Purchaser shall not be permitted to waive the
Minimum Condition (as defined herein). Purchaser agrees that upon the request
of the Company (and without limiting the number of times that Purchaser may
extend the Offer, or the total number of days for which the Offer may be
extended), Purchaser shall extend the Offer, one or more times, for an
aggregate of not more than twenty business days.
The Offer shall be made by means of an offering
circular/prospectus and related letter of transmittal (the "Letter of
Transmittal") (collectively, the "Offering Circular").

<PAGE> 9
5

Purchaser expressly reserves the right to increase the number of shares of
Holdings Common Stock to be exchanged for each share of Common Stock in the
Offer. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer, Purchaser
will accept (and Parent will cause Purchaser to accept) for exchange any and
all Shares which are validly tendered and not properly withdrawn on or prior to
the expiration of the Offer. Purchaser may, at any time, transfer or assign to
Parent or to one or more corporations directly or indirectly wholly owned by
Parent the right to purchase all or any portion of the Shares tendered pursuant
to the Offer, but any such transfer or assignment shall not relieve Purchaser
of its obligations under the Offer or materially prejudice the rights of
tendering shareholders to receive shares of Holdings Common Stock for Shares
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and accepted for exchange. In the
event that Purchaser assigns the right to purchase all or any portion of the
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer or an affiliate of Purchaser purchases
Shares under the Conditional Purchase/Stock Option Agreement, then for purposes
of any provision of this Agreement which is predicated upon Purchaser holding
or owning a specified number or percentage of Shares, the number of Shares held
or owned by Purchaser shall be deemed to include all Shares purchased by any
affiliate or affiliates pursuant to the transactions contemplated hereby or by
the Conditional Purchase/Stock Option Agreement.
(b) Promptly after the date hereof, in accordance 
with Rule 14d-2(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as

<PAGE> 10

amended (together with the rules and regulations thereunder, the "Exchange
Act"), Parent, pursuant to its Registration Rights Agreement with Holdings
dated July 15, 1990 (the "1990 Registration Rights Agreement") and, if
applicable, its Registration Rights Agreement with Holdings dated February 9,
1989 (the "1989 Registration Rights Agreement"), shall request that Holdings
promptly prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
"SEC") the Form S-4 covering the registration of the Holdings Common Stock to
be exchanged in the Offer and that will be issued in the Merger, as well as all
other information and exhibits required by law with respect to the registration
and offering of the Holdings Common Stock (the "Offering Materials"). Not
later than the date of commencement of the Offer (which shall be the date that
the definitive Offering Circular is first published, sent or given to
shareholders of the Company), Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule 14D-1 (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, the "Schedule 14D-1") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule 14D-1
shall contain (included as an exhibit) or shall incorporate by reference the
Offering Circular (or portions thereof) and forms of the summary advertisement,
as well as all other information and exhibits required by law. Parent and
Purchaser each agrees promptly to correct any information in the Offering
Materials and the Schedule 14D-1 (together the "Offer Documents") that shall be
or have become false or misleading in any material respect and Parent and
Purchaser each further agrees to request Holdings to

<PAGE> 11
7

take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and
its counsel shall be given an opportunity to review each of the Offer Documents
prior to its being filed with the SEC. Parent and Purchaser agree to provide
the Company and its counsel in writing with any written comments Parent and
Purchaser or their respective counsel may receive from the SEC with respect to
the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments.
Section 1.2 COMPANY ACTION. (a) The Company
hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that
(x) its Board of Directors, at a meeting duly called and held, has (i)
determined that this Agreement and the Conditional Purchase/Stock Option
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the
Merger, and thereby, taken together, are fair to the shareholders of the
Company, and has resolved to recommend that holders of Shares (A) accept the
Offer, (B) tender their Shares thereunder to Purchaser and, if required by
applicable law, and (C) approve and adopt this Agreement and Plan of Merger
(collectively, the "Recommendations") and (ii) approved this Agreement and the
Conditional Purchase/Stock Option Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, and that such approval constitutes approval of this
Agreement and the Conditional Purchase/Stock Option Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby for purposes of Sections 14A:10A-4
and

<PAGE> 12
8

14A:10A-5 of the New Jersey Business Corporation Act (the "NJBCA") and Article
VIII of the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "Charter") and
renders inapplicable the "Change in Control" provisions of the 8-3/8% Sinking
Fund Debentures due 2016, the "Change in Control" provisions of the Medium Term
Notes, Series A, the "Change in Control" provisions of the 9-7/8% Notes due
1997, Paragraph 4.1 of the letter dated November 20, 1987 from the Company to
Wachovia Bank and Trust Company, N.A. with respect to a $20 million line of
credit for Borden Chemical & Plastics Operating Limited Partnership ("BCPO")
and Section 6.5 of the ESOP Loan Agreement dated as of February 6, 1989 between
the Company and First National Bank of Boston and (y) Lazard Freres and Co. and
CS First Boston Corporation have delivered to the Board of Directors of the
Company their respective written opinions to the effect that the consideration
to be received by holders of Shares pursuant to each of the Offer and the
Merger is fair to such holders from a financial point of view. The Company
hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the Recommendations,
provided that they have not theretofore been withdrawn as permitted pursuant to
Section 1.2(b) or 5.3 herein.
(b) The Company hereby agrees to file with the SEC
contemporaneously with the commencement of the Offer, and distribute
contemporaneously with the Offering Circular to its shareholders, a Tender
Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with

<PAGE> 13
9

Recommendations. The Company further agrees, subject to clause (iii) of the
proviso to the first sentence in Section 5.3, not to change the Recommendations
unless the average of the average of the high and the low sales prices of the
Holdings Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Tape
for the Valuation Period is less than the price per share that would yield an
Exchange Ratio of 2.375 or less without giving effect to the proviso in the
definition of Exchange Ratio. The Company will not have any right to terminate
this Agreement as a result of any such change in the Recommendations and
notwithstanding any such change in the Recommendations, the Company will
continue to be bound by its representations and warranties and covenants
contained herein (except representations and warranties and covenants with
respect to the Recommendations), including, without limitation, those with
respect to the Rights Agreement (as hereinafter defined), antitrust approvals
and divestitures (assuming that following receipt of such approvals Purchaser
purchases at least 28,138,000 Shares), Article VIII of the Charter and Sections
14A:10A-4 and 14A:10A-5 of the NJBCA. The Company, Parent and Purchaser each
agrees promptly to correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 that shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. To the knowledge of the Company after due inquiry,
all the directors of

<PAGE> 14
10

the Company intend to tender their Shares pursuant to the Offer or to vote
their Shares in favor of approval and adoption of the Merger and this Agreement
at the shareholders' meeting referred to in Section 2.8. Parent and Purchaser
and their counsel shall be given an opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9
prior to its being filed with the SEC.
(c) In connection with the Offer, if requested by
Purchaser, the Company shall promptly furnish Purchaser with mailing labels,
security position listings and any available listing or computer file
containing the names and addresses of the record holders of shares of Common
Stock as of a recent date and shall furnish Purchaser with such information and
assistance (including, without limitation, updated lists of shareholders,
mailing labels and lists of securities positions) as Purchaser or its agents
may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial
holders of Shares.
Section 1.3 BOARD OF DIRECTORS; SECTION 14(F). (a)
If requested by Parent, the Company shall, following the acceptance for
exchange of the Shares to be exchanged pursuant to the Offer and/or the
purchase of the Option Shares in accordance with the Conditional Purchase/Stock

to cause the Applicable Percentage (as defined below) of directors (and of
members of each committee of the Board of Directors) (rounded in each case to
the next highest director or member) of the Company selected by Parent to

the Company, by means of

<PAGE> 15
11

increasing the size of the board of directors or seeking the resignation of
directors and causing Parent's designees to be elected). The "Applicable
Percentage" means the ratio of (i) the total voting power of all Shares
accepted for exchange pursuant to the Offer and/or purchased in accordance with
the Conditional Purchase/Stock Option Agreement to (ii) the total voting power
of the outstanding voting securities of the Company, rounded to the nearest
whole number and expressed as a percentage; provided that if Purchaser has
acquired at least 28,138,000 Shares the Applicable Percentage shall not be less
than 33-1/3%.
(b) The Company's obligations to cause designees of
Parent to be elected or appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company
shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions required
pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations
under this Section 1.3, and shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 such
information with respect to the Company and its officers and directors as is
required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1. Parent and Purchaser will supply
to the Company any information with respect to any of them and their nominees,
officers, directors and affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.
(c) Following the election or appointment of
Parent's designees pursuant to this Section and prior to the Effective Time (as

Purchaser or waiver by the Company of its rights hereunder or thereunder, will
require the concurrence of a majority of directors of the Company then in
office who are not affiliated with Parent or Purchaser or selected by Parent
for appointment or election to the board of directors of the Company in
accordance with Section 1.3(a) hereof (the "Independent Directors").

ARTICLE 3

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK
OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

Section 3.1 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder of any shares of Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of
Purchaser:
(a) COMMON STOCK OF PURCHASER. Each share of common
stock of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into a number of shares of common stock, par value $.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation equal to one one-thousandth of the
total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock immediately prior to the
Merger, which shall be all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the
Surviving Corporation.
(b) CANCELLATION OF TREASURY STOCK AND
PURCHASER-OWNED OR PARENT-OWNED COMMON STOCK. Each share of Common Stock that
is owned by the Company or by any subsidiary of the Company and each share of
Common Stock that is owned by Parent, Purchaser or any other subsidiary of
Parent shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and no cash, Holdings Common

<PAGE> 23
19

Stock or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor.
(c) CONVERSION OF COMMON STOCK. Except as otherwise
provided herein, each issued and outstanding share of Common Stock shall be
converted into the right to receive that number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Holdings Common Stock equal to the Final Exchange Ratio (as defined
herein). The aggregate amount of Holdings Common Stock which a holder of
Common Stock is entitled to receive with respect to each such share of Common
Stock shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Merger Consideration". The
"Final Exchange Ratio" shall equal that number of fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Holdings Common Stock that was delivered by the Purchaser with
respect to each share of Common Stock that was validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn and accepted for exchange pursuant to the terms of the
Offer.
(d) CANCELLATION AND RETIREMENT OF COMMON STOCK. 
All shares of Common Stock (other than shares referred to in Section 3.1(b)) 
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer 
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of 
Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the 
right to receive, upon surrender of such certificate to the Exchange Agent (as 
defined herein) and acceptance thereof in accordance with Section 3.3, the 
Merger Consideration (and/or any

<PAGE> 24
20

cash in lieu of fractional shares of Holdings Common Stock to be issued or paid
in consideration therefor).
Section 3.2 COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS AND RELATED
MATTERS. (a) As of the Effective Time, each holder of a then outstanding
option to purchase Common Stock (an "Option") shall receive with respect to
each share subject to such Option an amount in cash equal to the excess, if
any, of (i) the product of the Final Exchange Ratio and the average of the
average of the high and the low sales prices of Holdings Common Stock as
reported on each of the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the
Effective Time over (ii) the per share exercise price of such Option, and the
Company shall cause the surrender and cancellation of each Option (and any
related stock appreciation right) with respect to which a payment by the
Company is made. With respect to Options not so surrendered and cancelled, such
Options shall, if not previously terminated or expired in accordance with their
terms, terminate upon the grantee leaving the Company except upon such
grantee's death, Disability or retirement at or after age sixty-five (or such
earlier age as the Purchaser may expressly agree) and except that, to the
extent provided under any such existing Option, if the grantee is terminated by
the Company without Cause within two years following a Change in Control of the
Company, the grantee shall have a period of ninety days following such
termination within which to exercise such Option. The terms Disability, Change
in Control and Cause for this purpose shall have the meanings set forth in the
plans pursuant to which the Options were granted.

<PAGE> 25
21

No employee who has been previously granted an Option or stock appreciation
right shall be approved for retirement for purposes of any plan or agreement
under which such Option or right has been granted without the express consent
of the Purchaser. The Purchaser and the Company agree to continue to discuss
the manner in which outstanding stock options shall be treated after the
Merger.
(b) In addition to the foregoing, the Company shall
take all steps necessary so that no participant in any employee plans, programs
or arrangements of the Company shall have any right to acquire or receive any
Common Stock or other equity interest in the Company on or after the Effective
Time other than in connection with the exercise of Options outstanding on the
date hereof which have not been cancelled pursuant to Section 3.2(a). On or
prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall amend each of its (and cause the
amendment of each of its affiliate's) qualified defined contribution plans to
eliminate any investment in Common Stock after the Effective Time.
(c) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall cause an amendment of each of its employee plans, programs
and arrangements pursuant to which an employee may be entitled to receive
Common Stock (each a "Stock Plan") to provide that any employee entitled to
receive Common Stock in respect of previously deferred bonuses or compensation
shall receive instead cash equal to the product of (i) the Final Exchange Ratio
multiplied by the average of the average of the high and the low closing sales
prices of Holdings Common Stock as reported on each

<PAGE> 26
22

of the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the Effective Time
and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock so deferred, plus interest equal
to the rate otherwise credited on deferred amounts under the applicable plans
or if no such rate is credited the prime rate established by Chemical Bank from
time to time on such deferred bonuses or compensation from the Effective Time
to the date of distribution.
(d) Subject to the terms of any Company Plan, any
Merger Consideration paid in respect of restricted shares of Common Stock held
by any employee or former employee of the Company or any of its affiliates
shall remain restricted and subject to the same terms and conditions imposed on
such restricted shares.
Section 3.3 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES. (a)
EXCHANGE AGENT. At or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit
with or for the account of a bank or trust company designated by Parent, which
shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the
benefit of the holders of shares of Common Stock, for exchange in accordance
with this Article 3, the Merger Consideration in respect of each Share
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, except the shares of
Common Stock referred to in Section 3.1 (b) (the "Aggregate Merger
Consideration").
(b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, Purchaser will instruct the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than holders referred to in Section

<PAGE> 27
23

3.1(b)) of a certificate or certificates which represented shares of Company
Stock (the "Certificates") (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates
shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent
and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent or Purchaser
may reasonably specify) (the "Merger Letter of Transmittal") and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange
for Holdings Common Stock. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of
Certificates, together with such Merger Letter of Transmittal duly executed and
any other required documents, and acceptance thereof by the Exchange Agent,
each holder of a Certificate shall be entitled to a certificate or certificates
representing the number of full shares of Holdings Common Stock into which the
aggregate number of shares of Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificate surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement.
The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. After
the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the books and records
of the Company or its transfer agent of Certificates and if such Certificates
are presented to the Company for transfer, they shall be cancelled against
delivery of certificates for Holdings Common Stock as herein provided. If any
certificate for such Holdings Common Stock is to be issued in

<PAGE> 28
24

a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered for exchange is
registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed, with signature guaranteed, or otherwise
in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange shall
pay to Purchaser or its transfer agent any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the issuance of certificates for such Holdings Common Stock in a name
other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
establish to the satisfaction of Purchaser or its transfer agent that such tax
has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 3.3(b), each Certificate (other than certificates referred to in
Section 3.1(b) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by Section 3.1.
(c) NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. (i) No certificates or
scrip representing fractional shares of Holdings Common Stock shall be issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a
stockholder of Holdings; and (ii) notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of shares of Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the
Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Holdings Common Stock (after taking into account all shares of Common Stock
delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, a cash payment
(without interest)

<PAGE> 29
25

representing such holder's proportionate interest in the net proceeds from the
sale by the Exchange Agent (following the deduction of applicable transaction
costs of third parties other than the Exchange Agent, the Company, the
Purchaser or affiliates of any of the foregoing), on behalf of all such
holders, of the shares (the "Excess Shares") of Holdings Common Stock
representing all such fractions. Such sale shall be made as soon as
practicable after the Effective Time.
(d) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED 
SHARES. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Holdings Common 
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder 
of any unsurrendered Certificate for shares of Common Stock with respect to the
shares of Holdings Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu
of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 
3.3(c), until the surrender of such Certificate in accordance with this Article
3. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be delivered to the holder of such Certificate a
certificate representing whole shares of Holdings Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor and, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender or
as promptly after the sale of the Excess Shares as practicable, the amount of
any cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Holdings Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(c) and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of

<PAGE> 30
26

Holdings Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of
Holdings Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender. In no event
shall the persons entitled to receive such dividends or other distributions be
entitled to receive interest on such dividends or other distributions.
(e) NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN COMMON STOCK. 
All shares of Holdings Common Stock delivered and cash paid upon the surrender 
for exchange of Certificates which represented shares of Common Stock in 
accordance with the terms of this Article 3 (including any cash paid pursuant 
to Section 3.3(d)) shall be deemed to have been delivered (and paid) in full 
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificates, subject, however, to the Surviving 
Corporation's obligation, with respect to shares of Common Stock, to pay any 
dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the 
Effective Time which may have been declared or made by the Company on such 
shares of Common Stock prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain 
unpaid at the Effective Time.
(f) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of 
the Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this 
Article 3 (the "Exchange Fund") which remains undistributed to the holders of 
the certificates representing shares of Common Stock for nine months after the
Effective Time

<PAGE> 31
27

shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of shares of Common
Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article 3 shall thereafter
look only to Parent and only as general creditors thereof for payment of their
claim for Holdings Common Stock (or any security or consideration into which
Holdings Common Stock is converted) and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Holdings Common Stock and shall look only to Parent and only as general
creditors thereof for payment of any dividends or distributions with respect to
Holdings Common Stock to which such holders may be entitled.
(g) NO LIABILITY. None of Parent, Purchaser,
Holdings, the Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any shares of Holdings Common Stock (or dividends or distributions
with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.
If any Certificates which represented shares of Common Stock shall not have
been surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time (or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any shares of Holdings Common Stock, any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Holdings Common Stock or any dividends or
distributions with respect to Holdings Common Stock in respect of such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity (as defined herein)), any such shares, cash, dividends or
distributions in respect of such certificate shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the

<PAGE> 32
28

property of the Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person
previously entitled thereto.
(h) INVESTMENT OF EXCHANGE FUND. The Exchange Agent
shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on
a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be paid to Parent.

any other representation contained herein, would not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect.
(iii) (1) Each Company Plan has been established and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms, and in 
compliance with the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code 
of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and other applicable laws, rules and

organizations within the meaning of Code section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o)), to

in a liability to the Company, its affiliates or any member of their respective

their respective Controlled

<PAGE> 47

member of their respective Controlled Groups were to engage in a complete 
withdrawal (as defined in ERISA section 4203) from any such multiemployer plan; 
(2) no such multiemployer plan is in reorganization or insolvent (as those 
terms are defined in ERISA sections 4241 and 4245, respectively); and (3) 
neither the Company, any affiliate nor any member of their respective 
Controlled Groups has engaged in a transaction which could subject any of them 
to liability under ERISA section 4212(c) which would reasonably be expected to 
have a Material Adverse Effect.
(vi) Except as set forth in Section 4.1(h)(vi) of the
Disclosure Schedule, no Company Plan exists which could result in a payment of 
$100,000 or more to any employee or former employee of the Company or any

other rights or benefits with a value in the aggregate of

<PAGE> 48
44

$100,000 or more to any such employee or former employee as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Conditional Purchase/Stock
Option Agreement, whether or not such payment would constitute a parachute
payment within the meaning of Code section 280G.
(i) TAX MATTERS. Except where the failure to do so
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, each of the Company 
and each of its subsidiaries, and any consolidated, combined, unitary or

subsidiaries is or has been a member has timely filed all material Tax Returns 
required to be filed by it, has paid all Taxes shown thereon to be due and has 
provided adequate reserves in its financial statements for any Taxes that have 
not been paid, whether or not shown as being due on any returns. Except as set

Taxes has become a lien or encumbrance of any kind against the property of the 
Company or any of its subsidiaries or is being asserted against the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, except for such claims which have become a lien or 
encumbrance which would not have a Material Adverse Effect; (ii) no audit of 
any Tax Return of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is being conducted by a

ARRANGEMENTS. Parent, Purchaser and the Company will use their best efforts
and cooperate with one another (i) in promptly determining whether any filings
are required to be made or consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are

default, termination or acceleration of any agreement) under any United States

<PAGE> 84
80

this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, and the Conditional

Section 5.9 and to Section 8.3(f), in promptly making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith and in timely seeking

listing agreement with a national securities exchange, no party shall issue any
press release or make any public filings relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger, and the
Conditional Purchase/Stock Option Agreement, without affording the Company, on
the one hand, and Parent, on the other hand, the opportunity to review and
comment upon such release or filing.

Agreement and the Conditional Purchase/Stock Option Agreement, which
divestitures in each case shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent and
Purchaser.
Section 5.10 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS.
(a) Prior to the occurrence of a "Change in Control"
as defined in the Supplemental Benefit Trust Agreement between the Company and
Wachovia Bank of North Carolina, N.A. (the "Trust Agreement"), the Company
shall take all such action as may be necessary so that no funding of the Trust
created thereunder shall occur as a result of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. The Trust Agreement shall be amended prior to a Change in
Control to permit the disposition of all Common Shares it holds. The Company
may amend the plans listed in Section 5.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule that
would have been required to be funded pursuant to the terms of the Trust
Agreement in a manner which provides for a lump-sum distribution to, but does
not result in the constructive receipt of compensation by, a covered employee
of his or her deferred compensation thereunder

<PAGE> 86
82

in the event of the involuntary termination or normal retirement (under the
Employees Retirement Income Plan) of such employee.

request that the Company cancel, and the Company shall be under no obligation 
to cancel, the CORE Management Arrangements. For this purpose, "CORE

Disclosure Schedule which provide for certain payments and benefits in the 
event of certain terminations of employment.
(c) The Purchaser (or its affiliate) shall continue
the Company's Non-Exempt Associate Assistance Program and Exempt Associate
Assistance Program, on terms no less favorable than the terms in existence on
the date hereof, for the one-year period following the Effective Time. The
Company shall maintain, for the two-year period following the Effective Time,
employee plans and programs which are substantially similar in the aggregate to
those pension and welfare plans maintained for employees of the Company
generally.
(d) Neither the Company nor any of its affiliates
shall accelerate the payment of any deferred award under any bonus plan or
arrangement nor award or pay any pro rata awards thereunder as a result, or in
anticipation, of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that
the Company may pay the 1994 annual bonuses pursuant to its Management
Incentive Plan or other similar annual bonus plan in a manner which is

<PAGE> 87
83

consistent with past practice and the achievement of goals set forth therein.
(e) The Company shall ensure that no prohibited
transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or 4975 of the Code)
shall occur with respect to any Company Plan as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.
(f) With respect to any of the eleven individuals
listed in Section 5.10(f) of the Disclosure Schedule, in lieu of any other
severance arrangement for such individual, the Company shall pay such
individual in the event of that individual's termination by the Company after a
"Change in Control" without "Cause" (as those terms are defined in the Core
Management Agreements referred to in Section 5.10(b)) a cash severance amount
equal to twelve months of salary. The special severance payments set forth in
this Section 5.10(f) shall no longer be applicable when twelve (eighteen for
that individual next to whose name an asterisk appears in Section 5.10(f) of
the Disclosure Schedule) months have elapsed after the Change in Control. For
any executive listed on Schedule 5.10(g), such executive's letter of employment
shall be modified so that a termination without cause prior to the second
anniversary of a Change in Control (as defined in such letters) shall include a
termination by the executive due to the occurrence of any one of the following
events without his advance consent:
i. the executive's office is relocated to a 
different city;

ii. the executive's base salary is reduced or 
executive's bonus opportunity is materially 
lower than other Company executives of 
comparable rank;

<PAGE> 88
84

iii. there is a material diminution in the nature 
or scope of the authority or responsibilities 
attached to the executive's position. A 
diminution in nature or scope of authority or
responsibilities will not be deemed to occur 
simply because the company or business in which 
the executive is engaged has changed in size 
or structure; or

iv. in the case of the executive next to whose name
a double asterisk appears in Section 5.10(g) of
the Disclosure Schedule, the business (either 
separately or as part of a larger business unit)
in which the executive is engaged is sold or 
otherwise disposed of.

Section 5.11 INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE. (a)
The Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions identical with respect to elimination of personal liability
and indemnification to those set forth in Articles VI and VII of the Restated
Certificate of Incorporation set forth in Exhibit A hereto and Article X of the
By-laws of the Company, respectively, which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective
Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
individuals who at the Effective Time were directors, officers, agents or
employees of the Company.
(b) Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect
for six years from the Effective Time policies of directors' and officers'
liability insurance containing terms and conditions which are not less
advantageous than those policies maintained by the Company at the date hereof,
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, to the extent
available, and having the maximum available coverage under the current policies
of

<PAGE> 89
85

directors and officers' liability insurance; provided that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be required to spend in excess of a $3,000,000 annual
premium therefor; provided further that if the Surviving Corporation would be
required to spend in excess of a $3,000,000 premium per annum to obtain
insurance having the maximum available coverage under the current policies, the
Surviving Corporation will be required to spend $3,000,000 to maintain or
procure insurance coverage pursuant hereto, subject to availability of such (or
similar) coverage.
(c) In furtherance of and not in limitation of the
preceding paragraph, Parent and Purchaser agree that the officers and directors
of the Company that are defendants in all litigation commenced by shareholders
of the Company with respect to (x) the performance of their duties as such
officers and/or directors under federal or state law (including litigation
under federal and state securities laws) and (y) Purchaser's offer or proposal
to acquire the Company including, without limitation, any and all such
litigation commenced on or after the date of the Letter Agreement (as defined
herein) (the "Subject Litigation") shall be entitled to be represented, at the
reasonable expense of the Company, in the Subject Litigation by one counsel
(and New Jersey counsel if appropriate and one local counsel in each
jurisdiction in which a case is pending) each of which such counsel shall be
selected by a plurality of such director defendants; provided that neither the
Company nor the Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall

<PAGE> 90
86

not be unreasonably withheld) and that a condition to the indemnification
payments provided in paragraph 5.11(a) shall be that such officer/director
defendant not have settled any Subject Litigation without the consent of Parent
or the Surviving Corporation; and provided further that the Surviving
Corporation and Parent shall have no obligation hereunder to any
officer/director defendant when and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and
non-appealable, that indemnification of such officer/director defendant in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law.
Section 5.12 REDEMPTION OF SERIES B PREFERRED
STOCK. Without limiting the conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex A
hereto and provided that the Minimum Condition is satisfied without having been
waived or lowered, the Company will, promptly after consummation of the Offer,
in the manner and to the extent permitted by the Charter, redeem all of its
outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock prior to any record date in
connection with the Merger at the amount provided for redemption in the
Charter, and the Company agrees, subject to first obtaining any required
approvals under its debt instruments or other agreements to which the Company
is subject, promptly to commence taking all steps necessary to effect such
redemptions.
Section 5.13 CERTAIN AGREEMENTS. Neither the
Company nor any subsidiary will waive any provision of any confidentiality or
standstill or similar agreement to which it is a party without the prior
written consent of Parent, unless the

<PAGE> 91
87

board of directors of the Company or such subsidiary concludes in good faith
that waiving such provision is necessary or appropriate in order for the Board
of Directors of the Company to act in a manner which is consistent with its
fiduciary obligations under applicable law.
Section 5.14 REDEMPTION OF RIGHTS. The Company will
redeem all outstanding Rights at a redemption price of one and two-thirds cents
per Right effective immediately prior to the acceptance for exchange of any
Shares pursuant to the Offer, provided that the Minimum Condition will be
satisfied in the Offer. The Company will amend the Rights Agreement in
accordance with Section 4.1(o) hereof prior to the acceptance for payment of
any Shares pursuant to the Offer if the Minimum Condition is waived to permit
only such purchase of Shares. The Company and Parent hereby agree that if the
Company amends any provision of the Rights Agreement in connection with a
Transaction Proposal or with respect to any Person (as defined in Section
7.1(f)) or if the application of the Rights Agreement or any provision thereof
is enjoined with respect to any Person or Transaction Proposal or if the
Company agrees to redeem the Rights on terms more favorable than the terms set
forth with respect to Parent and Purchaser in this Agreement (any of such
events, a "Third Party Rights Amendment") in a manner that makes such Third
Party Rights Amendment less restrictive with respect to such Person, or in
connection with such Transaction Proposal, or is otherwise more favorable with
respect to such Person, or in connection with such Transaction Proposal, than
the Rights Agreement as then in effect

<PAGE> 92
88

with respect to Parent and Purchaser, the Company shall be deemed (if and to
the extent possible and without derogating the obligations of the Company
pursuant to the next sentence), without the necessity of any action by the
Company or the Rights Agent, to have so amended the Rights Agreement with
respect to Parent and Purchaser to the same extent or to have agreed to redeem
the Rights with respect to Parent and Purchaser on terms as favorable. The
Company agrees to notify Parent promptly of any Third Party Rights Amendment
and simultaneously with the execution of the Third Party Rights Amendment to
execute a written amendment to the Rights Agreement with respect to the
foregoing.
Section 5.15 AFFILIATES AND CERTAIN STOCKHOLDERS.
Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Parent a letter
identifying all persons who are, at the time the Merger is submitted for
approval to the shareholders of the Company, "affiliates" of the Company for
purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause each such person to deliver to Parent on or
prior to the Closing Date a written agreement substantially in the form
attached as Exhibit B hereto. Parent shall not be required to cause Holdings
to maintain the effectiveness of the Form S-4 or any other registration
statement under the Securities Act for the purposes of resale of Holdings
Common Stock by such affiliates and the certificates representing Holdings
Common Stock received by such affiliates in the Merger shall bear a

<PAGE> 93
89

customary legend regarding applicable Securities Act restrictions and the
provisions of this Section 5.15.
Section 5.16 PROXY SOLICITATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS'
MEETING. If approval of the Company's shareholders is required by applicable
law in order to consummate the Merger, the Company, Purchaser and Parent agree
that, if the Company or Parent is advised by its respective or joint proxy
solicitors prior to the Shareholders' Meeting that a vote in favor of the
Merger is not likely to be obtained at the Shareholders' Meeting, the
Shareholders' Meeting shall, at the request of the Independent Directors, be
adjourned from time to time, provided that in no event will the Shareholders'
Meeting be required hereunder to be held more than sixty days from the date
that the Proxy Statement was first mailed to the Company's shareholders, which
sixty day period shall be extended by the number of days, if any, that the
Company or Parent is enjoined from soliciting proxies for the Merger in
connection with the Shareholders' Meeting or that the holding of the
Shareholders Meeting or the vote thereat is enjoined.

101

(c) If Parent, together with any subsidiary or

paid by the Company to KKR & Co. pursuant to Section 8.3(b) or 8.3(c) hereof
(the "Transaction Fee") is not paid within five business days after the events

tender to KKR & Co., immediately in satisfaction of the Transaction Fee, such
number of shares (rounded to the nearest whole share) of (i) Common Stock ((A)
if it is publicly traded and (B) which at the request of KKR & Co. shall be
issued in shares of treasury stock, if available) or (ii), at the sole option
of KKR & Co. if the Conditional Purchase Right shall have been exercised, and
the Company shall at the time own Holdings Common Stock that is not subject to

trading day prior to the Fee Demand. The Company acknowledges that it is
obligated hereunder to pay the Transaction Fee in cash and that such obligation
is not derogated in any respect by the existence of the option of KKR & Co. to
seek satisfaction of such obligation by means of the Fee Demand.
(e) In addition to the other provisions of this
Section 8.3, the Company agrees promptly, but in no event later than two
business days following written notice thereof, together with related bills or

Act and shall be the subject of any stop order or proceedings seeking a stop
order, and any material "blue sky" and other state securities laws applicable
to the registration of the Holdings Common Stock to be exchanged for Common
Stock shall not have been complied with; or (vi) any of the following shall
occur and remain in effect and shall, in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser
in any such case, make it inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or such
acceptance for exchange of any of the Shares or to proceed with the Merger:

(a) (i) any representation or warranty of the
Company in the Agreement shall have been untrue as of the date of the Agreement
and shall continue to be untrue, which untrue representations or warranties, in

Agreement or the Conditional Purchase/Stock Option Agreement having a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company which has not been cured; (ii) the SEC Documents
filed by the Company with the SEC since the date of the Agreement did not
comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder applicable to such SEC Documents, and the SEC Documents
(including any and all financial statements included therein), except to the
extent revised or superseded by a subsequent filing with the SEC, as of such
dates contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; or (iii) the consolidated financial statements of the Company
included in the SEC Documents filed since the date of the Agreement did not
comply as to form in all material respects with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect
thereto, were not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles (except, in the case of unaudited consolidated quarterly statements,
as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and did not
fairly present the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results

of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the
case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

(b) there shall be any United states or foreign
statute, rule, regulation, decree, order or injunction promulgated, enacted,
entered into or enforced by any Governmental Entity, that (i) restrains or
prohibits the making or consummation of the Offer or the Merger or restrains or
prohibits the performance of this Agreement or the Conditional Purchase/Stock
Option Agreement, (ii) prohibits or materially limits the ownership or
operation by Parent or Purchaser of all or any substantial portion of the
business or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or compels Parent
or Purchaser to dispose of or to hold separate all or any substantial portion
of the business or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or imposes
any material limitation on the ability of Parent or Purchaser to conduct such
business or own such assets or (iii) imposes material limitations on the
ability of Parent or Purchaser (or any other affiliate of Parent or Purchaser)
to acquire or hold or to exercise full rights of ownership of the Shares,
including, but not limited to, the right to vote the Shares purchased by
Purchaser on all matters properly presented to the shareholders of the Company;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Parent and Purchaser shall have used their best efforts
to have any such decree, order or injunction vacated or reversed;

(c) any change shall have occurred since the date
hereof in the business, financial condition or results of operations of the
Company or any of its subsidiaries which has had, or would reasonably be
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company,
including, without limitation, the commencement in respect of, or by, the
Company of an involuntary, or voluntary, proceeding under any applicable
bankruptcy law, decree, order or any other case or proceeding adjudging the
Company a bankrupt or insolvent, or the condition of the Company is such that
it is unable to pay all of its liabilities as such liabilities mature or has
unreasonably small capital for conducting the business theretofore or proposed
to be conducted by it;

(d) there shall have occurred (and the adverse
effect of such occurrence shall, in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser, be
continuing) (i) any general suspension of trading in, or limitation on prices
for, securities on any national securities exchange or in the over-the-counter
market in the United States, (ii) any extraordinary or material adverse change
in United States financial markets generally, including, without limitation, a
decline of at least 25% in either the Dow Jones Average of Industrial Stocks or

be expected to materially adversely affect, the extension of credit by banks or
other lending institutions, (v) a commencement of a war or armed hostilities or
other national or international calamity directly or indirectly involving the
United States (other than in Haiti) which would reasonably be expected to have
a Material Adverse Effect or materially adversely affect (or materially delay)
the consummation of the Offer or (vi) in the case of any of the foregoing
existing at the time of commencement of the Offer, a material acceleration or
worsening thereof;

(e) the Agreement shall have been terminated in
accordance with its terms or the Offer shall have been amended or terminated
with the consent of the Company.

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of
the Parent and Purchaser and may be asserted by the Parent or Purchaser

waived by the Parent or Purchaser in whole or in part, PROVIDED HOWEVER, that
if Purchaser shall have exercised the Conditional Purchase Right in whole or in
part prior to the termination of the Offer Purchaser shall not be permitted to
waive the Minimum Condition. The Parent's or Purchaser's failure at any time
to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any
such right and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be
asserted at any time and from time to time.

[Closing Date]

RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp.
1301 Avenue of the Americas
New York, New York 10019

Gentlemen:

I have been advised that I have been identified as a
possible "affiliate" of Borden, Inc., a New Jersey corporation (the "Company"),
as that term is defined for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of
the General Rules and Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") under the Securities Act
of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), although nothing contained herein should be
construed as an admission of such fact.

Pursuant to the terms of an Agreement and Plan of
Merger dated as of September 23, 1994 (the "Merger Agreement") among Borden
Acquisition Corp., a New Jersey corporation ("Purchaser"), Whitehall
Associates, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and the Company, Purchaser
will be merged with and into the Company (the "Merger"). As a result of the
Merger, I will receive Merger Consideration (as defined in the Merger
Agreement), including shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share
("Holdings Common Stock"), of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., a Delaware
corporation ("Holdings") in exchange for shares of common stock, par value
$.625 per share ("Common Stock"), of the Company owned by me at the effective
time of the Merger as determined pursuant to the Merger Agreement.

A. In connection therewith, I represent, warrant
and agree that:

1. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other
disposition of the Holdings Common Stock I receive as a
result of the Merger in violation of the Securities Act or
the Rules and Regulations.

2. I have been advised that the issuance of
Holdings Common Stock to me as a result of the Merger has
been registered with the Commission under the Securities Act
on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I have
also been advised that, because at the time the Merger was
submitted for a vote of the stockholders of the Company I
may have been an "affiliate" of the Company and the
distribution by me of the shares of Holdings Common Stock I
receive as a result of the Merger has not been registered
under the Securities Act, such shares must be held by me
indefinitely unless (i) such distribution of such shares has
been registered under the Securities Act, (ii) a sale of
such shares is made in conformity with the provisions of

<PAGE> 123
2

Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the Securities 
Act or (iii) such sale is pursuant to a transaction which, 
in the opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to 
Holdings or as described in a "no-action" or interpretive
letter from the staff of the Commission, is not required to 
be registered under the Securities Act.

3. I have carefully read this letter and the Merger
Agreement and have discussed the requirements of the Merger
Agreement and other limitations upon the sale, transfer or
other disposition of the shares of Holdings Common Stock to
be received by me, to the extent I have felt necessary, with
my counsel or with counsel for the Company.

B. Furthermore, in connection with the matters set
forth herein, I understand and agree that:

1. Holdings is under no further obligation to
register the sale, transfer or other disposition of the
shares of Holdings Common Stock received by me as a result
of the Merger or to take any other action necessary in order
to make compliance with an exemption from registration
available, except as set forth in paragraph C below.

2. Stop transfer instructions will be given to the
transfer agents of Holdings with respect to the shares of
Holdings Common Stock I will receive as a result of the
merger, and there will be placed on the certificates
representing such shares, or any certificates delivered in
substitution therefor, a legend stating in substance:

"The shares represented by this certificate were 
issued in a transaction to which Rule 145 under the 
Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares 
represented by this certificate may be
transferred only in accordance with the terms of an
agreement dated , 1994 between the
registered holder hereof and RJR Nabisco Holdings
Corp., a copy of which agreement is on file at the
principal offices of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp."

3. Unless the transfer by me of my shares of
Holdings Common Stock is a sale made in conformity with the
provisions of Rule 145 of the Rules and Regulations or made
pursuant to a registration under the Securities Act,
Holdings reserves the right to put the following legend on
the certificates issued to my transferee:

"The shares represented by this certificate have 
not been registered under the Securities Act of 
1933 and were acquired by the holder not with a view 
to, or for resale in connection with, any 
distribution thereof

<PAGE> 124
3

within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and 
may not be sold, pledged or otherwise transferred 
except pursuant to a registration statement or in
accordance with an exemption from the registration 
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933."

It is understood and agreed that the legends set
forth above shall be removed and substitute certificates shall be delivered
without any such legend and the transfer agents will be instructed to
effectuate transfers of shares of Holdings Common Stock if the undersigned
delivers to Holdings a letter from the staff of the Commission or an opinion of
counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Holdings to the effect
that such legend is not required for the purposes of the Securities Act.

C. Holdings hereby represents, warrants and agrees
that:

For as long as resales of any shares of Holdings
Common Stock owned by me are subject to Rule 145, Holdings
will use all reasonable efforts to make all filings of the
nature specified in paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 144 of the
Rules and Regulations.

Very truly yours,

CONFORMED COPY

CONDITIONAL PURCHASE/STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT
-------------------------------------------

Conditional Purchase/Stock Option Agreement dated as of September 23, 1994
by and among Whitehall Associates, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership
("Parent"), Borden Acquisition Corp., a New Jersey corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Purchaser"), and Borden, Inc., a New Jersey
corporation (the "Company").

RECITALS
--------
Concurrently herewith, Parent, Purchaser and the Company are entering into
an Agreement and Plan of Merger of even date herewith (the "Merger Agreement";
capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth
in the Merger Agreement), which contemplates, among other things, an offer to
exchange (the "Offer"), pursuant to which each share of Common Stock accepted
by Purchaser in accordance with the Offer shall be converted into the right to
receive from Purchaser that number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of
Holdings Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio. Subject to the terms and
conditions of the Merger Agreement, the Offer will be followed by a merger (the
"Merger") of Purchaser with and into the Company.

As a condition to their willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement,
Parent and Purchaser have required that the Company agree, and believing it to
be in the best interests of the Company, the Company has agreed, among other
things, to grant to Parent the Option (as hereinafter defined).

AGREEMENT
---------
To implement the foregoing and in consideration of the mutual agreements
contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

1. The Conditional Purchase Option.
-------------------------------
1.1 GRANT OF OPTION. The Company hereby grants to Purchaser an
irrevocable option to purchase up to 28,138,000 shares of Common Stock (the
"Shares"), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein (the
"Option"). At the time that the Option is exercised, the Company shall
designate whether the Shares shall be newly issued Shares or Shares of treasury
stock of the Company.

1.2 Exercise of Option.
------------------
(a) The Option may be exercised by Purchaser (or its designee, which
designee must be Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent), in whole or in part, at any time, or from time to time, during the
period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the Expiration Date, PROVIDED
that if

<PAGE> 2
2

Purchaser (or its designee) has not exercised the Option in whole or in part
prior to the expiration of the Offer, it shall not be entitled to exercise the
Option thereafter if it waives or otherwise reduces the Minimum Condition and
accepts fewer than 41% of the outstanding Shares for payment in the Offer. As
used herein, the term "Expiration Date" means the first to occur of any of the
following dates:

(x) the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement); or

(y) March 21, 1995 (unless Purchaser has theretofore sent the 
written notice specified in Section 1.2(b)).

(b) If Purchaser wishes to exercise the Option (the "Option Purchase"),
Purchaser shall send a written notice to the Company of its intention to
exercise the Option, specifying the number of Shares to be purchased (and the
denominations of the share certificate or certificates to be issued), whether
Purchaser and/or a designee of Purchaser will be purchasing the Shares and the
place, and, if then known, time and date of the closing of such purchase (the
"Closing Date" or the "Closing"), which date shall not be less than two
business days nor more than ten business days from the date on which such
notice is delivered; PROVIDED, that the Closing shall be held only if (i) such
purchase would not otherwise violate or cause the violation of, any applicable
law or regulations (including, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act"), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), and the rules and regulations thereunder, or the
rules of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (the "NYSE")) and (ii) no statute,
rule, regulation, decree, order or injunction shall have been promulgated,
enacted, entered into or enforced by any governmental agency or authority or
court which prohibits delivery of the Shares, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent (PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the parties hereto shall use their best
efforts to have any such order, decree or injunction vacated or reversed). In
the event the Closing is delayed as a result of clause (i) or (ii) above, the
Closing Date shall be within five business days following the cessation of such
violation, statute, rule, regulation, decree, order or injunction, as the case
may be; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that, notwithstanding any prior notice of intention
to exercise the Option, Purchaser shall not be obligated to purchase any Shares
pursuant to this Section 1.2(b) after the date nine months following the date
of such notice.

(c) At any Closing, the Company shall deliver to Purchaser (or its
designee) all of the Shares to be purchased by delivery of a certificate or
certificates evidencing such Shares in the denominations designated by
Purchaser in the notice required under Section 1.2(b). If at the time of
issuance of any Shares pursuant to an exercise of all or part of the Option

<PAGE> 3
3

hereunder, the Company shall not have redeemed the Rights (as defined in the
Rights Agreement, dated as of January 28, 1986 between the Company and The Bank
of New York, as Rights Agent (the "Rights Agreement"), as amended on November
29, 1988, May 22, 1991, September 11, 1994 and the date hereof), then each
Share issued pursuant to such exercise shall have attached to it Rights or new
rights with terms substantially the same as and at least as favorable to the
Parent as are provided under the Rights.

1.3 Conversion of Option.
--------------------
(a) Upon the Conversion Date (as defined below), if any, the Option will
be converted in part from an irrevocable option to purchase the Shares into an
obligation on the part of Purchaser (or its designee, which designee must be
Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent) to exercise
the Option to acquire, and of Parent to cause Purchaser to take such action,
subject to applicable law (the "Mandatory Purchase"), on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein, such number of Shares, which when added to
the number of Shares purchased in the Offer (together with any Shares
previously purchased pursuant to the Option) as will result in Purchaser
beneficially owning more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock
(the "Mandatory Purchase Shares"). Shares subject to the Option in excess of
the number of Mandatory Purchase Shares shall continue, subject to the terms of
Section 1.2(a), to be subject to purchase at the option of the Purchaser. As
used herein, the term "Conversion Date" means the date, if any, on which
Purchaser or Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent
acquires more than 41%, but less than 50%, of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer.

(b) If the Conversion Date occurs, Purchaser shall send a written notice
to the Company, specifying the number of Mandatory Purchase Shares (and the
denominations of the share certificate or certificates thereunder), whether
Purchaser or a designee of Purchaser will be purchasing the Mandatory Purchase
Shares and, if then known, the place, time and date of the closing of such
purchase (the "Mandatory Closing Date" or the "Mandatory Closing"), which date
shall not be less than two business days nor more than ten business days from
the date on which such notice is delivered; PROVIDED, that the Mandatory
Closing shall be held only if (i) such purchase would not otherwise violate or
cause the violation of, any applicable law or regulations (including, the HSR
Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, or the rules of
the NYSE) and (ii) no statute, rule, regulation, decree, order or injunction
shall have been promulgated, enacted, entered into, or enforced by any
governmental agency or authority or court which prohibits delivery of the
Mandatory Purchase Shares, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent
(PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the parties hereto shall use their best efforts to
have any such order,

<PAGE> 4
4

decree or injunction vacated or reversed). In the event the Mandatory Closing
is delayed as a result of clause (i) or (ii) above, the Mandatory Closing Date
shall be within five business days following the cessation of such violation,
statute, rule, regulation, decree, order or injunction, as the case may be.

(c) At the Mandatory Closing, if any, the Company shall deliver to
Purchaser (or its designee) all of the Mandatory Purchase Shares to be
purchased by delivery of a certificate or certificates evidencing such shares
in the denominations designated by Purchaser. If at the time of issuance of
any Mandatory Purchase Shares, the Company shall not have redeemed the Rights,
then each Mandatory Purchase Share issued pursuant to such exercise shall have
attached to it Rights or new rights with terms substantially the same as and at
least as favorable to the Purchaser as are provided under the Rights.

1.4 PAYMENTS. In the event Purchaser exercises the Option (including an
obligatory exercise pursuant to Section 1.3), Purchaser (or, at Purchaser's
option, its designee) shall, at any Closing or Mandatory Closing, as the case
may be, deliver to the Company, such number of shares (rounded to the nearest
whole share) of Holdings Common Stock (the "Exchanged Shares") as shall equal
the product of the Option Exchange Ratio (as defined below) and the number of
Shares purchased pursuant to this Section 1. The "Option Exchange Ratio" shall
mean the quotient (rounded to the nearest 1/100,000) obtained by dividing (i)
$11.00 (the "Option Purchase Price") by (ii) the average of the average of the
high and low prices of Holdings Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock
Exchange Composite Tape on each of the ten consecutive trading days immediately
preceding the second trading day prior to (x) the date of notice of exercise in
the case of an Option Purchase or (y) the date of exercise in the case of a
Mandatory Purchase. In the event that a payment is actually made to Parent
pursuant to Section 8.3(b) of the Merger Agreement, the Option Purchase Price
shall be adjusted upward (retroactively if necessary and net of any taxes or
brokerage fees paid in connection with the sale, tender or exchange of shares
by Purchaser or its designee, which designee must be Parent or a direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent) to reflect (i) with respect to any
Shares sold, tendered, or exchanged in any third party transaction that
triggers a payment pursuant to Section 8.3(b) of the Merger Agreement, the
price per share (subject to the calculation principles set forth in the next
succeeding sentence) actually paid to holders of Common Stock of the Company as
a result of any such third party transaction and (ii) with respect to any
Shares sold, tendered or exchanged to another party or parties by Purchaser (or
its designee) other than pursuant to such third party transaction, the price
per share (subject to the calculation principles set forth in clause (i) of the
next succeeding sentence) actually paid to Purchaser (or its designee) by such
other party or parties in consideration for such Shares (the "Option Purchase
Price Adjustment"). To the extent the "price per share" referred

<PAGE> 5
5

to in the preceding sentence consists in whole or in part of non-cash
consideration, it shall be based on the trading market value thereof or if
there is no trading market for such consideration, the fair market value as
determined by an independent investment banker jointly selected by Purchaser
and the Company. The Option Purchase Price Adjustment shall be payable with
respect to shares actually sold, tendered or exchanged promptly following
receipt of the consideration therefor (and, if necessary, the valuation
thereof), and Purchaser agrees promptly, but in no event later than two
business days following such event, to notify the Company of the receipt of
such consideration. Parent agrees promptly, but in no event later than two
business days following written notice thereof, together with related bills or
receipts, to reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees
and expenses, including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel and the expenses of litigation, incurred in connection
with collecting the Option Purchase Price Adjustment as a result of any willful
breach by Parent of its obligations under this Section 1.4.

(d) BOARD ACTION. The Company's Board of Directors, at a meeting duly
called and held, has approved the execution of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the exercise of the Option, prior
to the execution of this Agreement, and such approval constitutes approval of

contemplated hereby, including the exercise of the Option, for purposes of
Sections 14A:10A-4 and 14A:10A-5 of the New Jersey Business Corporation Act
(the "NJBCA") and Article VIII of the Charter, and the approval of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Board of Directors of the
Company shall also constitute, solely for the purposes of Sections 14A:10-4
and 14A:10-5 of the NJBCA and, to the extent that there are no Continuing
Directors (as defined in the Charter), Article VIII of the Charter, an
approval of any future "Business Combination" (as defined in Section
14A:10A-3 of the NJBCA and Article VIII of the Charter) between the Company
and Parent or any affiliate thereof, provided that (x) such "Business
Combination" is approved by a majority of the Independent Directors and (y)

banking firm selected by the Independent Directors that such "Business
Combination" is fair to the Company's shareholders from a financial point of
view.

(e) RIGHTS AMENDMENT. The Company's Board of Directors has amended the
Rights Agreement prior to the execution of this Agreement and the Merger
Agreement so that neither the execution nor the delivery of this Agreement or
the Merger Agreement or both such agreements, taken together, nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will (i) trigger the
exercisability of the Rights (as defined in the Rights Agreement), the
separation of the Rights from the stock certificates to which they are
attached, or any other provisions of the Rights Agreement, including causing
Parent and/or Purchaser from becoming an Acquiring Person (as defined in the
Rights Agreement), the occurrence of a Distribution Date (as defined in the
Rights Agreement) or a Shares Acquisition Date (as defined in the Rights
Agreement) or (ii) trigger the rights of the holders of the common units of
Borden Chemicals and Plastics Limited Partnership, pursuant to the Second
Amended and Restated Deposit Agreement dated February 16, 1993, to require
the Company to purchase the common units held by them.

<PAGE> 11

(f) GOOD STANDING. The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of New Jersey and
has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement.

(g) DISTRIBUTION. Exchanged Shares acquired by the Company upon exercise
of the Option will not be transferred or otherwise disposed of except in a
transaction registered or exempt from registration under the Securities Act.

3. ADJUSTMENT UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION. In the event of any change
in the number (or conversion or exchange) of issued and outstanding shares of
Common Stock by reason of any stock dividend, split-up, merger,
recapitalization, combination, exchange of shares, spin-off or other change in
the corporate or capital structure of the Company which could have the effect
of diluting or otherwise diminishing Purchaser's rights hereunder (including
any issuance of Common Stock or other equity security of the Company at a price
below the fair value thereof), the number and kind of Shares or other
securities subject to the Option and the Option Exchange Ratio therefor shall
be appropriately adjusted so that Purchaser shall receive upon exercise (or, if
such a change occurs between exercise and Closing or Mandatory Closing, as the
case may be, upon Closing or Mandatory Closing, as the case may be) of the
Option the number and kind of shares or other securities or property that
Purchaser would have received in respect of the Shares that Purchaser is
entitled to purchase upon exercise of the Option if the Option had been
exercised (or the purchase thereunder had been consummated, as the case may be)
immediately prior to such event. The rights of Purchaser under this Section
shall be in addition to, and shall in no way limit, its rights against the
Company for breach of the Merger Agreement.

4. REGISTRATION OF SHARES HELD BY PURCHASER (OR ITS DESIGNEE) UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT. (a) If the Option is exercised, the Company agrees to extend
to Purchaser (or its designee) registration rights on the same terms and
subject to the same conditions as Holdings has extended to Parent pursuant to
the Registration Rights Agreement dated July 15, 1990 between Holdings and
Parent (the "Registration Rights Agreement"); PROVIDED that (i) for purposes of
Section 4(a) of the Registration Rights Agreement, Common Stock of the Company
shall be deemed to have been registered after the date of the agreement under
the Securities Act, (ii) for purposes of Section 4(a) and the definition of
"Demand Party" the reference to 13,600,000 shares of Common Stock shall be
deemed to mean 6,500,000 shares of Common Stock, (iii) for purposes of Section
4(c) of the Registration Rights Agreement, only the first two registrations of
Registrable Securities (as defined in the Rights Agreement) will be at the
expense of the Company and (iv) notices to the respective parties shall be
given as provided in this Agreement.

<PAGE> 12

5. REGISTRATION OF SHARES HELD BY THE COMPANY UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT. If
the Option is exercised, then subject in all respects to the terms and
conditions of the Registration Rights Agreement, the Company shall succeed with
respect to the shares of Holdings Common Stock acquired as a result of the
exercise of the Option to the rights and obligations of a subsequent Holder
under such agreement, unless, in the written opinion of counsel to Holdings,
which opinion shall be delivered to the Company and which shall be reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to the Company and its counsel, registration
of the shares of Holdings Common Stock acquired as a result of the exercise of
the Option is not required to lawfully sell and distribute such shares in the
manner contemplated by the Company. By its execution of this Agreement, the
Company agrees to be bound by the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement.
If the Option is exercised, Parent and the Company agree that the Company will
be entitled to two (2) registrations at the expense of Holdings (or if Holdings
refuses to bear such expenses, at the expense of Parent or Purchaser) of
Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement)
pursuant to Section 4(c) of the Registration Rights Agreement, and, subject to
the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement, such other registrations at its
own expense as it shall request.

6. BOARD OF DIRECTORS. (a) If requested by Parent, the Company shall,
following the exercise of the Option and the purchase of the Shares, and from
time to time thereafter, take all actions necessary to cause the Applicable
Percentage (as defined below) of directors (and of members of each committee of
the Board of Directors) (rounded in each case to the next highest director or
member) of the Company selected by Parent to consist of persons designated or
elected by Parent (whether, at the election of the Company, by means of
increasing the size of the board of directors or seeking the resignation of
directors and causing Parent's designees to be elected). The "Applicable
Percentage" means the ratio of (i) the total voting power of all Shares
purchased in accordance with the exercise of the Option and/or accepted for
exchange pursuant to the Offer to (ii) the total voting power of the
outstanding voting securities of the Company, rounded to the nearest whole
number and expressed as a percentage; provided that if Purchaser has acquired
at least 28,138,000 Shares the Applicable Percentage shall not be less than
33-1/3%.

(b) The Company's obligations to cause designees of Parent to be elected
or appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company shall be subject to
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The
Company shall promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under this Section 6 and shall
include in the Schedule 14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and
its officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.
Parent and Purchaser will supply to the Company any information with respect

<PAGE> 13
13

to any of them and their nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required
by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

(c) Following the election or appointment of Parent's designees pursuant
to this Section 6 and prior to the Effective Time, any amendment by the Company
of this Agreement, extension by the Company for the performance or waiver of
the obligations, conditions or other acts of Parent or Purchaser or waiver by
the Company of its rights hereunder, will require the concurrence of a majority
of the Independent Directors.

7. ANTITRUST FILING AND DIVESTITURES. The Company and Parent shall, as
promptly as practicable, file notification and report forms under the HSR Act
with the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") and make any other necessary
filings with the applicable Governmental Entities related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger Agreement and shall use their
best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries received
from the FTC or the Antitrust Division or such other Governmental Entities for
additional information or documentation. Provided that following receipt of
such approvals Purchaser acquires at least 28,138,000 Shares pursuant to the
exercise of the Option (and/or pursuant to consummation of the Offer), the
Company agrees to make any and all divestitures or undertakings required by the
FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other applicable Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Merger
Agreement, which divestitures in each case shall be reasonably acceptable to
Parent and Purchaser. The costs and expenses of obtaining and complying with
the antitrust requirements of the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other
Governmental Entity shall be paid by the Company. The parties agree to use
their best efforts to cause the other conditions to this Agreement to be
satisfied, and the Company agrees to use its best efforts to cause the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 2.3(d) and 2.3(e) to
continue to be true and correct.

8. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. The initial press release with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be mutually satisfactory to the parties
hereto and thereafter, except as may be required by applicable laws, court
process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with a national
securities exchange, no party shall issue any press release or make any public
filings relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
exercise of the Option, without affording the Company on the one hand, and
Parent on the other, the opportunity to review and comment upon such release or
filing.

9. FURTHER ASSURANCES. From time to time, at the other party's request and
without further consideration, each party hereto shall execute and deliver such
additional documents and take all such further action as may be necessary or
desirable

<PAGE> 14
14

to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, to vest in Purchaser good title to any Shares purchased
hereunder and to vest in the Company good title to any shares of Holdings
Common Stock delivered to the Company hereunder.

10. SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The respective
representations and warranties of the Company, Purchaser and Parent contained
herein or in any certificates or other documents delivered at or prior to any
Closing or Mandatory Closing, as the case may be, shall not survive the closing
of the transactions contemplated hereby, and the agreements contained herein
shall survive the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby.

11. Miscellaneous.

subject matter hereof and thereof and (ii) shall not be assigned by operation
of law or otherwise, provided that Parent and Purchaser may each assign its

perform such obligations. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be

11.6 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but both of
which shall constitute one and the same Agreement.

11.7 DESCRIPTIVE HEADINGS. The descriptive headings used herein are
inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of
or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

11.8 SEVERABILITY. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement will be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable law but if any provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision
or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement will be
reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction as if such invalid,
illegal or unenforceable provision or portion of any provision had never been
contained herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the
event that the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of the Option or upon
the Mandatory Purchase, or the number of shares of Holdings Common Stock to be
delivered as consideration therefore, is held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable for any reason (including as a result of the failure to obtain
any required vote of stockholders to authorize such issuance), the number of
Shares so issuable, and the number of shares of Holdings Common Stock to be so
delivered, shall be reduced to that number which could validly and legally be
issued and/or delivered as the case may be.

first person.

each of the ten consecutive trading days immediately preceding the second
trading day prior to the date of measurement (which shall be agreed upon in
good faith by the Company and Purchaser).

11.10 NON-RECOURSE. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or
implied in this Agreement, Parent covenants, agrees and acknowledges and the
Company, by its acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement, covenants, agrees
and acknowledges that no recourse under this Agreement or any documents or
instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement shall be had against
any officer, agent or employee of Parent or against any partner of Parent or
any director, officer, employee, partner, affiliate or assignee of any of the
foregoing, whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or
equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other

liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by
any officer, agent or employee of Parent or any partner of Parent or any

documents or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement or for any
claim based on, in respect of or by reason of such obligations or their

remedies it may have against the undistributed assets of Parent for the
