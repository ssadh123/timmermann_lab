WESTINGHOUSE REPORTS 1994 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS

PITTSBURGH, April 21 -- Westinghouse Electric Corporation (WX) today
reported first quarter net income of $36 million, or 7 cents per share, 
compared to net income of $3 million, or a loss of 2 cents per share, for the
same quarter a year ago. Income from Continuing Operations was $36 million, 
or 7 cents per share, compared to 1993 first quarter income of $59 million, 
or 14 cents per share.

The 1993 first quarter net income included an after-tax charge of $56
million, or 16 cents per share, due to the adoption of Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) 112, Employers' Accounting for Postemployment
Benefits.

Revenues for the quarter were $1.7 billion compared to $2 billion in the
year-earlier quarter.

Operating profit for the quarter was $65 million compared to $146 million 
in the same quarter last year. Operating profit margin was 3.7 percent compared
to 7.2 percent in the first quarter of 1993. Increased pension expense of $33
million and reduced licensee income of $15 million had a negative impact on
results. The first quarter of 1993 had a favorable impact of $25 million due
to a change in accounting for nuclear fuel revenues.

"Results for the quarter were mixed, but we made significant progress
on a number of strategic initiatives," said Mike Jordan, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer. "In March, we strengthened the financial structure of the
corporation by issuing $520 million in preferred equity.

"In addition, we successfully completed the divestitures of the
Distribution and Control Business Unit and the Westinghouse Electric Supply
Company, which were part of our planned liquidation of non-core businesses. 
Cash proceeds from these sales totaled $1.4 billion. These actions allowed us
to reduce net debt to $3.3 billion at the end of March 1994, down from $5.1
billion at the end of December 1993 and $8.4 billion at the end of December
1992.

"Keeping with our strategy of eliminating non-core businesses, we 
recently announced an agreement to sell the Controlmatic unit in Germany, which
lost money in 1993. The unit is part of the Government and Environmental
Services segment.

"The corporation also has been aggressively pursuing cost reductions
and restructuring initiatives. We reduced the number of employees
corporate-wide by over 1,000 people during the first quarter. Operations such
as our service organization within Power Generation have been consolidated,
underutilized facilities are being shut down or reduced in size, and various
unprofitable product lines are being discontinued. These cost reductions will
generate significant cost improvements over the next year.

"These successes are allowing us to pursue strategic growth initiatives
such as the recent agreement to acquire Norden Systems, a division of United
Technologies, which will become part of our Electronic Systems unit," Mr.
Jordan said.

Norden Systems is a manufacturer of airborne and shipboard radar
systems, air traffic control systems, and surveillance and intelligence
management systems for underseas applications.

Also in the first quarter the corporation was successful in settling
electric utility lawsuits involving steam generators at Duke Power and South
Carolina Electric and Gas.

First quarter results benefited from a one-time pre-tax gain of
approximately $30 million from the sale of two radio stations.

Orders for the first quarter of 1994 were $2 billion, down from $2.2
billion in the year-earlier quarter. Backlog remained at approximately $10
billion.

First Quarter Segment Information
(Please note that Westinghouse has redefined certain segments for financial
reporting purposes. Each core business is now reported as a separate segment.
The first quarter 1993 results have been realigned so that comparisons may be
made.)

BROADCASTING: Revenues and operating profits were up approximately $12
million and $7 million, respectively, in the quarter compared to the same
period of 1993 due primarily to higher revenues in television and continued
cost reductions in the television and radio groups.

ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS: As expected, revenues declined by approximately
$146 million primarily due to the effect in 1993 of the cancellation of the
ASPJ (Airborne Self-Protection Jammer) program. Operating profit was down
approximately $13 million as a result of reduced volume. Backlog for the unit
was $3.8 billion.

GOVERNMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES: Revenues in the segment were up
approximately $7 million for the quarter compared with the same period a year
ago. Because of higher prices in the backlog for the hazardous waste
incinerators at the beginning of 1993, operating profits for the first quarter
of 1993 were higher by $10 million compared to this year. In the commercial
environmental business, continued weakness in the remediation services market
and price pressure in the hazardous waste incineration business contributed to
lower margins.

WESTINGHOUSE REPORTS 1994 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS -5-

THERMO KING: Revenues were up approximately $12 million and operating
profit increased about $1 million for the quarter due to higher sales in the
truck and trailer operations and in service parts. March 1994 orders were the
highest in history and backlog is at record levels.

ENERGY SYSTEMS: Revenues and operating profit were down approximately
$79 million and $55 million, respectively, compared to the same quarter last
year due primarily to decreased licensee income and the favorable effect of a
change in accounting for nuclear fuel revenues in 1993. Orders were up 26
percent over last year, and backlog was $2.7 billion, up $200 million from
1993. 

POWER GENERATION: Revenues declined approximately $97 million
primarily due to several power projects slipping into the second quarter. 
Operating losses increased by approximately $3 million compared to the same
quarter a year ago. End of quarter backlog remained steady at $2.2 billion.

THE KNOLL GROUP: Revenues were about even with the same quarter last
year. Increased marketing and sales expense associated with the launch of new
products and increased distribution efforts, along with continued weakness in
the European market, caused an increased operating loss of approximately $5
million.

WCI COMMUNITIES, INC.: Revenues in the quarter were higher by
approximately $12 million compared to the same quarter of 1993, primarily due
to the continued strong South Florida market. Operating profit increased $2
million over the same period.

OTHER BUSINESSES (INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS & SERVICES, RESOURCE ENERGY

same quarter of 1993. Operating loss increased by approximately $12 million
for the same period.
