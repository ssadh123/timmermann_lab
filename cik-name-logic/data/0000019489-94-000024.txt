CHASE REPORTS RECORD EARNINGS FOR FIRST QUARTER 1994,
UP 138% TO $364 MILLION

The Chase Manhattan Corporation today reported record first quarter
1994 net income of $364 million ($1.80 per share), up 138% from the $153 
million ($.74 per share) reported for the first quarter of 1993.

Thomas G. Labrecque, Chase Chairman said, "We are very pleased with our
results for this quarter. They represent a continuation of the solid
earnings momentum we have established with our strengthened financial
position and sharpened strategic focus. Our ability to report record
earnings, despite the volatility in global markets, reflects the strength
and diversity of our customer base and product capability."

Highlights for the first quarter of 1994:
- strong profitability measures: return on assets and return on common
equity increased to 1.28% and 20.2%, respectively;
- a net interest margin of 4.17%;
- growth in fees and commissions: up 22% over the same period last year,
with increases in all categories;
- trading revenue of $179 million, a level consistent with prior
quarters;
- significant equity gains realized in our merchant banking activities;
- provision for possible credit losses of $160 million, down for the
fourth consecutive quarter.

NET INTEREST REVENUE - TAXABLE EQUIVALENT BASIS
Net interest revenue, on a taxable equivalent basis, was $958 million for
the first quarter of 1994, compared with $1,056 million for the first
quarter of 1993. Excluding first quarter 1993 interest revenue of $142
million from the sale of Brazilian past due interest bonds, net interest
revenue for the first quarter of 1994 increased by $44 million, or 5%, from
the same period last year. Net interest margin was 4.17%, compared with
4.94% (4.28% excluding Brazil PDI bonds) reported for the first quarter of
1993. Average interest-earning assets were $93.1 billion, compared with
$86.7 billion for the same period last year. Average loans decreased to
$61.3 billion for the current quarter from the $62.1 billion level reported
for the first quarter of 1993, primarily due to the reductions in
commercial real estate and refinancing countries loans, which were
partially offset by increases in consumer loans.

</TABLE>

Total trading revenue was $179 million, slightly higher than the revenue
reported for the same period last year. Chase experienced generally good
customer demand for derivative products and foreign exchange transactions.
In addition, substantial revenue was realized in the earlier part of the
quarter from reducing emerging markets trading positions, partially offset
by the effects of the decline in market values during the latter part of
the quarter.

</TABLE>

Fees and commissions were $446 million for the first quarter of 1994, up
22%, reflecting increases in all categories of fee revenue. Total consumer
banking fees, including credit card and mortgage banking fees, increased
23% over the same period last year. Mortgage banking fees for the first
quarter of 1993 were unfavorably impacted by $34 million from the
accelerated write down of mortgage servicing assets, compared with no such
writedowns in the first quarter of 1994.

Fee revenue from trust and fiduciary activities increased 33% due to
increased transaction volume and continued growth in trust and custody
assets in both the Transaction and Information Services and Global Private
Banking units. Investment banking fee revenue from global corporate
finance activities increased 24% over the same period last year due to
improved transaction volume.

</TABLE>

During the first quarter of 1994, corporate finance-related equity gains
resulted from several significant merchant banking transactions, continuing
the strong pace of last year. Further liquidation of real estate assets
held for accelerated disposition and sales of Brady bonds in the investment
securities available for sale portfolio yielded gains of $53 million and
$71 million, respectively.

OPERATING EXPENSES
Total operating expenses were $1,057 million for the first quarter of 1994
and $1,301 million for the first quarter of 1993, which included a $318
million provision for ORE held for accelerated disposition. Operating
expenses for the first quarter of 1994 included $8 million applicable to
the second quarter 1993 acquisition of Troy and Nichols and $37 million of
ORE valuation losses and expenses. First quarter 1993 ORE expenses were
$38 million. In addition, first quarter 1994 operating expenses reflected
the cost of funding business growth opportunities, particularly in Chase's
global trading and capital markets activities, global securities servicing
and national consumer products. The expense to revenue ratio, excluding
ORE expenses, improved to 56%.

INCOME TAXES
The provision for income taxes was $223 million representing an effective
tax rate of 38%. For the first quarter of 1993, Chase recorded a net
income tax benefit of $174 million. Excluding the tax benefits applicable
to the special provisions for the accelerated disposition portfolio,
Chase's first quarter 1993 tax provision would have been approximately $137
million. In addition, Chase adopted SFAS 109 in the first quarter of 1993,
resulting in a $500 million net benefit reflected as a cumulative effect of
a change in accounting principle.

<PAGE> 5
PROVISION FOR POSSIBLE CREDIT LOSSES AND NET LOAN CHARGE-OFFS
The provision for possible credit losses was $160 million, or $35 million
lower than the fourth quarter of 1993 and $200 million lower than the first
quarter of 1993, excluding the accelerated disposition portfolio.

Net loan charge-offs were $156 million, down $64 million from the first
quarter of 1993. Domestic commercial real estate net loan charge-offs
declined $40 million and domestic consumer net loan charge-offs declined $9
million from the first quarter of 1993.

1994, $766 million at December 31, 1993 and $588 million at March
31, 1993.
</TABLE>

Following a large decrease in total nonaccrual outstandings and ORE assets
of approximately $1 billion during the fourth quarter of 1993, such
balances declined $72 million during the first quarter of 1994.

DOMESTIC COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE ASSETS
Domestic commercial real estate assets declined $343 million from 
$4.0 billion at December 31, 1993 to $3.7 billion at March 31, 1994.
Contributing to this decline was approximately $234 million of net
repayments and sales of outstanding assets, including $8 million of
interest applied to principal, and $109 million of charge-offs and
valuation losses.

In addition, the continued liquidation of assets held for accelerated
disposition during the first quarter of 1994, through repayments and
sales, reduced the carrying value of such assets to $121 million and
resulted in pre-tax gains of $53 million.

Chase has entered into an agreement to sell several portfolios of its ORE
assets and of its accelerated disposition portfolio with aggregate carrying
values of approximately $100 million and $60 million, respectively. This
transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 1994 and is
expected to result in a gain.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT
On April 15, 1994, pursuant to the Brazilian restructuring, Chase 
exchanged its eligible Brazilian loans for Brazilian Brady bonds.
The exchange is expected to have a positive impact on Chase's financial
condition, beginning in the second quarter.
