ITEM 5. OTHER EVENTS

HAWAIIAN ELECTRIC COMPANY, INC. RECEIVES INTERIM RATE RELIEF

On March 31, 1994, Hawaiian Electric Company, Inc. (HECO), which
serves the island of Oahu and is Hawaiian Electric Industries, Inc.'s principal
electric utility subsidiary, received an interim decision and order from the
Hawaii Public Utilities Commission (PUC) authorizing an increase of $34.2
million in annual revenues, or approximately 5.5%. The increase is effective
April 1, 1994 and is based on a 12.0% return on average common equity. The
interim order, which contains findings that are subject to further analysis and
possible revision by the PUC, is part of a revised request for an increase of
$53.8 million, or approximately 8.6%, based on a 1994 calendar test year and
12.75% return on average common equity. HECO had proposed interim rate relief
of approximately $39.9 million in annual revenues.

HECO also has filed a rate increase request based on a 1995 calendar
test year. Both requests represent an increase of $106 million, or
approximately 16.7%, over rates in effect before the April 1, 1994 increase.
Revenue from both proposed increases would be used primarily to fund major
transmission and distribution projects on Oahu, including an additional
transmission corridor connecting power plants on the island's west side with
customers throughout Oahu.
