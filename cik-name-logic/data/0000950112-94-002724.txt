On October 13, 1994, The Continental Corporation
issued the following press release:

CONTINENTAL ANNOUNCES NEW CAPITAL INFUSION, NEW CEO,
AND RESERVE STRENGTHENING

Insurance Partners, LP To Invest $200 Million in Preferred Stock
Haverland Named to Succeed Mascotte as Continental's
Chairman and CEO
$400 Million in Reserves Established for IBNR
Environmental Claims

New York, N.Y., October 13, 1994 -- The Continental

Corporation (NYSE: CIC) today announced that it has entered

into a definitive agreement to sell $200 million in

preferred stock, convertible into about 19.9% of its

currently outstanding common stock, to Insurance Partners,

L.P.

Continental also announced that its board of directors

has elected Richard M. Haverland vice chairman and a

director of Continental Corporation. Upon completion of the

proposed transaction, which is expected by year-end,

Haverland will be named chairman and chief executive

officer, succeeding John P. Mascotte, who will resign.

Continental announced that it will strengthen its

reserves by $400 million pre-tax by establishing, for the

first time, loss reserves for incurred but not reported

asbestos-related, environmental pollution and other toxic-

tort claims. The company also announced that it will take 

2

<PAGE>

an additional pre-tax charge of $164 million for reinsurance

recoverables and other assets. These charges will be

reflected in its third quarter results, which the company

expects to report on November 2.

In a separate agreement, Insurance Partners and related

parties have agreed to buy for about $35 million the

operations of Continental Asset Management, the company's

investment management subsidiary.

Insurance Partners, L.P. is a $540 million investment

partnership formed in February 1994 to sponsor acquisitions,

recapitalizations, demutualizations, and other structured

transactions in the property/casualty and life insurance

industries in the U.S. and abroad. Principal partners

include Centre Reinsurance Holdings Ltd.; Keystone, Inc.

(formerly the Robert M. Bass Group); and the Chase Manhattan

Corporation. Insurance Partners Advisors, L.P., of New York

City, is the partnership's advisor.

"The capital infusion, reserve strengthening and sales

of assets, together with the actions taken by the company in

recent months to reduce expenses, exposure to catastrophes

and operating leverage, will all help to restore Continental

to its pre-eminent position in the property/casualty

industry," said Mr. Haverland. "I am looking forward to

leading that effort."

3

<PAGE>

"This strategic agreement will strengthen our capital

base and protect the value of Continental's franchise in the

property/casualty insurance market," said Mr. Mascotte.

"After two months of intensive review of the company,

we've developed great confidence in the fundamental strength

and value of Continental's operating franchise," said Daniel

Doctoroff, managing partner of Insurance Partners Advisors,

LP.

According to the agreement, Insurance Partners will

acquire for cash $200 million in liquidation value of two

series of cumulative preferred stock, each series paying an

annual cash dividend of 9.75%, along with an option to

acquire $125 million in liquidation preference of another

series of non-convertible preferred stock. Of the $200

million, about $165 million will be for a series of

convertible preferred stock, convertible into about 19.9% of

Continental's currently outstanding common shares, at a

conversion price of $15.00 a share. The balance, about $35

million, would be for a series of nonconvertible preferred

stock that would be redeemable under certain circumstances

at a price reflecting any increase in the per share price of

the common stock over $15.00. The two preferred issues will

mature in 15 years, but may be redeemed by the company after

seven years. The option and its underlying preferred stock 

4

<PAGE>

will be redeemable under certain circumstances at a price

reflecting any increase in the per share price of the common

stock over $17.00.

Following the purchase of the preferred stock,

Insurance Partners will be entitled to nominate up to four

directors to serve on Continental's board. Continental has

agreed that it will continue not paying dividends on its

common stock for three years from the time the preferred

stock is sold.

The agreement also contemplates that, following the

investment by Insurance Partners, Continental will further

strengthen its capital base by raising $100 million to be,

at the company's option, in nonconvertible preferred stock

or debt.

The proposed transaction is subject to satisfaction of

closing conditions under the agreement, including regulatory

approvals and expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino act

waiting period. If the agreement is terminated by

Continental in order to enter into an agreement for a merger

or similar transaction, Insurance Partners would be paid a

termination fee of $17.5 million, or if higher, 1.875% of

the aggregate value of the other transaction.

Continental also announced that a number of actuarial

and analytical studies on environmental claims have enabled 

5

<PAGE>

the company to develop a reasonable estimate of loss

reserves for IBNR (incurred but not reported) asbestos,

environmental pollution, and other toxic tort claims. The

company has historically posted reserves for known

environmental claims, but did not establish IBNR reserves,

due to the difficulty in estimating their future financial

impact. The company noted that its new $400 million IBNR

reserves, when combined with its current case reserves of

$200 million for known environmental claims, would comprise

approximately nine times its average annual paid loss for

such claims, a ratio which the company believes is well

above the industry average.

Also, Continental will conduct its regular annual in-

depth review of its core (non-environmental) reserves at

year-end. This review could result in substantial

additional reserve strengthening.

In a separate agreement, Insurance Partners and related

parties have agreed to buy the operations of Continental

Asset Management for about $35 million. Under the terms of

this agreement, Continental has an option to purchase a 20%

interest in these operations, and CAM will continue to

provide asset management services to Continental. The

proposed transaction is subject to satisfaction of closing 

6

<PAGE>

conditions, including financing and applicable regulatory

approvals.

Continental Asset Management is an investment advisory

firm which manages Continental's investment portfolio and

provides investment management services for outside clients,

including property/casualty insurance companies.

Haverland, the CEO-designate of Continental, has almost

25 years of experience in the insurance business. For the

past three years, he has been Executive Vice President -

Insurance Operations of American Premier Underwriters, Inc.,

which wrote $1.4 billion in premiums in 1993. From 1984 to

1991, he was executive vice president of Great American

Insurance Company, and from 1970 to 1983, he was with the

Progressive Corporation, where he was president and chief

operating officer, beginning in 1979.

Continental has over the last six months undertaken a

series of actions to improve its profitability and financial

position. These actions include a dramatic reduction in

commercial and personal package insurance writings to

improve profitability and to lower the company's potential

exposure to catastrophe losses; transferring $40 million of

capital from the parent company into its domestic insurance

operations; entering into a personal lines quota-share

arrangement with an outside reinsurer to lower its operating

7

<PAGE>

leverage; cutting pre-tax annual expenses by over $100

million by eliminating 2,300 positions in the company, and,

most recently, reaching agreements to sell its Canadian

operations and Casualty Insurance unit. The company

announced that it had also increased its U.S. statutory

surplus by redeploying over $200 million to its domestic

insurance operations. These actions are expected to reduce

Continental's premium to surplus ratio from a high of about

3:1 earlier this year to below 2:1 in 1995.

The Continental Corporation is a property/casualty

insurance organization headquartered in New York City. Its

subsidiaries are leading writers of commercial and personal

package policies and select specialty coverages through

major independent agents and brokers.

Earlier in the year, Continental announced its intent

to sell Casualty Insurance as part of a multi-faceted effort

to strengthen Continental's capital base.

Casualty Insurance, based in Chicago, is the leading

writer of workers' compensation insurance in Illinois. The

unit also has facilities operating in Wisconsin, Indiana,

Michigan and California. In 1993, Casualty wrote $362

million in premiums, overwhelmingly in the midwest.

The proposed transaction is subject to completion of a

definitive agreement, regulatory approvals, and satisfaction

of other closing conditions under the agreement.

Fremont General Corporation is a diversified insurance

and financial services holding company. In 1993, its

California-based subsidiary Fremont Compensation Insurance

Company generated $431 million in direct voluntary workers'

compensation premiums in California and Arizona.

The Continental Corporation, headquartered in New York

City, is a property/casualty insurance organization with

about $4 billion in annual revenues. Its subsidiaries are

to ask such questions as it deemed necessary, and to receive
answers from, representatives of the Company concerning the
merits and risks of investing in the Shares, the Option and
the Option Shares and to obtain such additional information
that the Company possesses or can acquire without unreason-
able effort or expense that is necessary to verify the
accuracy and completeness of the information contained in
the SEC Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained in this Section 5.3 shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by the Company.

ing, hypothecating or granting a security interest in, or

holder of such security interest forecloses on such Shares,
Conversion Shares or Exchange Notes, it may do so only if
such pledgee, mortgagee or holder of such security interest
agrees to be bound by the restrictions of this Section 6.1
and Section 6.4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if none of
the events specified in any of clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv)
above has occurred (whether before or after termination of
the Restricted Period), then the Purchaser shall not, prior
to the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, Transfer any
Shares, Conversion Shares or Exchange Notes issued with
respect to the Shares to any person or entity who after such
Transfer will own (to the knowledge of the Purchaser, based 

33

entity, and knowledge available from a review of publicly
available filings made by such person or entity with respect
to the beneficial ownership of Common Stock under Section 13
of the Exchange Act) more than 5% of the Common Stock of the

Subsidiaries or engage in any negotiations concerning, or
provide any confidential information or data to, or have any

Proposal, or otherwise facilitate directly or indirectly any
effort or attempt to make or implement an Acquisition

be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with
respect to any of the foregoing. The Company will take the
necessary steps to inform the individuals or entities
referred to in the first sentence hereof of the obligations

notify the Purchaser if any such inquiries or proposals are
received by, any such information is requested from, or any

Company shall be entitled to sell or otherwise dispose of
all or any substantial portion of the capital stock of
Casualty, The Continental Insurance Company of Canada or
Lombard Insurance Company Limited, may have and continue
negotiations with respect thereto and may provide informa-
tion with regard thereto. 

6.10 Permitted Disposition. Notwithstanding
---------------------
Section 6.9, prior to the Closing, the Company may continue
to solicit offers or proposals for a merger, consolidation
or business combination that would result in a change in
ownership of more than 50% of the securities of the Company
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, to
sell all or substantially all of the Company's assets or to
sell more than 50% of the outstanding securities of the
Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors (each a "Control Transaction"). The Company will
promptly inform the Purchaser if any inquiries or proposals
with respect to a Control Transaction are received by it,
but will not be required to inform the Purchaser of the
identity of the person or entity that makes such inquiry or
proposal or the terms of such Control Transaction. The
Company or the Purchaser may at any time prior to the
Closing elect to terminate this Agreement if the Company has
entered into a definitive agreement with respect to a
Control Transaction, at which time neither party shall have
any further obligations hereunder (other than the repre-
sentation set forth in Section 4.18 and the covenants and
agreements set forth in this Section 6.10, Section 6.12,
Section 8, Section 13.1 or Section 13.2, which shall survive
any such termination), except that upon such termination,
the Company shall promptly (A) pay to the Purchaser a fee
equal to the greater of (i) $17.5 million or (ii) (1) 1-7/8%
multiplied by (2) the Applicable Consideration (as herein-
after defined) and (B) reimburse the Purchaser, the Initial
Purchaser, Insurance Partners, L.P., Insurance Partners
Offshore (Bermuda), L.P., CAM Investment Management, L.P.,
and any of their respective Affiliates for all Transaction
Expenses (including any costs of collection of such expenses
or the fee payable pursuant to clause (A)), not to exceed
(a) $6,000,000 with respect to any such expenses incurred on
or prior to the date hereof and (b) $4,000,000 with respect
to any such expenses incurred after the date hereof (of 

41

<PAGE>

which no more than $2,000,000 shall be expenses incurred in
connection with the potential acquisition by an Affiliate of
the Purchaser of Casualty. For the purposes of calculating
the Transaction Expenses reimbursable pursuant to clause (B)
of the immediately preceding sentence, the aggregate amount
of investment banking fees to be reimbursed shall be deemed
to be an amount equal to $250,000 for each weekly period (or
portion thereof) commencing on August 30, 1994 to (and
including) the date on which this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to this Section 6.10 (rounded up to the nearest
whole number) and shall in no event exceed (x) $1,000,000
with respect to any such investment banking fees incurred
prior to the date hereof and (y) $1,000,000 with respect to
any such investment banking fees incurred after the date
hereof. "Applicable Consideration" means (I) in the case of
the sale of the assets of the Company, the amount of the
cash and the Fair Market Value of any securities or other
property received by the Company as consideration for such
assets, plus the value of any assets not sold by the Company
(such value to be calculated utilizing the same multiple of
the book value that was used to determine the consideration
paid for the assets sold by the Company) and (II) in the
case of a sale of more than 50% of the securities of the
Company entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors or a merger, consolidation or business combination
of the Company, the product of (A) the amount of the cash
and the Fair Market Value of any securities or other
property received by the holders of Common Stock, in each
case calculated on a per share basis for each share sold or
exchanged in such transaction, and (B) the number of shares
of Common Stock outstanding on September 9, 1994. For the
purposes of clause (II), if the same consideration is not
received with respect to all shares of Common Stock sold or
exchanged in such transaction, then the Applicable
Consideration will be calculated on the basis of the
weighted average of the per share consideration received
with respect to all shares of Common Stock sold or exchanged
in such transaction. "Fair Market Value" means, with
respect to securities or other property, the fair market
value of such securities or other property as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company.

6.11 Access. Upon reasonable notice prior
------
to the Closing, the Company shall (and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to) afford the officers, employees,
counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives of

properties, books, contracts and records and personnel and
advisors (who will be instructed by the Company to cooper-
ate) and the Company shall (and shall cause each of the
Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the Purchaser all
information concerning its business, properties and per-
sonnel as the Purchaser or its Representatives may reason-
ably request, provided that any review will be conducted in
a way that will not interfere unreasonably with the conduct
of the Company's business, and provided, further, that no
review pursuant to this Section 6.11 shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company. The Purchaser will keep all information and
documents obtained pursuant to this Section 6.11 on a
confidential basis in accordance with the Letter Agreement
referred to in Section 13.8.

6.12 Publicity. Except as required by law,

Company or any of its Affiliates nor (B) the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates shall, without the consent of the
other, make any public announcement or issue any press
release with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In no event will either (i) the Company or
any of its Affiliates or (ii) the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates make any public announcement or issue any press
release without consulting with the other party, to the
extent possible, as to the content of such public
announcement or press release.

-------------------
not declare or make any Restricted Payment.

6.14 Reservation of Shares. The Company
---------------------
shall at all times reserve and keep available, out of its
authorized and unissued stock, solely for the purpose of
effecting the conversion of Series E Preferred Stock or the

shares of Common Stock free of preemptive rights as shall
from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of
all shares of Series E Preferred Stock from time to time.

6.15 Issuance of New Preferred Stock or New
--------------------------------------
Senior Notes. Within 45 days of the Closing, the Company
------------
will deliver to the Purchaser a draft of either a Private

respect to the offering and sale of the New Preferred Stock
or the New Senior Notes pursuant to which the Company will 

43

<PAGE>

receive gross proceeds of at least $100,000,000. If the
Company shall propose to sell the New Preferred Stock or the
New Senior Notes, as applicable, in a public offering, such
Registration Statement on Form S-3 (if the Company is then
eligible to use Form S-3) shall be filed with the SEC within
30 days of the Closing Date. The Company shall use its best
efforts to consummate such private placement or public
offering within 210 days of the Closing. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Company shall fail to perform any of
its obligations under this Section 6.15, the Purchaser's
sole remedy shall be the increase in the dividend rate on
the Shares and the Option Shares in accordance with the
Certificate of Amendment or the increase in the interest
rate of the Exchange Notes in accordance with the Exchange
Notes.

6.16 Shareholders Rights Plan. The Company
------------------------
shall not adopt a shareholders right plan, poison pill or
similar arrangement unless such plan or arrangement shall
provide that (A) each holder of a share of Series E
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive thereunder,
upon conversion of a share of Series E Preferred Stock (in
accordance with the terms of the Certificate of Amendment)
prior to the earlier to occur of either the date of redemp-
tion of the rights issued under such plan or the date of
expiration of the rights issued under the plan, rights for
each Conversion Share issued upon conversion of such share
of Series E Preferred Stock in an amount equal to the amount
of rights issued with respect to each outstanding share of
Common Stock pursuant to such plan, (B) holders of
Conversion Shares shall be paid the redemption price of any
rights issued thereunder when such rights are redeemed
(unless the Conversion Price with respect to such Conversion
Shares shall have been adjusted as a result of such
redemption as contemplated by the Certificate of Amendment)
and (C) the acquisition, ownership, voting or other exercise
of rights and privileges with respect thereto by members of
the Purchaser Group of Shares, Option Shares, Exchange
Notes, shares of Common Stock, the Option or any other
security of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not
prohibited by this Agreement will not trigger any
distribution pursuant to such plan or otherwise cause the
Purchaser or the members of the Purchaser Group to be
treated in a manner differently from shareholders of the
Company generally. The provisions of clauses (A) and (B) of
this Section 6.16 shall inure to the benefits of all holders
of Series E Preferred Stock or Conversion Shares, whether or
not the Initial Purchaser.

6.17 Board Representation.
--------------------

(A) The Purchaser Designees appointed
to the Company's Board of Directors effective as of the
Closing Date (as contemplated by Section 3.1.18) shall be
appointed to serve until the next succeeding annual meeting
of shareholders of the Company to be held after such elec-
tion. Commencing with such annual meeting of shareholders
of the Company and at each annual meeting of shareholders of
the Company thereafter, the Initial Purchaser shall be
entitled to nominate to the Company's Board of Directors (in
addition to any rights granted to the holders of Shares or
Option Shares as set forth in the Certificate of Amendment)
(i) if the Company's Board of Directors consists of thirteen
or fourteen members, three directors or (ii) if the
Company's Board of Directors consists of fifteen, sixteen or
seventeen members, four directors. The Company shall cause
such Purchaser Designees (unless, after customary investiga-
tion of any Purchaser Designee's qualifications, the Board
of Directors reasonably determines in good faith that such
person is not qualified or acceptable under standards
applied fairly and equally to all nominees, in which event
the Initial Purchaser shall designate another person that
meets the foregoing standards) to be included in the slate
of nominees recommended by the Board of Directors or the
Nominating Committee to the Company's shareholders for
election as directors, and the Company shall use its best
efforts to cause the election of such designees, including
voting all shares for which the Company holds proxies
(unless otherwise directed by the shareholder submitting
such proxy) or is otherwise entitled to vote, in favor of
the election of such persons. Notwithstanding the fore-
going, the Initial Purchaser's right to nominate members of
the Board of Directors shall be reduced as follows, if, but
only if, the Initial Purchaser has Transferred shares of
Series E Preferred Stock, Conversion Shares or Exchange
Notes issued with respect to the Series E Preferred Stock
and as a result no longer holds at least 75% of the Original
Investment:

If the Board of Directors is composed of 15, 16 or

17 members:

"Original Investment" shall mean the aggregate number of
shares of Series E Preferred Stock issued at the Closing,
the aggregate number of Conversion Shares into which such
shares could be converted, the aggregate principal amount of
Exchange Notes for which such shares could be exchanged, or
any combination of the foregoing; provided, however, that in
-------- -------
determining the amount of the Original Investment at any
time remaining, no shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall
be included to the extent that such Shares have been
converted into Conversion Shares or exchanged for Exchange
Notes and no Exchange Notes shall be included to the extent
that such Exchange Notes have been converted into Conversion
Shares.

46

<PAGE>

(B) For so long as the Initial
Purchaser has the right to nominate at least one director,
commencing with the annual meeting of the Board of Directors
of the Company next succeeding the Closing, and at each
annual meeting of the Board of Directors thereafter, the
Initial Purchaser shall be entitled to such number of
Purchaser Designees to be appointed to each committee of the
Board of Directors (including the Nominating Committee) as
follows: (A) (i) if the Nominating Committee is composed
of three members, one Purchaser Designee shall be appointed
thereto or (ii) if the Nominating Committee is composed of
five members, two Purchaser Designees shall be appointed
thereto; and (B) such number (which number shall be at least
one and shall be rounded to the nearest whole number) of
Purchaser Designees shall be appointed to each other
committee of the Board of Directors equal to the product of
the total number of persons on such committee (including
Purchaser Designees) and a fraction the numerator of which
is the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock the
shares of Series E Preferred Stock owned by the Initial
Purchaser are convertible into and (2) the number of
Conversion Shares owned by the Initial Purchaser and the
denominator of which is the total number of outstanding
securities of the Company entitled to vote generally in the
election of directors (assuming conversion of the outstand-
ing shares of Series E Preferred Stock). If the Initial
Purchaser holds Exchange Notes issued with respect to the
Series E Preferred Stock, the foregoing fraction shall be
calculated assuming conversion of such Exchange Notes. If
the Initial Purchaser Transfers shares of Series E Preferred
Stock, Conversion Shares or Exchange Notes issued with
respect to the Series E Preferred Stock and as a result no
longer holds all of the Original Investment, its right to
have Purchaser Designees appointed to the committees (other
than the Nominating Committee) of the Board of Directors
shall be reduced so that such number of Purchaser Designees
on each such committee equals the product of the total
number of persons on such committee (including Purchaser
Designees) and a fraction the numerator of which is the sum
of (a) the number of shares of Common Stock the shares of
Series E Preferred Stock owned by the Initial Purchaser are
convertible into and (b) the number of Conversion Shares
owned by the Initial Purchaser and the denominator of which
is the total number of outstanding securities of the Company
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors
(assuming conversion of the outstanding shares of Series E
Preferred Stock) rounded to the nearest whole number. If
the Initial Purchaser holds Exchange Notes issued with 

47

<PAGE>

respect to the Series E Preferred Stock, the foregoing
fraction shall be calculated assuming conversion of such
Exchange Notes. The number of Purchaser Designees that the
Initial Purchaser shall be entitled to have appointed to the
Nominating Committee shall be reduced only to the extent
such that such number does not exceed the number of
Purchaser Designees that the Initial Purchaser shall have
the right to nominate to the Board of Directors.

(C) In the event any Purchaser Designee
shall cease to serve as a director for any reason (other
than by reason of a reduction of the number of Purchaser
Designees entitled to be members of the Board of Directors)
the Company shall cause the vacancy resulting thereby to be
filled by another Purchaser Designee. If a Purchaser
Designee ceases to serve on a committee of the Board of
Directors (other than by reason of a reduction of the number
of Purchaser Designees entitled to be members of such com-
mittee), such Purchaser Designee shall be replaced by
another Purchaser Designee.

(D) So long as the Initial Purchaser
retains the right pursuant to this Section 6.17 to designate
one or more Purchaser Designees, the Board of Directors
shall be composed of no less than thirteen or more than
seventeen members (except if additional members are elected
in accordance with the Certificate of Amendment or pursuant
to the terms of the New Preferred Stock) and the size of the
Nominating Committee shall be either three or five members,
except, in either case, on account of vacancies caused by
the resignations of members.

(E) The Initial Purchaser shall appoint
the Initial Purchaser Representative to act on its behalf,
vis-a-vis the Company, concerning the designation of
nominees to the Company's Board of Directors and the Company
shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon any instructions
given to it by the Initial Purchaser Representative pursuant
to this Section 6.17.

6.18 Specified Corporate Action. The
--------------------------
Company will not consummate, or agree to consummate, any
transaction that would constitute a Specified Corporate
Action unless at the time of the consummation of such
transaction (A) the Company has sufficient funds legally
available to it (after giving effect to such transaction) to
redeem at the then applicable price all outstanding shares
of Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock and 

48

<PAGE>

Series G Preferred Stock pursuant to the Certificate of
Amendment, (B) such redemption shall not be prohibited by
any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, by applicable law or otherwise,
(C) the Board of Directors of the Company, including a
majority of the directors who are not officers or employees
of the Company, shall have adopted a resolution confirming
that such funds are available and that the holders of
Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock and
Series G Preferred Stock have the right to require such
redemption and (D) the Company has set aside sufficient
funds through the Mandatory Redemption Date to redeem the
shares of Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock
and Series G Preferred Stock held by such holders (except
that no funds need be set aside with respect to such Shares
held by any such holder who has thereto fore notified the
Company that it will not require redemption of such shares).

6.19 Regulatory Approvals. The Company
--------------------
shall take all steps necessary, and the Purchaser and its
Affiliates shall reasonably cooperate therein, such that no
approvals by any federal or state bank regulatory authority
will be required to be obtained by the Company, any
Subsidiary of the Company, the Purchaser or any Affiliate
thereof in order to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, other than as may be provided in certain
agreed upon arrangements with such authorities, which shall
be reasonably satisfactory to the Purchaser and the Company
(the "Bank Regulatory Arrangements"). Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Section 6.19, the Purchaser shall
not be required to take any actions, or enter into any
arrangements that will subject the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to regulation or oversight by any federal or
state bank regulatory authority or impose any restrictions
upon the operations of the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (other than restrictions on any banking or non-
banking transactions between the Purchaser and its
Affiliates and California Central Bank Trust Corporation
(the "Bank") and restrictions on the Purchaser and its
Affiliates seeking to direct the management or policies of
the Bank).

6.20 Regulatory Documents. The Purchaser 
--------------------

49

<PAGE>

shall not include in any Forms A or similar information
statements filed by it with any insurance regulatory
authority in connection with seeking the approval of such
authority of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading; provided,
--------
however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any informa-
-------
tion supplied by the Company or any of its representatives
or Affiliates to the Purchaser for inclusion in any such
statement and included by the Purchaser in any such
statement.

7. STANDSTILL.

7.1 Prohibited Activities. The Purchaser
---------------------
hereby agrees that during the Standstill Period (hereinafter
defined) it will not, nor will it permit any member of the
Purchaser Group to, directly or indirectly, unless in any
such case specifically requested in advance to do so by the
Board of Directors of the Company:

(A) acquire, offer to acquire, or
agree to acquire by purchase or by joining a part-
nership, limited partnership, syndicate or other
"group" (as such term is used in Section 13(d)(3)
of the Exchange Act, hereinafter referred to as
"13D Group"), any securities of the Company
entitled to vote generally in the election of
directors, or securities convertible into or
exercisable or exchangeable for such securities
(collectively, "Restricted Securities") or any
material portion of the assets or businesses of
the Company and its Subsidiaries; provided,
--------
however, that nothing contained herein shall
-------
prohibit any member of the Purchaser Group from
(x) consummating the transactions contemplated by
the CAM Agreement or (y) acquiring any Restricted
Securities (i) upon conversion of convertible
securities of the Company currently owned by the
Purchaser Group or acquired pursuant to this
Agreement or upon exercise of the Option, (ii) as
a result of a stock split, stock dividend or
similar recapitalization by the Company,
(iii) upon the execution of unsolicited buy orders
by any member of the Purchaser Group that is a
registered broker-dealer for the bona fide account
of accounts managed by it that are unaffiliated 

50

<PAGE>

and not acting in concert with any member of the
Purchaser Group, or (iv) pursuant to the exercise
of any warrant, option or other right to acquire
Restricted Securities ("Rights") that it receives
directly from the Company pursuant to a distri-
bution to stockholders or from acquiring such
Rights directly from the Company; provided
--------
further, that if during the Standstill Period, as
-------
a result of a business combination transaction
between the Company or an affiliate of the Company
and any other entity which is not an affiliate of
any member of the Purchaser Group (an "Other
Entity"), any one or more members of the Purchaser
Group shall acquire beneficial ownership (within
the meaning of Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act) of
Restricted Securities in such business combina-
tion, such members may continue to own bene-
ficially such Restricted Securities so acquired by
such members and such Restricted Securities shall
continue to be subject to the provisions of this
Section;

(B) participate in, or encourage,
the formation of any 13D Group which owns or seeks
to acquire beneficial ownership of, or otherwise
acts in respect of, Restricted Securities;

(C) make, or in any way
participate in, directly or indirectly, any
"solicitation" of "proxies" (as such terms are
defined or used in Regulation 14A under the
Exchange Act) or become a "participant" in any
"election contest" (as such terms are defined or
used in Rule 14a-11 under the Exchange Act) with
respect to the Company, or initiate, propose or
otherwise solicit stockholders for the approval of
one or more stockholder proposals with respect to
the Company or induce or attempt to induce any
other person to initiate any stockholder proposal,
provided, however, that the limitation contained
in this paragraph (C) shall not apply to any
matter to be voted on by the Company's stock-
holders that is not initiated or proposed by any
member of the Purchaser Group or any Affiliate
thereof or the solicitation by any member of the
Purchaser Group of proxies for the election to the
Board of Directors of the Company of any Purchaser
Designee;

51

<PAGE>

(D) except as permitted by the
Certificate of Amendment or this Agreement, call
or seek to have called any meeting of the stock-
holders of the Company; or

(E) otherwise act, directly or
indirectly, alone or in concert with others, to
seek to control the management, Board of
Directors, policies or affairs of the Company, or
solicit, propose, seek to effect or negotiate with
the Company or any other person with respect to
any form of business combination transaction with
the Company or any affiliate thereof (other than
an Other Entity with respect to which any member
of the Purchaser Group or any affiliate thereof
shall have filed a Schedule 13D with the SEC with
respect to any class of equity securities of such
Other Entity prior to the public announcement of
the Company's intent to consummate a business
transaction with such Other Entity) or any
restructuring, recapitalization or similar trans-
action with respect to the Company or any affi-
liate thereof (except as aforesaid), or solicit,
make or propose or encourage or negotiate with any
other person with respect to, or announce an
intent to make, any tender offer or exchange offer
for any Restricted Securities (other than an
exchange of shares of Series E Preferred Stock for
Conversion Shares or the exchange of Shares or
Option Shares for Exchange Notes as contemplated
by the Certificate of Amendment) or disclose an
intent, purpose, plan or proposal with respect to
the Company or any Restricted Securities inconsis-
tent with the provisions of this Section 7.1,
including an intent, purpose, plan or proposal
that is conditioned on or would require the
Company to waive the benefit of, or amend, any
provisions of this Section 7.1, or assist, parti-
cipate in, facilitate, encourage or solicit any
effort or attempt by any person to do or seek to
do any of the foregoing; provided, however, that
-------- -------
it is agreed that nothing herein shall affect the
right of any Purchaser Designee (i) to act as a
member of the Board of Directors of the Company or
any committee thereof and (ii) to take any action
necessary or advisable to carry out his obliga-
tions as a director of the Company.

52

<PAGE>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any breach of Sec-
tion 7.1(A) caused by an acquisition of a non-material
amount of Restricted Securities shall have been cured within
30 days after the Purchaser becomes aware of such breach,
then no breach of this Section 7.1 shall be deemed to have
occurred.

7.2 Voting and Other Rights. Nothing in
-----------------------
this Section 7 shall preclude members of the Purchaser
Group, (A) from exercising the voting and other rights
granted to the Purchasers pursuant to this Agreement or any
of the Transaction Documents or (B) in the case of any
proposed merger, sale of assets or similar transaction that
under the Certificate of Amendment requires a vote of the
holders of Restricted Securities and has been approved or
recommended by the Board of Directors of the Company, or in
the case of a tender or exchange offer made without
encouragement by or the participation of the Purchaser or
any of its affiliates (if the Board of Directors of the
Company shall send to shareholders a statement that the
Board of Directors (i) recommends approval of such tender or
exchange offer, or (ii) is neutral with respect to such
tender or exchange offer) from making an offer to the Board
of Directors of the Company, in respect of such transaction,
upon terms more favorable to the Company or its stockholders
than those of the other transaction, as proposed.

7.3 Standstill Period. As used herein, the

a "Termination Event"):

not be a Termination Event with respect to any
provision of Section 7.1 except the provisions
contained therein prohibiting the Purchaser or its
Affiliates from making a tender offer for all the
outstanding shares of Common Stock or entering
into an agreement of merger or consolidation
(including soliciting, making, proposing or
negotiating with respect thereto, or announcing an
interest to make such a tender offer or to
consummate such a merger or consolidation);

Subsidiary of the Company, has had or would have a
Material Adverse Effect; or an involuntary case is
commenced against the Company or any of its

after commencement of the case, which, in the case
of a Subsidiary of the Company, has had or would
have a Material Adverse Effect; or a custodian (as
defined in the Bankruptcy Code) is appointed for,

of the Company, has had or would have a Material
Adverse Effect; or the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries commences any other proceeding under
any reorganization, arrangement, adjustment of
debt, relief of debtors, rehabilitation, dissolu-
tion, insolvency or liquidation or similar law of
any jurisdiction, whether now or hereafter in
effect, relating to the Company or such
Subsidiary, or there is commenced against the

receipt by such person or 13D Group of the
Company's agreement or consent to make such

Event with respect to such transferee and its Affiliates.

8. INDEMNIFICATION.

8.1 Indemnification by the Company. In
------------------------------
addition to all other sums due hereunder or provided for in
this Agreement, the Company agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Initial Purchaser and its Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, agents, employees,
subsidiaries, partners and controlling persons (each, an 

56

<PAGE>

"indemnified party") to the fullest extent permitted by law
from and against any and all losses, claims, damages,
expenses (including reasonable fees, disbursements and other
charges of counsel) or other liabilities ("Liabilities")
resulting from any breach of any covenant, agreement,
representation or warranty of the Company in this Agreement
or any legal, administrative or other actions brought by any
person or entity, proceedings or investigations (whether
formal or informal), or written threats thereof, based upon,
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any
Transaction Document, the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, or any indemnified person's role therein or in
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby; provided,
--------
however, that the Company shall not be liable under this
-------
Section 8.1: (i) for any amount paid in settlement of
claims without the Company's consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld) or (ii) to the extent that it
is finally judicially determined that such Liabilities
resulted primarily from a breach by the Purchaser of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the
Purchaser contained in this Agreement or the willful
misconduct of the Purchaser; provided further, that if and
-------- -------
to the extent that such indemnification is unenforceable for
any reason, the Company shall make the maximum contribution
to the payment and satisfaction of such indemnified
liability that shall be permissible under applicable laws. 
In connection with the obligation of the Company to
indemnify for Liabilities as set forth above, the Company
further agrees to reimburse each indemnified party for all
such expenses (including reasonable fees, disbursements and
other charges of counsel) as they are incurred by such
indemnified party.

8.2 Notification. Each indemnified party
------------
under this Section 8 will, promptly after the receipt of
notice of the commencement of any action or other proceeding
against such indemnified party in respect of which indemnity
may be sought from the Company under this Section 8, notify
the Company in writing of the commencement thereof. The
omission of any indemnified party so to notify the Company
of any such action shall not relieve the Company from any
liability that it may have to such indemnified party
(A) other than pursuant to this Section 8 or (B) under this
Section 8 unless, and only to the extent that, such omission
results in the Company's forfeiture of substantive rights or
defenses. In case any such action or other proceeding shall
be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify
the Company of the commencement thereof, the Company shall 

57

<PAGE>

be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that
it may wish, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided,
--------
however, that any indemnified party may, at its own expense,
-------
retain separate counsel to participate in such defense. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in any action or proceeding
in which both the Company and an indemnified party is, or is
reasonably likely to become, a party, such indemnified party
shall have the right to employ separate counsel at the
Company's expense and to control its own defense of such
action or proceeding if, in the reasonable opinion of
counsel to such indemnified party, (i) there are or may be
legal defenses available to such indemnified party or to
other indemnified parties that are different from or
additional to those available to the Company or (ii) any
conflict or potential conflict exists between the Company
and such indemnified party that would make such separate
representation advisable; provided, however, that (1) any
-------- -------
such separate counsel employed by the indemnified party at
the Company's expense shall be reasonably satisfactory to
the Company, (2) the indemnified party will not, without the
prior written consent of the Company, settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in such action or
proceeding unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of the Company from all
liability arising or that may arise out of such action or
proceeding relating to any matter subject to indemnification
hereunder and (3) in no event shall the Company be required
to pay fees and expenses under this Section 8 for more than
one firm of attorneys representing the indemnified parties
in any jurisdiction in any one legal action or group of
related legal actions. The Company agrees that the Company
will not, without the prior written consent of the
Purchaser, settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or pro-
ceeding relating to any matter subject to indemnification
hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of the Purchaser and each
other indemnified party from all liability arising or that
may arise out of such claim, action or proceeding. The
rights accorded to indemnified parties hereunder shall be in
addition to any rights that any indemnified party may have
at common law, by separate agreement or otherwise.

8.3 Registration Rights Agreement. Notwith-
-----------------------------
standing anything to the contrary in this Section 8, the
indemnification and contribution provisions of the
Registration Rights Agreement shall govern any claim made

representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement and (B) that the representation
contained in Section 4.18 and the covenants and agreements

thereof has been waived in accordance with the terms hereof
for all purposes and at all times by the parties to whom the
benefit of such performance is to be rendered). The waiver
by any party to this Agreement of a breach of any provision

assets of the Corporation at the time legally available therefor, cumulative

of the assets of the Corporation at the time legally available therefor, a
cumulative cash dividend in respect of each share of Series E Preferred Stock in

Directors in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.17 of the Securities
Purchase Agreement, (2) all dividends accrued to date on the Series E Preferred

9.75%, subject to being increased to a rate of 11.75% in the 

4

<PAGE>

event of each and every subsequent event of the character indicated above.

(c) Dividends payable pursuant to Section 2(a) shall begin to accrue
and be cumulative from the Issue Date, and shall accrue on a daily basis, in
each case whether or not declared. Dividends paid on the shares of Series E
Preferred Stock in an amount less than the total amount of such dividends at the

annual meeting of stockholders, on all matters voted on by holders of Common
Stock voting together as a single class with other shares entitled to vote
thereon. With respect to any such vote, each share of Series E Preferred Stock
shall entitle the holder thereof to cast that number of votes per share as is
equal to the number of votes that such holder would be entitled to cast had such
holder converted his shares of Series E Preferred Stock into Common Stock on the
record date for determining the stockholders of the Corporation eligible to vote
on any such matters.

5

<PAGE>

(b) Unless the consent or approval of a greater number of shares

stockholders called for the purpose, shall be necessary to (i) authorize, adopt

as to affect the shares of Series E Preferred Stock adversely or (iii) effect
the voluntary liquidation, dissolution, winding up, recapitalization or
reorganization of the Corporation, or the consolidation or merger of the

another Person of all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation;
provided, however, that no separate vote of the holders of Series E Preferred
- -------- -------
Stock shall be required to effect any of the transactions described in clause
(iii) above unless such transaction would either require a class vote pursuant
to clause (i) or (ii) above or would require a vote by any shareholders of the
Corporation; provided further, that no separate vote of the holders of the
-------- -------
Series E Preferred Stock as a class shall be required in the case of a
recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation or merger of, or sale by, the
Corporation if (A)(a) such recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation,
merger or sale constitutes a Specified Corporate Action, (b) the Corporation has
sufficient funds legally available to it (after giving effect to such
transaction) to redeem, at the then applicable price hereunder and pursuant to
the terms hereof, all the outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock,
(c) such redemption shall not be prohibited by any agreement to which the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, by applicable law or
otherwise, (d) the Board of Directors of the Corporation, including a majority
of the directors who are not officers or employees of the Corporation, shall
have adopted a resolution confirming that such funds are available and that the
holders of Series E Preferred Stock have the right to require such redemption

the Mandatory Redemption Date the shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by
such holders (except that no funds need be set aside with respect to such shares
held by any such holder who has theretofore notified 

6

<PAGE>

the Corporation (whether pursuant to Section 6(c) or otherwise) that it will not
require redemption of such shares) or (B) (1) the Corporation shall be the
resulting or surviving corporation, (2) the resulting or surviving corporation
will have after such recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation or merger
no Senior Stock or Parity Stock either authorized or outstanding (except such
Parity Stock of the Corporation as may have been authorized or outstanding
immediately preceding such consolidation or merger) or such stock of the
resulting or surviving corporation (having the same powers, preferences and
special rights of any such Parity Stock) as may be issued in exchange therefor),
(3) each holder of shares of Series E Preferred Stock immediately preceding such
recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation or merger will receive in
exchange therefor the same number of shares of stock, with the same preferences,
rights and powers, of the resulting or surviving corporation, (4) after such
recapitalization, reorganization, consolidation or merger the resulting or
surviving corporation shall not be in breach of any of the terms hereof, any of
the Material Provisions of the Securities Purchase Agreement or any of its
material obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement and (5) all or
substantially all the holders of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Corporation immediately prior to such consolidation or merger are entitled to
receive shares representing 50% or more of the then outstanding shares of
capital stock of the resulting or surviving corporation entitled to vote
generally in the election of directors.

(c) If on any date (i) the Corporation shall have failed to declare,
or shall have failed to pay, the full amount of dividends payable on the
Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock or Series G Preferred Stock
for six quarterly dividend periods or (ii) a breach of any of the Material
Provisions of the Securities Purchase Agreement or any of the Corporation's
material obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement shall have
occurred, then the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors
shall, without further action, be increased by two and the holders of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock shall have, in addition to the other voting rights set
forth herein with respect to the Series E Preferred Stock, the exclusive right,
together with the holders of Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred
Stock, voting separately as a single class together with the holders of Series F
Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock, to elect two directors of the
Corporation to fill such newly created directorship, by 

7

<PAGE>

written consent as provided herein, or at a special meeting of such holders
called as provided herein. Any such additional directors shall continue as
directors (subject to reelection or removal as provided in Section 3(d)(ii)) and
the holders of Series E Preferred Stock shall have such additional voting rights
until such time as (A) dividends then payable on the Series E Preferred Stock,
Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock shall have been declared
and paid in full or (B) there shall exist no breach of any of the Material
Provisions of the Securities Purchase Agreement or any of the Corporation's
material obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement, as the case may
be, at which time such additional directors shall cease to be directors, the
number of directors constituting the Board of Directors shall be reduced by two
and such additional voting rights of the holders of Series E Preferred Stock,
Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock shall terminate, subject
to revesting in the event of each and every subsequent event of the character
indicated above.

(d) (i) The foregoing right of holders of shares of Series E
Preferred Stock to take any action as provided in Section 3(c) may be exercised
at any annual meeting of stockholders or at a special meeting of holders of
shares of Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock and Series G
Preferred Stock, held for such purpose as hereinafter provided or at any
adjournment thereof, or by the written consent, delivered to the Secretary of
the Corporation, of the holders of the minimum number of shares required to take
such action.

So long as such right to vote continues (and unless such right has
been exercised by written consent of the minimum number of shares required to
take such action), the President of the Corporation may call, and upon the
written request of holders of record of at least 5% of the aggregate outstanding
shares of Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock and Series G
preferred Stock, addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal
office of the Corporation, shall call, a special meeting of the holders of
shares entitled to vote as provided herein. Such meeting shall be held within
30 days after delivery of such request to the Secretary, at the place and upon
the notice provided by law and in the by-laws of the Corporation for the holding
of meetings of stockholders.

<PAGE>

(ii) At each meeting of stockholders at which the holders of
shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately as a
single class together with the holders of Series F Preferred Stock and Series G
Preferred Stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation as provided in Sec-
tion 3(c) or to take any action, the presence in person or by proxy of the
holders of record of one-third of the total aggregate number of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock,
in each case then outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter shall be
necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. At any such meeting or at any
adjournment thereof:

(A) the absence of a quorum of the holders of shares of Series E
Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock,
shall not prevent the election of directors other than those to be elected
by the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred
Stock and Series G Preferred Stock, and the absence of a quorum of the
holders of shares of any other class or series of capital stock shall not
prevent the election of directors to be elected by the holders of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred
Stock, or the taking of any action as provided in Section 3(c); and

(B) in the absence of a quorum of the holders of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock, Series F Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred
Stock, a majority of the holders of such shares present in person or by
proxy shall have the power to adjourn the meeting as to the actions to be
taken by the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock, Series F
Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock, from time to time and place
to place without notice other than announcement at the meeting until a
quorum shall be present.

For taking of any action as provided in Section 3(b) or Section 3(c)

Series E Preferred Stock the funds necessary for such redemption with a bank or
trust company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, having a
capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000. Any moneys so deposited by the
Corporation and unclaimed at the end of two years from the Optional Redemption

shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall look only to the
Corporation for the payment of the Optional Redemption Price. In the event that
moneys are deposited pursuant to this Section 5(c) in respect of shares of

the holders of such converted shares in respect thereof. Any interest accrued
on funds deposited pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall be paid from time to time

shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, from and after the Optional
Redemption Date (i) the shares represented thereby shall no longer be deemed
outstanding, (ii) the rights to receive dividends thereon shall cease to accrue,
and (iii) all rights of the holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be
redeemed shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right to receive the
Optional Redemption Price therefor and the right to convert such shares into
shares of Common Stock until the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Optional Redemption Date (and to receive accrued and
unpaid dividends thereon), in accordance with Section 10; provided, however,
-------- -------
that if the Corporation shall default in the payment of the Optional Redemption
Price the shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall thereafter be deemed to be
outstanding and the holders thereof shall have all of the rights of a holder of
Series E Preferred Stock until such time as such default shall no longer be
continuing or shall have been waived by holders of at least 66-2/3% of the then
outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock.

(e) Any notice that is mailed as herein provided shall be
conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder of
shares of Series E Preferred Stock receives such notice, and failure to give
such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice, to the holders of any shares
designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for
the redemption of any other shares of Series E Preferred Stock. On or after the
Optional Redemption Date, each holder of the shares called for redemption,
subject to their right to convert shares of Series E Preferred Stock as provided
in section 10, shall surrender the certificate evidencing such shares to the
Corporation at the place designated in such notice and shall thereupon be
entitled to receive payment of the Optional Redemption Price. If less than all
the shares evidenced by any such surrendered certificate are redeemed, a new

Business Days of such notice, each holder shall return such inquiry form to the

the redemption of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock held by such holder for
purposes of Section 3(b) and such holder does not respond to the Corporation's

shares of Series E Preferred Stock who elects to have shares of Series E

with an election to have such redemption made and shall thereupon be entitled to
receive payment therefor provided in this Section 6. If less than all the
shares represented by any such surrendered certificate are

From and after the date of such redemption (i) the rights to receive dividends
thereon shall cease to accrue and (ii) all rights of the holders of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock so redeemed shall cease and terminate, excepting only
the right to receive the Mandatory Redemption Price therefor; provided, however,

that if the Corporation shall default in the payment of the Mandatory Redemption
Price the shares of Series E Preferred Stock that were to be redeemed shall
thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders thereof shall have all of
the rights of a holder of Series E Preferred Stock until such time as such
default shall no longer be continuing or shall have been waived by holders of at
least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock.

this Section 9.

Section 10 Conversion.
----------

(a) Any holder of Series E Preferred Stock shall have the right, at
its option, at any time and from time to time prior to the Maturity Date (but
subject to the provisions of Section 10(b)) to convert, subject to the terms and
provisions of this Section 10, each share of Series E Preferred Stock into such
number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock (calculated as to
each conversion to the nearest 1/100th of a share of Common Stock) for each full
share of Series E Preferred Stock as is equal, subject to Section 10(g), to the
quotient of (i) the Liquidation Preference divided by (ii) the Conversion Price
(as defined below) then in effect, except that with respect to any share that
shall be called for redemption, such right shall terminate at the close of
business on the date of redemption for such share, unless in any such case the
Corporation shall default in performance or payment due upon redemption thereof.
The Conversion Price shall be $15.00. The Conversion Price shall be subject to
adjustment as set forth in Section 10(d). Such conversion right shall be
exercised by the surrender of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be
converted to the Corporation at any time during usual business hours at its
principal place of business to be maintained by it, accompanied by written
notice that the holder elects to convert such shares and specifying the name or
names (with addresses) in which a certificate or certificates for shares of
Common Stock are to be issued and (if so required by the Corporation) by a
written instrument or instruments of transfer in form reasonably satisfactory to
the Corporation duly executed by 

21
<PAGE>

the holder or its duly authorized legal representative and transfer tax stamps
or funds therefor, if required pursuant to Section 10(k). All shares of
Series E Preferred Stock surrendered for conversion shall be delivered to the
Corporation for cancellation and cancelled by it and no shares shall be issued
in lieu thereof.

(b) As promptly as practicable after the surrender, as herein
provided, of any shares of Series E Preferred Stock for conversion pursuant to
Section 10(a), the Corporation shall deliver to or upon the written order of the
holder of the shares so surrendered a certificate or certificates representing
the number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock into which
such shares may be or have been converted in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 10. Subject to the following provisions of this paragraph and of
Section 10(d), such conversion shall be deemed to have been made immediately
prior to the close of business on the date that such shares shall have been
surrendered in satisfactory form for conversion, and the Person or Persons
entitled to receive the Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of such shares
shall be treated for all purposes as having become the record holder or holders
of such Common Stock at such appropriate time, and such conversion shall be at
the Conversion Price in effect at such time; provided, however, that no
-------- -------
surrender shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to
receive the Common Stock deliverable upon such conversion as the record holder
or holders of such Common Stock while the share transfer books of the
Corporation shall be closed (but not for any period in excess of five days), but
such surrender shall be effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled
to receive such Common Stock as the record holder or holders thereof for all
purposes immediately prior to the close of business on the next succeeding day
on which such share transfer books are open, and such conversion shall be deemed
to have been made at, and shall be made at the Conversion Price in effect at,
such time on such next succeeding day. In case of any Optional Redemption or
Maturity Redemption of any shares of Series E Preferred Stock, the right of
conversion shall cease and terminate, as to the shares to be redeemed, at the
close of business on (A) the Business Day immediately preceding the Optional
Redemption Date, in the case of an Optional Redemption or (B) on the Business
Day immediately preceding the Maturity Date, in the case of a Maturity
Redemption, unless the Corporation shall default in the payment of the
applicable redemption price for the shares to be redeemed.

22
<PAGE>

If the last day for the exercise of the conversion right shall not be
a Business Day, then such conversion right may be exercised on the next
preceding Business Day.

(c) To the extent permitted by law, when shares of Series E Preferred
Stock are converted, all dividends accrued and unpaid (whether or not declared
or currently payable) on the Series E Preferred Stock so converted to the date
of conversion shall be immediately due and payable and must accompany the shares
of Common Stock issued upon such conversion; provided, however, that if shares
-------- -------
being converted are held by a Person other than the original holder or any of
its Affiliates and such shares are not "restricted securities" (as defined in
Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended), then no such accrued and
unpaid dividends shall be payable when such shares are converted.

(d) The Conversion Price shall be subject to adjustment as follows:

(i) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from time to
time (A) pay a dividend or make a distribution on the outstanding shares of
Common Stock in Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment
plan approved by the Corporation's Board of Directors), (B) subdivide the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (C) combine
the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or
(D) issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Common
Stock, then, and in each such case, the Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to such event shall be adjusted (and any other appropriate actions shall
be taken by the Corporation) so that the holder of any share of Series E
Preferred Stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled to
receive the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities of the
Corporation that such holder would have owned or would have been entitled to
receive upon or by reason of any of the events described above, had such share
of Series E Preferred Stock been converted immediately prior to the occurrence
of such event. An adjustment made pursuant to this Section 10(d)(i) shall
become effective retroactively (A) in the case of any such dividend or
distribution, to the opening of business on the day immediately following the
close of business on the record date for the determination of holders of Common
Stock entitled to receive such dividend or distribution or (B) in the case of
any such subdivision, combination or 

23
<PAGE>

reclassification, to the close of business on the day upon which such corporate
action becomes effective.

(ii) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from time to
time issue or sell shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, or any options, warrants or other
rights to acquire shares of Common Stock (other than (x) options granted to any
employee or director of the Corporation pursuant to a stock option plan approved
by the shareholders of the Corporation or (y) rights issued pursuant to a
shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar arrangement that complies with
Section 10(k))) for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Price
then in effect at the record date or issuance date, as the case may be (the
"Date") referred to in the following sentence (treating the price per share of
any security convertible or exchangeable or exercisable into Common Stock as
equal to (A) the sum of the price for such security convertible, exchangeable or
exercisable into Common Stock plus any additional consideration payable (without
regard to any anti-dilution adjustments) upon the conversion, exchange or
exercise of such security into Common Stock divided by (B) the number of shares
of Common Stock initially underlying such convertible, exchangeable or
exercisable security), other than issuances or sales for which an adjustment is
made pursuant to another paragraph of this Section 10(d), then, and in each such
case, the Conversion Price then in effect shall be adjusted by dividing the
Conversion Price in effect on the day immediately prior to the Date by a
fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Date plus the number of
additional shares of Common Stock issued or to be issued (or the maximum number
into which such convertible or exchangeable securities initially may convert or
exchange or for which such options, warrants or other rights initially may be
exercised) and (y) the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Date plus the number
of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration (if any of such
aggregate consideration is other than cash, as valued by the Board of Directors
including a majority of the Directors who are not officers or employees of the
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, which determination shall be conclusive
and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) for the total number of
such additional shares of Common Stock so issued (or into which such 

24
<PAGE>

convertible or exchangeable securities may convert or exchange or for which such
options, warrants or other rights may be exercised plus the aggregate amount of
any additional consideration initially payable upon conversion, exchange or
exercise of such security) would purchase at the Conversion Price. Such
adjustment shall be made whenever such shares, securities, options, warrants or
other rights are issued, and shall become effective retroactively to a date
immediately following the close of business (i) in the case of issuance to
stockholders of the Corporation, as such, on the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to receive such shares, securities,
options, warrants or other rights and (ii) in all other cases, on the date
("issuance date") of such issuance; provided, however, that the determination as
-------- -------
to whether an adjustment is required to be made pursuant to this Section
10(d)(ii) shall only be made upon the issuance of such shares or such
convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights, and
not upon the issuance of the security into which such convertible or
exchangeable security converts or exchanges, or the security underlying such
option, warrants or other right; provided, further, that if any convertible or
-------- -------
exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights (or any portions
thereof) that shall have given rise to an adjustment pursuant to this Section
10(d)(ii) shall have expired or terminated without the exercise thereof and/or
if by reason of the terms of such convertible or exchangeable securities,
options, warrants or other rights there shall have been an increase or
increases, with the passage of time or otherwise, in the price payable upon the
exercise or conversion thereof, then the Conversion Price hereunder shall be
readjusted (but to no greater extent than originally adjusted) on the basis of
(x) eliminating from the computation any additional shares of Common Stock cor-
responding to such convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or
other rights as shall have expired or terminated, (y) treating the additional
shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or issuable pursuant to the
previous exercise of such convertible or exchangeable securities, options,
warrants or other rights as having been issued for the consideration actually
received and receivable therefor and (z) treating any of such convertible or
exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights that remain
outstanding as being subject to exercise or conversion on the basis of such
exercise or conversion price as shall be in effect at the time. 

25
<PAGE>

(iii) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from time to
time distribute to all holders of shares of its Common Stock (including any such
distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the
Corporation is the resulting or surviving corporation and the Common Stock is
not changed or exchanged or a redemption of any rights or other securities
issued pursuant to a shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar
arrangement) cash, evidences of indebtedness of the Corporation or another
issuer, securities of the Corporation or another issuer or other assets
(excluding (A) Permitted Dividends described in clause (B) of the definition
thereof and (B) securities for which adjustment is made under Section 10(d)(i)
or Section 10(d)(ii)), then, and in each such case, the Conversion Price then in
effect shall be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Price in effect immediately
prior to the date of such distribution by a fraction (x) the numerator of which
shall be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the record date
referred to below and (y) the denominator of which shall be such Current Market
Price of the Common Stock less the then Fair Market Value (as determined by the
Board of Directors of the Corporation, which determination shall be conclusive)
of the portion of the cash, evidences of indebtedness, securities or other
assets so distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to
one share of Common Stock (but such denominator not to be less than one);
provided, however, that no adjustment shall be made with respect to any
- -------- -------
distribution of rights to purchase securities of the Corporation if the holder
of shares of Series E Preferred Stock would otherwise be entitled to receive
such rights upon conversion at any time of shares of Series E Preferred Stock
into Common Stock unless such rights are subsequently redeemed by the
Corporation, in which case such redemption shall be treated for purposes of this
Section 10(d)(iii) as a dividend on the Common Stock. Such adjustment shall be
made whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective
retroactively to a date immediately following the close of business on the
record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such
distribution.

(iv) In the case the Corporation at any time or from time to
time shall take any action affecting its Common Stock, other than an action
described in any of Section 10(d)(i) through Section 10(d)(iii), inclusive, or
Section 10(h), then, the Conversion Price shall be adjusted in such manner and
at such time as the Board of Directors of the Corporation (other than Purchaser
Designees or directors 

26
<PAGE>

elected pursuant to Section 3(c)) in good faith determines to be equitable in
the circumstances (such determination to be evidenced in a resolution, a
certified copy of which shall be mailed to the holders of the Series E Preferred
Stock).

(v) The Corporation may make such reductions in the Conversion
Price, in addition to those required by subparagraphs (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv)
of this Section 10(d), as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable in
order to avoid or to diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or
rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of
stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income
tax purposes.

(vi) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
adjustment under this Section 10(d) need be made to the Conversion Price unless
such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% of the Con-
version Price then in effect. Any lesser adjustment shall be carried forward
and shall be made at the time of and together with the next subsequent
adjustment, which, together with any adjustment or adjustments so carried
forward, shall amount to an increase or decrease of at least 1% of such
Conversion Price. Any adjustment to the Conversion Price carried forward and
not theretofore made shall be made immediately prior to the conversion of any
shares of Series E Preferred Stock pursuant hereto; provided, however, that any
-------- -------
such adjustment shall in any event be made no later than three years after the
occurrence of the event giving rise to such adjustment.

(e) If the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its
Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other
distribution, and shall thereafter and before the distribution to stockholders
thereof legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or
distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the Conversion Price then in
effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record.

(f) Upon any increase or decrease in the Conversion Price, then, and
in each such case, the Corporation promptly shall deliver to each registered
holder of Series E Preferred Stock at least 10 Business Days prior to effecting
any of the foregoing transactions a certificate, signed by the President or a
Vice President and by the Treasurer or an 

<PAGE> 27
28

Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the
Corporation, setting forth in reasonable detail the event requiring the
adjustment and the method by which such adjustment was calculated and specifying
the increased or decreased Conversion Price then in effect following such
adjustment.

(g) No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares
shall be issued upon the conversion of any shares of Series E Preferred Stock. 
If more than one share of Series E Preferred Stock shall be surrendered for
conversion at one time by the same holder, the number of full shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion thereof shall be computed on the basis of the
aggregate Liquidation Preference of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock so
surrendered. If the conversion of any share or shares of Series E Preferred
Stock results in a fraction, an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the
Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the Business Day preceding the day
of conversion shall be paid to such holder in cash by the Corporation on the
date of issuance of the certificates representing the shares issued by the
Corporation upon such conversion.

(h) In case of any capital reorganization or reclassification or
other change of outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par
value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value), or
in case of any consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or into another
Person (other than a consolidation or merger in which the Corporation is the
resulting or surviving Person and which does not result in any reclassification
or change of outstanding Common Stock), or in case of any sale or other
disposition to another Person of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation (any of the foregoing, a "Transaction"), the Corporation, or such
successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute and deliver to
each holder of Series E Preferred Stock at least 10 Business Days prior to
effecting any of the foregoing Transactions a certificate that the holder of
each share of Series E Preferred Stock then outstanding shall have the right
thereafter to convert such share of Series E Preferred Stock into the kind and
amount of shares of stock or other securities (of the Corporation or another
issuer) or property or cash receivable upon such Transaction by a holder of the
number of shares of Common Stock into which such share of Series E Preferred
Stock could have been converted immediately prior to such Transaction. Such 

28
<PAGE>

certificate shall provide for adjustments that shall be as nearly equivalent as
may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Section 10. If, in
the case of any such Transaction, the stock, other securities, cash or property
receivable thereupon by a holder of Common Stock includes shares of stock or
other securities of a Person other than the successor or purchasing Person and
other than the Corporation, which controls or is controlled by the successor or
purchasing Person or which, in connection with such Transaction, issues stock,
securities, other property or cash to holders of Common Stock, then such
certificate also shall be executed by such Person, and such Person shall, in
such certificate, specifically acknowledge the obligations of such successor or
purchasing Person and acknowledge its obligations to issue such stock,
securities, other property or cash to the holders of Series E Preferred Stock
upon conversion of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock as provided above. 
The provisions of this Section 10(h) and any equivalent thereof in any such
certificate similarly shall apply to successive Transactions. The provisions of
this Section 10(h) and any equivalent thereof in any such certificate are and
shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, the requirements with respect to a
Mandatory Redemption.

(i) In case at any time or from time to time:

(A) the Corporation shall declare a dividend (or any other
distribution) on its Common Stock (other than a Permitted Dividend);

(B) the Corporation shall authorize the granting to the holders
of its Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any
shares of stock of any class or of any other rights or warrants;

(C) there shall be any reclassification of the Common Stock
(other than a subdivision or combination of the outstanding Common Stock, or a
change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no par value to
par value), or any consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is a party
and for which approval of any shareholders of the Corporation is required, or
any sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Corporation; or

(D) the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or
winding up of the Corporation;

29
<PAGE>

then the Corporation shall mail to each holder of shares of Series E Preferred
Stock at such holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of the
Corporation, as promptly as possible but in any event at least ten days prior to
the applicable date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on
which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution or
rights or warrants or, if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the
holders of Common Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution
or rights are to be determined, or (y) the date on which such reclassification,
consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up
is expected to become effective; provided that in the case of any event to which
--------
Section 10(h) applies, the Corporation shall give at least 10 days' prior
written notice as aforesaid. Such notice also shall specify the date as of
which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to
exchange their Common Stock for shares of stock or other securities or property
or cash deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale,
conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

(j) The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available for
issuance upon the conversion of the Series E Preferred Stock, such number of its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock as will from time to time be
sufficient to permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series E
Preferred Stock, and shall take all action required to increase the authorized
number of shares of Common Stock if at any time there shall be insufficient
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to permit such reservation or to
permit the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series E Preferred Stock.

(k) The Corporation shall not adopt a shareholders right plan,
"poison pill" or similar arrangement unless such plan or arrangement shall
provide that (i) each holder of a share of Series E Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to receive thereunder, upon conversion of a share of Series E Preferred
Stock (in accordance with the terms hereof) prior to the earlier to occur of
either the date of redemption of the rights issued under such plan or the date
of expiration of the rights issued under such plan, rights for each share of
Common Stock issued upon conversion of such share of Series E Preferred Stock in
an amount equal to the amount of rights issued with respect to each outstanding
share of Common Stock pursuant to such plan and 

30
<PAGE>

(ii) if such rights are redeemed prior to the conversion of any share of
Series E Preferred Stock into Common Stock, then upon conversion of such share
of Series E Preferred Stock the holder thereof shall receive an amount in cash
equal to the amount in cash that such holder would have received had he
converted such share of Series E Preferred Stock prior to such redemption
(unless prior to such conversion the Conversion Price applicable to such share
of Series E Preferred Stock shall have been adjusted pursuant to
Section 10(d)(iii) as a result of such redemption).

(l) The issuance or delivery of certificates for Common Stock upon
the conversion of shares of Series E Preferred Stock shall be made without
charge to the converting holder of shares of Series E Preferred Stock for such
certificates or for any tax in respect of the issuance or delivery of such
certificates or the securities represented thereby, and such certificates shall
be issued or delivered in the respective names of, or in such names as may be
directed by, the holders of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock converted;
provided, however, that the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax
- -------- -------
that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and
delivery of any such certificate in a name other than that of the holder of the
shares of Series E Preferred Stock converted, and the Corporation shall not be
required to issue or deliver such certificate unless or until the Person or
Persons requesting the issuance or delivery thereof shall have paid to the
Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Corporation that such tax has been paid.

Section 11 Exchange.
--------

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 11, the Corporation
shall have the right, with the consent of the holders of all of the outstanding
shares of Series E Preferred Stock (which consent may be withheld for any reason
whatsoever), at any time but on only one occasion, to exchange all (but not less
than all) of the shares of Series E Preferred Stock for Convertible Subordinated
Notes of the Corporation ("Convertible Notes"), at a price per share equal to
the Liquidation Preference per share, with the Convertible Notes valued for such
purpose at their face value. Simultaneously with such exchange the Corporation
shall pay to each holder of Series E Preferred Stock an amount per share in cash
equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not declared or
currently 

31
<PAGE>

payable, to the date fixed for exchange thereof. The Convertible Notes shall
have an annual interest rate equal to the annual dividend rate on Series E
Preferred Stock and shall contain other terms substantially similar to the
Series E Preferred Stock, including the date of maturity thereof and the right
to convert such notes into shares of Common Stock.

(b) Notice of an exchange of shares of Series E Preferred Stock
pursuant to Section 11(a) shall be given by publication in a newspaper of
general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (if such
publication shall be required by applicable law, rule, regulation or securities
exchange requirement), not less than 30, nor more than 60, days prior to the
date fixed for exchange; and, in any case, a similar notice shall be mailed at
least 30, but not more than 60, days prior to the date fixed for exchange to
each holder at such holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of the
Corporation. In order to facilitate the exchange of shares of Series E
Preferred Stock hereunder the Board of Directors may fix a record date for the
determination of shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be exchanged, or may
cause the transfer books of the Corporation for the Series E Preferred Stock to
be closed, not more than 60 days or less than 30 days prior to the date fixed
for exchange.

(c) On the date of any exchange being made pursuant to Section 11(a)
that is specified in a notice given pursuant to Section 11(b) and is not deemed
terminated pursuant to Section 11(b), the Corporation shall, and at any time
after the date that is 10 days prior to the date of exchange the Corporation
may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of shares of Series E Preferred
Stock to be exchanged (i) the Convertible Notes necessary for such exchange and
(ii) an amount in cash equal to all dividends payable with respect thereto upon
such exchange with a bank or trust company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City
of New York, having a capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000. Any
Convertible Notes so deposited by the Corporation and unclaimed at the end of
two years from the date designated for such exchange shall revert to the Corpo-
ration. After such reversion, any such bank or trust company shall, upon
demand, return to the Corporation such unclaimed Convertible Notes and thereupon
such bank or trust company shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect
thereof and any holder of shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be exchanged
shall look only to the Corporation for the 

32
<PAGE>

delivery of the Convertible Notes. In the event that Convertible Notes and
moneys are deposited pursuant to this Section 11(c) in respect of shares of
Series E Preferred Stock that are converted in accordance with the provisions of
Section 10, such Convertible Notes and moneys shall, upon such conversion,
revert to the Corporation and, upon demand, such bank or trust company shall
return to the Corporation such Convertible Notes and moneys and shall be
relieved of all responsibilities to the holders of such converted shares in
respect thereof. Any interest accrued on Convertible Notes deposited pursuant
to this Section 11(c) shall accrue for the accounts of, and be payable to, the
holders of shares of Series E Preferred Stock to be exchanged therefor.

(d) Notice of exchange having been given as aforesaid and not having
been deemed terminated as aforesaid, upon the deposit of Convertible Notes
pursuant to clause (i) of Section 11(c) and the deposit of the cash referred to
in clause (ii) of Section 11(c) in respect of shares of Series E Preferred Stock
to be exchanged pursuant to Section 11(a), notwithstanding that any certificates
for such shares shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, from and after
the date of exchange designated in the notice of exchange (i) the shares
represented thereby shall no longer be deemed outstanding, (ii) the rights to
receive dividends thereon (except as provided in paragraph (b) above) shall
cease to accrue, and (iii) all rights of the holders of shares of Series E
Preferred Stock to be exchanged shall cease and terminate, excepting only the
right to receive the Convertible Notes therefor, the right to receive the
dividends described in paragraph (b) above and the right to convert such shares
into shares of Common Stock until the close of business on the Business Day
preceding the date of exchange, in accordance with Section 10; provided,
--------
however, that if the Corporation shall default in the execution and delivery of
- -------
the Convertible Notes, the shares of Series E Preferred Stock that were to be
exchanged shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders thereof
shall have all of the rights of a holder of Series E Preferred Stock until such
time as such default shall no longer be continuing or shall have been waived by
holders of at least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Series E Preferred
Stock.

Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of holders of
shares of Series F Preferred Stock entitled to receive payment of a dividend
declared thereon, which record date shall be no more than 60 days or less than

to clause (i) or (ii) above or would require a vote by any 

37
<PAGE>

shareholders of the Corporation; provided further, that no separate vote of the
-------- -------
holders of the Series F Preferred Stock as a class shall be required in the case

together with the holders of Series E Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred

stockholders or at a special meeting of holders of shares of Series F Preferred
Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock, held for such
purpose as hereinafter provided or at any adjournment thereof, or by the written
consent, delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation, of the holders of the
minimum number of shares required to take such action.

So long as such right to vote continues (and unless such right has
been exercised by written consent of the minimum number of shares required to
take such action), the President of the Corporation may call, and upon the
written request of holders of record of at least 5% of the aggregate outstanding
shares of Series F Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series G
Preferred Stock, addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal
office of the Corporation, shall call, a special meeting of the holders of

shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately as a
single class together with the holders of Series E Preferred Stock and Series G
Preferred Stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation as provided in Sec-

holders of record of one-third of the total aggregate number of shares of
Series F Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock,
in each case then outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter shall be
necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. At any such meeting or at any
adjournment thereof:

(A) the absence of a quorum of the holders of shares of Series F
Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock,
shall not prevent the election of directors other than those to be elected
by the holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred
Stock and Series G Preferred Stock, and the absence of a quorum of the
holders of shares of any other class or series of capital stock shall not
prevent the election of directors to be elected by the holders of shares of

40
<PAGE>

Series F Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred
Stock, or the taking of any action as provided in Section 3(b); and

(B) in the absence of a quorum of the holders of shares of
Series F Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred
Stock, a majority of the holders of such shares present in person or by
proxy shall have the power to adjourn the meeting as to the actions to be
taken by the holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock, Series E
Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock, from time to time and place
to place without notice other than announcement at the meeting until a
quorum shall be present.

For taking of any action as provided in Section 3(a) or Section 3(b)
by the holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock, each such holder shall
have one vote for each share of such stock standing in his name on the transfer
books of the Corporation as of any record date fixed for such purpose or, if no
such date be fixed, at the close of business on the Business Day next preceding
the day on which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at the close of
business on the Business Day next preceding the day on which the meeting is
held; provided, however, that shares of Series F Preferred Stock, Series E
-------- -------
Preferred Stock or Series G Preferred Stock held by the Corporation or any
Subsidiary of the Corporation shall not be deemed to be outstanding for purposes
of taking any action as provided in this Section 3.

Each director elected by the holders of shares of Series F Preferred
Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock, as provided in
Section 3(b) shall, unless his term shall expire earlier in accordance with the
provisions thereof, hold office until the annual meeting of stockholders next
succeeding his election or until his successor, if any, is elected and
qualified.

If any director so elected by the holders of Series F Preferred Stock,
Series E Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock shall cease to serve as a
director before his term shall expire (except by reason of the termination of
the voting rights accorded to the holders of Series F Preferred Stock, Series E
Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock, in accordance with Section 3(b)),
the holders of the Series F Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and
Series G Preferred Stock then 

41
<PAGE>

outstanding and entitled to vote for such director may, by written consent as
provided herein, or at a special meeting of such holders called as provided
herein, elect a successor to hold office for the unexpired term of the director
whose place shall be vacant.

Any director elected by the holders of shares of Series F Preferred
Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series G Preferred Stock, voting together as
a separate class, may be removed from office with or without cause by the vote
or written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the aggregate
outstanding shares of Series F Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and
Series G Preferred Stock at the time of removal. A special meeting of the
holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and
Series G Preferred Stock, may be called in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 3(c)(i).

(e) Any notice that is mailed as herein provided shall be
conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder of
shares of Series F Preferred Stock receives such notice, and failure to give

or on the Conversion Redemption Date, each holder of shares of Series F
Preferred Stock who elects to have shares of Series F Preferred Stock held by it

thereon shall cease to accrue and (ii) all rights of the holders of shares of
Series F Preferred Stock so redeemed shall cease and terminate, excepting only

right to receive the Maturity Redemption Price therefor; provided, however, that
-------- -------
if the Corporation 

52
<PAGE>

shall default in the payment of the Maturity Redemption Price, the shares of
Series F Preferred Stock that were to be redeemed shall thereafter be deemed to
be outstanding and the holders thereof shall have all of the rights of a holder
of Series F Preferred Stock until such time as such default shall no longer be
continuing. 

Section 8 Acquired Shares.
---------------

Any shares of Series F Preferred Stock exchanged, redeemed, purchased
or otherwise acquired by the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries in any
manner whatsoever shall be retired and cancelled promptly after the acquisition
thereof. All such shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall upon their
cancellation become authorized but unissued shares of preferred stock, par value
$4.00 per share, of the Corporation and, upon the filing of an appropriate
certificate with the Department of State of the State of New York, may be
reissued as part of another series of preferred stock, par value $4.00 per
share, of the Corporation subject to the conditions or restrictions on issuance
set forth herein, but in any event may not be reissued as shares of Series F
Preferred Stock or Parity Stock unless all of the shares of Series F Preferred
Stock issued on the Issue Date shall have already been redeemed or exchanged.

Section 9 Liquidation, Dissolution or Winding Up.
--------------------------------------

(a) If the Corporation shall commence a voluntary case under the
United States bankruptcy laws or any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar law of any other country, or consent to the entry of an order for relief
in an involuntary case under any such law or to the appointment of a receiver,
liquidator, assignee, custodian, trustee, sequestrator (or other similar
official) of the Corporation or of any substantial part of its property, or make
an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or admit in writing its
inability to pay its debts generally as they become due (any such event, a
"Voluntary Liquidation Event"), or if a decree or order for relief in respect of
the Corporation shall be entered by a court having jurisdiction in the premises
in an involuntary case under the United States bankruptcy laws or any applicable

similar official) of the Corporation or of any substantial part of its property,
or ordering the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and on account of 

53
<PAGE>

any such event the Corporation shall liquidate, dissolve or wind up, or if the

thereto, the holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock shall have received
(A) if a Voluntary Liquidation Event shall have occurred, the Optional Redemp-
tion Price with respect to each share and (B) if a Voluntary Liquidation Event
shall not have occurred, the Liquidation Preference and all accrued and unpaid
dividends, whether or not declared or currently payable, to the date of
distribution, with respect to each share, or (ii) to the holders of shares of
Parity Stock, except distributions made ratably on the Series F Preferred Stock
and all Parity Stock in proportion to the total amounts to which the holders of
all shares of the Series F Preferred Stock (which amounts are set forth in
clauses (A) and (B) above) and Parity Stock are entitled upon such liquidation,
dissolution or winding up.

(b) Neither the consolidation or merger of the Corporation with or
into any other Person nor the sale or transfer of all or any part of the
Corporation's assets for cash, securities or other property shall be deemed to
be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation for purposes of
this Section 9.

Section 10 Exchange.
--------

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 10, the Corporation
shall have the right, with the consent of the holders of all of the outstanding
shares of Series F Preferred Stock (which consent may be withheld for any reason
whatsoever), at any time but on only one occasion, to exchange all (but not less
than all) of the shares of Series F Preferred Stock for Subordinated Notes of
the Corporation ("Subordinated Notes"), at a price per share equal to the
Liquidation Preference per share, with the Subordinated Notes valued for such
purpose at their face value. Simultaneously with such exchange the Corporation
shall pay to each holder of Series F Preferred Stock an amount per share in cash
equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not declared or
currently payable, to the date fixed for exchange thereof. The Subordinated
Notes shall have an annual interest rate equal to the annual dividend rate on
Series F Preferred Stock and shall contain other terms substantially similar to
the Series F Preferred Stock, including the date of maturity thereof. 

54
<PAGE>

(b) Notice of an exchange of shares of Series F Preferred Stock
pursuant to Section 10(a) shall be given by publication in a newspaper of
general circulation in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (if such
publication shall be required by applicable law, rule, regulation or securities
exchange requirement), not less than 30, nor more than 60, days prior to the
date fixed for exchange; and, in any case, a similar notice shall be mailed at
least 30, but not more than 60, days prior to the date fixed for exchange to
each holder at such holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of the
Corporation. In order to facilitate the exchange of shares of Series F
Preferred Stock hereunder the Board of Directors may fix a record date for the
determination of shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be exchanged, or may
cause the transfer books of the Corporation for the Series F Preferred Stock to
be closed, not more than 60 days or less than 30 days prior to the date fixed
for exchange.

(c) On the date of any exchange being made pursuant to Section 10(a)
that is specified in a notice given pursuant to Section 10(b) and is not deemed
terminated pursuant to Section 10(b), the Corporation shall, and at any time
after the date that is 10 days prior to the date of exchange the Corporation
may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of shares of Series F Preferred
Stock to be exchanged (i) the Subordinated Notes necessary for such exchange and
(ii) an amount in cash equal to all dividends payable with respect thereto upon
such exchange with a bank or trust company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City
of New York, having a capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000. Any
Subordinated Notes so deposited by the Corporation and unclaimed at the end of
two years from the date designated for such exchange shall revert to the Corpo-
ration. After such reversion, any such bank or trust company shall, upon
demand, return to the Corporation such unclaimed Subordinated Notes and
thereupon such bank or trust company shall be relieved of all responsibility in
respect thereof and any holder of shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be
exchanged shall look only to the Corporation for the delivery of the
Subordinated Notes. Any interest accrued on Subordinated Notes deposited
pursuant to this Section 10(c) shall accrue for the accounts of, and be payable
to, the holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be exchanged therefor.

(d) Notice of exchange having been given as aforesaid and not having
been deemed terminated as afore-

55
<PAGE>

said, upon the deposit of Subordinated Notes pursuant to clause (i) of Section
10(c) and the deposit of the cash referred to in clause (ii) of Section 10(c) in
respect of shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be exchanged pursuant to
Section 10(a), notwithstanding that any certificates for such shares shall not
have been surrendered for cancellation, from and after the date of exchange
designated in the notice of exchange (i) the shares represented thereby shall no
longer be deemed outstanding, (ii) the rights to receive dividends thereon
(except as provided in paragraph (b) above) shall cease to accrue, and (iii) all
rights of the holders of shares of Series F Preferred Stock to be exchanged
shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right to receive the Subordinated
Notes therefor and the right to receive the dividends described in paragraph (b)
above; provided, however, that if the Corporation shall default in the execution
-------- -------
and delivery of the Convertible Notes, the shares of Series F Preferred Stock
that were to be exchanged shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the
holders thereof shall have all of the rights of a holder of Series F Preferred
Stock until such time as such default shall no longer be continuing or shall
have been waived by holders of at least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding shares
of Series F Preferred Stock.

Section 11 Additional Amount.
-----------------

(a) For the purposes of this Article 2, "Additional Amount" shall
mean an amount per share equal to the product of (i) the excess of the sum of
(1) the Market Price of a share of Common Stock and (2) if the Corporation shall
have issued a right or rights with respect to its outstanding shares of Common
Stock pursuant to a shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar
arrangement, during the period commencing on the "distribution date" of such
right or rights (i.e., the date on which such right or rights commence to trade
----
separately from the Common Stock) and ending on the "triggering date" of such
right or rights (i.e., the date on which such right or rights commence to be
----
exercisable), the Market Price of such right or rights over the Conversion
Amount, in effect as hereinafter determined and (ii) (x) the Liquidation
Preference divided by (y) such Conversion Amount, in all cases calculated as of
the applicable determination date. The Additional Amount shall in no event be
less than zero. The Conversion Amount shall be $15.00, subject to adjustment as
set forth in Section 11(b). For the purpose of calculating the Additional
Amount in connection with an Optional Redemption, 

56
<PAGE>

Specified Corporate Action Redemption or Conversion Redemption, the Market Price
of the Common Stock and, if applicable, rights shall be the average of the
Market Price of such securities on the five trading days immediately preceding
and the five trading days immediately following the date of notice of such
redemption. 

(b) The Conversion Amount shall be subject to adjustment as follows:

(i) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from time to
time (A) pay a dividend or make a distribution on the outstanding shares of
Common Stock in Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment
plan approved by the Corporation's Board of Directors), (B) subdivide the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (C) combine
the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (D)
issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Stock,
then, and in each such case, the Conversion Amount in effect immediately prior
to such event shall be adjusted so that if the holder of any share of Series F
Preferred Stock were entitled to convert such share into such number of shares
of Common Stock as equals the Liquidation Preference divided by the Conversion
Amount and such holder thereafter surrendered such share for conversion, such
holder would be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock or
other securities of the Corporation that such holder would have owned or would
have been entitled to receive upon or by reason of any of the events described
above had such share of Series F Preferred Stock been converted immediately
prior to the occurrence of such event. An adjustment made pursuant to this
Section 11(b)(i) shall become effective retroactively (A) in the case of any
such dividend or distribution, to the opening of business on the day immediately
following the close of business on the record date for the determination of
holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividend or distribution or (B)
in the case of any such subdivision, combination or reclassification, to the
close of business on the day upon which such corporate action becomes effective.

(ii) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from time to
time issue or sell shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, or any options, warrants or other
rights to acquire shares of Common Stock (other than options granted to any
employee or director of the Corporation 

57
<PAGE>

pursuant to a stock option plan approved by the shareholders of the
Corporation)) for a consideration per share less than the Conversion Amount then
in effect at the record date or issuance date, as the case may be (the "Date")
referred to in the following sentence, including, without limitation, upon
exercise of rights issued pursuant to a shareholder rights plan, "poison pill"
or similar arrangement (treating the price per share of any security convertible
or exchangeable or exercisable into Common Stock as equal to (A) the sum of the
price for such security convertible, exchangeable or exercisable into Common
Stock plus any additional consideration payable (without regard to any anti-
dilution adjustments) upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of such security
into Common Stock divided by (B) the number of shares of Common Stock initially
underlying such convertible, exchangeable or exercisable security), other than
issuances or sales for which an adjustment is made pursuant to another paragraph
of this Section 11(b), then, and in each such case, the Conversion Amount then
in effect shall be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Amount in effect on the
day immediately prior to the Date by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall
be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Date plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock issued or to be
issued (or the maximum number into which such convertible or exchangeable
securities initially may convert or exchange or for which such options, warrants
or other rights initially may be exercised) and (y) the denominator of which
shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Date plus the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate
consideration (if any of such aggregate consideration is other than cash, as
valued by the Board of Directors including a majority of the Directors who are
not officers or employees of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, which
determination shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of
Directors) for the total number of such additional shares of Common Stock so
issued (or into which such convertible or exchangeable securities may convert or
exchange or for which such options, warrants or other rights may be exercised
plus the aggregate amount of any additional consideration initially payable upon
conversion, exchange or exercise of such security) would purchase at the
Conversion Amount. Such adjustment shall be made whenever such shares,
securities, options, warrants or other rights are issued, and shall become
effective retroactively to a date immediately following the close of business
(i) in the case of issuance to stockholders of the Corporation, as such, on the 

58
<PAGE>

record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such
shares, securities, options, warrants or other rights and (ii) in all other
cases, on the date ("issuance date") of such issuance; provided, however, that
-------- -------
the determination as to whether an adjustment is required to be made pursuant to
this Section 11(b)(ii) shall only be made upon the issuance of such shares or
such convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights,
and not upon the issuance of the security into which such convertible or
exchangeable security converts or exchanges, or the security underlying such
option, warrants or other right; provided, further, that if any convertible or
-------- -------
exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights (or any portions
thereof) that shall have given rise to an adjustment pursuant to this Section
11(b)(ii) shall have expired or terminated without the exercise thereof and/or
if by reason of the terms of such convertible or exchangeable securities,
options, warrants or other rights there shall have been an increase or
increases, with the passage of time or otherwise, in the price payable upon the
exercise or conversion thereof, then the Conversion Amount hereunder shall be
readjusted (but to no greater extent than originally adjusted) on the basis of
(x) eliminating from the computation any additional shares of Common Stock cor-
responding to such convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or
other rights as shall have expired or terminated, (y) treating the additional
shares of Common Stock, if any, actually issued or issuable pursuant to the
previous exercise of such convertible or exchangeable securities, options,
warrants or other rights as having been issued for the consideration actually
received and receivable therefor and (z) treating any of such convertible or
exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights that remain
outstanding as being subject to exercise or conversion on the basis of such
exercise or conversion price as shall be in effect at the time. 

(iii) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from time to
time distribute to all holders of shares of its Common Stock (including any such
distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the
Corporation is the resulting or surviving corporation and the Common Stock is
not changed or exchanged or a redemption of any rights or other securities
issued pursuant to a shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar
arrangement) cash, evidences of indebtedness of the Corporation or another
issuer, securities of the Corporation or another issuer or other assets
(excluding (A) Permitted 

59
<PAGE>

Dividends described in clause (B) of the definition thereof and (B) securities
for which adjustment is made under Section 11(b)(i) or Section 11(b)(ii)), then,
and in each such case, the Conversion Amount then in effect shall be adjusted by
dividing the Conversion Amount in effect immediately prior to the date of such
distribution by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the Current
Market Price of the Common Stock on the record date referred to below and (y)
the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price of the Common Stock
less the then Fair Market Value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the
Corporation, which determination shall be conclusive) of the portion of the
cash, evidences of indebtedness, securities or other assets so distributed or of
such subscription rights or warrants applicable to one share of Common Stock
(but such denominator not to be less than one). Such adjustment shall be made
whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective retroactively
to a date immediately following the close of business on the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution.

(iv) In the case the Corporation at any time or from time to
time shall take any action affecting its Common Stock, other than an action
described in any of Section 11(b)(i) through Section 11(b)(iii), inclusive,
then, the Conversion Amount shall be adjusted in such manner and at such time as
the Board of Directors of the Corporation (other than Purchaser Designees or
directors elected pursuant to Section 3(b)) in good faith determines to be
equitable in the circumstances (such determination to be evidenced in a
resolution, a certified copy of which shall be mailed to the holders of the
Series F Preferred Stock).

(v) The Corporation may make such reductions in the Conversion
Amount, in addition to those required by subparagraphs (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv)
of this Section 11(b), as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable in
order to avoid or to diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or
rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of
stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income
tax purposes.

(vi) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 11(b),
no adjustment to the Conversion Amount shall be made with respect to any rights
issued pursuant to 

60
<PAGE>

a shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar arrangement unless the
"triggering date" (i.e. the date on which such rights commence to be
----
exercisable) shall have occurred or such rights shall have been redeemed, in
which event adjustments under clause (ii) and clause (iii), respectively, shall
be made.

(c) If the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its
Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other
distribution, and shall thereafter and before the distribution to stockholders
thereof legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or
distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the Conversion Amount then in
effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record.

(d) Upon any increase or decrease in the Conversion Amount, then, and
in each such case, the Corporation promptly shall deliver to each registered
holder of Series F Preferred Stock at least 10 Business Days prior to effecting
any of the foregoing transactions a certificate, signed by the President or a
Vice President and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary
or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, setting forth in reasonable detail
the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which such adjustment was
calculated and specifying the increased or decreased Conversion Amount then in
effect following such adjustment.

stock of the Corporation other than the Other Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors, out of the
assets of the Corporation at the time legally available therefor, cumulative
cash dividends at an annual rate on the Liquidation Preference thereof equal to

a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months, accruing and payable in equal

Stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the Board of
Directors, out of the assets of the Corporation at the time legally available
therefor, a cumulative cash dividend in respect of each share of Series G
Preferred Stock in the amount of (i) 9.75% (or the then effective annual rate)
of the Liquidation Preference multiplied by (ii) a fraction equal to (A) the
number of days from (and including) the date of the issuance

arrears. 

(b) If (i) within 45 days of the Issue Date, the Corporation has not
delivered to each holder of shares of Series G Preferred Stock a Private
Placement Memorandum or a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (if the Corporation

11.75% in the event of each and every subsequent event of the character
indicated above.

(c) Dividends payable on a share of Series G Preferred Stock pursuant

(b) If on any date (i) the Corporation shall have failed to declare,
or shall have failed to pay, the full amount of dividends payable on the
Series G Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock or Series F Preferred Stock
for six quarterly dividend periods or (ii) a breach of any of the Material
Provisions of the Securities Purchase Agreement or any of the Corporation's
material obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement shall have
occurred, then the number of directors constituting the Board of Directors
shall, without further action, be increased by two and the holders of shares of
Series G Preferred Stock shall have, in 

66
<PAGE>

addition to the other voting rights set forth herein with respect to the
Series G Preferred Stock, the exclusive right, together with the holders of
Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock, voting separately as a
single class together with the holders of Series E Preferred Stock and Series G
Preferred Stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation to fill such newly
created directorship, by written consent as provided herein, or at a special
meeting of such holders called as provided herein. Any such additional
directors shall continue as directors (subject to reelection or removal as
provided in Section 3(c)(ii)) and the holders of Series G Preferred Stock shall
have such additional voting rights until such time as (A) dividends then payable
on the Series G Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred
Stock shall have been declared and paid in full or (B) there shall exist no
breach of any of the Material Provisions of the Securities Purchase Agreement or
any of the Corporation's material obligations under the Registration Rights
Agreement, as the case may be, at which time such additional directors shall
cease to be directors, the number of directors constituting the Board of
Directors shall be reduced by two and such additional voting rights of the
holders of Series G Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series F
Preferred Stock shall terminate, subject to revesting in the event of each and
every subsequent event of the character indicated above.

(c) (i) The foregoing right of holders of shares of Series G
Preferred Stock to take any action as provided in Section 3(b) may be exercised
at any annual meeting of stockholders or at a special meeting of holders of
shares of Series G Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series F
Preferred Stock, held for such purpose as hereinafter provided or at any
adjournment thereof, or by the written consent, delivered to the Secretary of
the Corporation, of the holders of the minimum number of shares required to take
such action.

So long as such right to vote continues (and unless such right has
been exercised by written consent of the minimum number of shares required to
take such action), the President of the Corporation may call, and upon the
written request of holders of record of at least 5% of the aggregate outstanding
shares of Series G Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series F
Preferred Stock, addressed to the Secretary of the Corporation at the principal
office of the Corporation, shall call, a special meeting of the holders of
shares entitled to vote as 

67
<PAGE>

provided herein. Such meeting shall be held within 30 days after delivery of
such request to the Secretary, at the place and upon the notice provided by law
and in the by-laws of the Corporation for the holding of meetings of
stockholders.

(ii) At each meeting of stockholders at which the holders of
shares of Series G Preferred Stock shall have the right, voting separately as a
single class together with the holders of Series E Preferred Stock and Series F
Preferred Stock, to elect two directors of the Corporation as provided in Sec-
tion 3(b) or to take any action, the presence in person or by proxy of the
holders of record of one-third of the total aggregate number of shares of
Series G Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock,
in each case then outstanding and entitled to vote on the matter shall be
necessary and sufficient to constitute a quorum. At any such meeting or at any
adjournment thereof:

(A) the absence of a quorum of the holders of shares of Series G
Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock,
shall not prevent the election of directors other than those to be elected
by the holders of shares of Series G Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred
Stock and Series F Preferred Stock, and the absence of a quorum of the
holders of shares of any other class or series of capital stock shall not
prevent the election of directors to be elected by the holders of shares of
Series G Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred
Stock, or the taking of any action as provided in Section 3(b); and

(B) in the absence of a quorum of the holders of shares of
Series G Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred
Stock, a majority of the holders of such shares present in person or by
proxy shall have the power to adjourn the meeting as to the actions to be
taken by the holders of shares of Series G Preferred Stock, Series E
Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock, from time to time and place
to place without notice other than announcement at the meeting until a
quorum shall be present.

For taking of any action as provided in Section 3(a) or Section 3(b)
by the holders of shares of Series G Preferred Stock, each such holder shall
have one 

68
<PAGE>

vote for each share of such stock standing in his name on the transfer books of
the Corporation as of any record date fixed for such purpose or, if no such date
be fixed, at the close of business on the Business Day next preceding the day on
which notice is given, or if notice is waived, at the close of business on the
Business Day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held; provided,
--------
however, that shares of Series G Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock or
- -------
Series F Preferred Stock held by the Corporation or any Subsidiary of the
Corporation shall not be deemed to be outstanding for purposes of taking any
action as provided in this Section 3.

Each director elected by the holders of shares of Series G Preferred
Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock, as provided in
Section 3(b) shall, unless his term shall expire earlier in accordance with the
provisions thereof, hold office until the annual meeting of stockholders next
succeeding his election or until his successor, if any, is elected and
qualified.

If any director so elected by the holders of Series G Preferred Stock,
Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock shall cease to serve as a
director before his term shall expire (except by reason of the termination of
the voting rights accorded to the holders of Series G Preferred Stock, Series E
Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock, in accordance with Section 3(b)),
the holders of the Series G Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and
Series F Preferred Stock then outstanding and entitled to vote for such director
may, by written consent as provided herein, or at a special meeting of such
holders called as provided herein, elect a successor to hold office for the
unexpired term of the director whose place shall be vacant.

Any director elected by the holders of shares of Series G Preferred
Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and Series F Preferred Stock, voting together as
a separate class, may be removed from office with or without cause by the vote
or written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the aggregate
outstanding shares of Series G Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and
Series F Preferred Stock at the time of removal. A special meeting of the
holders of shares of Series G Preferred Stock, Series E Preferred Stock and
Series F Preferred Stock, may be called in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 3(c)(i).

any case, a similar notice shall be mailed at least 30, but not more than 45,

holders of at least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding shares of Series G Preferred
Stock.

(e) Any notice that is mailed as herein provided shall be
conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not the holder of
shares of Series G Preferred Stock receives such notice, and failure to give
such notice by mail, or any defect in such notice, to the holders of any shares
designated for redemption shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for
the redemption of any other shares of Series G Preferred Stock. On or after the
Optional Redemption Date fixed for redemption as stated in such notice, each
holder of the shares called for redemption shall surrender the certificate

(ii) The date fixed for each Specified Corporate Action Redemption
shall be fixed by the Corporation and shall be no less than 60 days or more than
90 days following the occurrence of the Specified Corporate Action giving rise
thereto (or, in the case of a Specified corporate Action as described in clause
(iii) of the definition of "Specified Corporate Action," no less than 60 days or
more than 90 days following the date on which the Corporation obtains actual
knowledge of such Specified Corporate Action). The Corporation shall, within 5
days of the occurrence of a Specified Corporate Action (or, in the case of a
Specified Corporate Action described in clause (iii) of the definition of
"Specified Corporate Action," within 5 days of the date on which the Corporation
obtains actual knowledge of such Specified Corporate Action), give notice

designee, within ten Business Days of such notice, each holder shall return such
inquiry form to the Corporation and shall indicate in such form the proportion
of such holder's shares of Series G Preferred Stock that will be surrendered for
redemption pursuant to this Section 6. If such notice shall indicate that if a
holder does not respond prior to 

76
<PAGE>

ten Business Days after the date of such notice that such holder will be deemed
to have notified the Corporation that it will not require the redemption of the
shares of Series G Preferred Stock held by such holder for purposes of Section
3(b) and such holder does not respond to the Corporation's inquiry prior to
ten Business Days after the date of such notice, such holder will be deemed to
have notified the Corporation that it will not require the redemption of the
shares of Series G Preferred Stock held by such holder for purposes of Sec-
tion 3(b). Nothing contained in this Section 6(a)(iii) shall affect the right
of a holder of Series G Preferred Stock to require the Corporation to redeem
such shares pursuant to Section 6(a)(i).

(b) At any time after , 1995,15/ the holder of any shares
--------- --
of Series G Preferred Stock shall have the right, at such holder's option
exercisable at any time upon 30 days notice to the Corporation, to require the
Corporation to redeem (a "Holder's Election Redemption") all or any part of the
shares of Series G Preferred Stock then held by such holder at a price per share
(the "Holder's Election Redemption Price") equal to the sum of (A) 100% of the
Liquidation Preference of such share, (B) an amount per share equal to all
accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not declared or payable, to the
date specified for such Holder's Election Redemption and (C) the Additional
Amount, in immediately available funds. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
redemption of any portion of such shares would (i) cause any two of Standard's &
Poor's ("S&P"), Moody's Investor Services ("Moody's") and A.M. Best & Co. ("A.M.
Best") to downgrade the rating of (a) the Corporation's securities, in the case
of S&P or Moody's or (b) the pooled rating of the Subsidiaries of the
Corporation engaged in the insurance business, in the case of A.M. Best or (ii)
in the reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of the Corporation have a
material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Corporation, then the
Corporation may elect to deliver with respect to such shares in lieu of cash
senior nonconvertible notes of the Corporation ("Notes") (x) having a final
maturity date no later than December 31, 2006, and (y) having such other terms
and conditions as shall result in a determination that such Notes have a fair
market value as of the date of their proposed issuance at least equal to the sum
of (1) the Holder's Election Redemption Price with respect to such

<PAGE>

shares and (2) customary underwriting discounts and commissions payable with
respect to the sale of securities of a type comparable to the Notes; provided,
--------
however, that if the issuance of senior nonconvertible notes would cause the
- -------
event described in clause (i) above or in the reasonable judgment of the Board
of Directors of the Corporation have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition of the Corporation, then the Corporation may elect to issue
subordinated nonconvertible notes (in which case the term "Notes" shall mean
such subordinated nonconvertible notes) or shares of nonconvertible preferred
stock ("Redemption Preferred Stock") in each case having the terms and
conditions described in clauses (x) and (y) in lieu of senior nonconvertible
notes. The Corporation shall use its best efforts to cause the Notes or the
Redemption Preferred Stock to be registered for immediate resale pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act prior to the issuance
thereof. If such registration statement is not effective within 60 days of the
date of such issuance then the annual interest rate of the Notes or the annual
dividend rate of the Redemption Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be
increased by 0.5% per annum until such securities are sold pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act. For purposes of this
Section 6(b), "fair market value" shall mean the fair market value of the Notes
or Redemption Preferred Stock, as the case may be, as determined by an
investment banking firm of national standing selected by the Corporation and
reasonably acceptable to the holders of a majority of the shares of Series G
Preferred Stock electing to effect such Holder's Election Redemption. In the
case that the Corporation shall be entitled to deliver either subordinated
nonconvertible notes or Redemption Preferred Stock, it shall be the election of
the Corporation whether to deliver such Notes or Redemption Preferred Stock,
except that, if, the sale of the security to be delivered by the Corporation to
effect a Holder's Election Redemption would give rise to an additional liability
on the part of such holder upon the sale thereof and it shall so notify the
Corporation in writing, the Corporation shall deliver to such holder the other
type of security specified in such notice. 

(c) On the date fixed for any Specified Corporate Action Redemption
or Holder's Election Redemption, each holder of shares of Series G Preferred
Stock who elects to have shares of Series G Preferred Stock held by it redeemed
shall surrender the certificate representing such shares to 

78
<PAGE>

the Corporation (i) at the place designated in such notice in the case of a
Specified Corporate Action Redemption or (ii) at the Corporation's principal
place of business to be maintained by it, in the case of a Holder's Election
Redemption, together with an election to have such redemption made and shall
thereupon be entitled to receive payment therefor provided in this Section 6. 
If less than all the shares represented by any such surrendered certificate are
redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed shares. 
From and after the date of such redemption (i) the rights to receive dividends
thereon shall cease to accrue and (ii) all rights of the holders of shares of
Series G Preferred Stock so redeemed shall cease and terminate, excepting only
the right to receive the Specified Corporate Action Redemption Price or Holder's
Election Redemption Price therefor, as applicable; provided, however, that if
-------- -------
the Corporation shall default in the payment of the applicable redemption price
or, in the case of a Holder's Election Redemption, elect to postpone payment
thereof in accordance with Section 6(b), the shares of Series G Preferred Stock
that were to be redeemed shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the
holders thereof shall have all of the rights of a holder of Series G Preferred
Stock until such time as such default shall no longer be continuing or shall
have been waived by holders of at least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding shares
of Series G Preferred Stock or, in the case of a Holder's Election Redemption,
so postponed, the date on which the Holder's Election Redemption Price is paid. 

Section 7 Redemption Upon Maturity.

after such notice shall have been mailed and before the Maturity Date the
Corporation may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of shares of Series G
Preferred Stock the funds necessary for such redemption with a bank or trust
company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, having a capital and
surplus of at least $100,000,000. Any moneys so deposited by the Corporation
and unclaimed at the end of two years from the date designated for such
redemption shall revert to the general funds of the Corporation. After such
reversion, any such bank or trust company shall, upon demand, pay over to the
Corporation such unclaimed amounts and thereupon such bank or trust company
shall be relieved of all responsibility in respect thereof and any holder of
shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be redeemed shall look only to the
Corporation for the payment of the Maturity Redemption Price. Any interest
accrued and unpaid on funds deposited pursuant to this Section 5(c) shall be
paid from time to time to the Corporation for its own account.

Price, the shares of Series G Preferred Stock that were to be redeemed shall
thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the holders thereof shall have all of

Section 10 Exchange.
--------

(a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 10, the Corporation

the Corporation ("Subordinated Notes"), at a price per share equal to the
Liquidation Preference per share, with the Subordinated Notes valued for such
purpose at their face value. Simultaneously with such exchange the Corporation
shall pay to each holder of Series G Preferred Stock an amount per share in cash
equal to all accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not declared or
currently payable, to the date fixed for exchange thereof. The Subordinated
Notes shall have an annual interest rate equal to the annual dividend rate on
Series G Preferred Stock and shall contain other terms substantially similar to

<PAGE>

Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York (if such publication shall be
required by applicable law, rule, regulation or securities exchange
requirement), not less than 30, nor more than 60, days prior to the date fixed
for exchange; and, in any case, a similar notice shall be mailed at least 30,
but not more than 60, days prior to the date fixed for exchange to each holder
at such holder's address as it appears on the transfer books of the Corporation.
In order to facilitate the exchange of shares of Series G Preferred Stock
hereunder the Board of Directors may fix a record date for the determination of
shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be exchanged, or may cause the transfer
books of the Corporation for the Series G Preferred Stock to be closed, not more
than 60 days or less than 30 days prior to the date fixed for exchange.

(c) On the date of any exchange being made pursuant to Section 10(a)
that is specified in a notice given pursuant to Section 10(b) and is not deemed
terminated pursuant to Section 10(b), the Corporation shall, and at any time
after the date that is 10 days prior to the date of exchange the Corporation
may, deposit for the benefit of the holders of shares of Series G Preferred
Stock to be exchanged (i) the Subordinated Notes necessary for such exchange and
(ii) an amount in cash equal to all dividends payable with respect thereto upon
such exchange with a bank or trust company in the Borough of Manhattan, The City
of New York, having a capital and surplus of at least $100,000,000. Any
Subordinated Notes so deposited by the Corporation and unclaimed at the end of
two years from the date designated for such exchange shall revert to the Corpo-
ration. After such reversion, any such bank or trust company shall, upon
demand, return to the Corporation such unclaimed Subordinated Notes and
thereupon such bank or trust company shall be relieved of all responsibility in
respect thereof and any holder of shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be
exchanged shall look only to the Corporation for the delivery of the
Subordinated Notes. Any interest accrued on Subordinated Notes deposited
pursuant to this Section 10(c) shall accrue for the accounts of, and be payable
to, the holders of shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be exchanged therefor.

(d) Notice of exchange having been given as aforesaid and not having
been deemed terminated as aforesaid, upon the deposit of Subordinated Notes
pursuant to clause (i) of Section 10(c) and the deposit of the cash referred to
in clause (ii) of Section 10(c) in respect of 

83
<PAGE>

shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be exchanged pursuant to Section 10(a),
notwithstanding that any certificates for such shares shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, from and after the date of exchange designated in
the notice of exchange (i) the shares represented thereby shall no longer be
deemed outstanding, (ii) the rights to receive dividends thereon (except as
provided in paragraph (b) above) shall cease to accrue, and (iii) all rights of
the holders of shares of Series G Preferred Stock to be exchanged shall cease
and terminate, excepting only the right to receive the Subordinated Notes
therefor and the right to receive the dividends described in paragraph (b)
above; provided, however, that if the Corporation shall default in the execution
-------- -------
and delivery of the Convertible Notes, the shares of Series G Preferred Stock
that were to be exchanged shall thereafter be deemed to be outstanding and the
holders thereof shall have all of the rights of a holder of Series G Preferred
Stock until such time as such default shall no longer be continuing or shall
have been waived by holders of at least 66-2/3% of the then outstanding shares
of Series G Preferred Stock.

Section 11 Additional Amount.
-----------------

(a) For the purposes of this Article 3, "Additional Amount" shall
mean an amount per share equal to the product of (i) the excess of the sum of
(1) the Market Price of a share of Common Stock and (2) if the Corporation shall
have issued a right or rights with respect to its outstanding shares of Common
Stock pursuant to a shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar
arrangement, during the period commencing on the "distribution date" of such
right or rights (i.e., the date on which such right or rights commence to trade
----
separately from the Common Stock) and ending on the "triggering date" of such
right or rights (i.e., the date on which such right or rights commence to be
----
exercisable), the Market Price of such right or rights over the Conversion
Amount, in effect as hereinafter determined and (ii) (x) the Liquidation
Preference divided by (y) such Conversion Amount, in all cases calculated as of
the applicable determination date. The Additional Amount shall in no event be
less than zero. The Conversion Amount shall be $17.00, subject to adjustment as
set forth in Section 11(b). For the purpose of calculating the Additional
Amount in connection with an Optional Redemption, Specified Corporate Action
Redemption or Holder's Election Redemption, the Market Price of the Common Stock
and, if applicable, rights shall be the average of the Market Price 

84
<PAGE>

of such securities on the five trading days immediately preceding and the five
trading days immediately following the date of notice of such redemption.

(b) The Conversion Amount shall be subject to adjustment as follows:

(i) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from time to
time (A) pay a dividend or make a distribution on the outstanding shares of
Common Stock in Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend reinvestment
plan approved by the Corporation's Board of Directors), (B) subdivide the
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (C) combine
the outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (D)
issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Stock,
then, and in each such case, the Conversion Amount in effect immediately prior
to such event shall be adjusted so that if the holder of any share of Series G
Preferred Stock were entitled to convert such share into such number of shares
of Common Stock as equals the Liquidation Preference divided by the Conversion
Amount and such holder thereafter surrendered such share for conversion, such
holder would be entitled to receive the number of shares of Common Stock or
other securities of the Corporation that such holder would have owned or would
have been entitled to receive upon or by reason of any of the events described
above had such share of Series G Preferred Stock been converted immediately
prior to the occurrence of such event. An adjustment made pursuant to this
Section 11(b)(i) shall become effective retroactively (A) in the case of any
such dividend or distribution, to the opening of business on the day immediately
following the close of business on the record date for the determination of
holders of Common Stock entitled to receive such dividend or distribution or (B)
in the case of any such subdivision, combination or reclassification, to the
close of business on the day upon which such corporate action becomes effective.

(ii) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from time to
time issue or sell shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, or any options, warrants or other
rights to acquire shares of Common Stock (other than options granted to any
employee or director of the Corporation pursuant to a stock option plan approved
by the shareholders of the Corporation)) for a consideration per share less than
the Conversion Amount then in effect at the record date or 

85
<PAGE>

issuance date, as the case may be (the "Date") referred to in the following
sentence, including, without limitation, upon exercise of rights issued pursuant
to a shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar arrangement (treating the
price per share of any security convertible or exchangeable or exercisable into
Common Stock as equal to (A) the sum of the price for such security convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable into Common Stock plus any additional consideration
payable (without regard to any anti-dilution adjustments) upon the conversion,
exchange or exercise of such security into Common Stock divided by (B) the
number of shares of Common Stock initially underlying such convertible,
exchangeable or exercisable security), other than issuances or sales for which
an adjustment is made pursuant to another paragraph of this Section 11(b), then,
and in each such case, the Conversion Amount then in effect shall be adjusted by
dividing the Conversion Amount in effect on the day immediately prior to the
Date by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the sum of the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Date plus the number
of additional shares of Common Stock issued or to be issued (or the maximum
number into which such convertible or exchangeable securities initially may
convert or exchange or for which such options, warrants or other rights initi-
ally may be exercised) and (y) the denominator of which shall be the sum of the
number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Date plus
the number of shares of Common Stock that the aggregate consideration (if any of
such aggregate consideration is other than cash, as valued by the Board of
Directors including a majority of the Directors who are not officers or
employees of the Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, which determination
shall be conclusive and described in a resolution of the Board of Directors) for
the total number of such additional shares of Common Stock so issued (or into
which such convertible or exchangeable securities may convert or exchange or for
which such options, warrants or other rights may be exercised plus the aggregate
amount of any additional consideration initially payable upon conversion,
exchange or exercise of such security) would purchase at the Conversion Amount. 
Such adjustment shall be made whenever such shares, securities, options,
warrants or other rights are issued, and shall become effective retroactively to
a date immediately following the close of business (i) in the case of issuance
to stockholders of the Corporation, as such, on the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to receive such shares, securities,
options, warrants or other rights and 

86
<PAGE>

(ii) in all other cases, on the date ("issuance date") of such issuance;
provided, however, that the determination as to whether an adjustment is
- -------- -------
required to be made pursuant to this Section 11(b)(ii) shall only be made upon
the issuance of such shares or such convertible or exchangeable securities,
options, warrants or other rights, and not upon the issuance of the security
into which such convertible or exchangeable security converts or exchanges, or
the security underlying such option, warrants or other right; provided, further,
-------- -------
that if any convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other
rights (or any portions thereof) that shall have given rise to an adjustment
pursuant to this Section 11(b)(ii) shall have expired or terminated without the
exercise thereof and/or if by reason of the terms of such convertible or
exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights there shall have been
an increase or increases, with the passage of time or otherwise, in the price
payable upon the exercise or conversion thereof, then the Conversion Amount
hereunder shall be readjusted (but to no greater extent than originally
adjusted) on the basis of (x) eliminating from the computation any additional
shares of Common Stock corresponding to such convertible or exchangeable
securities, options, warrants or other rights as shall have expired or termi-
nated, (y) treating the additional shares of Common Stock, if any, actually
issued or issuable pursuant to the previous exercise of such convertible or
exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other rights as having been issued
for the consideration actually received and receivable therefor and (z) treating
any of such convertible or exchangeable securities, options, warrants or other
rights that remain outstanding as being subject to exercise or conversion on the
basis of such exercise or conversion price as shall be in effect at the time. 

(iii) In case the Corporation shall at any time or from time to
time distribute to all holders of shares of its Common Stock (including any such
distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the
Corporation is the resulting or surviving corporation and the Common Stock is
not changed or exchanged a redemption of any rights pursuant to a shareholder
rights plan, "poison pill" or similar arrangement) cash, evidences of
indebtedness of the Corporation or another issuer, securities of the Corporation
or another issuer or other assets (excluding (A) Permitted Dividends described
in clause (B) of the definition thereof and (B) securities for which adjustment
is made under Section 11(b)(i) or Section 

87
<PAGE>

11(b)(ii)), then, and in each such case, the Conversion Amount then in effect
shall be adjusted by dividing the Conversion Amount in effect immediately prior
to the date of such distribution by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall
be the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the record date referred to
below and (y) the denominator of which shall be such Current Market Price of the
Common Stock less the then Fair Market Value (as determined by the Board of
Directors of the Corporation, which determination shall be conclusive) of the
portion of the cash, evidences of indebtedness, securities or other assets so
distributed or of such subscription rights or warrants applicable to one share
of Common Stock (but such denominator not to be less than one). Such adjustment
shall be made whenever any such distribution is made and shall become effective
retroactively to a date immediately following the close of business on the
record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such
distribution.

(iv) In the case the Corporation at any time or from time to
time shall take any action affecting its Common Stock, other than an action
described in any of Section 11(b)(i) through Section 11(b)(iii), inclusive,
then, the Conversion Amount shall be adjusted in such manner and at such time as
the Board of Directors of the Corporation (other than Purchaser Designees or
directors elected pursuant to Section 3(b)) in good faith determines to be
equitable in the circumstances (such determination to be evidenced in a
resolution, a certified copy of which shall be mailed to the holders of the
Series G Preferred Stock).

(v) The Corporation may make such reductions in the Conversion
Amount, in addition to those required by subparagraphs (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv)
of this Section 11(b), as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable in
order to avoid or to diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or
rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from any dividend or distribution of
stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any event treated as such for income
tax purposes.

(vi) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section 11(b),
no adjustment to the Conversion Amount shall be made with respect to any rights
issued pursuant to a shareholder rights plan, "poison pill" or similar
arrangement unless the "triggering date" (i.e. the date on which such rights
----
commence to be exercisable) shall have 

88
<PAGE>

occurred or such rights shall have been redeemed, in which event adjustments
under clause (ii) and clause (iii), respectively, shall be made.

(c) If the Corporation shall take a record of the holders of its
Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a dividend or other
distribution, and shall thereafter and before the distribution to stockholders
thereof legally abandon its plan to pay or deliver such dividend or
distribution, then thereafter no adjustment in the Conversion Amount then in
effect shall be required by reason of the taking of such record.

(d) Upon any increase or decrease in the Conversion Amount, then, and
in each such case, the Corporation promptly shall deliver to each registered
holder of Series G Preferred Stock at least 10 Business Days prior to effecting
any of the foregoing transactions a certificate, signed by the President or a
Vice President and by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer or the Secretary
or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, setting forth in reasonable detail
the event requiring the adjustment and the method by which such adjustment was
calculated and specifying the increased or decreased Conversion Amount then in
effect following such adjustment.

STOCK OPTION
------------

1. Grant of Option. Pursuant to the Securities Purchase
---------------

Agreement, dated as of October ___, 1994 (the "Securities Purchase

Agreement"), between The Continental Corporation, a New York corporation (the

"Corporation"), and TCC-PS Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited

partnership (the "Optionee"), the Corporation hereby grants to the Optionee,

for the period beginning on [the Closing Date] and ending at midnight (New

York Time) on [seventh anniversary of the Closing Date] (the "Expiration

Date"), the exclusive and irrevocable right and option (this "Option") to

purchase from the Corporation for cash in an amount equal to 

<PAGE>

$125,000,000.00 (the "Exercise Price") a total of 1,250,000 shares (the

"Shares") of Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series G (the "Series G Preferred

Stock"), par value $4.00 per share, of the Corporation, as such Series G

Preferred Stock is designated in the Certificate of Incorporation of the

Corporation. Accordingly, the exercise price per Share shall be $100.00 (the

"Exercise Price Per Share").

2. Defined Terms. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein
-------------

shall have the meanings specified in the Securities Purchase Agreement.

3. Exercise of Option. This Option may be exercised in whole or
------------------

in part by the Optionee from time to time between [the Closing Date] and the

Expiration Date. Upon any partial exercise of this Option, the remainder of

this Option shall remain in effect and may be exercised at any time or times

thereafter until the Expiration Date. If the Optionee wishes to exercise

this Option, the Optionee shall send a written notice to the Corporation

specifying its intention to exercise this Option and setting forth a date

(not less than 5 business days and not more than 10 business days from the

date of such notice), time and place for the closing of such purchase. The

place specified in 

2
<PAGE>
3

such notice shall be the offices of the Corporation unless otherwise agreed

to by the Optionee and the Corporation. The date on which the notice is sent

to the Corporation by a means provided for in Section 8.3 hereof shall be

deemed to be the exercise date with respect to such purchase and is referred

to herein as the "Exercise Date." The Option may be exercised only with

respect to full shares of Series G Preferred Stock. No fractional shares of

Series G Preferred Stock shall be issued.

4. Payment and Delivery of Certificates.
------------------------------------

4.1 Delivery of Funds and the Acknowledgement. Upon any
-----------------------------------------

exercise of all or any part of this Option, the Optionee shall on the

Exercise Date (i) deliver to the Corporation an Election to Exercise in the

form of Exhibit A hereto and (ii) make payment to the Corporation of the

aggregate Exercise Price Per Share for the Shares being purchased by delivery

of a certified or bank check or by wire transfer of immediately available

funds to a bank designated by the Corporation.

4.2 Delivery of the Shares. Upon payment (or deemed payment
----------------------

in accordance with Section 4.1) of the Exercise Price Per Share for the

Shares being purchased, the 

3
<PAGE>

Corporation shall deliver to the Optionee certificates representing the

number of Shares being purchased by the Optionee from the Corporation,

registered in the name of the Optionee. The issuance of any Shares upon the

exercise of this Option and the delivery of certificates representing such

Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any tax or other charge

in respect of such issuance.

4.3 Put Option. At any time that the Optionee would be
----------

entitled to cause the redemption of any Shares pursuant to Article 3, Section

6 of the Certificate of Amendment if it were the holder of such Shares, in

lieu of exercising all or any part of this Option, the Optionee may, at any

time (except with respect to a Holder's Election Redemption only after the

[first anniversary of the Closing Date]) instead require the Corporation to

repurchase this Option (or any portion thereof) for cash at a price equal to

the Value (as hereinafter defined for purposes of this Section 4.3) of this

Option. For purposes of this Section 4.3, the Value of this Option (or such

portion) shall equal the product of (i) the number of Shares for which this

Option (or such portion) is exercisable, multiplied by (ii) the excess, if

any, of (A) the applicable redemption price 

4
<PAGE>

per Share at such time pursuant to Article 3, Section 6 of the Certificate of

Amendment (which will be, in each case hereunder, the sum of (x) 100% of the

Liquidation Preference of such share and (y) the Additional Amount), over (B)

the Exercise Price Per Share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the

applicable redemption price is the Holder's Election Redemption Price and the

redemption of any portion of this Option would (i) cause any two of

Standard's & Poor's ("S&P"), Moody's Investor Services ("Moody's") and A.M.

Best & Co. ("A.M. Best") to downgrade the rating of (a) the Corporation's

securities, in the case of S&P or Moody's or (b) the pooled rating of the

Subsidiaries of the Corporation engaged in the insurance business, in the

case of A.M. Best or (ii) in the reasonable judgment of the Board of

Directors of the Corporation have a material adverse effect on the financial

condition of the Corporation, then the Corporation may elect to deliver with

respect to such portion of this Option in lieu of cash senior nonconvertible

notes of the Corporation ("Notes") (x) having a final maturity date no later

than December 31, 2006, and (y) having such other terms and conditions as

shall result in a determination that such Notes have a fair market value as

of the date of their 

5
<PAGE>

proposed issuance at least equal to the sum of (1) the Value of this Option

(or such portion) and (2) customary underwriting discounts and commissions

payable with respect to the sale of securities of a type comparable to the

Notes; provided, however, that if the issuance of senior nonconvertible notes
-------- -------

would cause the event described in clause (i) above or in the reasonable

judgment of the Board of Directors of the Corporation have a material adverse

effect on the financial condition of the Corporation, then the Corporation

may elect to issue, in lieu of senior nonconvertible notes, subordinated

nonconvertible notes (in which case the term "Notes" shall mean such

subordinated nonconvertible notes) or shares of nonconvertible preferred

stock ("Redemption Preferred Stock"), in each case having the terms and

conditions described in clauses (x) and (y) above. The Corporation shall use

its best efforts to cause the Notes or the Redemption Preferred Stock to be

registered for immediate resale pursuant to an effective registration under

the Act prior to the issuance thereof. If such registration statement is not

effective within 60 days of the date of such issuance then the annual

interest rate of the Notes or the annual dividend rate of the Redemption 

6
<PAGE>

Preferred Stock, as applicable, shall be increased by 0.5% per annum until

such securities are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement

under the Act. For purposes of this Section 4.3 "fair market value" shall

mean the fair market value of the Notes or Redemption Preferred Stock, as the

case may be, as determined by an investment banking firm of national standing

selected by the Corporation and reasonably acceptable to the Optionees

electing to effect such Holder's Election Redemption. In the case that the

Corporation shall be entitled to deliver either subordinated nonconvertible

notes or Redemption Preferred Stock, it shall be the election of the

Corporation whether to deliver such Notes or Redemption Preferred Stock,

except that, if the sale of the security to be delivered by the Corporation

pursuant to the terms hereof would give rise to an additional liability on

the part of the Optionee and it shall so notify the Corporation in writing,

the Corporation shall deliver the type of security specified in such notice.

5. Transfer.

fully diluted basis, or (4) pursuant to a tender offer (a) commenced by the

Corporation or (b) commenced by any other person or entity with respect to

<PAGE>

the Shelf Registration pursuant to the penultimate sentence of this Section
2.1(a), the Company may instead amend such Shelf Registration to register
such Registrable Securities. The Shelf Registration shall be on Form S-3 (or
any successor form) if the Company is then eligible to use Form S-3 (or such
successor form). The Company shall use its best efforts to have the Shelf
Registration declared effective as soon as reasonably practicable after such
filing, and shall use its best efforts to keep the Shelf Registration
continuously effective, subject to Section 2.6(a), from the date such Shelf
Registration is declared effective until such time as all of the Registrable
Securities shall cease to be Registrable Securities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, upon the request of any holder of Registrable Securities that has
acquired such Registrable Securities upon foreclosure upon a security
interest granted in such Registrable Securities by the Original Purchaser,
the Company shall promptly file the Shelf Registration with respect to such
Registrable Securities, whether or not such request shall be made prior to
[eleven months after Closing Date], and use its best efforts to have the
Shelf Registration declared effective as soon as reasonably practicable after
such filing; provided, however, that if such Registrable Securities are not
-------- -------
shares of Common Stock, such Shelf Registration shall only be required to
cover the shares of Common Stock (if any) issuable upon conversion of such
Registrable Securities. The filing of the Shelf Registration in accordance
with the immediately preceding sentence shall not relieve the Company of any
of its other obligations under this Section 2.1(a).

(b) Supplements and Amendments; Expenses. The Company
------------------------------------
shall supplement or amend, if necessary, the Shelf Registration, as required
by the registration form utilized by the Company or by the instructions
applicable to such registration form or by the Securities Act or as
reasonably required by the Original Purchaser or the holder or holders of (or
any underwriter for) a majority of the Registrable Securities and the Company
shall furnish to the holders of the Registrable Securities to which the Shelf
Registration relates copies of any such supplement or amendment prior to its
being used 

2
<PAGE>

and/or filed with the Commission. The Company shall pay all Registration
Expenses in connection with the Shelf Registration, whether or not it becomes
effective, and whether all, none or some of the Registrable Securities are
sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration. In no event shall the Shelf
Registration include securities other than Registrable Securities, unless the
Initial Purchaser consents to such inclusion.

(c) Underwriting Procedures. If the Original Purchaser
-----------------------
so elects or, in the event the Original Purchaser does not hold 50% of the
Registrable Securities, if the holders of a majority of the Registrable
Securities so elect, the offering of all or a portion of such Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration shall be in the form of an
underwritten offering and the managing underwriter or underwriters selected
for such offering shall be selected by the Original Purchaser or such
holders, as the case may be, and reasonably acceptable to the Company. The
Original Purchaser or such holders shall provide the Company with notice of
the identity of the managing underwriter or underwriters it or they have
selected a reasonable time prior to the commencement of any such underwritten
offering.

2.2 Incidental Registration.
-----------------------

(a) Right to Include Registrable Securities. If at any
---------------------------------------
time subsequent to the [first anniversary of Closing Date] the Company at any
time proposes to register any of its Common Stock under the Securities Act by
registration on any form other than Form S-4 or S-8, whether or not for sale
for its own account, it will each such time give prompt written notice to all
registered holders of Registrable Securities of its intention to do so and of
such holders' rights under this Section 2.2. Upon the written request of any
such holder (a "Requesting Holder") made as promptly as practicable and in
any event within 20 days after the receipt of any such notice (10 days if the
Company states in such written notice or gives telephonic or telecopied
notice to all registered holders of Registrable Securities, with written
confirmation to follow promptly thereafter, stating that (i) such
registration will be on Form S-3 and (ii) such shorter period of time is
required because of a planned filing date) (which request shall specify the
Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such Requesting Holder
and the intended method of disposition), the Company will use its reasonable
best efforts 

3
<PAGE>

to effect the registration under the Securities Act of all Registrable
Securities that the Company has been so requested to register by the
Requesting Holders thereof to the extent required to permit the disposition
of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended methods
thereof described as aforesaid; provided, however, that prior to the
-------- -------
effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such
registration, immediately upon notification to the Company from the managing
underwriter of the price at which such securities are to be sold, if such
price is below the price which any Requesting Holder shall have indicated to
be acceptable to such Requesting Holder, the Company shall so advise such
Requesting Holder of such price, and such Requesting Holder shall then have
the right to withdraw its request to have its Registrable Securities included
in such registration statement; provided further, that if, at any time after
-------- -------
giving written notice of its intention to register any securities and prior
to the effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with
such registration, the Company shall determine for any reason not to register
or to delay registration of such securities, the Company may, at its
election, give written notice of such determination to each Requesting Holder
of Registrable Securities and (i) in the case of a determination not to
register, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any Registrable
Securities in connection with such registration (but not from any obligation
of the Company to pay the Registration Expenses in connection therewith),
without prejudice, however, to the rights of any holder or holders of
Registrable Securities under Section 2.1, and (ii) in the case of a
determination to delay registering, shall be permitted to delay registering
any Registrable Securities, for the same period as the delay in registering
such other securities. No registration effected under this Section 2.2 shall
relieve the Company of its obligations under Section 2.1. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Shelf Registration is effective at the time the Company
proposes to effect a registration subject to this Section 2.2(a), the Company
shall have no obligation to notify the holders of Registrable Securities or
effect the registration of any such securities under this Section 2.2(a)
unless the securities to be registered by the Company are to be disposed of
in an underwritten offering.

(b) Priority in Incidental Registrations. If the
------------------------------------
managing underwriter of any underwritten offering shall inform the Company by
letter that, in its opinion, the number or type of Registrable Securities 

4
<PAGE>

requested to be included in such registration would adversely affect such
offering, and the Company has so advised the Requesting Holders in writing,
then the Company will include in such registration, to the extent of the
number and type that the Company is so advised can be sold in (or during the
time of) such offering, first, all securities proposed by the Company to be
-----
sold for its own account, second, such Registrable Securities requested to be
------
included in such registration pursuant to this Agreement, pro rata among such
Requesting Holders on the basis of the estimated proceeds from the sale
thereof and, third, all other securities proposed to be registered.
-----

(c) Expenses. The Company will pay all Registration
--------
Expenses in connection with any registration effected pursuant to this
Section 2.2.

2.3 Registration Procedures. If and when-ever the Company is
-----------------------
required to effect the registration of any Registrable Securities under the
Securities Act as provided in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, the Company will, as
expeditiously as possible:

(i) prepare and file with the Commission the requisite
registration statement to effect such registration and thereafter use
its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become
effective; provided, however, that the Company may discontinue any
-------- -------
registration of its securities that are not Registrable Securities (and,
under the circumstances specified in Section 2.2(a), its securities that
are Registrable Securities) at any time prior to the effective date of
the registration statement relating thereto;

(ii) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments
and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used
in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration
statement effective and to comply with the provisions of the Securities
Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement until such time as all of such
Registrable Securities have been disposed of in accordance with the
intended methods of disposition by the seller or sellers thereof set
forth in such registration statement; provided, however, that in the
-------- -------
case of a registration statement filed pursuant to Sec-

5
<PAGE>

tion 2.2(a), not later than 135 days after the effective date thereof;

(iii) furnish to each selling holder of Registrable
Securities covered by such registration statement, such number of
conformed copies of such registration statement and of each such
amendment and supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits,
appropriately redacted in the case of those exhibits filed on a
confidential basis), and so long as the Company is required to keep such
registration statement effective pursuant to subdivision (ii) such
number of copies of the prospectus contained in such registration
statement (including each preliminary prospectus and any summary
prospectus) and any other prospectus filed under Rule 424 under the
Securities Act, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities
Act, and such other documents, as such selling holder may reasonably
request;

(iv) use its best efforts (x) to register or qualify all
Registrable Securities and other securities covered by such registration
statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of such States of
the United States of America where an exemption is not available and as
the selling holder of Registrable Securities covered by such
registration statement shall reasonably request, (y) to keep such
registration or qualification in effect for so long as such registration
statement remains in effect and (z) to take any other action that may be
necessary or advisable to enable such selling holders to consummate the
disposition in such jurisdictions of the securities to be sold by such
selling holders, except that the Company shall not for any such purpose
be required to (a) qualify generally to do business as a foreign
corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it would not, but for the
requirements of this subdivision (iv), be obligated to be so qualified,
(b) become subject to taxation in any jurisdiction where it would not
then so subject or (c) take any action that would subject it to general
service of process in any such jurisdiction;

(v) use its reasonable best efforts to cause all
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement to be
registered with or approved by such other federal or state governmental
agencies or authorities as may be necessary in the opinion of 

6
<PAGE>

counsel to the Company and counsel to the selling holder or selling
holders of Registrable Securities to enable the seller or sellers
thereof to consummate the disposition of such Registrable Securities;

(vi) furnish at the effective date of such registration
statement and the date of closing of the sale of the Registrable
Securities (whether or not such sale is underwritten), to each selling
holder of Registrable Securities, and each such selling holder's
underwriters, if any, a signed counterpart of:

(x) an opinion of counsel for the Company, dated
the effective date of such registration statement (or such date of
sale, as applicable), and

(y) a "comfort" letter signed by the independent
public accountants who have certified the Company's financial
statements included or incorporated by reference in such
registration statement,

covering substantially the same matters with respect to such
registration statement (and the prospectus included therein) and, in the
case of the accountants' comfort letter, with respect to events
subsequent to the date of such financial statements, as are customarily
covered in opinions of issuer's counsel and in accountants' comfort
letters delivered to the underwriters in underwritten public offerings
of securities;

(vii) notify each selling holder of Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act,
upon discovery that, or upon the happening of any event known to the
Company as a result of which, the prospectus included in such registra-
tion statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, and, subject
to Section 2.6(a), promptly prepare and, at the request of any such
selling holder, furnish to it a reasonable number of copies of a
supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so 

7
<PAGE>

that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such securities, such
prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein not misleading in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made;

(viii) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply
with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and, if
required, make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably
practicable, an earnings statement covering the period of at least
twelve months, but not more than eighteen months, beginning with the
first full calendar month after the effective date of such registration
statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of
Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 promulgated thereunder,
and promptly furnish to each such selling holder of Registrable
Securities a copy of any amendment or supplement to such registration
statement or prospectus;

(ix) provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent
and registrar (which, in each case, may be the Company) for all
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement from and
after a date not later than the effective date of such registration; and

(x) use its best efforts to list all Registrable
Securities covered by such registration statement on The New York Stock
Exchange.

The Company may require each selling holder of Registrable Securities as to
which any registration is being effected to furnish the Company such
information regarding such selling holder and the distribution of such
securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in
writing.

Each holder of Registrable Securities agrees by acquisition of such
Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company of
the happening of any event of the kind described in subdivision (vii) of this
Section 2.3, such holder will forthwith discontinue such holder's disposition
of Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration statement relating to
such Registrable Securities until such holder's receipt of the copies of the 

8
<PAGE>

supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by subdivision (vii) of this
Section 2.3 and, if so directed by the Company, will deliver to the Company
(at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies, then
in such holder's possession of the prospectus relating to such Registrable
Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice.

2.4 Underwritten Offerings.
----------------------

(a) Requested Underwritten Offerings. If requested by
--------------------------------
the underwriters for any underwritten offering by holders of Registrable
Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, the Company will use
all reasonable efforts to enter into an underwriting agreement with such
underwriters for such offering, such agreement to be reasonably satisfactory
in substance and form to the Company, the Original Holder (or, if the
Original Holder does not hold 50% of the Registrable Securities to be
included in such underwritten offering, the holders of a majority of the
Registrable Securities to be included in such underwritten offering) and the
underwriters and to contain such representations and warranties by the
Company and such other terms as are customary in agreements of that type,
including, without limitation, indemnities to the effect and to the extent
provided in Section 2.7. The holders of the Registrable Securities proposed
to be sold by such underwriters will reasonably cooperate with the Company in
the negotiation of the underwriting agreement. Such holders of Registrable
Securities to be sold by such underwriters shall be parties to such
underwriting agreement and may, at their option, require that any or all of
the representations and warranties by, and the other agreements on the part
of, the Company to and for the benefit of such underwriters shall also be
made to and for the benefit of such holders of Registrable Securities and
that any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such
underwriters under such underwriting agreement be conditions precedent to the
obligations of such holders of Registrable Securities. No holder of
Registrable Securities shall be required to make any representations or
warranties to or agreements with the Company other than representations,
warranties or agreements regarding such holder, such holder's Registrable
Securities and such holder's intended method of distribution or any other
representations required by applicable law.

9
<PAGE>

(b) Incidental Underwritten Offerings. If the Company
---------------------------------
proposes to register any of its securities under the Securities Act as
contemplated by Section 2.2 and such securities are to be distributed by or
through one or more underwriters, the Company will, if requested by any
Requesting Holder of Registrable Securities in the notice given to the
Company by such Requesting Holder under Section 2.2(a), use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange for such underwriters to include all the Registrable
Securities to be offered and sold by such Requesting Holder among the
securities of the Company to be distributed by such underwriters, subject to
the provisions of Section 2.2(b). The holders of Registrable Securities to
be distributed by such underwriters shall be parties to the underwriting
agreement between the Company and such underwriters and may, at their option,
require that any or all of the representations and warranties by, and the
other agreements on the part of, the Company to and for the benefit of such
underwriters shall also be made to and for the benefit of such holders of
Registrable Securities and that any or all of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of such underwriters under such underwriting agreement be
conditions precedent to the obligations of such holders of Registrable
Securities. Any such Requesting Holder of Registrable Securities shall not
be required to make any representations or warranties to or agreements with
the Company or the underwriters other than representations, warranties or
agreements regarding such Requesting Holder, such Requesting Holder's
Registrable Securities and such Requesting Holder's intended method of
distribution or any other representations required by applicable law. The
holders of Registrable Securities, if requested by the managing underwriter
or underwriters of such underwritten offering, shall not, except as part of
such underwritten offering, effect any public sale or distribution of
Registrable Securities of the same class as any securities included in such
underwritten offering (including a sale pursuant to Rule 144) during the
10-day period prior to, and during the 90-day period beginning on, the
closing date of such underwritten offering, to the extent timely notified in
writing by the Company or the managing underwriter or underwriters. No
holder of Registrable Securities may participate in any such underwritten
offering unless such holder (i) agrees to sell such holder's Registrable
Securities on the basis provided in the underwriting agreement and
(ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney, and other
documents reasonably required under the terms of the underwriting agreement.

10
<PAGE>

(c) Underwriting Discounts and Commissions. The holders
--------------------------------------
of Registrable Securities sold in any offering pursuant to Section 2.4(a) or
Section 2.4(b) shall pay all underwriting discounts and commissions of the
underwriter or underwriters with respect to the Registrable Securities sold
thereby.

2.5 Preparation; Reasonable Investigation. In connection with
-------------------------------------
the preparation and filing of each registration statement under the
Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will give the holders
of Registrable Securities registered under such registration statement, their
underwriters, if any, and their respective counsel the opportunity to
participate in the preparation of such registration statement, each
prospectus included therein or filed with the Commission, and each amendment
thereof or supplement thereto, and will give each of them such reasonable
access to its books and records and such opportunities to discuss the
business of the Company with its officers and the independent public
accountants who have certified its financial statements as shall be
necessary, in the opinion of such holders' and such underwriters' respective
counsel, to conduct a reasonable investigation within the meaning of the
Securities Act; provided, however, that each such holder, underwriter or
-------- -------
counsel shall receive such information only if such holder, underwriter or
counsel and their respective agents and representatives shall have expressly
agreed that any information that is designated in writing by the Company, in
good faith, as confidential at the time of delivery of such information,
shall be kept confidential by such holder, underwriters, counsel, agent or
representative and not be used for any purpose other than in connection with
the review by such holder, underwriter, counsel, agent or representative of
the registration statement except to the extent (i) disclosure of such
information is required by court or administrative order or applicable law,
(ii) disclosure of such information, in the opinion of counsel to such
holder, underwriter, counsel, agent or representative is necessary to avoid
or correct a misstatement or omission of a material fact in the registration
statement, prospectus or any supplement or post-effective amendment thereto,
(iii) disclosure of such information is in the opinion of counsel for any
such holder, underwriter, counsel, agent or representative necessary or
advisable in connection with any action, claim, suit or proceeding, directly
or indirectly, involving or potentially involving such holder, underwriter,
counsel, agent or representative and arising out of, or based upon, relating
to or involving this Agreement or any 

11
<PAGE>

of the transactions contemplated hereunder or (iv) such information becomes
generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure or
failure to safeguard by such holder, underwriter, counsel, agent or
representative. Each selling holder of such Registrable Securities further
agrees that it will, upon learning that disclosure of any such information is
sought pursuant to a court or administrative order, give prompt notice
thereof to the Company and allow the Company, at the Company's expense, to
undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of the information deemed
confidential. The Company shall promptly notify the holders of Registrable
Securities and their counsel of any stop order issued or threatened by the
Commission and take all reasonable actions required to prevent the entry of
such stop order or to remove it if entered.

2.6 Limitations, Conditions and Qualifications to Obligations
---------------------------------------------------------
under Registration Covenants. 
----------------------------

(a) Limitation on Requirement to File or Amend
------------------------------------------
Registration Statement. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary
----------------------
notwithstanding, it is understood and agreed that the Company shall not be
required to file a Registration Statement, amendment or post-effective amend-
ment thereto or prospectus supplement or to supplement or amend any
Registration Statement if the Company is then involved in discussions
concerning, or otherwise engaged in, an acquisition, disposition, financing
or other material transaction and the Company determines in good faith that
the making of such a filing, supplement or amendment at such time would
materially adversely effect or interfere with such transaction so long as the
Company shall, as soon as practicable thereafter (but in no event more than
90 days thereafter) make such filing, supplement or amendment. The Company
shall promptly give the holders of Registrable Securities written notice of
such postponement, containing a general statement of the reasons for such
postponement and an approximation of the anticipated delay, provided,
--------
however, that nothing herein shall require the Company to disclose any terms
-------
of any such transaction or the identity of any party thereto. Upon receipt
by a holder of notice of an event of the kind described in this Section
2.6(a), such holder shall forthwith discontinue such holder's disposition of
Registrable Securities until such holder's receipt of notice from the Company
that such disposition may continue and of any supplemented or amended
prospectus indicated in such notice.

12
<PAGE>

(b) Provision of Information by Holder. Each selling
----------------------------------
holder of Registrable Securities as to which any registration is being
effected agrees, as a condition to the registration obligations with respect
to such selling holder provided herein, to furnish promptly to the Company
such information regarding the selling holder and the distribution of such
Registrable Securities as the Company may, from time to time, reasonably
request in writing to comply with the Securities Act and other applicable
law. The Company may exclude from such registration the Registrable
Securities of any selling holder who unreasonably fails to furnish such
information within a reasonable time after receiving such request. If the
identity of a selling holder of Registrable Securities is to be disclosed in
a registration statement, such selling holder shall be permitted to include
all information regarding such selling holder as it shall reasonably request.

(c) Discontinuation of Offering. Each holder of
---------------------------
Registrable Securities agrees that, upon receipt of written notice from the
Company of (i) the issuance by the Commission of a stop order suspending the
effectiveness of a registration statement or of any order preventing or
suspending the use of any preliminary prospectus or the initiation of any
proceedings for that purpose or (ii) the receipt by the Company of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption
from qualification of a registration statement or any Registrable Securities
covered thereby for offer or sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation of
any proceeding for such purpose, such holder shall forthwith discontinue the
disposition of such Registrable Securities covered by such registration
statement or prospectus (but in the case of clause (ii), solely in the
applicable jurisdiction) until such holder's receipt of the copies of the
supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by the Company, or until it
is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the applicable
prospectus may be resumed, and has received copies of any amendments or
supplements thereto, and, if so directed by the Company, such holder will
deliver to the Company all copies, other than permanent file copies, then in
such holder's possession, of the prospectus covering such Registrable
Securities current at the time of receipt of such notice.

2.7 Indemnification.
---------------

(a) Indemnification by the Company. The Company will,
------------------------------
and hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless, in the case of any registration
statement filed pursuant to Section 2.1 or 2.2, each holder of any Regis-
trable Securities covered by such registration statement, and each other
Person who participates as an underwriter in the offering or sale of such
securities and each other Person, if any, who controls such holder or any
such underwriter within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, and
their respective directors, officers, partners, agents and affiliates,
against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to
which such holder or underwriter or any such director, officer, partner,
agent, affiliate or controlling person may become subject under the
Securities Act or otherwise, including, without limitation, the fees and
expenses of legal counsel, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or
are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any
material fact contained in any registration statement filed by the Company
under which such securities were registered under the Securities Act, any
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained
therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein in light of the circumstances in
which they were made not misleading, and the Company will reimburse such
holder or underwriter and each such director, officer, partner, employee,
agent, affiliate and controlling Person for any legal or any other expenses
reasonably incurred by them in connection with investigating or defending any
such loss, claim, liability, action or proceeding; provided, however, that
-------- -------
the Company shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such
loss, claim, damage, liability (or action or proceeding in respect thereof)
or expense arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration
statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary prospectus,
amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such holder,
underwriter, director, officer, partner, employee, agent, affiliate or
controlling Person, as the case may be, expressly for use in the preparation
thereof; provided further, that the Company shall not be liable in any such 
-------- -------

14
<PAGE>

case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense
arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of any material fact contained in any such registration statement,
preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or summary prospectus contained
therein or any omission to state therein a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in light of the
circumstances in which they were made not misleading in a prospectus or pros-
pectus supplement, if (i) such untrue statement or omission is completely
corrected in an amendment or supplement to such prospectus or prospectus
supplement, the seller of the Registrable Securities has an obligation under
the Securities Act to deliver a prospectus or prospectus supplement in
connection with such sale of Registrable Securities and the seller of
Registrable Securities thereafter fails to deliver such prospectus or
prospectus supplement as so amended or supplemented prior to or concurrently
with the sale of Registrable Securities to the person asserting such loss,
claim, damage or liability after the Company has furnished such seller with a
sufficient number of copies of the same or (ii) if the seller received
written notice from the Company of the existence of such an untrue statement
or such an omission and the seller continued to dispose of Registrable
Securities prior to the time of the receipt of either (a) an amended or
supplemented prospectus or prospectus supplement that completely corrected
the untrue statement or the omission or (b) a notice from the Company that
the use of the existing prospectus or prospectus supplement may be resumed. 
Such indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of such seller or any such director,
officer, partner, employee, agent, affiliate or controlling person and shall
survive the transfer of such securities by such seller.

(b) Indemnification by the Sellers. As a condition to
------------------------------
including any Registrable Securities in any registration statement, the
Company shall have received an undertaking satisfactory to it from the
prospective seller of such Registrable Securities, to indemnify and hold
harmless (in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth in Section
2.7(a)) the Company, and each director of the Company, each officer of the
Company and each other Person, if any, who participates as an underwriter in
the offering or sale of such securities and each other Person who controls
the Company or any such underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act,
with respect to any statement 

15
<PAGE>

or alleged statement in or omission or alleged omission from such
registration statement, any preliminary prospectus, final prospectus or
summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto,
if such statement or alleged statement or omission or alleged omission was
made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to
the Company by such seller expressly for use in the preparation of such
registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final prospectus, summary
prospectus, amendment or supplement; provided, however, that (A) the
-------- -------
indemnifying party shall not be liable in any such case to the extent that
any such statement or omission is completely corrected (x) in the final
prospectus, in the case of a preliminary prospectus, or (y) in an amendment
or supplement to a prospectus or prospectus supplement (provided, however,
-------- -------
that nothing in this clause (y) shall limit the indemnifying party's liabi-
lity with respect to sales made prior to the receipt by the Company from the
indemnifying party of written notice of such an untrue statement or such an
omission) and (B) the liability of such indemnifying party under this Section
2.7(b) shall be limited to the amount of proceeds received by such indem-
nifying party in the offering giving rise to such liability. Such indemnity
shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made
by or on behalf of the Company or any such director, officer or controlling
person and shall survive the transfer of such securities by such holder.

(c) Notices of Claims, etc. Promptly after receipt by
-----------------------
an indemnified party of notice of the commencement of any action or
proceeding involving a claim referred to in Section 2.7(a) or (b), such
indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against
an indemnifying party, give written notice to the latter of the commencement
of such action; provided, however, that the failure of any indemnified party
-------- -------
to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of
its obligations under the preceding subdivisions of this Section 2.7, except
to the extent that the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced by such
failure to give notice. In case any such action shall be brought against any
indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the
commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate
therein and, to the extent that it may wish, to assume the defense thereof,
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such indemnified party; provided,
--------
however, that (i) if the indemnified party reasonably believes that it is
-------
advisable for it to be represented by 

16
<PAGE>

separate counsel because there exists or may exist a conflict of interest
between its interests and those of the indemnifying party with respect to
such claim, or there exist defenses available to such indemnified party that
may not be available to the indemnifying party, or (ii) if the indemnifying
party shall fail to assume responsibility for such defense, the indemnified
party may retain counsel satisfactory to it and, in the case of clause (i),
reasonably satisfactory to the indemnifying party, and the indemnifying party
shall pay all fees and expenses of such counsel; provided further, that the
-------- -------
indemnifying party shall not be deemed to have failed to assume
responsibility for such defense if the indemnifying party has not received
notice of such claim pursuant to this Section 2.7(c). In the event an
indemnifying party elects not to assume, or shall not be entitled to assume
because of a conflict of interest between its interests and those of the
indemnified party, the defense of a claim, such indemnifying party shall not
be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel or firm of
counsel in any jurisdiction in any one legal action or group of related legal
actions for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party in respect of
such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any such indemnified party a
conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other
of such indemnified parties in respect of such claim. No indemnifying party
shall be liable for any settlement of any action or proceeding effected
without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed. No indemnifying party shall, without the consent of the
indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving
by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all
liability in respect to such claim or litigation or that requires action
other than the payment of money by the indemnifying party.

(d) Contribution. If the indemnification provided for
------------
in this Section 2.7 shall for any reason be held by a court to be unavailable
to an indemnified party under Section 2.7(a) or (b) hereof in respect of any
loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, then, in
lieu of the amount paid or payable under Section 2.7(a) or (b), the
indemnified party and the indemnifying party under Section 2.7(a) or (b)
shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities
(including legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in 

17
<PAGE>

connection with investigating the same), (i) in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company and the prospective
sellers of Registrable Securities covered by the registration statement that
resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action or proceeding in
respect thereof, with respect to the statements or omissions which resulted
in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action or proceeding in respect
thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations or (ii) if
the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable
law, in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative
benefits received by the Company and such prospective sellers from the
offering of the securities covered by such registration statement; provided,
--------
however, that for purposes of this clause (ii), the relative benefits
-------
received by the prospective sellers shall be deemed not to exceed the amount
of proceeds received by such prospective sellers. No Person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Such prospective sellers'
obligations to contribute as provided in this Section 2.7(d) are several in
proportion to the relative value of their respective Registrable Securities
covered by such registration statement and not joint. In addition, no Person
shall be obligated to contribute hereunder any amounts in payment for any
settlement of any action or claim effected without such Person's consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(e) Other Indemnification. Indemnification and
---------------------
contribution similar to that specified in the preceding subdivisions of this
Section 2.7 (with appropriate modifications) shall be given by the Company
and each holder of Registrable Securities with respect to any required regis-
tration or other qualification of securities under any federal or state law
or regulation of any governmental authority other than the Securities Act.

(f) Indemnification Payments. The indemnification and
------------------------
contribution required by this Section 2.7 shall be made by periodic payments
of the amount thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as
and when bills are received or expense, loss, damage or liability is
incurred.

delivered on such Closing Date by the Company to
the Purchaser pursuant to the Agreement, and

Business or any of the Purchased Assets), and such examina-

tion of the books, records and financial condition of the

Business (and of Continental and its Affiliates insofar as

other such corporate, accounting and other records as may be

reasonably requested in connection with such matters. Each

party will allow representatives of any other party access

to such records upon reasonable notice, during normal

business hours and under reasonable circumstances in such a

way that will not interfere unreasonably with the conduct of

the business of the party providing access, provided that 
--------

<PAGE>

57

all information and documents obtained pursuant to this Sec-

tion 6.4(b) will be kept confidential except as required by

Law. If disclosure is required by Law, the party required

--------

to maintain such position; provided that no party hereto

adjustment made by any Taxing authority that could give rise

to an indemnification obligation under this Agreement on the

part of such other party (including any threatened audit or

other governmental proceedings) within 10 days after becom-

ing aware of any such proposed adjustment or threatened

audit or other governmental proceedings. The Seller shall

conduct and control any such audit or other governmental

proceedings to the extent it relates to Taxes that are

Excluded Liabilities and the Buyer shall in good faith

cooperate with the Seller in the conduct of such audit or

other governmental proceedings; provided that notwithstand-

together with any interest allocable to such refund received

from or allowed as credit against any liability by such

taxing authority, promptly after receipt of such refund or

interest from such taxing authority or realization of the

benefit of such credit by filing the relevant Tax return or

otherwise.

maintained or contributed to by the Buyer or an Affiliate

thereof after the Closing.

portion of any guaranteed investment contract or similar

investment vehicle reasonably acceptable to the Buyer.

under this Section 6.16(b), the Buyer Savings Plan shall be

liable for any distribution that becomes due to any

Transferred Employee. In the event that benefit payments 

<PAGE>

78

Plan to a Transferred Employee under this Section 6.16(b),

the amount of assets to be transferred from such plan shall

be reduced by an amount equal to such distribution. Upon

hereunder, Continental shall have no further liability to

the applicable Transferred Employees or to the Buyer in

connection with the Account Balances.

anniversary thereof. If the Buyer makes such request, and

such request is granted, the Buyer shall reimburse the

Seller on a monthly basis, within 10 business days of

notification by the Seller of the amount of such costs, for

the monthly costs incurred in providing such coverage. The

costs of coverage shall be determined by the Seller, subject

<PAGE>

79

such six-month period destroy any unused Marked Materials. 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Sec-

tion 6.19, the Buyer shall be entitled to retain and use

solely for archival and records purposes (including as

necessary and consistent with such use, making copies

thereof) any Marked Materials which are in the files,

records and archives of the Seller that have been acquired

If a Notice of Disagreement is received by the Buyer in a

timely manner, then the Certified Buyer Statement (as

revised in accordance with clause (x) or (y) below) shall

become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of

(x) the date the parties hereto resolve in writing any

differences they have with respect to any matter specified

matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement. If, at the

end of such twenty day period, the Buyer and Continental

have not reached agreement on such matters, the matters

which remain in dispute shall be submitted to an arbitrator

for review and resolution in accordance with the following

procedures. Within ten days after the expiration of the

twenty-day period, Continental shall (a) together with the

Buyer contact Coopers & Lybrand (or any other nationally

recognized independent public accounting firm agreed upon by

the Buyer and Continental) to arrange for the appointment of

a single arbitrator (the "Arbitrator") who shall be a senior

partner of the firm with no prior direct contact with either

party, and (b) serve upon the Buyer (and the Arbitrator as

Arbitrator a Response to the Statement of Claim setting

forth in detail the arguments in favor of the Buyer's

position and the evidentiary basis therefor. The Arbitrator

shall thereafter conduct such further proceedings as he or

she deems appropriate, including a hearing unless waived by

both parties, and shall render a final, binding and non-

appealable written decision within thirty days of the date

upon which the Buyer's Response is served upon Continental. 

Any other matter relating to a disagreement with respect to

the payment of any sum pursuant to Section 7.1 or

Section 7.2 (other than Section 7.2(g)) shall also be

subject to arbitration by the Arbitrator in accordance with

the procedures set forth above. The fees of the Arbitrator

shall be borne 50% by each Party; provided, that the

Arbitrator may apportion such fees and other costs of the

arbitration (including attorneys' fees) in his or her

discretion.

deficiencies, demands, claims, actions, judgments or causes

of action, assessments, costs or expenses (including

11.3 Notice to Indemnifying Party. If any
----------------------------

party hereto (the "Indemnitee") receives written notice of

any third party claim or potential claim or the commencement

of any action or proceeding that could give rise to an

obligation on the part of any other party hereto to provide

indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") pursuant to

Section 11.1 or 11.2, the Indemnitee shall promptly give the

Indemnifying Party notice thereof (the "Indemnification

Notice"); provided, however, that the failure to give the
-------- -------

Indemnification Notice promptly shall not impair the

Indemnitee's right to indemnification in respect of such

claim, action or proceeding unless, and only to the extent

that, the lack of prompt notice adversely affects the

ability of the Indemnifying Party to defend against or

diminish the Losses arising out of such claim, action or 

<PAGE>

102

proceeding. The Indemnification Notice shall contain

factual information (to the extent known to the Indemnitee)

describing the asserted claim in reasonable detail and shall

include copies of any notice or other Document received from

any third party in respect of any such asserted claim. The

Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the

defense of a third party claim or suit described in this

Section 11.3 at its own cost and expense and with counsel of

its own choosing; provided, however, that the Indemnifying
-------- -------

Party acknowledges in writing (at the time it elects to

assume the defense of such claim or suit, which shall be not

later than 30 days after the date of the Indemnification

Notice) its obligation in accordance with this Section 11.3

to indemnify the Indemnitee with respect to such claim or

suit; such counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the

Indemnitee; the Indemnitee is kept fully informed of all

developments and is furnished copies of all papers; the

Indemnitee is given the opportunity, at its option and at

its own cost and expense and with counsel of its own

choosing (which shall be reasonably satisfactory to the

Indemnifying Party) to participate in (but not control) the

defense of such claim or suit. No settlement of any such

third party claim or suit shall be made by the Indemnifying

Party without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee

(which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). No

settlement of any such third party claim or suit shall be

made by the Indemnitee if the Indemnifying Party shall have 

<PAGE>

103

assumed the defense thereof and shall be in compliance with

its obligations with respect thereto as set forth above in

this Section 11.3. If the Indemnifying Party chooses to

defend any claim, the Indemnitee shall make available to the

Indemnifying Party, any books, records or other documents

within its control that are necessary or appropriate for

such defense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitee

shall have the right to employ separate counsel at the

Indemnifying Party's expense and to control its own defense

of such asserted liability if in the reasonable opinion of

counsel to such Indemnitee (i) there are or may be legal

defenses available to such Indemnitee or to other Indemni-

tees that are different from or additional to those

available to the Indemnifying Party or (ii) a conflict or

potential conflict exists between the Indemnifying Party and

such Indemnitee that would make such separate representation

advisable; provided that (a) any such separate counsel
--------

employed by the Indemnitee at the Indemnifying Party's

expense shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnifying

Party, (b) the Indemnitee shall not settle such claim or

litigation without the written consent of the Indemnifying

Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld and

(c) the Indemnifying Party shall only be responsible for the

reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel (in addition to

local counsel) for all Indemnitees. The Seller and

Continental agree that they shall have an obligation to

manage any such Claim or litigation in consultation with the

ing to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or relief of

debtors, seeking to have an order for relief entered with

decree and if all existing Events of Default have been cured

has become due solely because of acceleration.

Section 5. Miscellaneous.
-------------

5.1 This Note, and the beneficial ownership

thereof, is freely assignable (i) to an Affiliate of the

Payee and (ii) subject to the following two sentences, to

any other Person. The Payee shall give the Maker prior

written notice (the "Transfer Notice") of its intention to

transfer or assign this Note to any Person other than an

Affiliate of the Payee. The Maker may elect to purchase

this Note from the Payee at the outstanding principal amount

thereof plus accrued interest through the date of purchase,

which election shall be evidenced by written notice

delivered to the Payee (the "Purchase Election Notice") on

or prior to the expiration of two full Business Days

following the Maker's receipt of the Transfer Notice;

provided, however, that if the Maker intends to finance the
-------- -------

purchase of this Note, the Purchase Election Notice shall

set forth that the Maker's proposed purchase is subject to

the Maker obtaining financing acceptable to the Maker in its

sole discretion. If (x) the Maker does not timely deliver

the Purchase Election Notice or (y) the purchase of this

Note by the Maker is not consummated prior to the expiration

of twenty business days following the Payee's receipt of the

Purchase Election Notice, the Payee shall have the right to

transfer or assign this Note to any other Person. In addi-

tion, this Note may be pledged to any Person. This Note may

be assigned or transferred by Maker in connection with any

assignment or transfer by Maker (referred to as the Buyer 

<PAGE>

under the Asset Purchase Agreement) of the Asset Purchase

Agreement in accordance with Section 6.14(vi) of the Asset

purchase Agreement. All of the provisions of this Note

shall bind and inure to the benefit of Maker, Payee and

their respective successors and permitted assigns.

5.2 The observance of any provision of this

Note may be waived (either generally or in a particular

instance) only with the written consent of the party waiving

compliance. No failure on the part of the Holder to

exercise, and no delay in exercising and no course of

dealing with respect to, any right under this Note shall

operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial

exercise by the Holder of any right under this Note preclude

any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any

other right. The rights granted to the Holder in this Note

are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other remedies

provided by law. Any term of this Note may be amended only

with the written consent of Maker and Payee.

5.3 Each of Maker and Payee intend that the

obligations evidenced by this Note conform strictly to all

applicable laws from time to time in effect. All agreements

between Maker and Payee, whether now existing or hereafter

created and whether oral or written, are hereby expressly

limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever,

whether by acceleration of maturity hereof or otherwise,

shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to Payee, or

collected by Payee, by or on behalf of Maker for the use, 

<PAGE>

7

forbearance or detention of the money to be loaned to Maker

hereunder or otherwise, or for the payment or performance of

any covenant or obligation contained herein of Maker to

Payee, or in any other document evidencing, securing or

pertaining to such indebtedness evidenced hereby, exceed the

maximum amount permissible under applicable law. If, under

any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision

hereof or of any other document, at the time performance of

such provisions shall be due, shall involve transcending the

limit of validity prescribed by law, then, ipso facto, the
---- -----

obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of

such validity; and if under any circumstances Payee ever

shall receive from or on behalf of Maker an amount deemed

interest, by applicable law, which would exceed the highest

lawful rate, such amount that would be excessive interest

under applicable law shall be applied to the reduction of

Maker's principal amount owing hereunder and not to the

payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds

the unpaid balance of principal and such other indebtedness,

the excess shall be deemed to have been an inadvertent pay-

ment and shall be refunded to Maker or to any other Person

making such payment on Maker's behalf.

5.4 Any notice or other communication

required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and

shall be delivered personally, telegraphed, telexed, sent by

facsimile transmission or sent by certified, registered or

express mail, postage prepaid. Any such notice shall be

the Purchase Agreement, up to $2,500,000 of the indemnifica-

tion payments payable by Payee and Continental pursuant to

<PAGE>

5

standing Interest Notes, next against accrued and unpaid

interest on this Note and finally against accrued and unpaid

respective employees, officers, directors, advisors or

representatives other than with respect to payment of

Maker's obligations hereunder. Payee shall not disclose or

provide such information or documents (or any portion

thereof) to any Person other than any of its Affiliates,

employees, officers, directors, advisors or representatives

who reasonably requires such information to advise Payee in

respect of matters pertaining to this Note, without notify-

ance of or compliance with any covenant contained in this

that such notice is a "Notice of Default"); or

(c) if Maker (i) makes a general

assignment for the benefit of its creditors, (ii) commences

any case, proceeding or other action under any existing or

future law of any jurisdiction, domestic or foreign, relat-

ing to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or relief of

debtors, seeking to have an order for relief entered with

respect to it; or seeking to adjudicate it bankrupt or

insolvent; or seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjust-

ment, winding-up, liquidation, dissolution, composition or

other such relief with respect to it or its debts; or

seeking appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian or

other similar official for it or for all or any substantial

part of its assets (a "Bankruptcy Action"); (iii) becomes

the debtor named in any Bankruptcy Action which results in

the entry of an order for relief or any such adjudication or

ing, subject to the provisions of Section 8 (Subordination),

Payee may, without limiting any other rights it may have at 

<PAGE>

10

unpaid principal of and accrued interest on this Note due

and payable, whereupon the same shall be immediately due and

payable without presentment, demand, protest or other notice

of any kind, all of which Maker hereby expressly waives and

Payee may proceed to enforce payment of such amount or part

thereof in such manner as it may elect and exercise any

rights under this Note; provided that, in the case of an
--------

Event of Default specified in Section 7.1(c), the unpaid

principal of and interest on this Note shall become immedi-

ately due and payable without presentment, demand, protest

or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly

waived by Maker. Payee's notice to Maker may rescind an

acceleration and its consequences if the rescission would

not conflict with any judgment or decree and if all existing

Events of Default have been cured or waived except nonpay-

ment of principal or interest that has become due solely

because of acceleration. All of the foregoing rights of

Payee are subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8

below.

Section 8. Subordination.

this Note agrees, that the indebtedness evidenced by this

Note is subordinated and junior in right of payment, to the

dation or dissolution of Maker or in any Bankruptcy Action

relating to Maker or its property:

(i) holders of Senior Debt shall be

entitled to receive payment in full of all Senior Debt

before Payee shall be entitled to receive any payment

of principal of or interest on this Note; and

(ii) until all Senior Debt is paid in

full, any distribution to which Payee would be entitled

but for this Section 8 shall be made to holders of

Senior Debt as their interest may appear, except that

Payee may receive ownership interests of Maker and any

debt securities of Maker that are subordinated to

Senior Debt to at least the same extent as this Note.

(c) If a distribution is made to Payee in

respect of this Note that because of this Section 8 should

not have been made to Payee, Payee shall hold it in trust

for the holders of Senior Debt and pay it over to them as

their interests may appear.

(d) After all Senior Debt is paid in full

and until this Note is paid in full, Payee shall be subro-

gated to the rights of holders of the Senior Debt to receive

payments or distributions of assets of the Maker applicable 

<PAGE>

12

to Senior Debt. A distribution made under this Section 8 to

holders of Senior Debt which otherwise would have been made

to Payee is not, as between Maker and Payee, a payment by

Maker on Senior Debt.

(e) No right of any holder of Senior Debt to

enforce the subordination of the indebtedness evidenced by

this Note shall be impaired by any act or failure to act by

Maker or by its failure to comply with this Note.

(f) Payee by accepting this Note acknow-

ledges and agrees that the foregoing subordination provi-

sions are, and are intended to be, an inducement and a

consideration to each holder of any Senior Debt, whether

such Senior Debt was created or acquired before or after the

issuance of this Note, to acquire and continue to hold, or

to continue to hold, such Senior Debt and such holder of

Senior Debt shall be deemed conclusively to have relied on

such subordination provisions in acquiring and continuing to

hold, or in continuing to hold, such Senior Debt.

(g) Prior to the payment in full of all

Senior Debt, and so long as any event of default under any

Senior Debt is continuing Payee shall not, without the prior

written consent of the holders of the Senior Debt, take any

action (including, without limitation, the acceleration of

the maturity of all or any part of this Note) toward the

collection of this Note or enforcement of any rights, powers

or remedies hereunder, or under other agreements entered

into pursuant to this Note or under applicable law, or file,

<PAGE>

13

join in or facilitate any petition or proceeding seeking the

involuntary bankruptcy of Maker upon the occurrence of any

Event of Default hereunder or any event, which with the

passage of time, or giving of notice, or both, would

constitute an Event of Default hereunder or on any other

basis or for any other reason.

Section 10. Miscellaneous.
-------------

10.1 This Note, and the beneficial ownership

Payee and (ii) subject to the following two sentences, to

any other Person. The Payee shall give the Maker prior

written notice (the "Transfer Notice") of its intention to

transfer or assign this Note to any Person other than an

Affiliate of the Payee. The Maker may elect to purchase

this Note from the Payee at the outstanding principal amount

thereof plus accrued interest through the date of purchase,

which election shall be evidenced by written notice

delivered to the Payee (the "Purchase Election Notice") on

or prior to the expiration of two full Business Days

provided, however, that if the Maker intends to finance the
-------- -------

purchase of this Note, the Purchase Election Notice shall

set forth that the Maker's proposed purchase is subject to

the Maker obtaining financing acceptable to the Maker in its

sole discretion. If (x) the Maker does not timely deliver

the Purchase Election Notice or (y) the purchase of this

Note by the Maker is not consummated prior to the expiration

of twenty business days following the Payee's receipt of the

<PAGE>

16

Purchase Election Notice, the Payee shall have the right to

transfer or assign this Note to any other Person. In addi-

tion, this Note may be pledged to any Person. This Note may

be assigned or transferred by Maker in connection with any

assignment or transfer by Maker (referred to as the Buyer

Agreement in accordance with Section 6.14(vi) of the Asset

purchase Agreement. All of the provisions of this Note

shall bind and inure to the benefit of Maker, Payee and

their respective successors and permitted assigns.

10.2 The observance of any provision of this

Note may be waived (either generally or in a particular

instance) only with the written consent of the party waiving

compliance. No failure on the part of the Holder to

exercise, and no delay in exercising and no course of

dealing with respect to, any right under this Note shall

operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial

exercise by the Holder of any right under this Note preclude

any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any

other right. The rights granted to the Holder in this Note

are cumulative and are not exclusive of any other remedies

provided by law. Any term of this Note may be amended only

with the written consent of Maker, Payee and the holders of

the Senior Debt.

10.3 Each of Maker and Payee intend that the

obligations evidenced by this Note conform strictly to all

applicable laws from time to time in effect. All agreements

<PAGE>

17

between Maker and Payee, whether now existing or hereafter

created and whether oral or written, are hereby expressly

limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever,

whether by acceleration of maturity hereof or otherwise,

shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to Payee, or

collected by Payee, by or on behalf of Maker for the use,

forbearance or detention of the money to be loaned to Maker

hereunder or otherwise, or for the payment or performance of

any covenant or obligation contained herein of Maker to

Payee, or in any other document evidencing, securing or

pertaining to such indebtedness evidenced hereby, exceed the

maximum amount permissible under applicable law. If, under

any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision

hereof or of any other document, at the time performance of

such provisions shall be due, shall involve transcending the

limit of validity prescribed by law, then, ipso facto, the
---- -----

obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of

such validity; and if under any circumstances Payee ever

shall receive from or on behalf of Maker an amount deemed

interest, by applicable law, which would exceed the highest

lawful rate, such amount that would be excessive interest

under applicable law shall be applied to the reduction of

Maker's principal amount owing hereunder and not to the

payment of interest, or if such excessive interest exceeds

the unpaid balance of principal and such other indebtedness,

the excess shall be deemed to have been an inadvertent pay-

<PAGE>

18

ment and shall be refunded to Maker or to any other Person

making such payment on Maker's behalf.

10.4 Any notice or other communication

required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and

shall be delivered personally, telegraphed, telexed, sent by

facsimile transmission or sent by certified, registered or

express mail, postage prepaid. Any such notice shall be

FORM OF
INDUCEMENT AND NON-COMPETITION AGREEMENT
----------------------------------------

AGREEMENT dated as of __________ __, 1994, among

CAM INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, L.P., a Delaware limited

partnership (the "Buyer"), THE CONTINENTAL CORPORATION, a

New York corporation ("Continental"), and CONTINENTAL ASSET

MANAGEMENT CORP., a New York corporation and an indirect

wholly-owned subsidiary of Continental (the "Seller").

In accordance with an Asset Purchase Agreement,

dated as of October 13, 1994, among the Buyer, the Seller

and Continental (the "Purchase Agreement"), the Seller

wishes to sell, and the Buyer wishes to purchase, the

Business (as defined below) and the Purchased Assets upon

the terms and subject to the conditions of the Purchase

Agreement.

As a condition to the closing (the "Closing") of

such sale (the "Transaction"), which is occurring on the

date hereof, the Buyer requires that the Seller and

Continental enter into an agreement pursuant to which the

Seller and Continental agree not to engage in the Business

for a period of time.

Capitalized terms used and not defined herein

shall have the same meaning as in the Purchase Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing,

and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt

and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, on the 

<PAGE>

2

terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the

parties hereto agree as follows:

1. Covenants of Continental and the Seller.
---------------------------------------

1.1 Covenants Against Competition. 
-----------------------------

Continental (for itself and the Seller) acknowledges that

(i) through the Closing, the Seller has been engaged in the

Business for property and casualty insurance companies,

pension funds, corporations and other financial institutions

throughout the United States; (ii) the agreements and

covenants contained in this Agreement are essential to

protect the business and goodwill purchased by the Buyer;

and (iii) the Buyer would not consummate the Transaction but

for such agreements and covenants. The "Business" is the

business of financial asset management, and, more

specifically, the design of investment programs and the

management and supervision of investments in equity, debt

and other financial securities and instruments for insurance

companies, pension funds, corporations and other

institutions. Accordingly, Continental covenants and agrees

on behalf of itself, its direct and indirect subsidiaries,

including, without limitation, the Seller, and other

Affiliates, as follows:

1.1.1 Non-Competition. For a period of
---------------

seven (7) years following the Closing (the "Restricted

Period"), Continental shall not, and shall cause its

subsidiaries and other Affiliates not to, directly or 

<PAGE>

3

indirectly, (i) engage in the Business for clients other

than the Continental Parties; (ii) acquire ownership of any

shares of capital stock, partnership or other equity

interest in any Person (other than the Buyer or any of its

partners or any of their respective Affiliates that control

the Buyer or any of its partners) engaged in the Business

for clients other than the Continental parties; provided,

however, Continental, its subsidiaries and other Affiliates

may own, directly or indirectly, solely as an investment,

securities of any Person engaged in the Business if neither

Continental nor any of its subsidiaries or other Affiliates

is a controlling person of, or a member of a group which

controls, such person and does not, directly or indirectly,

own 5% or more of any class of securities of such person. 

Subject to the Purchase Agreement and any investment

advisory or management Contracts, agreements or other

arrangements between Continental and the Buyer, nothing

herein shall limit the right of Continental to manage its

own financial assets and those of its subsidiaries and other

Affiliates.

1.1.2 Employees of the Buyer. During
----------------------

the Restricted Period, Continental and its subsidiaries and

other Affiliates shall not, without the prior written

consent of the Buyer, directly or indirectly, hire or

solicit any employee of the Buyer or its Affiliates or

encourage any such employee to leave such employment, except

<PAGE>

4

any such employee who has been involuntarily terminated by

the Buyer.

1.2 Rights and Remedies Upon Breach. If
-------------------------------

either Continental or the Seller breaches, or threatens to

commit a breach of, any of the provisions of Section 1.1

(the "Restrictive Covenants"), the Buyer shall have the

following rights and remedies, each of which rights and

remedies shall be independent of the others and severally

enforceable, and each of which is in addition to, and not in

lieu of, any other rights and remedies available to the

Buyer under law or in equity:

1.2.1 Specific Performance. The
--------------------

right and remedy to have the Restrictive Covenants

specifically enforced by any court of competent

jurisdiction, it being agreed that any breach of the

Restrictive Covenants would cause irreparable injury to the

Buyer and that money damages would not provide an adequate

remedy to the Buyer.

1.2.2 Accounting. The right and remedy
----------

to require Continental to account for and pay over to the

Buyer, all compensation, profits, monies, accruals,

increments or other benefits derived or received by

Continental and their respective affiliates as the result of

any transactions constituting a breach of the Restrictive

Covenants.

1.3 Blue-Pencilling. If any court
---------------

determines that any of the Restrictive Covenants, or any 

<PAGE>

5

part thereof, is unenforceable because of the duration or

geographic scope of such provision, such court shall have

the power to reduce the duration or scope of such provision,

as the case may be, and, in its reduced form, such provision

shall then be enforceable.

1.4 Enforceability in Jurisdictions. The
-------------------------------

Buyer and Continental intend to and hereby confer

jurisdiction to enforce the Restrictive Covenants upon the

courts of any jurisdiction within the geographical scope of

such Covenants. If the courts of any one or more of such

jurisdictions hold the Restrictive Covenants unenforceable

by reason of the breadth of such scope or otherwise, it is

the intention of the Buyer and Continental that such

determination not bar or in any way affect the Buyer's right

to the relief provided above in the courts of any other

jurisdiction within the geographical scope of such

Covenants, as to breaches of such Covenants in such other

respective jurisdictions, such Covenants as they relate to

each jurisdiction being, for this purpose, severable into

diverse and independent covenants.

2. Miscellaneous.

-----------
Company shall pay Executive a base salary at the annual rate
of no less than $1,000,000. The base salary shall be re-
viewed no less frequently than annually for increase in the

----------------------
Employment Period, Executive shall participate in the Com-
pany's existing and future annual and long term incentive
compensation programs at a level commensurate with his posi-
tion at the Company and consistent with the Company's then

and (ii) thereafter, Executive's target annual incentive
--

no later than March 31 of the calendar year following the
calendar year for which such bonus is payable hereunder,
subject, in each such case, to Executive's continued employ-
ment with the Company through December 31 of the calendar
year for which such bonus is payable, except as otherwise
provided in Paragraph 6. The annual incentive compensation
payable currently under this Paragraph 3(b) shall be re-
duced, however, to the extent Executive elects to defer such
annual incentive compensation under the terms of the Annual
Management Incentive Plan of the Company.

c. Eligibility for Equity Awards. Notwithstanding
-----------------------------
any provision of this Agreement or of any compensation or
benefit plan, policy, program or agreement of the Company,

Executive's death, a Termination due to Disability (as de-
fined in Paragraph 6(d)), a Termination Without Cause (as

as provided in Paragraph 6(b)(iv), until the later of the
fifth anniversary of the Commencement Date or the date the
Option would otherwise cease to be exercisable following
such termination under the generally applicable terms of the
LTIP.

(iv) The Company shall amend the LTIP, subject to
approval of such amendment by the Company's shareholders at
or before the Company's next annual meeting of shareholders,
to permit the Option to contain the terms relating to the
period of post-termination exercisability described in Para-

<PAGE>

d. Option Agreement. The remaining terms and con-
----------------
ditions of the Option, to the extent consistent with this
Paragraph 4, shall be as provided in the LTIP and the agree-
ment relating to such grant, which shall provide Executive
with the same rights as are generally made available to
senior executive officers of the Company under the Company's
standard compensation practices.

5. Benefits, Perquisites and Expenses.
----------------------------------

a. Benefits. During the Employment Period, Execu-
--------
tive shall be eligible to participate in (i) each welfare
-
benefit plan sponsored or maintained by the Company for its
senior executive officers, including, without limitation,
each group life, hospitalization, medical, dental, health,
accident or disability insurance or similar plan or program
of the Company, and (ii) each pension, profit sharing, re-
--
tirement, deferred compensation or savings plan sponsored or
maintained by the Company for its senior executive officers,
in each case, whether now existing or established hereafter,
in accordance with the generally applicable provisions
thereof. To the extent there is a period of employment re-
quired as a condition for full benefit coverage under any
employee benefit program, other than a pension, profit shar-
ing, retirement, deferred compensation or savings plan that
is qualified under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, Execu-
tive shall be deemed to have met such requirement. Without
Executive's prior written consent, the Company shall not
terminate or reduce any benefit enjoyed by Executive under
any of such plans unless the Company furnishes Executive
with a benefit that is substantially equivalent.

b. Perquisites. During the Employment Period,
-----------
Executive shall be entitled to receive such perquisites as
are generally provided to other senior executive officers of
the Company in accordance with the then current policies and
practices of the Company.

c. Business Expenses. During the Employment Per-
-----------------
iod, the Company shall pay or reimburse Executive for all
reasonable expenses incurred or paid by Executive in the
performance of Executive's duties hereunder, upon presenta-
tion of expense statements or vouchers and such other infor-
mation as the Company may require and in accordance with the
generally applicable policies and procedures of the Company.

5

<PAGE>

d. Company Car. During the Employment Period, the
-----------
Company shall provide Executive with the use of an automo-
bile and chauffeur commensurate with his status and position
and shall pay all costs of maintenance thereof and insurance
thereon, but shall not be responsible for any other expenses
which are not reimbursable in accordance with the Company's
usual polices regarding business expenses.

e. Company Apartment. During the Employment Per-
-----------------
iod, in addition to the period of exclusive use described in
Paragraph 5(f)(ii) below, the Company shall make available
to Executive for his use the Company's apartment located in
Manhattan (the "Apartment") on substantially the same basis
as the Apartment was made available to the Company's chief
executive officer in office immediately prior to Executive.

f. Relocation Arrangements.
-----------------------

(i) Relocation Expenses. The Company shall
-------------------
directly pay or reimburse Executive for reasonable moving,
house-search, travel, lodging and similar expenses incurred
by him in relocating Executive and his household effects to
the New York Metropolitan area, and the reasonable fees and
expenses associated with the purchase or lease by Executive
of a residence in the New York Metropolitan area and the
sale of his present residence. Without limiting the fore-
going, Executive shall be afforded the arrangements provided
under the Company's relocation policy but without reference
to the $400,000 limit with respect to his present residence
or his new residence. In addition, such payments or reim-
bursements shall be on a "tax grossed-up basis" so that
Executive will not be "out-of-pocket" on an after-tax basis
with respect to any such payment or reimbursement, it being
understood that there shall be no tax gross up with respect
to amounts that are deductible by Executive as a moving
expense.

(ii) Temporary Accommodations. Until the ear-
------------------------
lier of (x) the date Executive's primary residence in the
-
New York Metropolitan area is, in the reasonable judgment of
Executive, ready for occupancy and (y) the first anniversary
-
of the Commencement Date, the Company shall make the Apart-
ment available to the Executive, for his sole and exclusive
use.

6

<PAGE>

g. Retirement Benefits. The Company shall pay
-------------------
Executive an additional monthly retirement benefit pursuant
to the terms of this Agreement which shall be equal to the
excess of (i) the monthly retirement benefit which would be
-
payable to Executive under the terms of the Supplemental
Retirement Plan of the Company (the "SERP"), as in effect on
the date hereof, assuming that Executive were credited with
10.5 years of service in addition to his actual years of
service with the Company over (ii) the monthly retirement
--
benefit which is actually payable to Executive under the
SERP. In determining the amount of any offset as provided
in the preceding sentence, such amount shall be calculated
assuming the same frequency of payment, the same form of
annuity and the same commencement date of payment as the
benefits to be paid under this Paragraph 5(g). The
retirement benefit payable to or in respect of Executive
pursuant to this Paragraph 5(g) shall be fully vested at all
times, without regard to when or the manner in which
Executive's employment with the Company terminates, and
shall commence to be paid at the same time as Executive's
retirement benefit under the SERP, but in no event later
than the later to occur of (x) the termination of
-
Executive's employment and (y) his attainment of age 60. If
-
under the SERP as currently in effect, there would be an
actuarial reduction if the retirement benefits commenced on
the date provided in the preceding sentence, Executive may
elect to defer commencement of such benefits until the date
as of which retirement benefits may commence without
actuarial reduction. The retirement benefit payable to or
in respect of Executive pursuant to this Paragraph 5(g)
shall be paid in the form of a straight life annuity for his
lifetime or in such other alternative form of benefit
permitted under the terms of the SERP as currently in effect
as Executive may elect in accordance with the election
provisions applicable under the SERP. The Company shall (i)
-
establish a grantor trust, subject to the claims of its
creditors, as soon as practicable after the Commencement
Date and (ii) contribute to such trust the amounts necessary
--
to satisfy its obligations to Executive under this Paragraph
5(g) (which amount shall be determined using the same
actuarial assumptions that it uses for purposes of financial
accounting in accordance with FAS 87) over the period
between the Commencement Date and the last day of the month
in which Executive attains age 60.

h. Profit Sharing Account. If Executive forfeits
----------------------
all or any portion of the profit sharing account (the
"Profit Sharing Account") accrued on his behalf pursuant to
the terms of the profit sharing plans of the Prior Employer 

7

<PAGE>

(the "Prior Employer Profit Sharing Plan") by reason of
Executive's termination of employment with the Prior Employ-
er to accept employment hereunder, the Company shall estab-
lish on its books a notional account on Executive's behalf
(the "Deferred Compensation Account") to which the Company
will credit an amount equal to the amount so forfeited. 
Executive shall advise the Company of the amount, if any,
that is so forfeited. Interest shall be credited annually
to amounts credited to the Deferred Compensation Account, at
a rate equal to the long-term Applicable Federal Rate, com-
pounded annually, in effect on the Commencement Date, as
determined pursuant to section 1274(d) of the Internal Rev-
enue Code of 1986, as amended. Such interest shall be cred-
ited to the Deferred Compensation Account for the period
commencing on the date an amount is forfeited under the
Prior Employer Profit Sharing Plan and ending on the day
immediately preceding the day amounts credited to the De-
ferred Compensation Account are paid to Executive pursuant
to this Paragraph 5(h). The entire amount credited to the
Deferred Compensation Account shall be fully vested at all
times and shall become payable to Executive on the first
business day of the calendar year following the calendar
year in which Executive's employment with the Company termi-
nates for any reason.

i. Indemnification. (x) The Company agrees that
---------------
if Executive is made a party, or is threatened to be made a
party, to any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (a "Proceeding"),
by reason of the fact that he is or was a director, officer
or employee of the Company or is or was serving at the re-
quest of the Company as a director, officer, member, employ-
ee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint ven-
ture, trust or other enterprise, including service with
respect to employee benefit plans, whether or not the basis
of such Proceeding is Executive's alleged action in an offi-
cial capacity while serving as a director, officer, member,
employee or agent, Executive shall be indemnified and held
harmless by the Company to the fullest extent legally per-
mitted or authorized by the Company's certificate of incor-
poration or bylaws or resolutions of the Board or, if
greater, by the laws of the State of New York, against all
cost, expense, liability and loss (including, without limi-
tation, attorney's fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise
taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by Executive in
connection therewith, and such indemnification shall con-
tinue as to Executive even if he has ceased to be a direc-
tor, officer, member, employee or agent of the Company or
other entity and shall inure to the benefit of Executive's 

8

<PAGE>

heirs, executors and administrators. The Company shall
advance to Executive all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred by him in connection with a Proceeding within 20
days after receipt by the Company of a written request for
such advance. Such request shall include an undertaking by
Executive to repay the amount of such advance, plus interest
at the short term "Applicable Federal Rate", as then in
effect, under Section 1274(d) of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, if it shall ultimately be determined
that he is not entitled to be indemnified against such costs
and expenses.

(y) Neither the failure of the Company (including
its board of directors, independent legal counsel or stock-
holders) to have made a determination prior to the commence-
ment of any Proceeding concerning payment of amounts claimed
by Executive under Paragraph 5(i)(x) above that indemnifica-
tion of Executive is proper because he has met the appli-
cable standard of conduct, nor a determination by the Com-
pany (including the Board, independent legal counsel or
stockholders) that Executive has not met such applicable
standard of conduct, shall create a presumption that Exe-
cutive has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

(z) The Company agrees to continue and maintain a
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy covering
Executive to the extent the Company provides such coverage
for its other executive officers.

6. Termination of Employment. 
-------------------------

a. Early Termination of the Employment Period. 
------------------------------------------
Notwithstanding Paragraph 1(b), the Employment Period shall

ary) shall be paid the type or types of compensation, bene-
fits and other payments determined to be payable in accor-
dance with the following table at the times established

termination of his employment until the earlier of (A) 24
-
months following termination of his employment and (B) the
-
date, or dates, he receives equivalent coverage and benefits
under the plans and programs of a subsequent employer (such
coverages and benefits to be determined on a coverage-by-
coverage, or benefit-by-benefit basis); provided that if
Executive is precluded from continuing his participation in
any employee plan or program as provided in this Paragraph
6(b)(ii), he shall be provided with the economic equivalent
of the benefits provided under the plan or program in which
he is unable to participate. In the case of any welfare
benefit plan, the economic equivalent of any benefit fore-
gone shall be (x) deemed to be the lowest cost that would be
-
incurred by Executive in obtaining such benefit himself on
an individual basis and (y) shall be provided on a "tax
-
grossed-up basis" to the extent the economic equivalent is
taxable to Executive, but provision of the benefit to Execu-
tive while an employee was not taxable.

that is due pursuant to Paragraph 5(g), (B) any other
-
amounts accruing or owed to Executive but not yet paid under
Paragraph 5 and (C) the Vested Benefits.
-

(iv) In the event of (A) a Termination Without Cause
-
or a Termination for Good Reason occurring more than six
months after the Commencement Date, the Option shall immed-
iately become exercisable to the extent it would have become
exercisable pursuant to Paragraph 4(c) during the 24 months
following termination of Executive's employment and (B) a
-
termination of Executive's employment due to death or a
Termination due to Disability, the next installment of the
Option that would have become exercisable pursuant to Para-
graph 4(c) shall immediately become exercisable.

(v) The Normal Severance Benefits payable to Exe-
cutive (or, in the event of his death after the date the
Employment Period ends, his surviving spouse, if any, or his
estate or other beneficiary) in the event the Employment
Period ends pursuant to Paragraph 6(a) by reason of a Ter-
mination Without Cause or a Termination for Good Reason
shall consist of the following components:

(A) the Basic Payment,

(B) if the Employment Period ends at any time dur-
ing calendar year 1994 or 1995, the Earned
Guaranteed Bonus,

(C) if the Employment Period ends after calendar
year 1995, a pro-rated amount equal to the
product of (i) Executive's target bonus for the
-
calendar year in which the Employment Period
ends, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numer-
--
ator of which is equal to the number of days in
the calendar year in which the Employment
Period ends pursuant to Paragraph 6(a) which
have elapsed as of the date of such end of the
Employment Period and the denominator of which
is 365, and

(D) if the Employment Period ends on or before the
last day of the eighteenth full calendar month

plemental Payment.

In addition, if, in the case of a Termination Without Cause
or a Termination for Good Reason, the Option is cancelled or
expires by its terms, in either case, not later than the 

11

<PAGE>

last day of the three month period following the last day of
the Employment Period (the "Option Period"), the Additional
Payment shall be payable to Executive (or, in the event of
his death, his surviving spouse, if any, or his estate or
other beneficiary).

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, in the
event that the aggregate value of the severance compensation
and benefits payable to Executive under the terms of The
Executive Severance Plan of the Company (the "Executive
Severance Plan") is greater than the aggregate value of the
Normal Severance Benefits, then, in lieu of any payments
under this Paragraph 6, Executive shall receive the seve-
rance compensation and benefits payable to him under the
terms of the Executive Severance Plan. If Executive re-
ceives payment of the Normal Severance Benefits described in
this Paragraph 6 (other than under the Executive Severance
Plan, as described in the immediately preceding sentence),
Executive shall not be entitled to any severance benefits or
compensation under the terms of the Executive Severance Plan
or any other severance plan of the Company.

(vi) The Additional Payment shall be payable to
Executive (or, in the event of his death, his surviving
spouse, if any, or his estate or other beneficiary) in the
event the Employment Period ends by reason of Executive's
death or a Termination due to Disability, provided that, if
--------
the Option shall remain exercisable by its terms until the
fifth anniversary of the Commencement Date, then, notwith-
standing any provision hereof to the contrary, no Additional
Payment will be payable pursuant to this Agreement by reason
of Executive's death or a Termination due to Disability.

(vii) For purposes of this Paragraph 6(b) and Para-
graph 6(c), capitalized terms have the following meanings.

"Additional Payment" means the sum of the amounts,
determined separately with respect to each Option Share
subject to the Exercisable Option, equal to the excess of
(A) over (B), where

(A) is equal to (1) the Fair Market Value of an
-
Option Share on the earlier of (x) the fifth
-
anniversary of the Commencement Date or (y) if
-
applicable, the Designated Date (as defined
below), reduced by (2) the exercise price for
-
such Option Share, and

(B) is equal to the greater of (1)(x) the Fair Mar-
- -
ket Value of such Option Share on the date the

12

<PAGE>

Employment Period ends, reduced by (y) the ex-
-
ercise price for such Option Share, and (2)
-
zero,

provided that, if the Employment Period ends by reason of a
--------
Termination Without Cause or a Termination for Good Reason
during the Supplemental Payment Period, the amount of the
Additional Payment shall be reduced (but not below zero) by
the amount of the Supplemental Payment. Notwithstanding
anything else contained herein to the contrary, if Executive
(or Executive's surviving spouse, estate and/or other
beneficiaries, as the case may be) surrenders the
Exercisable Option to the Company within 10 business days
after the date his employment terminates, the Company shall
grant him (or Executive's surviving spouse, estate and/or
other beneficiaries, as the case may be) the right to
designate the date (the "Designated Date") as of which the
Fair Market Value of an Option Share for purposes for
subclause (A) above is determined by delivering to the
Company a written notice of such designation on or prior to
the date designated in such notice; provided that, if a
--------------
Termination Without Cause or a Termination for Good Reason 
occurs six months or less after the Commencement Date
Executive shall be deemed to have surrendered the
Exercisable Option as of the date of his termination of
employment.

"Basic Payment" means an amount equal to two times
the sum of (a) the annual Base Salary payable to Executive
-
immediately prior to the end of the Employment Period (or in
the event a reduction in Base Salary is the basis for a Ter-
mination for Good Reason, then the Base Salary in effect
immediately prior to such reduction) and (b) (x) if the
- -
Employment Period ends prior to January 1, 1996, $800,000 or
(y) if the Employment Period ends after December 31, 1995,
-
the annual incentive compensation Executive would have been
entitled to receive under Paragraph 3(b) for the calendar
year in which the Employment Period ends pursuant to Para-
graph 6(a) had he remained employed by the Company for the
entire calendar year and assuming that all targets for such
calendar year had been met.

"Earned Compensation" means the sum of (a) any Base
-
Salary earned, but unpaid, for services rendered to the
Company on or prior to the date on which the Employment
Period ends pursuant to Paragraph 6(a) and (b) any annual
-
incentive compensation payable for services rendered in the
calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the Em-
ployment Period ends that has not been paid on or prior to
the date the Employment Period ends (other than (x) Base

fits consisting of the Supplemental Payment shall be paid in
a single lump sum, at whichever of the following times is

ment Period, the Company shall contribute the amount of the
Supplemental Payment into the Separate Account and shall
cause the terms of such trust to permit the investment of
the amounts held in the Separate Account to be managed by an
investment manager or other investment professional

if (x) at the time the Supplemental Payment would otherwise
-
be due, no amount is due Executive with respect to the
Supplemental Payment and (y) the amount actually contributed
-
to the Separate Account exceeds the fair market value of the
assets in the Separate Account at the time the Supplemental
Payment would otherwise be due, Executive shall pay to the
Company an amount equal to the excess, if any, of (i) over
-
(ii), where:
--

ment, by Executive's surviving spouse,
estate and/or other beneficiaries, as the
case may be) upon the exercise of all or a
portion of the Option.

The Additional Payment shall be paid in a single

graphs 4 and 6, the following additional capitalized terms
have the following meanings:

"Termination for Cause" means a termination of Exec-
utive's employment by the Company due to (i) Executive's
-
conviction of a felony or the entering by Executive of a
plea of nolo contendere to a felony charge, (ii) Executive's
--
gross neglect, willful malfeasance or willful gross miscon-
duct in connection with his employment hereunder which has 

17

<PAGE>

to the best interests of the Company, (iii) a substantial
---
and continual refusal by Executive in breach of this Agree-
ment to perform the duties, responsibilities or obligations
assigned to Executive pursuant to the terms hereof, provided
that such duties, responsibilities or obligations are con-
sistent with his positions as Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer and are otherwise lawful and appropriate or (iv) any
--
other material breach by Executive of any material provision
of this Agreement. A Termination for Cause shall not take
effect unless the following provisions are complied with. 
Executive shall be given written notice by the Board of the
intention to terminate him for Cause, such notice (A) to
-
state in detail the particular act or acts or failure or
failures to act that constitute the grounds on which the
proposed Termination for Cause is based and (B) to be given
-
within six months of the Board learning of such act or acts
or failure or failures to act. Executive shall have 15 days
after the date that such written notice has been given to
Executive in which to cure such conduct, to the extent such
cure is possible. If he fails to cure such conduct, Execu-
tive shall then be entitled to a hearing before the Board. 
Such hearing shall be held within 30 days of such notice to
Executive. If a majority of the members of the Board
(excluding Executive) do not confirm that the Company had
grounds for a "Cause" termination, Executive shall have the
option to treat his employment as not having terminated or
as having been terminated pursuant to a Termination Without
Cause.

"Termination due to Disability" means a termination
of Executive's employment by the Company because Executive
has been incapable of substantially fulfilling the posi-
tions, duties, responsibilities and obligations set forth in
this Agreement because of physical, mental or emotional
incapacity resulting from injury, sickness or disease for a
period of more than six consecutive months in any twelve
month period. Any question as to the existence, extent or
potentiality of Executive's disability upon which Executive
and the Company cannot agree shall be determined by a quali-
fied, independent physician jointly selected by the Company
and Executive. If the Company and Executive cannot agree on
the physician to make the determination, then the Company
and Executive shall each select a physician and those physi-
cians shall jointly select a third physician, who shall make
the determination. The determination of any such physician
shall be final and conclusive for all purposes of this
Agreement. Executive or his legal representative or any
adult

18

<PAGE>

member of his immediate family shall have the right to pre-
sent to such physician such information and arguments as to
Executive's disability as he, she or they deem appropriate,
including the opinion of Executive's personal physician.

"Termination for Good Reason" means a termination of
Executive's employment by Executive within six months fol-
lowing (i) a reduction in Executive's annual Base Salary or
-
incentive compensation opportunity or the termination or
reduction of any material employee benefit or perquisite
enjoyed by him without the substitution of another compar-
able benefit or perquisite or another benefit or perquisite
of comparable value, (ii) the failure to elect or reelect
--
Executive to any of the positions described in Section 2
above or removal of him from any such position, (iii) a
---
material reduction in Executive's duties and responsibili-
ties or the assignment to Executive of duties and responsi-
bilities which are materially inconsistent with his duties
or which materially impair Executive's ability to function
as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Company,
(iv) a material breach of any material provision of this
--
Agreement by the Company, (v) the failure of the Company and
-
the Partnership to consummate the transactions contemplated
by the Securities Purchase Agreement on or prior to March
31, 1995 or the termination or abandonment by the Company
and the Partnership of the Securities Purchase Agreement
prior to March 31, 1995, (vi) if any of the documents filed
--
by the Company with the SEC since January 1, 1993 and prior
to the Commencement Date or to be filed with the SEC with
respect to calendar year 1994, (x) failed or fails to comply
-
in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or (y)
-
contained or contains any untrue statements of a material
fact or omitted or omits to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, or (vii) the occurrence of an event that
---
would permit participants in the Executive Severance Plan to
terminate employment with the Company and receive payment of
severance compensation and benefits under the terms of the
Executive Severance Plan, assuming for this purpose that the
level of ownership by any person or group of the Company's
common stock necessary to constitute a Change of Control is
25% (instead of 30%) but excluding from the definition of a
Change of Control the acquisition by the Partnership (or any
group of which the Partnership is a member) of securities in
excess of that level of ownership. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, a termination shall not be treated as a Term-
ination for Good Reason (i) if Executive shall have
-
consented in writing to the occurrence of the event giving 

19

<PAGE>

rise to the claim of Termination for Good Reason (other than
an event described in clause (vii) of this definition) or
(ii) unless Executive shall have delivered a written notice
--
to the Board within six months of his having actual knowl-
edge of the occurrence of one of such events stating that he
intends to terminate his employment for Good Reason and
specifying the factual basis for such termination, and such
event, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured
within 30 days of the receipt of such notice.

"Termination Without Cause" means any termination of
Executive's employment by the Company other than (i) a Ter-
-
mination due to Disability or (ii) a Termination for Cause.
--

"Voluntary Termination" means any termination of
Executive's employment on his own initiative (other than a
termination due to death, a Termination due to Disability or
a Termination for Good Reason) after the second anniversary
of the Commencement Date and upon 60 days' advance written
notice to the Company of such termination.

e. Payment Following a Change in Control. In
-------------------------------------
the event that, in the case of a Termination Without Cause
or a Termination for Good Reason, the aggregate of all pay-
ments or benefits made or provided to the Executive under
this Paragraph 6 and under all other plans and programs of
the Company (the "Aggregate Payment") is determined to con-
stitute a Parachute Payment, as such term is defined in
Section 28OG(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, the Company
shall pay to the Executive, prior to the time any excise tax
imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code ("Ex-
cise Tax") is payable with respect to such Aggregate Pay-
ment, an additional amount which, after the imposition of
all income and excise taxes thereon, is equal to the Excise
Tax on the Aggregate Payment. The determination of whether
the Aggregate Payment constitutes a Parachute Payment and,
if so, the amount to be paid to the Executive and the time
of payment pursuant to this Paragraph 6(e) shall be made by
an independent auditor (the "Auditor") jointly selected by
the Company and the Executive and paid by the Company. The
Auditor shall be a nationally recognized United States pub-
lic accounting firm which has not, during the two years
preceding the date of its selection, acted in any way on
behalf of (x) the Company or any affiliate thereof or (y)
- -
Executive. If the Executive and the Company cannot agree on
the firm to serve as the Auditor, then the Executive and the
Company shall each select one accounting firm and those two
firms shall jointly select the accounting firm to serve as
the Auditor.

<PAGE>

f. Full Discharge of Company Obligations. The
-------------------------------------
amounts payable to Executive pursuant to this Paragraph 6
following termination of his employment (including amounts
payable with respect to Vested Benefits) shall be in full
and complete satisfaction of Executive's rights under this
Agreement and any other claims he may have in respect of his
employment by the Company or any of its subsidiaries other
than claims for common law torts or under other contracts
between Executive and the Company or its subsidiaries. Such
amounts shall constitute liquidated damages with respect to
any and all such rights and claims and, upon Executive's
receipt of such amounts, the Company shall be released and
discharged from any and all liability to Executive in con-
nection with this Agreement or otherwise in connection with
Executive's employment with the Company and its subsidiar-
ies.

g. No Mitigation; No Offset. In the event of any
------------------------
termination of employment under this Paragraph 6, Executive
shall be under no obligation to seek other employment and
there shall be no offset against amounts due Executive under
this Agreement on account of any remuneration attributable
to any subsequent employment that he may obtain except as
specifically provided in this Paragraph 6.

7. Noncompetition and Confidentiality.
----------------------------------

a. Noncompetition. During the Employment Period
--------------
and, in the case of a Voluntary Termination, the Additional
Period, Executive shall not become associated with any enti-
ty, whether as a principal, partner, employee, consultant or
shareholder (other than as a holder of not in excess of 1%
of the outstanding voting shares of any publicly traded com-
pany), that is actively engaged in any geographic area in
any business which is in competition with a business con-
ducted by the Company at the time of the alleged competition
and, in the case of the Additional Period, at the date of
the Voluntary Termination. For the purpose of this Para-
graph 7, the "Additional Period" shall mean a period of 12
months following the Voluntary Termination. Notwithstanding
anything else contained herein to the contrary, in the event
that Executive voluntarily terminates his employment in a
termination which is not a Voluntary Termination (or a
Termination for Good Reason or a Termination for
Disability), the covenant contained in this Paragraph 7(a)
shall only continue in effect until the earlier of (i) the
-
end of the Employment Period or (ii) the later of (A) the
-- -
third anniversary of the Commencement Date or (B) the date
-
as of which the Additional Period would have ended had such
termination been a Voluntary Termination.

21

<PAGE>

b. Confidentiality. Without the prior written con-
---------------
sent of the Company, except (i) in the course of carrying
-
out his duties hereunder or (ii) to the extent required by
--
an order of a court having competent jurisdiction or under
subpoena from an appropriate government agency, Executive
shall not disclose any trade secrets, customer lists, draw-
ings, designs, information regarding product development,
marketing plans, sales plans, manufacturing plans, manage-
ment organization information (including data and other
information relating to members of the Board of Directors
and management), operating policies or manuals, business
plans, financial records, packaging design or other finan-
cial, commercial, business or technical information relating
to the Company or any of its subsidiaries or information
designated as confidential or proprietary that the Company
or any of its subsidiaries may receive belonging to suppli-
ers, customers or others who do business with the Company or
any of its subsidiaries (collectively, "Confidential Infor-
mation") to any third person unless such Confidential Infor-
mation has been previously disclosed to the public by the
Company or has otherwise become available to the public
(other than by reason of Executive's breach of this Para-
graph 7(b)).

c. Company Property. Promptly following Execu-
----------------
tive's termination of employment, Executive shall return to
the Company all property of the Company, and all copies
thereof in Executive's possession or under his control, ex-
cept that Executive may retain his personal notes, diaries,
Rolodexes, calendars and correspondence.

d. Non-Solicitation of Employees. During the Em-
-----------------------------
ployment Period and during the one year period following any
termination of Executive's employment, Executive shall not,
except in the course of carrying out his duties hereunder, 
directly or indirectly induce any employee of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries to terminate employment with such
entity, and shall not directly or indirectly, either indi-
vidually or as owner, agent, employee, consultant or other-
wise, knowingly employ or offer employment to any person who
is or was employed by the Company or a subsidiary thereof
unless such person shall have ceased to be employed by such
entity for a period of at least 6 months.

e. Injunctive Relief with Respect to Covenants. 
-------------------------------------------
Executive acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and
obligations of Executive with respect to noncompetition,
nonsolicitation, confidentiality and Company property relate
to special, unique and extraordinary matters and that a
violation of any of the terms of such covenants and obliga-

22

<PAGE>

tions may cause the Company irreparable injury for which
adequate remedies are not available at law. Therefore,
Executive agrees that the Company shall be entitled to seek
an injunction, restraining order or such other equitable
relief restraining Executive from committing any violation
of the covenants and obligations contained in this Paragraph
7. These injunctive remedies are cumulative and are in
addition to any other rights and remedies the Company may
have at law or in equity.

8. Miscellaneous.
-------------

a. Survival. Paragraphs 4 (relating to the stock
--------
option grant), 5(g) (relating to Executive's additional

sharing account), 5(i) (relating to the Company's obligation
to indemnify Executive), 6 (relating to early termination),

pursuant to Paragraph 6 hereof.

b. Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding
--------------

tion or reorganization involving the Company or a sale of
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, pro-
vided that the assignee or transferee is the successor to
all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and
such assignee or transferee assumes the liabilities, obli-
gations and duties of the Company, as contained in this
Agreement, either contractually or as a matter of law. The
Company further agrees that, in the event of a sale of as-
sets as described in the preceding sentence, it shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause such assignee or trans-
feree to expressly assume the liabilities, obligations and
duties of the Company hereunder. This Agreement shall also
enure to the benefit of Executive's heirs, executors, admin-
istrators and legal representatives and beneficiaries as
provided in Paragraph 8(d).

c. Assignment. Except as provided under Paragraph
----------
8(b), neither this Agreement nor any of the rights or obli-
gations hereunder shall be assigned or delegated by any
party hereto without the prior written consent of the other
party. 

23

d. Beneficiaries/References. Executive shall be
------------------------
entitled, to the extent permitted under any applicable law
and the terms of any applicable plan, to select and change a
beneficiary or beneficiaries to receive any compensation or
benefit payable hereunder following Executive's death by

arbitration, to be held in New York City in accordance with
the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Asso-
ciation. Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitra-
tor(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
thereof. Costs of the arbitration shall be borne by the
Company. Unless the arbitrator determines that Executive
did not have a reasonable basis for asserting his position
with respect to the dispute in question, the Company shall
also reimburse Executive for his reasonable attorneys' fees
incurred with respect to any arbitration. Pending the reso-
lution of any arbitration or court proceeding, the Company
shall continue payment of all amounts due Executive under
this Agreement and all benefits to which Executive is
entitled at the time the dispute arises (other than the
amounts which are the subject of such dispute).

f. Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes
----------------
the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect
to the matters referred to herein. No amendment to this
Agreement shall be binding between the parties unless it is
in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement
is sought. There are no promises, representations, induce-
ments or statements between the parties other than those
that are expressly contained herein. Executive acknowledges
that he is entering into this Agreement of his own free will
and accord, and with no duress, that he has been represented

employment hereunder and compliance by the Company with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement will not conflict

Company ("Fremont Compensation"), an indirect subsidiary of
Fremont General Corporation ("Fremont General"), agrees to
acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares (the "Shares")
of capital stock of Casualty Insurance Company (the "Company")
from its parent, The Buckeye Union Insurance Company ("Buckeye"),
a subsidiary of The Continental Corporation ("Continental") (the

party has taken the appropriate corporate action to approve this
Agreement in Principle. The purchase of the Shares will occur
pursuant to the terms of a definitive Stock Purchase Agreement
and ancillary agreements (collectively the "Stock Purchase
Agreement"), which will conform to the terms of this Agreement in
Principle.

2. Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price for the
----------------
Shares will be $250 million, all of which will be paid in cash at
the closing of the Acquisition (the "Closing"). The purchase
price will be funded from the assets of Fremont Compensation and
Fremont General. There is no financing contingency. The purchase
price will be subject to adjustment, as described in Section 7
below.

3. Other Business; Fronting Arrangements. The parties
---------------------------------------
agree that all liabilities not pertaining to the workers
compensation insurance business in California, Indiana, Illinois,
Wisconsin and Michigan (the "Acquired States") will be either
removed from the Company or be reinsured by a Continental
affiliate prior to the Closing, in a manner to be mutually agreed
upon by the parties. All fronting arrangements enabling the
Company to do business in the Acquired States will be continued
by one or more Continental affiliates for a mutually agreed
period of time following the Closing.

4. Reinsurance Recoverable.
------------------------

(a) Accord Re. At the Closing, Continental Insurance Company
-----------
will assume for the benefit of the Company the reinsurance
obligations of Accord Re with respect to the Workers'
compensation business in the Acquired States (the

<PAGE>

"Transferred Business"). Such assumption will not adversely
affect the equity of the Company.

(b) Reinsurance Recoverable from Continental and its
------------------------------------------------
Affiliates. The parties mutually agree that a portion of the
------------
total reinsurance obligations from Continental and its affiliates
to the Company will be either collateralized or supported by a
letter of credit.

5. Other Services. Continental and its affiliates will
----------------
continue to provide to the Company services currently performed
by Continental and its affiliates on behalf of the Company during
a transition period of up to one year from the Closing, at a
price of 115% of the cost of such services. The cost of such
services will be defined in the Stock Purchase Agreement as the
direct cost incurred by Continental and its affiliates.
Continental agrees that it will make all reasonable efforts to
transition to Fremont Compensation as soon as practicable the
services performed pursuant to this Section 5.

6. Reasonable Access.
------------------

(a) Continental and its affiliates will make available to the
authorized representatives of Fremont Compensation such books,
records and personnel of the Company, Buckeye, Continental and
their affiliates as are reasonably necessary to permit Fremont
Compensation to negotiate the Stock Purchase Agreement and
investigate the accuracy of representations and warranties made
to it in the Stock Purchase Agreement. The Confidentiality
Agreement, dated July 5, 1994, between Fremont General and
Continental will remain in effect and apply to Fremont
Compensation's continuing review.

(b) Fremont Compensation will at its expense cause its
auditors, Ernst & Young ("E & Y"), to perform agreed upon
procedures with respect to the Company's records, such procedures
to be specified in the Stock Purchase Agreement and completed
prior to the Closing (the "Preclosing E & Y Procedures). E & Y
will commence such procedures promptly after execution of this
Agreement in Principle. The Company, Buckeye, Continental and
their affiliates will cooperate with E & Y in its performance of
the Preclosing E & Y Procedures.

<PAGE>

7. Balance Sheets; Methodology; Purchase Price Adjustment.
-----------------------------------------------------------

(a) Prior to the signing of the Stock Purchase Agreement, the
parties will agree on the pro forma consolidated balance sheet of
the Company and WCIC as of June 30, 1994 (the "June 30 Balance
Sheet"), as if the depooling transactions referred to in Section
8 below had been effectuated.

(b) The parties will prepare the June 30 Balance Sheet using
the following assumptions:

(i) The portfolio assets (the "Portfolio Assets") to be
transferred to Fremont Compensation will consist exclusively
of cash, U.S. Treasury securities and accrued interest
receivable thereon, be reasonably acceptable to Fremont
Compensation and have a carrying value equal to their fair
market value.

(ii) Any deferred tax asset which is included in the
June 30 Balance Sheet shall be equal to an amount computed
using a tax rate of 35% and taking into account only items
that constitute temporary differences reflected in the June
30 Balance Sheet.

(iii) The amount of loss and loss adjustment expense
reserves ("Loss Reserves") shall be based on the following:

(A) Subject to verification of the accuracy of the
date provided to Milliman & Robertson, the report dated
June 27, 1994 prepared for the Company by Milliman &
Robertson is accepted by the parties to establish the
Company's ultimate voluntary business Loss Reserves for
accident years 1993 and prior.

(B) The proper analytical methodology to establish
the voluntary business Loss Reserved for accident year
1994, and if necessary, accident year 1995, shall be
mutually agreed and specified in the Stock Purchase
Agreement.

(C) The parties will agree to an amount necessary
to discharge the liabilities from business assumed from
the National Worker's Compensation Reinsurance Pool.

3

<PAGE>

(D) The parties will agree to methodology to
determine the loss adjustment expense reserves
necessary to discharge the Company's obligations for
business serviced on behalf of the National Worker's
Compensation Reinsurance Pool.

(iv) The provision for reinsurance recoverables,
statutory discount, policyholder dividend liabilities,
reserves for retrospective premium adjustments, reserves for
future audit premiums, any other accruals, and any other
assets and liabilities not described above will be
established on a basis mutually agreeable to the parties.

(c) The Company will prepare and deliver to Fremont
Compensation at least two weeks before the Closing an estimated
balance sheet as of the projected closing date, which will be
prepared on a basis consistent with the June 30 Balance Sheet.
Such estimated closing balance sheet will be "brought down" the
day before the Closing by marking the investment portfolio to
market as of such day. The parties will close on the basis of
such brought down estimated balance sheet (the "Closing Balance
Sheet"). Prior to the Closing, the assets and liabilities of the
Company will be adjusted by Continental as necessary so that the
Closing Balance Sheet reflects shareholders' equity of
$201,780,000.

(d) If the amount of Portfolio Assets set forth in the
Closing Balance Sheet is not in the range of $700,000,000 -
$740,000,000, the purchase price shall be decreased or increased
pursuant to a formula to be specified in the Stock Purchase
Agreement.

(e) Following the Closing, E & Y will perform an audit (the
"Acquisition Audit") of the Closing Balance Sheet at the expense
of Fremont Compensation. The assumptions determined as provided
in Section 7(b) above shall be used in the Acquisition Audit.
Continental, Buckeye and their affiliates will cooperate fully
with E & Y in the performance of the Acquisition Audit.

(f) If the parties do not agree on the results of the
Acquisition Audit, they will use their best efforts to resolve
any such dispute. If they are unable to agree, the dispute will
be finally determined by another independent accounting firm
chosen by the parties.

4

<PAGE>

(g) If the Acquisition Audit, as finally determined pursuant
to Section 7(f) above, shows that the amount of shareholders
equity (the "Actual Shareholders' Equity") was more than $250,000
greater or less than $201,780,000, then a post-closing adjustment
in the purchase price will be made by a cash payment by either
Fremont Compensation or Continental. In such event, Fremont
Compensation shall pay to Continental the amount by which the
Actual Shareholders' Equity exceeded $201,780,000 (the "Positive
Adjustment") or Continental shall pay to Fremont Compensation the
amount by which $201,780,000 exceeded the Actual Shareholders'
Equity. Provided, however, that if the Positive Adjustment is
more than $5,000,000, then Fremont Compensation will pay
$5,000,000 in cash and will return Portfolio Assets with a value
equal to the difference between the Positive Adjustment and
$5,000,000.

(h) In the Stock Purchase Agreement, Continental will make no
representation or warranty about, and provide no indemnity
concerning, the adequacy of the Company's Loss Reserves or the
collectibility of reinsurance recoverables (other than on
reinsurance provided by Continental or its affiliates) as those
matters will be addressed through the Preclosing E & Y Procedures
and the Acquisition Audit as described above.

8. Continental Pool. Prior to the Closing, the
------------------
Transferred Business will be fully unwound from the Continental
pool without adversely affecting the Company's ability to do
business in the Acquired States. Continental will indemnify the
Company fully with respect to any liabilities that do not relate
to the Transferred Business.

9. Tax Matters.
------------

(a) Continental will hold the Company harmless from any tax
liabilities with respect to periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date that are not appropriately reflected in the Closing
Balance Sheet.

(b) None of the Purchase Price will be allocated to the
covenant not to compete described in Section 11 below except to
the extent mutually agreed by the parties.

(c) At Fremont Compensation's option, Continental and Fremont
Compensation shall jointly make an election pursuant to IRC
section 338(h)(10) (and any analogous provision of state, local
or foreign law) to have the purchase

5

<PAGE>

of the Company's stock treated for tax purposes as a "deemed
asset acquisition."

(d) Continental and Fremont Compensation will consult in good
faith to determine whether an alternative structure for the
transaction (i.e., an exchange described in section 351 of the
IRC) will provide either party with a material tax benefit. In
the event the parties mutually agree upon any such alternative
structure, the proposed agreement shall be converted to such
alternative structure, with only such modifications as are
necessary to give effect to the change in structure.

10. Conditions to Closing. Consummation of the Acquisition is
-----------------------
conditional upon the occurrence of the following:

(a) Negotiation and execution of the Stock Purchase
Agreement. The Stock Purchase Agreement will contain customary
representations and warranties to be brought down to Closing,
including representations with respect to the June 30 Balance
Sheet to be attached to the Stock Purchase Agreement. Subject to
Section 7(h) above, the representations and warranties made to
Fremont Compensation shall cover the accuracy of the Closing
Balance Sheet, and the Preclosing E & Y Procedures shall not
indicate that such representations and warranties are materially
incorrect. Any modifications in the assets and liabilities of the
Company required by Section 7(c) above shall have been completed.

(b) Review and approval of definitive documentation by the
Boards of Directors of Continental, Buckeye, the Company, Fremont
Compensation and Fremont General.

(c) Any requisite approvals from the Commissioners of
Insurance of the States of Illinois and California and of such
other states as needed, as well as compliance, if required, with
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.

(d) No material adverse change in the operations, business,
financial condition, prospects or assets of the Company and WCIC,
taken as a whole. Provided, however, that the Stock Purchase
Agreement will exclude from the definition of a material adverse
change certain personnel losses in the California operations of
the Company due to the pendency of the Acquisition and any
downgrading in the claims

6

<PAGE>

paying rating of the Company provided by Moody's Investors
Services, Inc. or Standard & Poor's Corporation or in the rating
of the Company provided by A.M. Best Company, if such ratings
change has resulted from the pendency of the Acquisition and not
from changes in the ratings of Continental.

(e) Prior to the Closing Continental will supply audited
balance sheets as of December 31 in each of the years 1992 and
1993 and audited profit and loss statements for each of the years
ended on December 31, 1991, 1992 and 1993 in a form sufficient to
meet Fremont General's reporting requirements under Regulation S-
X.

11. Covenant Not to Compete. The Stock Purchase Agreement
-------------------------
will contain a non-competition covenant prohibiting Continental
and its affiliates from competing with the Company for a period
of three years in the Acquired States. Exceptions to the covenant
will be made for certain passive investments, acquisitions of
companies that have only a de minimus worker's compensation
insurance business, national accounts, package accounts and a
limited amount of unso-licited business in the Acquired States.
This covenant will also prohibit soliciting any employees of the
Company to leave the Company's employ, hiring any of certain key
employees of the Company to be specified in the Stock Purchase
Agreement (the "Specified Employees") or hiring in the aggregate
more than 10% of the employees of the Company who are not
Specified Employees.

12. No Shop. For 30 days from the date hereof, Continental,
---------
the Company and their directors, officers, employees, agents and
affiliates will not, without Fremont Compensation's written
consent, provide any information to or encourage, solicit or
negotiate with, any corporation, individual or other entity with
respect to any acquisition, merger, sale of stock or other
substantial assets or other such proposal concerning the Company
("Acquisition Proposal"); provided however, that at Fremont
Compensation's option, the foregoing 30 day period may be
extended to 48 days from the date hereof. The parties understand
that Continental, the Company and their affiliates are agreeing
to the terms of this Section 12 to induce Fremont Compensation
and Fremont General to enter into this Agreement in Principle,
and to enter into a Stock Purchase Agreement within the time
period described above.

7

<PAGE>

13. Costs. Each of the parties shall bear its own costs in
-------
connection with the Acquisition. All fees owned to Goldman, Sachs
& Co. in connection with the Acquisition will be paid by
Continental. All fees owed to Chase Manhattan Bank or Chase
Securities, Inc. in connection with the Acquisition will be paid
by Fremont Compensation.

14. Publicity. The parties agree that the execution and
-----------
delivery of this Agreement in Principle will be publicly
disclosed, but that the parties will release only a mutually
agreed upon text. Except as required by law, regulation or stock
exchange requirements, any other public announcement (including
the text thereof) of the proposed Acquisition may be made only
with the approval of both Continental and Fremont Compensation,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

15. Best Efforts. The parties will use their best efforts to
--------------
enter into the Stock Purchase Agreement and to consummate the
Acquisition.

16. Governing Law. This Agreement in Principle and the Stock
---------------
Purchase Agreement shall be governed by California law.

17. Conduct of Business. From the date hereof, the Company
---------------------
will not take action outside its ordinary course of business.

18. Termination. This Agreement in Principle shall be null
-------------
and void if not accepted and agreed to by the parties on or
before October 10, 1994, and shall terminate if the Stock
Purchase Agreement has not been executed within 45 days from the
date hereof.

acknowledges that it is satisfied with and consents to the
Reorganization. The parties hereto agree promptly after the date
hereof to execute and deliver, and to cause any relevant

parties hereto agree to, at the Time of Closing, execute and
deliver in escrow pursuant to an escrow agreement described below
(the "Escrow Agreement") the portion of the Purchase Price

the Reorganization does not occur by April 30, 1995 (such other
deliveries and documentation being the "Alternative Documents").

<PAGE>

provisions, and shall otherwise be satisfactory to the Purchaser
and Continental, each acting reasonably:

(i) the escrow agent shall hold all documents delivered as
provided in this section 1.10 until the earlier of
April 30, 1995 and the date on which it receives a
certificate of Continental and the Purchaser to the
effect that all regulatory approvals necessary to
permit the Reorganization to be completed have been
granted, each of the Purchaser and Continental agreeing
to provide such certificate upon the receipt of all
such regulatory approvals;

(ii) the escrow agent shall invest the Purchase Price in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the
Purchaser having no approval rights in respect thereof;

(iii) if the escrow agent receives the certificate
referred to in paragraph (i) above prior to the close
of business on April 30, 1995, the escrow agent shall
deliver the portion of the Purchase Price placed in
escrow ( and all income earned thereon during the
escrow period) to the order of the Corporation and
Dominion, shall deliver each of the Closing Documents
to the party who is to receive it and shall destroy
the Alternative Documents;

(iv) if the escrow agent does not receive the certificate
referred to in paragraph (i) above prior to the close
of business on April 30, 1995, the escrow agent shall
deliver the portion of the Purchase Price placed in
escrow (and all income earned thereon during the escrow
period) to the order of the Vendors, shall deliver each

<PAGE>

- 20 -

of the Alternative Documents to the party who is to
receive it and shall destroy the Closing Documents; and

(v) Continental and the Purchaser shall provide the escrow
agent with the customary indemnities, but as between
them Continental shall indemnify the Purchaser with
respect thereto, and Continental shall pay any fees and
expenses of the escrow agent.

The Purchaser covenants and agrees to cooperate and to use

it by Continental to be taken to achieve completion of the
Reorganization.

Schedules in which it is required to be included. The inclusion

the right to use all of the intellectual property listed in

Business, are in full force and effect and none of the
Vendors, Continental or Continental Canada has received
notice from any reinsurer that such party intends to
terminate or does not intend to renew such agreement.
Neither Continental Canada nor, to the knowledge of the
Vendors and Continental, any other party thereto, is in
default as to any material provision of any reinsurance
treaty. All reinsurance placed or ceded by Continental
Canada: (i) was or, as applicable, is, fully placed; (ii)
covered or covers losses occurring during the term of the
reinsurance except in the case of reinsurance placed to
protect claims made against insurance or reinsurance
policies; and (iii) was or is placed on terms and conditions
which are concurrent with the terms and conditions of the
underlying insurance or reinsurance policies which are the
subject matter of such reinsurance. No reinsurance placed
or ceded by Continental Canada has been cancelled or
terminated without provision having been made to provide
reinsurance protection for the run-off of in-force insurance
or reinsurance policies which were the subject matter of
such reinsurance.

its Subsidiaries are accurate in all material respects.

Each of the parties represents and warrants to the other
that such party has not taken, and agrees that it will not take,
any action that would cause the other party to become liable to
any claim or demand for a brokerage commission, finder's fee or
other similar payment. Any fees payable to Barclays Bank plc

5.4 Negative Covenant
-----------------
Except as expressly provided in this Agreement (including
without limitation, the Reorganization) or except with the prior
written consent of the Purchaser, from the date hereof to the
Time of Closing the Vendors and Continental shall exercise
reasonable efforts to ensure that neither the Corporation nor any
Subsidiary:

5.4.1 amends its certificate of incorporation, by-laws
or other organizational documents;

5.4.2 amalgamates, merges or consolidates with, or
acquires all or substantially all the shares or assets of,

5.5 Corporate Action and Resignations
---------------------------------

<PAGE>

- 42 -

At or prior to the Time of Closing, the Vendors and
Continental shall cause all necessary corporate action on their
part to be taken for the purpose of approving the transfer of the
Purchased Shares to the Purchaser. At or prior to such time, the
Vendors and Continental shall use reasonable efforts to obtain
the resignations of those directors, and those officers who are
not full-time employees, of the Corporation and the Subsidiaries
designated in writing by the Purchaser not less than 24 hours
prior to the Time of Closing. Continental shall indemnify the
Purchaser against any claims by such resigning individuals in
their capacity as directors and officers against the Corporation
or any of the Subsidiaries (other than in respect of
indemnification). If requested by the Purchaser, the Vendors and
Continental shall cause nominees of the Purchaser to be elected
or appointed directors of the Corporation and the Subsidiaries to
fill any vacancies effective as of the Time of Closing.

5.6 Obtaining of Consents and Approvals
-----------------------------------

The Vendors, Continental and the Purchaser shall use their
reasonable efforts to deliver, at or prior to the Time of
Closing, the consents and approvals referred to in section 4.1.5,
although they shall not be required to pay any monies or give any
other consideration in order to obtain any consent or approval,
other than payments in respect of required regulatory filing
fees, reasonable legal fees incurred by third parties in
connection with a request for a consent or approval and the
expenses of that party (including the reasonable fees and
disbursements of their counsel) in obtaining such consents and
approvals and such monies or other consideration as may be
necessary in connection with the receipt of any required consents
of reinsurers. If the Purchaser completes the transaction
contemplated hereby on the Closing Date notwithstanding that any
of the consents or approvals referred to in section 4.1.5 have
not been obtained, the Vendors, Continental and the Purchaser
shall continue after the Closing to use reasonable efforts as

<PAGE>

- 43 -

requested by the Purchaser from time to time in order to attempt
to obtain any such consent or approval.

5.7 Restructuring
-------------

Each of the Vendors, Continental and the Purchaser agree
that, in addition to the matter contemplated in section 1.10,
they will consent to any reasonable proposal to restructure the
transaction or any part thereof contemplated by this Agreement in
a way advantageous to the party making such proposal if such
proposal has no negative economic or commercial impact on the
party whose consent is sought.

5.8 Reinsurance Arrangements
------------------------
Except as otherwise expressly provided for in this
Agreement, all reinsurance arrangements between Continental
Canada and the Vendors, Continental and their affiliates shall
remain in place unamended until December 31, 1994. At the
Purchaser's option, Continental shall request the relevant
reinsurers to give reasonable consideration to continuing each
such arrangement for up to three additional one-year periods.
Nothing in this Agreement shall relieve any reinsurer under any
such reinsurance arrangements of any obligation incurred or
provided for under those arrangements.

At the Purchaser's election, which must be exercised by
notice given to Continental on or prior to December 15, 1994,
CRCIL shall, and Continental shall cause CRCIL to, enter into the
retrocession agreement provided for below (the "Retrocession
Agreement") and the Purchaser shall cause its affiliate to enter
into such agreement, which shall be signed either at the Time of
Closing or by March 31, 1995, as appropriate. If the
Retrocession Agreement is to take effect at the Time of Closing,
CRCIL shall, and Continental shall cause CRCIL to, and the
Purchaser shall cause its affiliate to, by the Time of Closing or
as soon thereafter as is reasonably practicable, take the steps

<PAGE>

- 44 -

necessary so that there shall have occurred all actions which
that agreement provides or contemplates will occur in conjunction
with that agreement taking effect. The Retrocession Agreement
shall include or be subject to the following terms: 

(i) CRCIL will retrocede to an insurance company subsidiary
of the Purchaser (the "retrocessionnaire") all of the
liabilities of CRCIL under the Quota Share Treaty
related to the business of Continental Canada as of the
date provided for below, against payment by CRCIL of
good quality, marketable securities within the Bermuda
Trust (which securities shall remain within the Bermuda
Trust after such payment) equal in value (at fair
market value determined by the Purchaser and
Continental, acting reasonably) to the sum of 162/180
of the amount of liabilities for outstanding losses
assumed and 100% of the liabilities for unearned
premiums (net of deferred acquisition costs) assumed,
as determined in paragraph (iii) below;

(ii) the retrocessionnaire will receive 50% of the
investment income on the assets transferred pursuant to
paragraph (i) above from June 30, 1994 until the
earlier of Closing and December 31, 1994, and all of
such investment income thereafter. Except as provided
in the preceding sentence, CRCIL will receive all of
the investment income on its assets within the Bermuda
Trust;

(iii) the liabilities assumed shall initially be estimated
and, when audited 1994 financial statements are
available, those estimates shall be finalized and
necessary adjustments made, all pursuant to procedures
comparable to the scheme in Schedule 2.3;

(iv) the Purchaser may at its option specify either (a) that
the Retrocession Agreement will take effect at the
earlier of the Time of Closing and December 31, 1994,
in which event any further liabilities of CRCIL of the
type assumed which accrue after Closing until December
31, 1994 shall also be assumed as of December 31, 1994;
or (b) that the Retrocession Agreement will take effect
as of January 1, 1995, with the Purchaser having until
March 31, 1995 to arrange for this to occur;

(v) the Bermuda Trust will be amended as necessary to
ensure that the assets within the Bermuda Trust are
vested in trust for the benefit of the reinsured under

<PAGE>

- 45 -

the Quota Share Treaty and to permit payments of claims
under the Quota Share Treaty to be made out of the
assets of the retrocessionnaire within the Bermuda
Trust; 

(vi) CRCIL will, in a manner satisfactory to Continental and
the Purchaser, acting reasonably, be relieved of direct
liability for the liabilities ceded under the
Retrocession Agreement, and the Purchaser shall ensure
the return to CRCIL of its assets within the Bermuda
Trust, not later than December 31, 1997. Until that
time, the assets of CRCIL within the Bermuda Trust will
remain within that trust and will be managed by CRCIL
and such assets as are transferred to the Purchaser
under the Retrocession Agreement will be managed by the
Purchaser or an affiliate, in both cases within OSFI
requirements or guidelines; and

(vii) in the event there is a requirement under
Applicable Laws that assets be contributed to the
Bermuda Trust,

(A) the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the
retrocessionnaire, to deposit within that trust
assets (which shall remain the contributor's
assets) with a fair market value (determined by
the Purchaser and Continental, acting reasonably)
such that the value of the Purchaser's and the
retrocessionnaire's assets within the Bermuda
Trust, when added to the amount of claims paid out
of such assets in respect of the liabilities
retroceded under the Retrocession Agreement, is at
least equal to the sum of the value of the assets
transferred to the retrocessionnaire in accordance
with paragraph (i) above at the time of such
transfer plus any increase in assets required
under Applicable Laws at any time after December
31, 1994 either as a result of adverse reserves
developments in respect of the retroceded
liabilities or any change in Applicable Laws; and

(B) Continental shall, or shall cause CRCIL, to
deposit within the Bermuda Trust assets (which
shall remain the contributor's assets) which are
sufficient, after any contribution of assets
referred to in the preceding clause (vii)(A), to
satisfy the requirements of Applicable Laws. 

<PAGE>

- 46 -

5.9 Cooperation
-----------
The parties shall cooperate fully in good faith with each
other and their respective legal advisers, accountants and other
representatives in connection with any steps required to be taken
as part of their respective obligations under this Agreement.

5.10 Retention of Tax Records and Returns
------------------------------------
The Vendors, Continental, the Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall retain (or cause to be retained) all returns,
schedules and work papers, records and other documents in their
possession relating to Tax matters of the Corporation and the
Subsidiaries for each taxable period ending after the Closing
Date and for all prior taxable periods, until the later of (i)
the expiration of the statute of limitations of the taxable
periods to which such returns and other documents relate, without
regard to extensions except to the extent notified by the
Purchaser in writing of such extensions for the respective
taxable periods, or (ii) six years following the due date
(without extension) for such returns; provided, however, that
-------- -------
returns, schedules, work papers, records and other documents
relating to the determination of the basis of any asset shall be
retained for six years following the disposition of such asset;
and provided further that none of Continental, the Vendors and
-------- -------
any subsidiary thereof shall dispose of any such documents
without first notifying the Corporation and providing the
Corporation a reasonable period of time in which to assume
possession of such documents. Any information obtained under
this section 5.10 shall be kept confidential except as may be
otherwise necessary in connection with the filing of returns or
claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other proceeding.

5.11 Continuance of Business Relationships
-------------------------------------

Each of the Purchaser, Continental and the Vendors covenant
and agree, and covenant and agree to cause their respective
affiliates, to continue the existing business relationships and

<PAGE>

- 47 -

arrangements referred to below in this section 5.11. In the
event that prior to Closing the Purchaser determines that it
wishes to continue an existing business relationship or
arrangement between Continental Canada and Continental and its
affiliates which is not referred to below, the Purchaser shall
provide Continental and the Vendors with a notice which includes
a description of the business relationship or arrangement to be
continued and, if Continental is, in its sole discretion,
interested in continuing such relationship or arrangement, the
parties shall negotiate reasonably regarding the continuation of
that business relationship consistent with the provisions below.

The North American Business Team arrangements described in
Schedule 5.11 will continue indefinitely, subject to mutual
agreement otherwise, and the arrangements under which loss
control or claims services, or administration services for MOAC
(as described in Schedule 5.11), are provided, and specialty
lines are insured in Canada and the United States respectively
and services and information with respect to those lines is
provided, will continue on mutually agreeable terms, negotiated
reasonably, so long as desired by the Person to whom the services
are provided.

5.12 Access to Insurance Products
----------------------------

For a period of five years after Closing, the Vendors and
Continental shall, and shall cause their affiliates to, provide
to Continental Canada, at Continental Canada's request,
information concerning new insurance products or revised existing
insurance products, other than insurance products relating to the
lines of business currently managed by MOAC or AAU described in
Schedule A to the Non-Competition Agreement and specialty lines
which are currently mutually written by Continental Canada and
affiliates of Continental but which cease to be mutually written
by such parties subsequent to Closing, including reasonable
access to copies of such products, all relevant documentation and

<PAGE>

- 48 -

knowledgeable personnel, so that Continental Canada will be in a
position to sell such insurance products. Continental Canada
will have the indefinite right to sell insurance products
developed based on the information and access provided by this
section 5.12 in Canada and any other jurisdiction where
Continental and its affiliates do not sell and have not announced
their intention to sell such insurance products prior to
Continental Canada starting to sell such products in those
jurisdictions. Nothing in this section 5.12 permits the use of
such insurance products otherwise than by Continental Canada or
use by Continental Canada in the United States otherwise than
through the North American Business Team arrangements described
in Schedule 5.11.

5.13 Protection of Existing Relationships
------------------------------------
Continental covenants and agrees, and covenants and agrees
to cause its affiliates, to refrain from taking any action which
may reasonably be expected to adversely affect a contractual or
business relationship existing between Continental Canada and any
other Person at the date hereof, including Continental Canada's
role as chief agent for Tokio Marine and Fire.

5.14 Software Licences
-----------------
Continental shall permit Continental Canada to continue to
use all computer software currently used by Continental Canada in
which Continental or its affiliates have any rights (including,
without limitation, software related to catastrophe management or
to underwriting or loss control services) and Continental shall
use reasonable efforts to provide, and use reasonable efforts to
cause its affiliates to provide, Continental Canada with any
license agreements which are required or beneficial to continue
to use such software, in all cases to the extent that Continental
or its affiliates have the right to permit such use. Such
license agreements shall be for an indefinite period and at no
cost to Continental Canada.

<PAGE>

- 49 -

If MOAC, CIC or Niagara wishes to use any computer software
for their business in Canada which is currently used by
Continental Canada, Continental Canada shall allow MOAC, CIC or
Niagara to use such software at no cost for an indefinite period
to the extent that Continental Canada has the right to permit
such use, and shall use reasonable efforts to provide MOAC, CIC
and Niagara with any licence agreements which are required or
beneficial in this regard.

5.15 Withholding Tax
---------------

If the Vendors fail to deliver to the Purchaser, at least 2
Business Days before the tax hereinafter referred to is required
to be remitted, a certificate issued pursuant to section 116 of
the Income Tax Act (Canada) in respect of the sale of the
Purchased Shares containing a certificate limit at least equal to
$155 million, the amount of the certified cheque or bank draft or
wire transfer of the Purchaser referred to in section 2.2.2.1 may
be reduced by the amount of tax for which the Purchaser may be
liable (as determined solely by the Purchaser's Counsel) under
section 116 of such Act. The Purchaser shall not remit such tax
to Revenue Canada until two Business Days prior to the last date
on which it is required to be remitted.

5.16 Use of Continental Name and Registered Trade Marks
--------------------------------------------------
Continental and the Vendors consent to the use by
Continental Canada of the names Continental Insurance Limited,
The Continental Insurance Company of Canada and Continental
Insurance Management Ltd. for a period of two years from Closing
and agree during that period, and for any longer period
contemplated below during which the Continental name may be used,
to provide Continental Canada with any consent or other document
which is required or beneficial for the use of such name in
Canada or any other jurisdiction in which Continental does not
carry on business in accordance with Applicable Laws. The
Purchaser agrees to change the name of the Corporation and its

<PAGE>

- 50 -

Subsidiaries so that their names do not include the name
"Continental" prior to the end of such two year period, unless
the name "Continental" is used by Continental Canada in
conjunction with another name or term so that the combined name
is not confusing with the name "Continental" and unless
Continental consents in its sole discretion to the use of the
combined name.

Continental shall, and shall cause its affiliates, to grant
or continue to grant to Continental Canada a licence, registered
user or comparable agreement to use in Canada the registered
trade marks listed on Schedule 3.1.13 which are marked for
identification with an "A" or a "B" and all other registered user
agreements shall be deemed to be terminated at Closing. The
period of the agreement for those marked with an "A" shall be the
period for which Continental Canada is allowed to use the
"Continental" name and for those marked with a "B" shall be
indefinite.

5.17 Financial Statements
--------------------

At the request of the Purchaser, Continental shall arrange
for the appropriate auditors to provide any financial statements
or pro forma financial statements relating to Continental Canada
that are required in connection with securities offerings by the
Purchaser to finance the purchase of Continental Canada
hereunder.

5.18 Chief Agent
-----------

Continental shall continue to appoint the chief executive
officer of the Corporation as chief agent in Canada for
Continental and any affiliate of Continental carrying on an
insurance business in Canada for a period of three years from the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the
appointment shall be reviewable by Continental at the end of each
one year period and may be cancelled by Continental at each such

<PAGE>

- 51 -

time in its sole discretion or at any time for material non-
performance. The Purchaser shall indemnify and save Continental
harmless for any loss, damage, liability, expense or deficiency
suffered by Continental or an affiliate as a result of any
material non-performance of the chief agent as so appointed.

5.19 NABT Reporting
--------------
Robert Rich, or another person acceptable to the Purchaser,
shall be the individual designated by Continental as the contact
person for Continental Canada in relation to the activities of
the North American Business Team.

5.20 Fairfax Note
------------
At the request of Continental, the Purchaser will use all
reasonable efforts to cause the Fairfax Note to be freely
tradeable in the United States at any time after the Purchaser
has received its audited financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 1994.

5.21 Pension Plan Assets
-------------------

The assets including any surplus and related liabilities of
the current Continental Canada employee pension plan applicable
to MOAC and CAFO, Inc. employees shall be removed from such
pension plan in accordance with MOAC's instructions and at MOAC's
expense, as soon as all required regulatory consents and
approvals have been received. Towers Perrin or such other
actuary as is agreed to by the parties hereto shall make all
necessary actuarial determinations in this connection.

5.22 Reinsurance with Affiliates
---------------------------

Continental covenants and agrees that, except for currently
established fixed periodic premiums payable in 1994 which are
currently unpaid, Continental Canada shall not be liable, in
respect of 1994 or any prior period, for any additional or
adjusting premiums or payments (including without limitation any

<PAGE>

- 52 -

payback, swing rate, reinstatement or reinsurance surcharge
premium or any payment of a deductible) upon any existing
reinsurance or retrocession contract or arrangement made with any
affiliate of Continental as reinsurer or retrocessionnaire. The
Purchaser shall cause the Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
consent to the release to the settlor of any surplus assets held
in any trust relating to any existing reinsurance contracts
provided that OSFI has consented to such release of surplus
assets.

5.23 Currency Protection on U.S. Claims
----------------------------------
Continental covenants and agrees, with respect to all United
States losses of Continental Canada occurring prior to and
including December 31, 1994 (other than those relating to the
Thomson Corporation business), (the claims giving rise to such
losses being those listed in a schedule which has been prepared
by the Corporation and its Subsidiaries and provided to
Continental) to continue the existing practice whereby affiliates
of Continental (other than the Corporation and its Subsidiaries)
reimburse and indemnify the Corporation and its Subsidiaries for
the excess of any amounts paid by them in United States dollars
on or in connection with such claims over the amount which would
have been paid had the amount paid been the same numerical dollar
amount but denominated in Canadian dollars, such reimbursement
and indemnity obligation being limited to the respective loss
reserve for each claim as shown on the above-mentioned schedule.

5.24 Settling U.S. and Canadian Claims
---------------------------------

5.24.1 Continental covenants and agrees, subsequent to
the Time of Closing, to cause any affiliate which has the
authority or responsibility to settle in the United States
any claim on behalf of Continental Canada to keep
Continental Canada informed on developments and not to
settle such claim unless Continental Canada has approved
such settlement prior to the time it is made. In acting on

<PAGE>

- 53 -

behalf of Continental Canada in connection with claims
settlement activities, any such affiliate shall conduct
itself in a manner consistent with responsible industry
practice, including with a view to preserving Continental
Canada's client relationships. Nothing in this section 5.24
restricts Continental Canada's right to terminate the above-
mentioned authority or responsibility at any time.

5.24.2 The Purchaser covenants and agrees, subsequent to
the Time of Closing, to cause the Corporation or any
affiliate which has the authority or responsibility to
settle in Canada any claim on behalf of Continental or an
affiliate to keep Continental informed on developments and
not to settle such claim unless Continental has approved
such settlement prior to the time it is made. In acting on
behalf of Continental in connection with claims settlement
activities, the Corporation or any of its affiliates shall
conduct itself in a manner consistent with responsible
industry practice, including with a view to preserving
Continental's client relationships. Nothing in this section

5.24 restricts Continental's right to terminate the above-
mentioned authority or responsibility at any time.

5.25 Termination of Non-Arm's Length Arrangements. Except as
----------------------------------------------
expressly provided by this Agreement (including, without
limitation, in sections 5.11, 5.12, 5.13 and 5.14 hereof), all
arrangements between the Corporation or the Subsidiaries on the
one part, and Continental, any affiliate (excluding the
Corporation and the Subsidiaries), and any officer, director,
employee or shareholder of Continental or any such affiliate, on
the other part, and any arm's length investment management
agreement or arrangement to which Continental Canada is a party,
will be terminated as of the Time of Closing unless stipulated
otherwise by the Purchaser, without any continuing liability to
the Corporation or a Subsidiary and all accrued liabilities under

<PAGE>

- 54 -

such arrangements shall be satisfied without cost to the
Corporation and its Subsidiaries in full on a net basis at the
Time of Closing with respect to such of those amounts as are
determinable at such time and, with respect to such of those
amounts as are not determinable at that time, as soon thereafter
as such amounts are determinable.

5.26 Co-Operation in United States Tax Matters
-----------------------------------------

The Purchaser agrees that it shall co-operate with the
Vendors and Continental, and cause the Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to co-operate with the Vendors and Continental, by
sharing all financial and accounting information reasonably
requested by the Vendors and Continental in connection with the
preparation or audit of Continental's United States federal
income tax return or Canadian tax returns of the Corporation and
its Subsidiaries for any taxation year during any part of which
the Corporation and its Subsidiaries was owned, directly or
indirectly, by Continental. Such assistance shall include, but
not be limited to, providing information necessary to (i)
determine the subpart F income of the Corporation and its
Subsidiaries or (ii) substantiate foreign tax credits claimed
with respect to taxes paid or accrued by the Corporation and its
Subsidiaries.

ARTICLE 6

INDEMNIFICATION AND
-------------------

PAYMENT OF ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT
----------------------------

6.1 Indemnification and Adjustment Amount
-------------------------------------

6.1.1 The Vendors and Continental shall jointly and
severally indemnify the Purchaser and save the Purchaser
harmless for and from any loss, damage, liability, expense
or deficiency suffered by the Purchaser as a result of any
breach of representation, warranty or covenant on the part

<PAGE>

- 55 -

of the Vendors or Continental or any of their affiliates
contained in this Agreement or in any agreement, certificate
or document delivered pursuant to or contemplated by this
Agreement, and all claims, demands, costs and expenses,
including reasonable legal fees, in respect of the
foregoing. The amount of such indemnity shall be on an
after-tax basis and shall be deemed to be an adjustment to
the Purchase Price.

6.1.2 The Vendors and Continental shall pay the
Adjustment Amount to the Purchaser in accordance with
sections 6.5 and 6.6.

6.1.3 Amounts payable under sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2
shall be paid without duplication.

6.2 Notice of Claim for Indemnification
-----------------------------------
The Purchaser shall promptly give notice to the Vendors and
Continental of any claim for indemnification pursuant to section
6.1 (a "Claim", which term shall include more than one Claim).
Such notice shall specify whether the Claim arises as a result of
a claim by a Person (a "Third Party") against the Purchaser (a
"Third Party Claim") or whether the Claim does not so arise (a
"Purchaser's Claim"), and shall also specify with reasonable
particularity (to the extent that the information is available):

6.2.1 the factual basis for the Claim; and

6.2.2 the amount of the Claim or, if an amount is not
then determinable, an approximate and reasonable estimate of
the likely amount of the Claim.

If the Vendors and Continental do not receive such prompt notice,
the Vendors and Continental shall not be obligated to indemnify

<PAGE>

- 56 -

the Purchaser for any damages or costs that could have been
avoided but for such lack of timely notice.

6.3 Procedure for Indemnification
-----------------------------

6.3.1 Purchaser's Claims. Following receipt of notice
------------------
from the Purchaser of a Claim, the Vendors and Continental
shall have 30 days to make such investigation of the Claim
as the Vendors or Continental consider necessary or
desirable. For the purpose of such investigation, the
Purchaser shall make available to the Vendors and
Continental and their authorized representatives the
information relied upon by the Purchaser to substantiate the
Claim and all other available relevant information. If the
Purchaser and the Vendors or Continental agree at or prior
to the expiration of such 30 day period (or any mutually
agreed upon extension thereof) to the validity and amount of
such Claim, the Vendors or Continental, as the case may be,
shall immediately pay to the Purchaser the full agreed upon
amount of the Claim.

If the Purchaser and the Vendors or Continental do not
agree within such period (or any mutually agreed upon
extension thereof), the Purchaser, the Vendors and
Continental agree that any of them may take the dispute to a
court of competent jurisdiction.

6.3.2 Third Party Claims. With respect to any Third
-------------------
Party Claim against the Purchaser, the Vendors or
Continental shall have the right, at their own expense, to
participate in or assume control of the negotiation,
settlement or defence of such Third Party Claim and, in such
event, the Vendors or Continental shall reimburse the
Purchaser for all the Purchaser's out-of-pocket expenses as
a result of such participation or assumption. If the

<PAGE>

- 57 -

Vendors or Continental elect to assume such control, the
Purchaser shall cooperate with the Vendors or Continental,
and shall have the right to participate in the negotiation,
settlement or defence of such Third Party Claim at its own
expense. If the Vendors or Continental, having elected to
assume such control, thereafter fail to defend any such
Third Party Claim within a reasonable time, the Purchaser
shall be entitled to assume such control and the Vendors and

Continental shall be bound by the results obtained by the
Purchaser with respect to such Third Party Claim.

6.4 Additional Rules and Procedures for Indemnification
---------------------------------------------------

The obligation of the Vendors or Continental to indemnify
the Purchaser in respect of Claims shall also be subject to the
following:

6.4.1 The obligation of Continental and the Vendors to
indemnify the Purchaser and the Corporation shall not apply
until the aggregate amount of Claims is at least $1,000,000
and shall not apply to the first $1,000,000 in aggregate
amount of Claims. However, this section 6.4.1 shall not
apply to Claims pursuant to breaches of the indemnity
obligations in sections 1.10 and 5.5 and breaches of the
covenants contained in sections 5.22 and 5.23, with the
result that any proper Claims under those sections shall be
paid in full, and there shall be no minimum amount of
aggregate Claims under those sections.

6.4.2 The obligation of Continental and the Vendors to
indemnify the Purchaser and the Corporation in respect of
Claims shall be limited to the aggregate amount of
$50,000,000. 

6.4.3 Whether or not the Vendors or Continental assume
control of the negotiation, settlement or defence of any

<PAGE>

- 58 -

Third Party Claim against the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall
not negotiate, settle, compromise or pay any such Third
Party Claim except with the prior written consent of the
Vendors and Continental (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld).

6.4.4 The Purchaser shall not permit any right of appeal
in respect of any Third Party Claim against it to terminate
without giving the Vendors and Continental notice thereof
and an opportunity to contest such Third Party Claim.

6.4.5 The Purchaser, the Vendors and Continental shall
cooperate fully with each other with respect to Third Party
Claims, shall keep each other fully advised with respect
thereto (including supplying copies of all relevant
documentation promptly as it becomes available) and shall
each designate a senior officer who will keep himself
informed about and be prepared to discuss the Third Party
Claim with his counterpart and with counsel at all
reasonable times. 

6.4.6 Notwithstanding section 6.3.2, the Vendors and
Continental shall not settle any Third Party Claim or
conduct any related legal or administrative proceeding in a
manner which would, in the opinion of the Purchaser, acting
reasonably, have an adverse impact on the Purchaser.

6.5 Calculation of Adjustment Amount and Combined Ratio Achieved

SCHEDULE 2.3

(a) Assumption of the Assumed Liabilities
-------------------------------------

(i) In accordance with section 2.3 of the Agreement:

(A) Continental shall cause Niagara and CIC to sell,
assign and transfer to the Corporation and its
Subsidiaries Canadian Branch Assets with a value
equal to the value of the Assumed Liabilities; and

(B) the Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall assume
from Niagara and CIC, respectively, the Assumed
Liabilities.

(ii) For the purposes of determining the value of the
Niagara Investments and the value of the CIC Investments
which Niagara and CIC shall sell, assign and transfer to the
Corporation and its Subsidiaries as part of the Canadian
Branch Assets, Continental shall in good faith prepare
estimates of the value of the Assumed Liabilities and of the
Canadian Branch Assets other than CIC Investments and
Niagara Investments as of the time of closing and deliver a
written statement of such estimates to the Purchaser not
less than three Business Days prior to the closing date.
The amount obtained when the second such estimated value is
subtracted from the first shall be the value of CIC
Investments and Niagara Investments transferred to the
Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of closing.

(iii) The value of the Assumed Liabilities and the value
of the Canadian Branch Assets other than the CIC Investments
and the Niagara Investments as of the closing date shall be
calculated by the Purchaser based upon the appropriate
audited financial statements for calendar 1994 within ten
Business Days after such audited financial statements are

<PAGE>

- 2 -

first available and written notice thereof shall be provided
to Continental. If Continental does not agree with such
values, Continental shall within ten Business Days of being
advised of the Purchaser's calculation advise the Purchaser
of such values as calculated by Continental in consultation
with its professional advisors (failing which Continental
will be deemed to have agreed with the Purchaser's
calculation), and if the Purchaser and Continental cannot
agree on such values within ten Business Days thereafter,
then such values shall be forthwith determined by a mutually
agreed upon third party whose determination, including with
respect to costs, shall be final and binding on the parties
hereto. Unless otherwise agreed, such dispute shall be
submitted to arbitration pursuant to the Arbitration Act,
1991 (Ontario).

Corporation and its Subsidiaries, or the Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall pay to Niagara or CIC, as applicable,
whichever is appropriate, the Canadian Branch Adjustment
Amount, in either case by transferring cash or marketable
securities as shall be mutually agreed by Continental and
the Purchaser acting reasonably, valued in accordance with
section (c).

<PAGE>

- 3 -

(v) The determinations and adjustments referred to in this
section (a) shall not limit or affect any other rights or

agreement.

and the Subsidiaries the Excluded Liabilities.

(ii) For the purposes of determining the value of the

good faith prepare estimates of the value of the Excluded
Liabilities and of the Excluded Assets other than the
Excluded Investments as of September 30, 1994 and deliver a
written statement of such estimates to the Purchaser as soon
as practical. The amount obtained when the second such
estimated value is subtracted from the first shall be the
value of the Excluded Investments transferred to CIC or
Niagara as of closing.

(iii) The value of the Excluded Liabilities and the
value of the Excluded Assets other than the Excluded

<PAGE>

- 4 -

Investments as of the closing date shall be calculated by
the Purchaser based upon the appropriate audited financial
statements for calendar 1994 within ten Business Days after
such audited financial statements are first available and
written notice thereof shall be provided to Continental. If
Continental does not agree with such values, Continental
will within ten Business Days of being advised of the
Purchaser's calculation advise the Purchaser of such values
as calculated by Continental in consultation with its
professional advisors (failing which Continental will be
deemed to have agreed with the Purchaser's calculation), and
if the Purchaser and Continental cannot agree on such values
within ten Business Days thereafter, then such values shall
be forthwith determined by a mutually agreed upon third
party whose determination, including with respect to costs,
shall be final and binding on the parties hereto. Unless
otherwise agreed, such dispute shall be submitted to
arbitration pursuant to the Arbitration Act, 1991 (Ontario).

(iv) For the purposes of this section (iv), "Excluded
Adjustment Amount" means the difference between the value of
Excluded Investments transferred as of closing pursuant to
section (ii), and the value of such investments which should
have been so transferred based on the determinations made
pursuant to section (iii), plus an amount equal to deemed
