Item 5. Other Events

In 1986, the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC)
began investigating a 1985 steam-pipe rupture at the Mohave
Generating Station. Southern California Edison Company
(Edison) is plant operator and 56% owner. In 1991, the CPUC's
Division of Ratepayer Advocates alleged that Edison
contributed to the piping failure by imprudently operating and
maintaining the plant and recommended disallowance of all
accident-related expenditures.

On December 31, 1993, an administrative law judge at the
CPUC submitted a proposed decision faulting Edison for the
steam-pipe rupture and recommending that costs stemming from
the accident should be disallowed. Edison maintains that its
operational and maintenance activities at the station were
reasonable and consistent with industry practices at the time
of the June 1985 accident.

Edison will file comments describing factual, legal, and
technical errors in the proposed decision on January 20 with
the CPUC. After review of the complete record, the CPUC may
accept, reject, or modify the proposed decision. If the CPUC
accepts the proposed decision, a second phase of this
proceeding will quantify the costs stemming from the accident.

This matter was previously reported in Part I, Item 1 of
Edison's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended 1992,
and in Note 2 of Edison's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for
the quarters ended March 31, 1993, June 30, 1993, and
September 30, 1993.
